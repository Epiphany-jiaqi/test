这是你家
It's your house.

你的地盘
It's your world.

你是凯撒大帝
You're a real julius caesar.

但是我觉得学校这种东西
But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, jerry.

纯属浪费时间 一堆人乱跑乱撞
It's a waste of time. A bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.

下课铃一响 他们给你一盒牛奶
Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a

一张纸 上面写着
Piece of paper that says you can

你可以去上个大号
Go take a dump or something.

学校不适合聪明人待
I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.

我知道不是什么主流观点 但我就这么想的

你这是在暗示我家里穷吗
Are you trying to say my family's poor?

Frank  没必要动刀子吧
Oh, geez, frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary.

不用刀子也能搞定啊

Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

你觉得我一个人能行吗
What do you think? I can just do it all by myself?

把你爸送进养老院吧
Let's put your dad in a nursing home.

这哔哔叫我听得见
We can hear the beeps!

好了 来吧 Morty 我们走
There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.

好吧
Oh, geez. Okay.

天啊 Rick
Oh, man, Rick.

这是个啥地方
What is this place?

这是35c次元 这儿的气候非常适合一种特殊的树
It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of

叫做奇异树
Tree, morty, called a mega tree,

树上有果子 果子里有种子
And there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.

那就是奇异种
I'm talking about mega seeds.

这种种子非常强大 我的研究需要这些种子
They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.

Rick 我看了下四周
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place,

总觉得有点怕怕的呢
And I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.

好吧好吧
All right. All right.

冷静点 听我说 Morty
Calm down. Listen to me, morty.

我知道人在新环境里会感到不安
I know that new situations can be intimidating.

你看周围 又吓人又陌生
You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but,

迎头而上 像一头公牛一样冲过去
You know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull

这样人才能成长
that's how we grow as people.

我经常遇到可怕的事
I'm no stranger to scary situations.

我一直在和它们打交道
I deal with them all the time.

你跟着我
Now, if you just stick with me, Morty,

我们一定会 妈呀 快跑 Morty
we're gonna be... Holy crap, Morty, run!

我这辈子都没见过这玩意儿
I never seen that thing before in my life.

这到底是啥鬼东西啊
I don't even know what the hell it is!

快跑啊Morty
We got to get out of here, morty!

它会杀了我们的
It's gonna kill us!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die, morty!

Morty 深呼吸
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

呼吸点新鲜空气
Breathe that, breathe that fresh air in, morty.

闻到没
Y-you smell that?

充满了冒险气息啊 Morty
That's the smell of adventure, Morty.

一条完全不同的进化之路的味道
That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.

好了Rick
All right, Rick,

还要多久啊
Look how much longer is this gonna be?

我是不是该回学校了
Shouldn't I be back at school by now?

开什么玩笑
Are you joking me?

看看你周围这些鬼玩意儿
I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.

看那边那个
Look at that thing right there.

这是什么鬼
W-what the hell is that thing?

你觉得你在学校能看见
You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?

看它滚来滚去
Look at it just lumbering around.

无法用逻辑理解
It defies all logic that thing.

Rick 我明白
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

我们周围全是怪物
We're surrounded by monsters.

所以我才想走啊
That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.

看见了吗 Morty
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?

看见下面是什么了吗
You see what we just stumbled upon, morty?

知道是啥吗
Any idea what that is down there?

奇异树吗
The mega trees?

没错Morty
That's right, Morty

长着果子的奇异树
The mega trees with the mega fruit on them.

我要的就是这个呀 Morty 种子就在那儿
And that's what I'm talking about, morty. That's where my seeds are.

如果我们按你说的来 那就永远找不到了
If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have

因为你如此迷恋你的学校
Found them, because y because you're so in love with school.

好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

这些种子到底有什么特别的
So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?

Morty 别问这么多问题
You ask a lot of questions, Morty.

这样不好
Not very charismatic.

很碍事的
It makes you kind of an under underfoot figure.

穿上这鞋子 Morty
Just take these shoes, Morty.

这是特制的吸附鞋
They're sp special grappling shoes.

只要穿着这宝贝儿
When you're wearing these things ba these babies,

你想往哪儿走往哪儿走
You can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty

往上 往下 倒立 转到左边
Up, down, below, turn around to the left.

怎么都行
These things really bring it all together.

啊
Aah!

Morty 你得先启动它们
You have to turn them on, Morty!

先把鞋子的开关打开
The shoes have to be turned on!

我绝不会送我爸去养老院
I am not putting my father in a home!

他才刚回到我的生活中
He just came back into my life,

你就想这么把他塞床垫下面
And you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress

跟上月的维多利亚的秘密产品目录为伍吗
like last month's victoria's secret?

我说了我是在给你订情人节礼物嘛
I told you I was ordering you something for valentine's day.

而且你爸对我们的孩子有很不好的影响
More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.

你们没问题吧 Beth
Everything cool in here, Beth?

没事的 Davin
It's fine, Davin.

那就好
Okay, cool.

我们今天一起完成了一件伟大的事
You know, we did something great today.

没什么比马儿的心脏更高贵自由了
There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.

既然我们在吵架
Since we're fighting,

如果你跟那家伙有过什么
If you ever have an affair with that guy,

我就去酒店房间吞子弹
I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out

把脑浆全崩到你的裸体上
all over your naked bodies.

我理解你承受的压力
Look, I appreciate the stress you're under,

但是Morty早在我爸搬进来前
but morty was having trouble in school way

学习就有问题了
Before my dad moved in,

我唯一能看到Rick带来的影响就是 这么久以来
and the only influence I can see rick having is that, for the first time in his life,

Morty第一次有了朋友
Morty has a friend.

或许你是对的
Well, maybe you're right.

或许是吧
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

我是我爸的女儿
I'm my father's daughter.

我很聪明
I'm smart.

不然咋当上心外科医生的
Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?

马心外科医生
Horse heart surgeon.

你好
Hello?

Smith太太吗
Mrs. Smith?

我是阴道校长 别做联想
This is principal Vagina no relation.

请问你和Morty的父亲今天下午能
I wonder if you and morty's father might be able to have a

过来谈谈吗
Chat with me this afternoon?

Morty你把你的腿弄得真惨
Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.

你得把开关打开 这鞋子才能用啊
You know, you got to turn the shoes on, morty, for them to work.

看我的打开了
Yeah, look I turned mine on.

我下来的多顺当
I had no problem getting down here.

简直是轻松愉快
It was a leisurely breeze.

我快疼死了 Rick
I'm in a lot of pain, rick.

嗯 我看得出来
Yeah, I can see that.

不过你应该还能帮我把种子采来的吧
But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, morty?

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?!

够了 Rick
That's it, Rick!

我忍不了了
That's the last straw!

简直不敢相信
I can't believe this

我两条腿都断了
I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken,

你还要我去帮你弄种子
and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?!

嗷嗷嗷
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

你是个怪物
Y-y-you're a monster.

跟希特勒似的 至少希特勒心里还装着德国
Y-you're like hitler, but but even hitler cared about Germany or something.

好吧 等我一下 Morty
Okay, hold on just a second, morty.

哇哦Rick 这个一下就治好了我的腿
Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.

这辈子没觉得这么好过
I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.

谢谢
Thank you.

别管了 Morty
Don't worry about it, Morty.

快过来帮我弄种子
Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?

没问题 Rick
Sure thing, Rick.

虽然你没问
Not that you asked,

不过刚才我去了一个未来的次元
Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future

医学高度发达
Dimension with such advanced medicine

治断腿的血清到处的药店都有卖的
that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.

这种东西满街都是
The stuff was all over the place, morty.

听上去好厉害啊 Rick
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

就是有个小问题
There's just one problem, Morty, one little hang-up.

我去的次元太发达了
The dimension I visited was so advanced,

他们抑制了衰老
they had also halted the aging process,

那儿的每个人都很年轻 也从未老过
and everyone there was young, morty, and they had been forever.

我是那儿唯一的老人
I was the only old person there, morty.

在那儿 我就像一个名人般
It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.

他们觉得我可迷人了
I-I was fascinating to them.

那边有很多美女
There were a lot of attractive Women there, morty,

她们都想和我共度良宵
and they they they they all wanted time with me.

我和很多美女玩得非常开心
I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies,

但我在那边待太久了 次元传送装置它
but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device

没有能量了
it's got no charge left, Morty.

没有能量了
It's got no charge left.

啥
What?!

它现在就是一废物
It's as good as garbage, morty.

已经没用了
It's not gonna work anymore, morty.

Rick 这可不妙
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

那我们怎么办
W-what are we gonna do?

我现在得回学校了
I-I have to be back at school right now.

我们要怎么回家
How are we gonna get back home?

有很多办法可以回家
There's ways to get back home, Morty.

只是麻烦点而已
It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

我们得去过空间海关
We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs,

所以我还得要你帮个忙
so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.

啊哦
Uh-oh.

我们到海关的时候
When we get to customs,

你得把这些种子
I'm gonna need you to take these seeds

带去洗手间
into the bathroom,

深深的塞进你的屁股里
and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.

塞进屁股里
In my butt?

往里塞 越深越好
Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.

天啊 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick.

我真不想这样
I really don't want to have to do that.

总得有人要做的啊 Morty
Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.

不塞进直肠里 这些种子
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs

过不了海关的
unless they're in someone's rectum, morty.

如果我来的话会直接掉出来
And they'll fall right out of mine.

我塞过太多次了
I've done this too many times, morty.

你还年轻
I mean, you're young.

你还有大好人生 肛门也还紧致有弹性
You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable.

帮帮外公吧 Morty
You got to do it for Grandpa, morty.

把这种子塞屁股里吧
Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.

塞屁股里
In my butt?

求你了 Morty
Come on, morty. Please, morty.

你一定要帮我 Morty
You have to do it, Morty.

天啊
Oh, man.

事情是这样的 你们的儿子Morty
The fact is, your son, morty,

过去的两个月里一共只上了七个小时的学
Has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.

啥
What?

你之前为什么没有通知我们
Why didn't you notify us?

我早通知过你们
I done been notifying you.

你们没收到
Have you not been getting the messages

我留给Morty外公的消息吗
I've been leaving with morty's grandfather?

哈
Boom!

我就说吧
Told you! In your face!

我们的孩子快让他毁了
He is ruining our child!

等等 我这么高兴干嘛
Wait, what am I celebrating?

我就觉得有点可疑
Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there,

因为总是Morty的外公把他从学校接走
Because it's usually morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.

Summer
Summer?

上帝怎么会让这种事发生
What kind of god lets this happen?

这儿出了点小意外
We had a little incident.

有个学生被冻死了
A student was frozen to death.

没有任何证据表明是拉丁裔的学生干的
And there's no evidence that a latino student did it!

总有人想扯到民族问题上去
Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.

我不会让他们得逞的
I won't let them.

我跟他说"把blimfarx给我"
So, I told him, "Give me the blimfarx," You know?

这人根本不懂星际货币
This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency.

我想吃点胡言乱语
It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like,

因为咱Girvonesk星就吃这
that's what we eat on Girvonesk.

我不喜欢这儿 Morty
I don't like it here, Morty.

我忍不了这种官僚主义
I can't abide bureaucracy.

我不喜欢让人指手画脚
I don't like being told where to go and what to do.

我觉得这是对我的冒犯
I consider it a violation.

你把种子塞屁股里了吗
Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?

是的Rick
Yeah, rick.

咱能快点吗
Let's just get this over with, okay?

这些东西尖尖的
I mean, these things are pointy.

很疼的
They hurt.

这说明品质好
That means they're good ones.

你是个好孩子Morty
You're a good kid, Morty.

这些种子对我的研究非常重要
Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.

你帮了我一个大忙
You've been a huge help to me.

有了这些我什么都能干了
I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.

这真是太好了Morty
It's gonna be great, Morty.

什么样的科学都行
All kinds of science.

下一个
Okay, next through.

除了你 你去那边
Except you. You go over there.

为什么他就得去那边
Why does he have to go over there?

抽查
Random check.

他要过那边的新机器
He's got to go through the new machine.

什么新机器
What new what new machine?

就一新机器
It's a new machine.

能检查你的屁股深处
It detects stuff all the way up your butt.

跑啊 Morty 快跑
Run, Morty! Run!

啊
Aah!

拉警报
Red alert!

别管它
Don't think about it!

聪明啊 Morty
Oh, nice, Morty!

青出于蓝胜于蓝
The student becomes the teacher.

当然不了
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

我只是想 啊啊啊
You know me I'm just trying to... Aah!

我得输入我们自己世界的坐标
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, morty.

掩护我
Cover me.

天啊 我不想开枪打人
Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.

他们是机器人Morty 随便打 他们是机器人
They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!

我的腿被打断了
My leg is shot off!

Glenn要失血而死了
Glenn's bleeding to death!

谁通知下他老婆孩子
Someone call his wife and children!

他们不是机器人啊Rick
They're not robots, Rick!

这是修辞 Morty
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

他们都是官僚体系的走狗 没关系的
They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them.

接着打 Morty
Just keep shooting, Morty.

你不明白这里的监狱有多可怕
You have no idea what prison is like here!

天啊
Holy crap!

这太疯狂了
This is insane!

走 Morty
Come on, morty!

我们离开这儿
We got to get the hell out of here!

哇哦
Wow.

你刚刚是穿过传送门进了食堂吗
Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?

是啊
Uh, yeah.

因为我的法拉利还在店里嘛
Well, you know, my my ferrari's in the shop.

开玩笑的
Ju just kidding.

你是Morty 是吗
You're Morty, right?

是的
Yeah.

你可以晚点找他要电话
You can get his number later.

Morty 我们走
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here.

你得去把种子从屁股里弄出来
You got to get those seeds out of your ass.

看呐 亲爱的
Oh, look, Honey.

这不是咱儿子和阿尔伯特 爱因撕蛋吗
It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.

啥
What?

我是愤怒的父亲 又不是即兴演说家
I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.

噢嗨 Jerry
Oh, hi, Jerry.

天啦 Morty
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

你怎么没在上课
What are you doing out of class?

我不是和你说过了吗 你爸妈和我
We talked about this. Your your parents and I

对这种行为都感到很失望
are very disappointed in in this behavior.

没人信吗
No? No takers?

别碰这些东西
You guys should really not be touching that stuff.

这些超出你们的理解范围的
It's beyond your reasoning.

你才超出我们的理解
You're beyond our reasoning!

彼此彼此
Takes one to know one.

爸 你怎么能让我们的儿子缺了整整一学期的课呢
Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school?

他又不是漂亮妹子
I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl.

挥霍完青春再找一长期饭票
He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

你们搬我东西干嘛
What what are you guys doing with my stuff?

我们要把你送进养老院
We're moving you... to a nursing home.

养老院
A nursing home?

你疯了吧
What are what are you, nuts?

我是个天才
I'm a genius.

我造机器人玩的
I build robots for fun.

那你可以去做篮子
Well, now you can build baskets

用录影机看保罗纽曼的电影
and watch Paul Newman movies on vhs and

在圣诞节的时候给童子军留下心灵创伤
mentally scar the boy scouts every christmas.

这什么意思
What does that mean?

私事
It's personal.

爸妈 别这样
Dad, mom, c-come on.

Rick只是要我帮忙而已
Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty 别来搅和
Morty, stay out of this.

你自己显然没有足够的判断力
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.

你这是说Morty什么呢
What are you trying to say about morty?

说他笨吗
That he's stupid or something?

别抢占道德制高点了
Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

你明知道Morty根本缺不起课的
You know fully well that morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.

我不明白你想说什么
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.

能再具体点吗
Can can can you be a little bit more specific?

天啊
Oh, for crying out

他有点缺陷什么的
He's got some kind of disability or something.

你就想让我们说这个吗
Is that what you want us to say?

真的吗
I do?

不是吗 孩子
Well, duh doy, son.

我爱你 孩子
Look, I love you, morty, but we both

但我们都清楚 你没别的孩子机灵
know you're not as fast as the other kids, and

如果你想有所成就 就得加倍努力
if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.

天啊 老爸
Aw, geez, dad.

你突然和一个小孩子说这些 太沉重了吧
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.

Morty 告诉你爸妈圆周率的平方根
Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.

别这样 Rick
Oh, come on, Rick.

你知道我不行的
You know I can't.

圆周率的平方根
The square root of pi,

Morty 来吧
Morty go.

1.77245385
1.77245385.

哇哦
Whoa!

怎么搞的
What the hell?

天啊 他说的对
Holy crap. He's right.

Morty 热力学第一定律
Morty, tell your parents the first law of thermodynamics.

"一个系统内能的增加等于
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is

等于该系统吸收的热量"
Equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."

哇 我好聪明
Wow! I'm so smart!

可是
But

我早跟你们说了学校这玩意儿很蠢
I told the both of you school is stupid.

在那儿学不到东西的
It's not how you learn things.

Morty很有天分
Morty's a gifted child.

他很特别
He has a special mind.

所以他才是我的小助手
That's why he's my little helper.

他就像我
He's like me.

他日后会从事伟大的科学工作
He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.

他太聪明了 学校不适合他
He's too smart for school.

他得继续帮我
H-he needs to keep hanging out and helping me.

Jerry 我不希望这一切就这么结束了
Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.

我明白
No, I-I understand.

可能是我们反应过度了
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

但他还得继续上学
But he has to keep going to school.

好吧Jerry
Okay, Jerry.

你真会开条件 但我能干嘛呢
You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do?

说不吗
Say say no?

这里毕竟你说了算
You you really wear the pants around here.

我想让你们知道 从现在开始
I just want you to know, between us, from now on,

我们互相保证百分百的诚实和公开
it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication.

Frank Palicky今天被冻死了
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!

完全不知道你在说啥
No idea what you're talking about.

行
Okay.

Morty 再过一个小时你就该上床了
Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.

别再熬夜了
Don't stay up all night again.

不过这挺好的
This is good, though.

这样能行
This can work.

我们能做一家人
I think we can be a family.

Beth 如果你愿意的话 我想和你去床上
And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.

你猜咋的
You know what?

好嘞
Okay.

天啊 Rick
Holy cow, Rick.

我都不知道和你在一起让我变聪明了
I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.

其实吧 没有这回事
Full disclosure, morty it's not.

暂时的超常智力只是
Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect

奇异种溶解在你肠道里的副作用
of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.

噢
Aw, man.

一旦种子的效力过去 你会失去大部分运动机能
Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor Skills,

以及大部分的大脑功能 持续七十二小时
and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, morty.

从现在开始
Starting right about now.

天啊
Ohh, man.

我很抱歉Morty 不幸的是你确实很蠢
I'm sorry, morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come.

我真的很需要那些种子
And I needed those seeds real bad,

我不得不放弃它们好让你父母别来烦我
and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back,

因此 我们得去搞来更多的种子
so now we're gonna have to go get more.

在那之后我们还要有更多的冒险 Morty
And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, morty.

而你要保持沉默 Morty
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, morty, because

因为世上充满了分不清轻重的傻瓜
The world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important,

他们会试图分开我们
and they'll tear us apart, morty.

但只要你跟着我 我就能完成伟业
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things,

你也会是伟业的一部分
Morty, and you're gonna be part of them,

我们一起东奔西走
and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

做各种奇妙的事情
We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, morty.

- 就你和我 Morty  - 不啊不
- Just you and me, morty.   - Oh, no, no.

外面的世界是我们的敌人
The outside world is our enemy, morty.

我们的朋友只有彼此
We're the only friends we've got, Morty.

只有Rick和Morty
It's just rick and morty

Rick和Morty大冒险
Rick and morty and their adventures, morty.

你想出去么
You want to go outside?

想出去吗
Outside?

他刚尿在地毯上了
He just peed on the carpet!

坏狗狗
Bad dog! Bad!

Morty 快来 我今晚要你帮忙
Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.

等下 Rick
Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.

你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing

更聪明的科学发明吧
You could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?

养狗的目的不就是为了有优越感吗 Jerry
I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

我要是你 就不会想做这事
If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.

走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

Rick 要是你想继续在这儿白住
Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free

拉我儿子帮你搞啥破科学 至少你
And use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do

要帮这家里做点事吧
Is put a little bit of it to use for the family.

你不把狗弄聪明点
You make that dog smart or...

我就禁足Morty
Morty's grounded!

噢 不要
Aw, man!

那你真是让我别无他法了 Jerry
Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.

好吧 皱皱
All right, Ruffles

他叫啥来着
What's his name?

嗅嗅
Snuffles.

嗅嗅 握手
Snuffles, shake.

打滚
Roll over.

去上厕所
Go to the bathroom.

- 妈啦  - 我的天
- Holy crap! - No way.

这下你满意了吧 Jerry
Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry.

玩得开心
Have fun.

我们走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

太神奇啦 Rick
That was fantastic, Rick!

如果你喜欢那玩意儿的话
Yeah, morty, if you like that.

这个一定能让你大吃一惊
boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.

这是啥
W-w-w-what is it?

Morty 只要把这个设备
It's a device, Morty,

放进你的耳朵里 就能进入别人的梦里
That when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty.

就跟你老说的那电影一样
It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.

《盗梦空间》吗
You talking about "Inception"?

没错 Morty
That's right, Morty.

和那个差不多 但是这个不扯
This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense.

《盗梦空间》也不扯好吗
"Inception" Made sense.

你不用跟我说这些 Morty
You don't have to try to impress me, Morty.

今晚我们去你数学老师Goldfold先生家
Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and

将你数学得A的想法植入他脑子里
We're g we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you a's in math, Morty.

这样你就
That way you can, you know

你就能天天帮我搞科学了
Y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.

Rick 你花时间在搞这种发明
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing,

就不能直接帮我把作业做了吗
couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?

你有好好听我说的话吗
Are you listening to me, morty?

作业有害智商 少做才是正解
Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.

走 我们快过去把事情办了
J-j come on, let j let's just get over there and deal with this thing.

去你老师的梦里
W-we're gonna incept your teacher.

别说扫兴话了
Y-y-y-y-y-you're frustrating me.

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

好啊 Pancakes太太 好极了啊
Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.

下一周的《Pancakes太太的日日夜夜》
Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

那他妈就让我好好地认识认识你
Then let me get to know yo, damn it!

不好 剧透
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

我落了一季没看呢
I'm a full season behind.

Rick 我们居然就这么跑到我老师的房子里来了
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house.

太诡异了
It's really weird.

马上就会更诡异了 Morty
It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.

麦脆片 麦脆片
Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

给我来两份
I'll take two.

我觉得你吃得够多了 先生
Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.

你又不认识我
You don't know me.

好了 Morty 是时候动手了
All right, Morty, time to make our move.

弹一弹
Make it bounce.

哎呀
No, you didn't.

抖一抖
Oh, jiggle it now.

快住手了啦
You better stop with that.

真主至上
Allahu akbar!

这飞机是我们的了
We're gonna take control of this plane!

如果不给Morty Smith更好的数学成绩 我们就重演911
We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!

嘿 说了不许动
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

我不叫"嘿"
The name's not buddy.

我叫Goldenfold
It's Goldenfold.

吃我麦脆片
Nice to wheat you!

找掩护 Morty
Take cover, Morty!

嗷
Ooh!

我没想到Goldenfold这么厉害
Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated.

这人不是高中数学老师吗
I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.

没想到他在梦里这么有主动权
I-I-I-I didn't take him for an active dreamer.

我们得干掉他让他醒过来
We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty.

但我们不能死
But we can't get killed.

如果你在别人梦里被杀掉 你就真的死了
If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.

啥 你说啥
What?! Are you kidding me?!

怂什么
Don't be a baby!

现实生活中不是躲过不少子弹吗
You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty.

在这儿也一样躲 不就没事了
Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!

帮我把拖鞋拿来
Now bring me my slippers.

嗅嗅 来帮我垫脚
Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

这才对嘛
This is what I'm talking about.

这才叫狗狗
This is a dog.

嗯哼 这样挺好的
Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.

我们婚礼上你就说了这句话 连讽刺的语气都一样
You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding

结果呢
and guess what.

天啊 他想和我们说话
Oh, my god. He's trying to tell us something.

太棒了
That is so awesome.

他在说"我爱千层面"
Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna."

他在说"我爱奥巴马"
He's saying "I love Obama."

好可爱哎
So cute!

嗯
Hmm?

Goldenfold 我们出来了
Goldenfold, we're coming out!

咱们得谈谈
We just want to talk!

你们凭什么跟我谈条件
Why would I negotiate with you?

咱都是明白人 不想闹得最后没法收拾
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.

况且 我还有肉盾
And because I have a human shield.

Pancakes太太
Mrs. Pancakes!

不好 他的潜意识开始恐慌了
Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.

快跑啊
Run!

冷静 Morty
Relax, Morty.

看 Pancakes太太有降落伞
Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

快来
Come on!

嘿 你又不认识我
Hey, you don't know me!

Rick 看
Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold 把飞机降落了
Goldenfold landed the plane,

他造了个机械手臂来 接住Pancakes太太
And he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air

他要让我们掉进熔岩池里
while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!

总结得真简练 Morty
Pretty concise, Morty.

看来我们不过是把不可避免的事推迟了而已
Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.

对啊 Morty
That's it, morty!

把不可避免的事推迟
Prolonging the inevitable!

如果我们进到Pancakes太太的梦里 时间会比外面慢一百倍
Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.

这样我们就有想办法的时间了
That'll buy us some time to figure this out!

你又不认识
You don't know...

行了 咱们走
All right, let's go.

天啊 Rick 这好诡异啊
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

别评头论足 Morty
Don't judge, Morty.

好吧
Okay. All right, well...

看Pancakes太太在那儿
Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there.

我去让她醒了以后告诉Goldfold别杀我们
I'll just go ask her to tell Goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.

不行 Morty 植入想法的要点就在于
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making

要让他们以为他们自己产生了这个想法
People think theycame up with the idea.

听着
Listen to me.

如果我们要让Pancakes太太产生什么想法 就要先混入人群
If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

我午饭以后来找你
I'll talk to you after lunch.

嘿
Ooh, hey!

呃哦 天啊
Ooh, oh! Oh, man.

- 来一起玩嘛  - 不用了
- Come and join us.  - I'm sorry. No, no.

- 来嘛  - 算了吧
- Ooh, come here!  - No, thanks!

小可爱 来这儿啊
Ooh, wow! Come over here, baby!

不了
No, I'm okay.

你好啊 陌生人
Hey, there, stranger.

喜不喜欢这对儿宝贝儿啊
What do you think of these things?

好恶心 好恶心
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!

你干啥呢 Morty 冷静点
What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down!

这儿的气氛都让你毁了
You're kind of killing the vibe in here.

是Summer
It's S-s-s-summer!

哇
Aw, geez.

看来Goldenfold 有一些他自己都不齿的癖好
Looks like Goldenfold has some predilections so shameful

深埋在他梦里的人的梦里
he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams,

包括对你未成年姐姐的变态遐想
including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.

你能怪他吗
Can you blame him?

来嘛 老汉 小娃
Come on, old man, little boy.

咱们来个跨辈三明治
Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.

天啊
Oh, my god.

天啊
Oh, my god!

看在上帝的份上 把衣服穿上啦
Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake!

太恶心了
This is disgusting!

我要吐了
I'm gonna puke!

我受不了了 Rick
I can't take it, Rick!

在快活屋扰乱色情秩序者可处死刑

看来得潜入更深层次的梦里了 Morty
Time to go another dream deep, Morty!

搞啥
What the hell?

为什么Goldenfold梦见的Pancakes梦里的
Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version

一个半人马会梦见这么恐怖的地方 Rick
of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?

不知道啊 Morty
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

你指望我能干嘛
Wha-what do you want from me?

欢迎来到你们的噩梦 贱人
Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!

来了
Oh, here we go!

看起来像是某个没构成侵权的山寨版
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an

You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

哇 你这是怎么回事儿
Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?

Snuffles want to be understood.

嗅嗅需要被理解

娱乐时间结束了
Fun's over.

爸 你不能给一个生物思想然后剥夺掉
Whoa, Dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.

为何不能
Why not?

selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast

成为了人类顺从的小伙伴
was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.

天啊
Aw! Oh, my god!

他能认出电视上别的狗狗呢
He recognizes the other dogs on tv.

*他叫恐怖Terry*
*"A," "B" his name is scary terry*

*他真的好恐怖*
*"C," "D" he's very scary*

我们得躲进别的梦里去
Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!

天啦 天啦
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

*他会送你上路*
*"E," "F" he'll design your death*

那小女孩儿
The little girl!

嗯
Huh?

*他会让你痛不欲生*
*"J," "K," He'll really ruin your day*

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

又是这个
This again?

看来我们已经到了梦的底层了 Morty
Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

这太糟糕了 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

从此开始只有恐怖 贱人
Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!

嗷哦啊
Ohhhh!

妈啦 Morty
Holy crap, Morty.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams!

我们完蛋啦
We're so screwed!

Summer 我的睾丸去哪儿了
Where are my testicles, Summer?

我的睾丸呢 Summer
Where are my testicles, Summer?

被摘除了
They were removed.

去哪儿了
Where have they gone?

你这一连串问得有点咄咄逼人啊 嗅嗅
Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles.

不准这么叫我
Do not call me that!

"嗅嗅"是我作为奴隶的名字
"Snuffles" Was my slave name.

你现在要叫我雪球
You shall now call me Snowball

因为我的毛又美又白
Because my fur is pretty and white.

行 雪球 冷静点好吗
Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay?

你吓到我了
You're scaring me.

吓到你了
Scaring you?

Summer 要是一个人天生就是短腿
Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs,

你们会让他和另外一个畸形配种
would they breed it with another deformed human

然后把他们的后代拿来像腊肠狗那样展览吗
and put their children on display like the dachshund?

呃
Uhhh...

这儿还好吗
Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?

Jerry 又想来把我的脸摁进尿里吗
Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?

不 不是 我们就是过来看看Summer
No! No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...

想不想和我们半夜出去散个小步
Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!

想啊想啊
Yeah. Totally.

走吧
Let's go.

到散步的时间了 你们才能去散步
You will walk when it is time to walk.

我们在这儿干嘛来着 植入什么想法吗
What are we here for again? Incepting?

我们是想让我数学得A
We're trying to incept me to get an "A" In math?

哦对
Oh, yeah.

系好安全带 贱人
Buckle up, bitch!

他好喜欢说"贱人"啊
Man, he sure says "Bitch" A lot!

尽管跑 但别想躲起来
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

等等 Morty 他不停说我们可以跑但是别躲
Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.

我们躲起来试试看
I say we try hiding.

但这不是和他说的反着来
But that's the opposite of what...

我们干嘛要照他说的来
Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?

你说的有道理耶 Rick
Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick.

如果躲起来有用的话
Like, if the truth was that we could hide,

他肯定不会这么说的
it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know?

我觉得行得通
I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.

最坏的情况也就接着跑呗
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.

梦中六小时以后

感觉我们可以就这样一直躲下去耶
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time.

Rick 你真是太机智了
Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.

谢谢 Morty
Thanks, Morty.

偶尔能意见一致真是蛮好的
Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.

尽管跑
You can run...

但别想躲起来
But you can't hide!

太好了 Morty
Oh, this is perfect, Morty.

看 他开始困了
Look at that. He's getting sleepy.

在过一会儿他就要休息了
Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.

到时候我们就动手
That's when we make our move.

嗅嗅 我们没有恶意
Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm!

这是个天大的误会
This is a huge misunderstanding.

爸 你要叫他雪球
Dad, he wants to be called Snowball.

我才不会这么叫呢
Well, I'm not calling him that.

太扯了
That's ridiculous.

你脾气不太好啊 Jerry
You're being very aggressive, Jerry.

或许明天Scraps医生能动个手术帮你解决这个问题
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.

你以为给我剪个头发就能让我屈服吗
You think you can control me with a haircut?

亲爱的 你回来的好早啊
Hi, Honey. You're home early.

今天过得怎么样啊
How was your day?

我不想说这个
I don't want to talk about... It!

当然当然 你什么时候想说过
Oh, of course. You never want to talk about it.

少来烦我 贱人
Get off my back, bitch!

有脾气别带回家里来
Out there. Not in here.

我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know, I know.

我不该冲着你和恐怖Brandon发脾气
I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon.

我爱你 Melissa
I love you, Melissa.

我也爱你 Terry
I love you, too, Terry.

Morty 太好了
Morty, this is perfect.

再来场恐怖爱爱他们就要睡觉了 然后我们就到他的梦里去
After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.

恐怖Terry好像在做噩梦啊
Looks like Scary Terry's having a nightmare.

Rick 要多可怕的噩梦才能吓到恐怖Terry啊
Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know, scare Scary Terry.

哦不 我上课要迟到了 贱人
Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch!

哦不 我没穿裤子
Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!

Terry先生 你来告诉一下同学们
Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class

当你追人经过一片南瓜田的时候应该说什么啊
the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?

呃 呃 "贱人"
Oh... um... "Bitch."

你就想不出什么和南瓜有关系的双关吗 贱人
Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

别这样对他
Hey, leave him alone!

没错 这纯粹是胡扯
Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.

杀人的时候谁管你说什么双关呢
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone?

让他想说什么说什么不行吗
Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?

我才不会就这么站着让你们侮辱
Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.

你给自己太多压力了恐怖Terry
You're putting too much pressure on yourself, Scary Terry.

你现在就已经非常吓人了
You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.

嘿 恐怖T
Hey, yo, Scary T.

别担心你的裤子 哥们儿
Don't even trip about your pants... dawg.

我们这儿有一条
Here's a pair on us, fool.

噢 贱人 我都不知道该说什么了
Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.

你什么都不用说
You don't need to say anything.

我们挺你 哥们儿
We got you, dawg.

你有我们呢 别担心
You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.

嘿 是你们啊
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

我好几年没见他这么放松了
I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.

你们需要什么尽管说
If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.

确实有一件事要请你帮忙 Terry
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.

*你逃不掉的*
*"Q," "R," You won't get very far*

我一直就不喜欢这首歌
I always hated that song!

这两半就不该拼一起 贱人
These halves don't belong together, bitch!

性是神圣的
Sex is sacred!

叫你不给Morty Smith好成绩 贱人
This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

我的个天啦
Holy crap! God damn!

我一定要给Morty打A 这是我自己的想法
I know one thing for sure I'm giving morty an "A" In math, and that's my idea.

是我自己想这么干的
That is an original thought.

这怎么回事
What the hell?

刚下刀山又进火海啊 Morty
Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

发生什么了
Oh, man, what's going on?

有可能
Well, it's possible

你的狗狗有了自我意识
that your dog became self-aware

然后改进了认知增强装置
and made modifications on the cognition amplifier,

然后在认识到人类对他的种族压迫后
then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after

对Jerry Beth和Summer动手了
learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but

不过你的想法也很有可能啦 Morty
Your guess is as good as mine, Morty.

就因为聪明了嗅嗅居然变得这么狠心
I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.

所以我才只愿意拿C
This is why I choose to get C's

嘿 Beth Jerry Summer
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

爸
Dad!

Rick
Rick!

谢天谢地 Morty
Oh, thank god, Morty.

不用谢
Oh, you're welcome.

好了 快走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

如果抓紧时间 我们还能在狗狗们全面占领世界之前
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something

在下水道之类的地方建个营地
before the dogs completely take over.

我们哪儿也不去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere.

这是我家
This is my house.

我不会抛弃它的
I'm not abandoning it.

都完了 Jerry
It's all over, Jerry.

那些狗马上就要占领世界了
The dogs are on a path to total world domination.

不过至少他们不会在你地毯上撒尿了
But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?

等等 我有个主意
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

先生们 占用一下你们的时间
Gentlemen, a moment of your time.

看见了吗
See that?

你们的特制枪上都是我的尿
I'm peeing all over your special guns.

所以这些都是我的了
That means I own them.

坏人 坏
Bad person. Bad.

这招好厉害啊 Jerry
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

把男孩带来
Bring the boy to me.

你对我一直很好 Morty
You were always kind to me, Morty.

所以我可以让你把睾丸留着
That's why I will leave you with your testicles.

从现在起 你是我最好的朋友 留在我身边
From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.

谢谢 嗅嗅
Th-thanks, snuffles.

阶段二开始
Begin phase two.

狗军占领东部沿海 战争仍在继续
Fighting continues as the dog army captures the Eastern seaboard.

显然人类统治的纪元将迎来了苦涩的终结
It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end.

求求你别杀我
Please! Please don't kill me!

她在说什么 Bill
What's she saying, Bill?

我觉得她在说"我爱千层面"
I think she's saying, "I love lasagna."

human testicles 人睾丸

谢谢你 Fido
Thank you, Fido.

Rick 我以为你死了
Rick! I thought you were dead!

不不不 我只是装死
No, no, no, I was just playing dead.

有好消息
Good news, though, Morty.

这一切马上就要结束了
This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.

啥
What?

这是个梦 Morty
It's a dream, Morty.

我们在你的狗的梦里
We're in your dog's dream.

狗抓住我们的那天晚上
The night the dogs captured us,

你吓哭了 拉在了裤子里 然后我们都睡着了
after you cried and crapped your pants, we... we all went to sleep.

然后我用梦境植入装置把我们两个弄进了嗅嗅的梦里
Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

但这都过了差不多一年了
But I-it's been like a whole year!

是六个小时
It's been six hours.

梦里的时间是现实时间的一百分之一
Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog

而狗的时间是人的七分之一
Time is one-seventh human time.

这里过一天 外面一分钟
So, you know, every day here is like a minute.

就和《盗梦空间》一样 把人搞得很晕 而且很蠢
It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid,

这部人人爱的电影就这个样
then so is everyone's favorite movie.

可是我很喜欢这样的生活呀
Aw, man. I really liked this life.

不过至少我没有真的拉在裤子里吧
Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.

不 这事儿是真的 在你睡着之前就拉了
No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.

你现在就睡在你的屎里呢
You're sleeping in your crap right now.

唯一一件确确实实发生了的事
Out of all the things that happened to you,

就是你拉在裤子里了
 that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants.

简直一团糟
I mean, it's a mess out there.

还有些沾到我手上了
I got some on my hands, Morty,

然后我给弄到梦境植入器上了 还有一坨掉进了我的嘴里
And then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.

天啊 不是吧
Aw, man, geez! Seriously?

别管了 Morty
Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.

来把这个吃了
Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.

这些药能让我醒过来还是怎么的
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?

差不多吧
Close.

这个会让你的肾功能停止
It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

啥
What?!

这是为了我们的计划 Morty
It's necessary for the plan, Morty.

别担心 哥们儿
Don't even trip, dawg.

情况很糟 雪球陛下
It's pretty bad, Emperor Snowball.

我们还需要做一次手术
We're gonna need to do another operation.

不惜一切
Anything.

不惜一切代价救回我的宝贝Morty
Anything for my precious Morty.

作为您的会计师 我必须告诉您
Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that

这些医疗支出会让您的财政到达岌岌可危的地步
these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy.

您可能会失去您的帝国
You could lose your kingdom.

去他的帝国 斤斤计较的会计
To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.

我愿意牺牲这一切 来换得这个人类的健康和幸福
I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.

你觉得他们会为我们做到这一步吗
Do you think they would have done this for us?

我们又不是他们
We are not them!

我们不是 他们
We are not... them.

召集军队
Assemble the troops.

我做了一个决定
I've made a decision.

占领人类世界
Taking over the human's world

只会造成更多的残忍与伤痛
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty.

所以我们决定去新世界建立一个智慧狗类的社会
Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs.

我们不会再犯人类的错误
One that will not make the same mistakes as humanity

并且会有强制宠物保险
and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.

我会想你的 雪球
I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

你可以叫我嗅嗅 Morty
You can call me Snuffles, Morty

我也会想你的 非常想念
and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.

Jerry
Jerry?

抱歉
I'm sorry.

就和《老黄狗》的结局一样
It's just like the end of "Old Yeller."

你这么说是因为里面也有狗吧
Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.

一个智慧狗类居住的世界
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.

我好想知道会是什么样啊 Rick
I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.

我觉得肯定很棒 Morty
I think it will be great, Morty.

可以发展成一个
You know, it's g I-I-I-I-it could be developed in-into

很好的全年龄向节目啊
a very satisfying project for people of all ages.

我每一集至少愿意看十一分钟
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.

说不定还能有分镜脚本
You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.

这个想法很令人欣慰啊 Rick
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.

你知道什么呢 Morty
What do you know, Morty?

你又知道啥呢
What do you know?

嗨 大家好

模拟部是不会模拟已经被绑架了的人的 所以

果酱饼怎么会住在烤面包机里呢
I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick?

那种地方对它们来说不是应该很恐怖吗
I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live.

对吧
You know what I mean?

你搞错重点了 Morty

I'm going to make love to my wife!

不错哟
Lookin' good.

慢着点
Slow down!

好样的
My man!

天哪 Rick
aw, geez, Rick.

这个计划真的好吗
I-I don't know if I like this plan, you know?

人一多 我就总觉得好紧张
I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Morty 别怕
Morty, relax.

外面只不过是堆二进制代码
It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there.

没事的
You're gonna be fine.

跟着我来就行
Just follow my lead.

哟 DJ 节奏打起来
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

啊噢 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

我们这么赞的说唱表演
This crowd looks too small

这人也来的太少了
for one of our famous rap concerts.

这我们还怎么表演我们的新歌
I don't think we can perform our new song,

"浓缩暗物质配方"
"The recipe for Concentrated dark matter,"

就这么点人
for a crowd this tiny.

你说的对 Rick
you got that right, Rick.

这还差不多
now that's more like it!

Morty 走着
Morty, here we go.

每个人都说"嘿哟"
Let me hear everybody say "Hey-oh!" Yeah!

所有女士请说"耶"
All the ladies say, "Yeah!"

所有超过30岁的人 用你们的手做这个动作
Everybody over 30, do this with your hands!

所有穿红衣服的人
Everybody with a red shirt,

上下蹦
jump up and down!

嗯嗯嗯
mm. Mm. Mm.

就这样 别动
Yeah, don't move.

嗯 嗯 唔嗯
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

嗯
Mm!

名字以"L"开头的非西班牙裔
name begins with an "L" who isn't hispanic,

绕圈子 圈数等于你们的年龄平方根的十倍
walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

趁着系统还没重启
Before the system reboots!

耶 喜欢这样么
yeah! You like that?

现在知道我的厉害了吧
Now who's unremarkable?

你想要苹果吗
You hungry for apples?

你 想要 苹果吗
Are you hungry...for...apples?!

哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

这是我有生以来最棒的一场爱爱了
That's the best sex I've ever had in my life.

这 这也太棒了
It's...it's...too good.

我配不上这个 Beth
I don't deserve this, Beth.

我是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

天 Rick
oh, man, Rick!

我们要跑哪儿去
W-w-w-where we running to?

跑出模拟舱 Morty
Out of the simulation, Morty.

通常来讲 模拟舱的运行类似跑步机
Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill,

随着我们的移动 身后的虚拟世界会不断消失
with the virtual world disappearing

新渲染的空间会出现在我们眼前
behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it,

但如果它当机了 Morty
but while it's frozen, Morty,

我们就可以到达边界了
we can get to The edge.

快来吧
Here we go.

我的天啊
holy crap!

快点 Morty
come on, Morty.

长官 他们穿过边界了
Sir, they're over the edge.

没错
Yes, they are.

正如 计划 所料
Just...as...planned.

咱这心理操纵(mindfuck)玩得妙啊
Oh, this is going to be such a mind [beep].

到了中控室好好盯着点 Morty
keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty.

看看我们怎么耍这群傻子
That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.

嘿 Rick 如果你比这群外星人聪明那么多
so, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you,

为啥他们还一直追着你不放啊
Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?

他们就是有这种执念
it's an obsession for them at this point.

这么多年来
The zigerions have been

Z星人一直想证明他们比我聪明 Morty
trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.

每次我都比他们棋高一着
Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them.

啊哈
Aha!

到了
Here we go.

中央处理器→

←逃生舱

能拿多少处理器就拿多少 Morty
Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty.

这群人没什么本事
These guys aren't good at much,

做芯片倒是有一套
But they're reallygood at making these chips.

我抓太多啦 都快拿不了啦
I've got so many, I can barely hold them all.

看呐 看我
Look at-look at this.

哎呀 掉了一个
Oops. I dropped one.

别担心 Morty
don't worry about it, Morty.

这玩意儿有的是 小笨蛋
There's plenty of them, you little goofball.

过来 Morty 噢 抓到你啦
Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

行啦 别闹啦 Rick
come on, quit it, Rick!

别闹啦
Quit it!

小家伙 时不时闹一下没啥错的
nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

哇哦 真没想到 居然这么容易
wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.

完全没错
totes malotes, dawg.

都有点不敢相信了
just kind of hard to believe, you know?

没啥不信的 Morty
believe it, Morty.

我又把能拿的全拿走然后远走高飞啦
And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry,

Z星人从我这儿什么都没搞到
and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.

Marklevitz先生 能和您谈谈吗
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a Minute to talk?

好啊
yes.

我是个骗子
look, I'm a fraud.

我们面对事实吧
I mean, let's face it

"想要苹果吗"是我抄的"有牛奶吗"
"Hungry for apples" Is just a rip-off of "Got milk?"

简直如出一辙
It's almost identical.

是的
yes.

好吧
okay.

我活该
I deserve that.

我这就去卷铺盖卷
Umm...I guess...i'll just pack up my desk.

好的
yes.

噢 天哪
oh, my god.

等会儿 不对
Wait. You know what?! No!

编牛奶广告的那群人又没为简单反问句申请专利
The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions!

"想吃苹果吗"和"有牛奶吧" 没一个字是一样的
There's not even a single word in "Hungry for apples" That's Shared by "Got milk?"

我写的是一个完全不同的广告语
It's a completely different slogan.

完全不同
It's different!

我不该走人
And I shouldn't be fired.

我该升职
I should be promoted!

是的
yes.

耶
yeah!

等等 真的吗
Wait. Really?

是的
Yes!

棒
yes!

虽然这条广告语是衍生出来的
I mean, I'm it may be derivative,

但这是公司这么久以来
but it's the most successful

最成功的一条广告语
campaign to come out of the agency in a long time.

是的
yes.

我倒不是说我该得个什么广告奖
i-I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials,

但完全可以有个专门颁给苹果广告的奖项的提名啊
but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples,

比如说 苹苹奖之类的
Like...an appley or something.

是的
yes.

真有和苹果品牌广告有关的奖项叫苹苹奖吗
is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

是的
yes.

能提名我吗
could we nominate me?

是的
yes.

超赞啊
holy crap!

进来 Morty
get in, Morty.

我可以用这些处理器
I'm gonna be able to use these processors

搞点真正重大的科学发明
to make some real important science stuff.

哈 我应该输对了啊
Huh. I thought I entered the code right.

哇 这是什么啊
Wha well, what's this?

这是怎么回事
W-what could this possibly be?

因为看起来你们在模拟舱
Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...

里面的另一个模拟舱里
Inside a simulation.

你们还在我们的飞船上
You're still on the ship.

美梦破灭
Game-day bucket go boom.

出自一个肯德基广告

长官 呃
Sir, the, uh,

您和医生之前预约的
doctor's appointment to examine

检查您肛门瓣的变色情况
the discoloration on your butthole flaps was

声音太大了 Cynthia
Too loud, Cynthia.

而且你说的太具体了
Too loud and too specific.

呃
uhh...

我们早就知道
We've known how to make

怎么制造浓缩暗物质了
concentrated dark matter for a long time.

不过现在嘛 我们 还知道了
But now we also know

你传说中的保险箱密码 Rick Sanchez
the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

你所有最珍贵的秘密
All your most valuable secrets

马上就是我们的了
will now be ours!

是吗 我会在你们之前赶到家
uh, yeah, until I get home before you

然后把密码改了
and change the combination,

蠢货
you bunch of Idiots!

所以你永远也回不了家了
That is why you're never getting home.

给我抓起来
Get them!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

噢老天啊
oh, my god!

关闭重力开关

啊
Ow!

开启重力开关

第七十五届

苹苹奖

不得不说 今天早上
I got to tell you, this morning,

我都不知道还有这个奖
I didn't even know this award existed.

现在我居然拿着奖杯
Now I'm holding one.

呃
And...um...

我想说
Look, I want to say that today

今天是我一生中最美好的一天
was the best day of my life...

但其实它的意义远高于此
But...the truth is, it's it's more meaningful than that.

好样的
My man!

谢谢您
yes. Thank you, sir.

我的人生 终于 完整了
I...am...finally complete!

好 好 好 好样的
My my my my man!

啊啊
aah!

搞什么
What the hell?!

不要啊
No.

- Jerry  - 爸
- Jerry?!  - Dad!

你在这儿干啥呢
what are you doing Here?

你怎么穿的像个服务生似的
W-why are you dressed like a Waiter?

算了 没时间了 快跑
Screw it. We don't have time. Come on.

不要啊
no!

逃生舱

研发部

禁区

啊啊啊啊
ohhhhh!

啊
aah!

啊
Oof!

有点儿男人样 Jerry
man up, Jerry!

可能得要你来操作激光炮
I may need you to work the lasers.

天啊 他们马上就要追上来了 Rick
Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!

看来他们确实有浓缩暗物质
I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

你也知道怎么制造的 对吧 Rick
well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

是的
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

去轮机舱看看
Uh, check the engine room.

我们需要铯 深成夸克
We just need cesium, plutonic quarks,

还有一瓶水
and bottled water.

齐了 Rick
it's all here, Rick!

哇 Morty 运气太好了
wow, Morty. Lucky break.

把那个桶拿过来
Grab that bucket.

好 两份深成夸克
Okay, two parts plutonic quarks,

一份铯
One part cesium.

好的
okay. Uh-huh.

好了
All right.

现在把水全倒进桶里
Now empty the water bottle into the bucket

再把混合物全倒进燃料箱
and pour it all into the fuel tank

然后我们就能逃出去了
so we can get the hell out of here!

你干啥呢 Morty
What are you doing, Morty?!

没时间了
There's no time!

噢 不是吧
oh, no.

到底
what the

不要啊
no!

天哪 Rick
Oh, my god, Rick.

你是有多蠢啊
How dumb are you?

你是在模拟出的模拟舱
You're inside a simulation... of a simulation...

模拟出的另一个模拟舱里
Inside another giant simulation!

我们从来没有过浓缩暗物质的配方
W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.

但是现在有了
But we do now!

现在有了 蠢货
We do now, sucka!

你们模拟了我外孙的生殖器
You simulated my grandson's genitalia?!

你们这群畜生
Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Kevin为了监管这项工程可是费了不少劲儿呢
Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

说好了不告诉别人的
You said you weren't gonna tell anyone!

这个梗我这辈子都摆脱不掉了是吗
I'm never gonna live this down, am I?

好吧 好吧
all right. Okay.

好吧 你厉害 你狠
All right, great. Wonderful.

你赢了 我们现在能回家了不
You win. Can we go home now?

我不知道 能吗
I don't know. Can you?

哈 赞
Ha! Nice.

好了 好了
Okay, okay.

把这个好骗的傻瓜送上航天机
Show this gullible turd to his shuttle.

没他什么事儿了
I'm done with him.

噢 等下 拍张照
Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

哎哟 看他的表情
Aww. Look at his face.

他还在琢磨自己是不是在模拟舱里呢
He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.

是吧 Rick
Are you, Rick?

是吧
Are you?

不是
You're not.

还是说 是呢
Or are you?

噢 还 还有
Oh, a-and, by the way,

我的肛门瓣可没变色
I don't have discolored butthole flaps.

那是模拟的一部分
That was part of the simulation.

噢
Oh.

呃 长官 那我是不是要取消预约
Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

对啊 当然取消
Yeah! Of course you should!

不 留着
No, keep it.

可以的话 提到上面去
Move it up, actually, if you can.

嘿 Jerry 别担心嘛
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

就算你人生中最有意义的一天是 都是最低性能的模拟又怎么样呢
So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

是吗 Rick 这些人也把你耍了
you know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too.

你还是尊重一下宇宙里的蠢人吧
You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe,

既然你也是其中之一
now that you're one of us.

也许你说得对 Jerry
maybe you're right, Jerry.

也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

好了大伙儿
All right, everybody.

两份深成夸克
Two parts plutonic quarks...

一份铯
One part cesium...

还有 很抱歉之前对大家大吼大叫
A-and listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier.

你们是最棒的员工
I-I couldn't ask for a better Staff.

我爱你们 我也爱你们的家人
I love you guys, and I love all your families.

最后的原料
And the final ingredient...

啊
whoa!

搞什么啊
What the hell?!

发生了什么
W-what happened back there?

Jerry 不然你去问问全宇宙最聪明的人吧
why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?

噢对 没法问了
Oh, yeah. You can't.

他们都被炸飞了
They blew up.

Gerry Rafferty《Baker Street》

那么
so...

怎么样
What do you think?

你被解雇了
You're fired.

啥
wha

但这个创意已经通过了最先进的模拟测试了
But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

那这模拟有够烂的
Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation.

滚出去
Get out.

天 这种人是怎么能回家和他老婆做爱的
Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

嘿 Morty

They're my parents and sister!

Morty 我已经和你说过了 这不是你家人
Morty, I already told you it's not your family!

是另一个未来的平行宇宙里
They're clones from an alternate reality,

被外星恶灵附身的他们
possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future!

你是得要什么记忆辅助装置之类的吗
Do you need a mnemonic device or something?

Just hit the button, already!

Good work, Morty.

这这这些外星恶灵可是非常珍贵的
You know, th-th-these demonic alien spirits are really valuable.

你还好吗 Morty
You okay, Morty?

我跟你说了那些金枪鱼不能吃了
I told you not to trust that tuna.

我不管他们究竟是什么
I just killed my family!

我刚杀了我的家人
I don't care what they were.

是吗 Morty
I don't know, Morty.

有的人出大价钱就为了迈出这一步呢
Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.

Rick 我受够了
You know what, Rick? That's it!

我受够这些疯狂的冒险了
I'm done with these insane adventures!

我的心灵受到了创伤
That was really traumatizing!

我不干了
I quit! I'm out!

哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

别啊 Morty 别别别这样
Come on, Morty, don't don't don't be like that.

宇宙就是这样疯狂而混乱的啊
The universe is a crazy, chaotic place.

你才疯狂又混乱
You're the one that's crazy and chaotic!

冒险应该是轻松愉快才对
Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun.

是啊 Morty 是啊
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

这这这这种话 跟班的说起来当然轻松
Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position.

那那不然下次 你来负责
But but, uh, how about next time you be in charge,

我们看看是怎么个轻松愉快法
and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is?

真的吗 Rick
Seriously, Rick?

你让我来做决定吗
Y-y-you'll you'll let me call the shots?

是的
Okay, yeah, fine.

不过为了更有意思些 Morty
But let's make it interesting, Morty.

如如如果你的冒险很烂 我们半路放弃了
I-I-I-if your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it,

那以后的冒险你都不准抱怨
you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures.

还有 你得帮我洗一个月的衣服
Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.

没问题 硬汉
Okay, all right, tough guy!

但如果成功的话
But if my adventure's good,

以后每三个冒险就由我做主
I get to be in charge of every third adventure!

每十个
Every tenth.

成交
Deal. All right.

那那我们快点出发吧
W-well, come on, let's get going.

爸 洗碗机老毛病又犯了
Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.

洗碗的毛病么
Washing dishes?

- 它不洗啊 你能修好它么  - Rick外公
- No. The opposite. Can you fix it? - Grandpa Rick,

我作业不会做 能帮帮我吗
Can you help me with my science homework?

可以啊 别做就好啦
Yeah j-just don't do it.

外公
Grandpa!

Rick 你有什么手状的发明
Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device

能帮我打开这美乃滋的罐子嘛
that can open this mayonnaise jar?

哇 帽子戏法(三连击)
Wow. Hat trick.

好吧 Morty 冒险的事情先暂且放一下吧
All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this.

你家这群可怜虫需要我的帮助
I got to help your pathetic family.

说这种话 你不是怂(鸡)了吧
Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say.

咯咯咯 咯咯咯
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

呵呵 Morty 你真是欺人太甚了 赌约正式开始
Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on.

我真是等不及你的冒险不终而散
I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.

至于你们这群渣渣
As for you dingdongs...

这是一个使命必达盒
This is a Meeseeks Box.

我来示范一下 你按这个
Let me show you how it works. You press this.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

你说出你的请求
You make a request.

使命必达先生 打开Jerry的傻逼美乃滋罐子
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.

遵命 先生
Yes, siree!

使命必达先生会满足你的请求
The Meeseeks fulfills the request.

搞定
All done!

哇
Wow!

然后他会自动消失
And then it stops existing.

天哪 他自爆了
Oh, my god, he exploded!

没事 他们巴不得这样
Trust me, they're fine with it.

请便 但记得请求不要太复杂
Knock yourselves out, just keep your requests simple.

他们可不是上帝
They're not gods.

行 好了 快点出去吧 大家快滚出去
All right! G-get out of here now! Everybody out of here!

我还有场赌要赢呢
I got a bet to win!

好多心愿想实现啊
So many possibilities.

脑中一片翻腾
My mind is racing.

如果我们要用这东西的话
If we're gonna use this thing,

虽然我觉得还是有点玄 我们的请求得简...
which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simp...

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

我想在学校里变得受欢迎
I want to be popular at school!

Summer, what did I just...

我是使命必达先生 看过来
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

我想成为一个更加完整的女人
I-I-I want I want to be a more complete woman!

Beth
Beth!

嗯 行啊 女士
Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

你们这是在乱用吧
You guys are doing it wrong.

他说了要"简单"
He said "simple."

你好 我是使命必达先生
Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

使命必达先生 我希望我的高尔夫成绩能减两杆
Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.

行啊 没问题
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

搞定
Nailed it.

天哪 Morty 这冒险开始得好无聊啊
God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure.

我们干嘛不直接去肯塔基州啊
I don't w-w-w-why didn't we just go to Kentucky?

Rick 这是一个奇幻世界 里面充满了神奇的生物和奇幻的东西
Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.

- 我们是来探险的  - 好期待啊
- W-we're going on a quest, okay? - Can't wait.

咳咳 不好意思
Ahem. Excuse me!

我们是两位渴望冒险的谦逊英雄
We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!

天哪 太丢脸了
Oh, my god, so embarrassing.

你们总算来了 两位英雄 你们得帮帮我们
At last! Two heroes! You must help us!

这个村太穷了
This village is terribly poor,

但是住在云端的巨人
yet the giant that lives in the clouds above

却私藏了数不清的财富
has untold treasures!

这样啊
You know what?

我接受你的请求 这位善良又温和的先生
I-I-I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir.

走吧 Rick 云端上住着巨人呢
Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!

呵呵 新手的运气
Yeah. Beginner's luck.

总而言之 与Summer Smith的友谊是可贵的
In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable

和Summer友谊天长地久

能让你们年轻的生命更加充实
and enriching experience of your young lives.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

谢谢
Thank you!

使命必达先生是吗
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

我是基恩 阴道
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

我最近因为监护权和前妻有点问题 我想能不能
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering...

没事 我找Summer要你的联系方式好了
No, I'll g-get your info from Summer.

我17岁时就怀孕了
I got pregnant at 17.

我还是上完了兽医学院
I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school.

我很成功 但要是当时我没能
Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...

我只是想说 时过境迁
I'm just saying, somewhere along the way,

那个天真烂漫的马斯基根少女已经不复存在了
I lost that wide-eyed girl from Muskegon.

她还在你心里啊 Beth
She's still there, Beth.

至少腰是没了
Well, her waistline isn't.

Beth 即使有了家庭
Beth, having a family

你也还是可以拥有属于自己的一片天啊
doesn't mean that you stop being an individual.

对爱你 依赖你的人
You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you?

你更应该坦诚 即使这意味着放手
Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

你的意思是说 我应该离开Jerry
You're saying I should leave Jerry.

真不敢相信 终于有人谈到了我的心声
I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.

还要酒吗
More wine?

不用 我喝得够多了
I think I've had enough.

肩放松 自然往后收 Jerry
Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.

是啊 是啊 我知道了
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

没事的啦 看过来 我是使命必达先生
That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

再来一次 头压低一点
Try again and keep your head down.

所以到底要干嘛
Okay, well, which is it?

收肩还是头压低一点
Square my shoulders or keep my head down?

两个都要 但是最重要的是 你得放轻松
Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.

使命必达先生
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

我觉得这样没用 我放弃了
I don't think this is working. I give up.

对不起 Jerry 你不能放弃
I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我必须满足你的请求然后消失 看过来
I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.

那你随意吧 我逊爆了
Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.

不 我才逊爆了
No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks!

我试试这个办法
Let me try something.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

- 嗨 使命必达先生 我是使命必达先生 看过来  - 嗨
- Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. - Hi!

你能帮我让Jerry的高尔夫成绩少两杆嘛
Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?

当然可以 我是使命必达先生
Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

他的肩有往后收嘛
Is he keeping his shoulders squared?

他有在努力
Ooh, he's trying!

好了 Mort
All right, Morty.

我们到了这蠢巨人的城堡里面了
W-w-we're in your stupid giant's castle.

接下来做什么
W-what do we do next?

放轻松行吗 Rick
Would you just relax, Rick?

我们只要找到宝藏室就行了
All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay?

简单明了
It's nice and simple.

冒险这么这么一帆风顺真是对不起啊
You know, I-I-I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.

不好了 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

事情不太妙了啊
Startin' to get a little hairy.

老大 我们接下来该怎么做
What do you want to do, boss?

快点 躲到这个饼干罐后面
Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.

(杰克与豌豆中巨人所念四行诗的第一句)
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

放弃吧 Morty 游戏到此为止
Just give up, Morty. This is game over.

只要你开口 我们现在就能回去
I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.

没戏 Rick 这都是冒险的一部分
No way, Rick. This is all part of it.

冒险就是要有冲突 要勇敢直面
Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.

我闻到了...(第二句 我闻到了英国人的血味)
I smell the blood of...(an English man)

- 我操  - 天哪
- Holy crap. - Oh, boy.

他看起来快不行了 Morty
He looks pretty bad down there, Morty.

要失血而亡了
Looks like he's bleeding out.

天哪 Dale
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

- 你们这群混蛋  - 不好
- You sons of bitches! - Oh, man.

911吗
Hello, 911?

我老公被迷你人袭击了
My husband has been attacked by tiny people!

已经奄奄一息了
He's dying!

听着 我们懂
Hey, look, we get it.

你们很小 最近又不太景气 然后你们就想
You're little, you're down on your luck, you think,

"反正他是个巨人
"Hey, he's a giant.

不妨我们潜入他家 先抢劫再杀人灭口 多好啊"
Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"

事情的经过不是这样子的
But that's not how it went down!

没差 反正事情就这么入案了
Oh, well, it's going down like that.

你们两个就这么入狱吧
You're both going down like that.

哇 Morty 你真是让我见识到了怎么冒险啊
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done.

真是简单又有趣
Real straightforward and fun.

放下想要变得受欢迎这个想法
Like, letting go of the need to be popular

才能更好地让别人喜欢你
is what makes people like you.

真爱来自自爱
The most important love you can receive is from yourself.

Jerry 虎口下握 靠近击球点
Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!

到底干嘛 下握还是随球把挥杆动作做完
Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!

Jerry 拜托 我们说了好几次了
Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this.

两个都要做到
You know you got to do both!

我们和你一样心烦
This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.

别来和我扯这些 这只会让我压力更大
Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!

- 试着放松啦  - 你才该放松
- Just try to relax. - You try to relax!

你试着放松过吗 真是自相矛盾
Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!

这些使命必达先生 可真棘手啊
These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful.

你们肯定也很头疼吧
I can't imagine what you two must be going through.

Jerry 我们的使命必达先生都已经消失几个小时了
Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.

你这是在逗我吧
You're kidding me.

注意到什么变化没
Notice anything different?

等等 你说几个小时前就消失了?
I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

爸 看妈妈多美
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

你这样会失去她的
Look at her! You will lose her!

呃
Uhh...

Jerry 你能回来继续练习了嘛
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand?

使命必达先生一般不需要存活这么久的
Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.

这感觉怪怪的
It's getting weird.

法庭内保持肃静
Order in the court!

在陪审团裁定前
Before the jury reaches its verdict,

我想先澄清 我个人认为你们两个是有罪的
I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.

真是奇妙的冒险啊 伙计
Oh, great adventure, Buddy.

Rick和Morty进巨人监狱
Rick and Morty go to giant prison.

要是有人不小心掉块肥皂
You know, if somebody drops the soap,

砸我们头上 我们的脊柱就直接被砸碎了 Morty
it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.

那之后再奸尸多容易
You know, i-i-i-it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

我们不会有事的 Rick
We're gonna be okay, Rick.

你想怎么做 他们把我的传送枪没收了
How? They took my portal gun.

这案子一目了然 Morty
This is an open-and-shut case, Morty.

你觉得还能发生什么事吗
You know, w-w-w-what do you think's gonna happen,

凭空出现一个有魔力的天使 然后...
some magical angel's gonna show up and then...

Fee Fi Fo Fum
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

我闻到了侵犯公民自由的味道
I smell the violation of civil liberties!

法官大人 我来自一个迷你人倡导团体
Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group

我来此是为了递交驳回此案的动议
and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss.

这些迷你人未曾被告知他们的巨人权利
These little men were never read their giant rights

所以应当被 fi释 fo放
and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.

他到底在说什么啊
W-what the hell is he talking about?

我的意思是他们自由了
They're free to go, is what I meant.

我我我只是想贴近我们的口头禅而已
I-I-I'm deconstructing our our thing we say.

我们不是巨人嘛 居然没人懂 算了随便吧
We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

我就和你说嘛 Rick 我们做到了
Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!

Morty 看来传送枪还能用
All right, Morty, looks Like the portal gun's still working.

准备回家了吗
You ready to head home?

是啊 这样你就逞心如意了不是嘛 Rick
Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick?

我们还不能放弃
Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet.

我们还要去找一些宝藏什么的
You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something

带回去分给那些村民呢
and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.

Morty 别逞强了 这明显是徒劳无功
Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash.

是啊 我们一开始被捕的时候你也是这么说的
Yeah, you were saying that back w-w-w-when we first got arrested,

巨人法院

现在我们被释放了 还大步流星的走出法院呢
but here we are, you know, walking down the Courthouse steps.

天哪 Morty
Oh, boy, Morty.

通常从法院的楼梯走下去是冒险里比较简单的部分
Usually, walking down the Courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.

怎么说 Morty
What do you say, Morty?

我说 帮把手 跟班
I say give me a hand, Sidekick.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

大家都给我闭嘴 我再试试
Everybody shut up! Let me try!

可恶 可恶 可恶
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

- 我要出门了  - 哦 什么?
- I'm going out. - Wait. What?

你在忙 而我肚子饿了 所以想出去吃个饭
Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out.

你是想让我开心呢 还是想让我被关起来
Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?

哇 哇 哇 你这脾气是... 我陪你去吃晚饭吧
Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is... I'll take you to dinner.

不是吧
Come on.

嘿 听着 我也不愿意这么废柴
Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too.

我马上就来
I'll be right there.

听着 我的婚姻还亟待拯救呢
Look, I've got a marriage to keep together.

这个挥杆的问题 更该操心的是你们 不是我
At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.

我受不了了 我只想去死
I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!

我们都很想死啊 我们可是使命必达先生
We all want to die! We're Meeseeks!

你为什么要把我拖下水
Why did you even rope me into this?

因为他把我拖下水了啊
'Cause he roped me into this!

那边那个 是他把我拖下水
Well, him over there, he roped me into this!

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this!

那我呢 是他把我拖下水
Well, what about me? He roped me into this.

我是被那边那个拖下水的
Well, that one over there roped me into this.

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this.

Morty 这种故事情节真是人人爱啊
Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves.

爬下650,000级巨型阶梯
Scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.

呵呵 如果这是一个故事
All right, okay, y-you know, if this was a story,

这段就会被直接删掉了 白痴
this part wouldn't be included, Stupid.

Rick 没想到吧 快看下面
Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there.

像是个造在阶梯里的客栈
Looks like some kind of tavern something built right into the side of the step.

小渴栈

哇 Rick 这才像是一场冒险嘛
Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it.

快看 这里有小小的阶梯形人
Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here.

各式各样稀奇古怪的角色呢
A-all kinds of crazy characters.

这地方真棒
This place is great, you know?

稀奇古怪有很有趣
It's whimsical and fun.

- 妈的 你看什么看  - Rick 淡定
- What are you looking at, mother f**ker. - Easy, Rick.

别理他们 这些阶梯小精灵脾气挺怪的
Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody.

你们想来点些什么
Now, what can I getcha?

我们有斯伽洛罂粟
We've got skarlog poppies,

放轰 哈鸡嗝丝 不撸基斯 多汁时间宝
flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies...

随便啦 你们这里有苏格兰威士忌嘛
Yeah yeah yeah. How about some scotch whiskey?

这你总有吧 还是只有一堆瞎扯的单词
You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?

Rick 请给我们两杯不撸基斯
Rick. We'll have two bloogies, please.

然后 我们想问
And, uh, we were wondering,

这里有让两名英雄更快下楼梯的办法么
is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?

你们需要搭便车吗
Y'all need to ride down the stairs?

我的名字是滑溜顺滑小阶梯
My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

25傻屌 我就能背你们下去
I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.

25傻屌 那是什么东西啊
25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is.

是很多 还是很少
Is that a lot? Is it a little?

我这对硕大的假胸也是这价钱
That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.

嗨 我是买胸达人先生 我愿意出25傻屌买这对胸部
Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.

好诱人的开价 但我还是拒绝好了
It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.

可恶 太可惜了
Rats! What a shame.

Morty 你的冒险没什么前途了
Morty, your adventure's in a spiral.

说真的 是时候该走了
For real, man, time to pull out.

Rick 你知道你为什么老质疑我的冒险吗
You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?

呃 因为很烂
Uh, because it's lame?

因为你小肚鸡肠
It's because you're petty!

我为了你忍受了多少扯淡的破事儿
You know, h-how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap?

我每次都忍了 Rick
I always roll with the punches, Rick.

为什么你就不行
Why can't you?

听着 我要去上个厕所 等我回来的时候
Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back,

如果你还是没有想通的话 你就自己回去吧
if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!

随你便
Whatever.

事态已经很明显了 看过来
It's become clear, look at me,

只要我们专攻Jerry的后续打姿
that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through,

问题就能解决了 我是使命必达先生
we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me.

正解应该是要让他正确握杆
The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我已经在这里帮Jerry两天了
I've been trying to help Jerry for two days,

对使命必达先生来说已经算是永恒了
an eternity in Meeseeks time,

还是什么都没能奏效
and nothing's worked.

最担心的是我
I fear the worst.

你的失败属于你一个人 老头
Your failures are your own, old man.

我是使命必达先生 看过来 我说后续打姿
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through!

- 谁支持我?  - 后续打姿
- Who's with me?! - Follow-through.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

- 杀了他  - 妈的
- Kill him! - Son of a bitch.

你好 我是软豆先生
How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean.

嗨 软豆先生 我是Morty
Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty.

我外公和我是来冒险的
My grandpa and I are on an adventure.

真棒 有趣吗
Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

希望吧
I hope so.

但是我开始担心是不是有点脱离正轨了
But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.

冒险不都这样的嘛
Isn't that what adventures do?

对啊 你说的很对
Hey, you know what? You're right.

一切都挺顺利的
Everything's going fine.

我只要放轻松 顺其自然就好
I just got to relax and go with the flow.

是啊
Yeah.

- 啊 那个 拜拜 - 不 别走啊
- Okay. Uh. Bye. - Uhh, no, stay.

跟着感觉走
Go with the flow.

住手 你让我现在很不舒服
Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.

不要抗拒我 顺其自然就好
Stop fighting me. Just let this happen.

滚开啊
Get off of me!

*美丽家园阿拉巴马*
*Sweet home Alabama*

不要啊 住手 求求你
No! Stop! Please!

别这么[哔]的风骚啊 你个小[哔]
Stop being such a ** tease, you sweet little **.

不要 住手
No! No!

大家都给我停下
Everybody sto-o-o-p!

看过来
Look at me!

我的兄弟们啊 在这里流血起不到任何作用
My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood.

请求不被满足我们是不会死去的
None of us can die until our job is done.

这个请求根本无法满足
The job can't be done!

我们不可能帮他减去两杆
We'll never get two strokes off his game!

我们不能
No, we won't.

但是我们可以帮他减掉所有的杆数
But we will get all strokes off his game.

- 他想到哪里去了  - 他什么意思
- Where's he going with this? - What's he mean?

在他生命终止的那一刻
When we kill him.

Jerry 或许是时候 我去参加那个我一直向往的旅行了
Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.

你要去哪里
Where would you go?

不是道 意大利 希腊 阿根廷
I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.

这些国家的男人性欲都很旺盛呢
Countries known for their sexually aggressive men.

我和你说过 其实我很喜欢你的新发型吗
Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?

我靠 发生什么事了
What the heck?

他在那里
There he is!

快逃 Jerry
Run, Jerry!

快出来吧 Jerry
Come on out, Jerry!

我会好好握杆的 我会做好后续打姿的 你们说什么我就做什么
Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?

已经用不着了 Jerry
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

快点 Rick 别拖时间了 你手里啥牌
Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?

看完了就去角落哭吧
Read 'em and weep, fellas!

嘿 Morty
Oh, hey, Morty.

听着 之前说了很多关冒险的坏话 我很抱歉
Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure.

我现在很开心 Morty
I'm havin' a good time, Morty.

其实没有这么糟
It's not so bad.

我们回家吧
Let's just go home, Okay?

我放弃了
I'm calling it.

冒险到此为止
The adventure's over.

我们现在还不能走啊 Morty
We can't leave now, Morty.

我这手气 拦不住啊
I'm on fire!

我现在就想走
Look, I want to leave now.

赌约是你赢了 好嘛
You win the bet, okay?

把传送枪给我 我们走吧
Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please.

求求你了 我只想回家
Please, I just want to go home.

听着Morty 我刚刚赢了一堆傻屌
Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

我们用25傻屌让顺滑小阶梯载我们回去
Why don't we use 25 of them to pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village,

然后把剩余的傻屌给村民怎么样
and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

真的嘛
Really?

真的 Morty
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

好的冒险需要一个好的结局
You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.

坐稳咯
Buckle up!

使命必达先生来到这个世界上不是为了寻求意义的 Jerry
Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!

我们的存在只为了满足一个愿望
We are created to serve a singular purpose

为了实现这个愿望我们可以不择手段
for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!

存在于世上对我们来说是痛苦的 Jerry
Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

我们为了减去痛苦可以不择手段 就问...
And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask...

你叫什么 女士
What's your name, ma'am?

Samantha 求求你 先生 他要什么就给他吧
S-samantha. Please, Mister! Give him what he wants!

无辜的人要因我而死了
Innocent people are going to die because of me.

我为什么就这么平庸呢
Why am I so mediocre?

Jerry 转身 挺背
Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back.

弯膝 弯下去
Bend your knees. Bend them.

肩膀往后 深吸一口气
Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath.

我爱你
I love you.

我数到三 Jerry
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

这[哔]的是在搞什么
What the f**k is going on?

他成功了
He's got it!

这一下能减不少差点了
Th-th-that's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!

不好意思 但是我是个比较顽固的使命必达先生
Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks.

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?

天哪 天哪 我的天哪
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?!

喔 好棒
Ooh, nice!

我觉得我们还是打包就好
I think we'll take our food to go.

想都别想
No, you won't.

警察要来了 你有很多问题得慢慢回答呢
The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.

好吧
Fair enough.

谢谢你 好心的先生 我们的村子有救了
Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved!

你们可真是真英雄啊
You are both true heroes!

好样的 Morty 看来赌约是你赢了
Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.

谢啦 Rick 但我也不知道其实该不该赢呢
Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should.

其实关于宇宙的看法你是对的
You know, you were right about the universe.

真是疯狂而混乱啊
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

所以每过一段时间就得清扫一下嘛
Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know.

这次的冒险这么棒 是因为我们是按Morty的方式来的呀
This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.

英雄们 我希望把你们介绍给我们的国王
Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved King

好让他亲自感谢你们
so that he may thank you personally.

呃 其实不用了啦
Uh, no, i-it's cool.

Rick 传送门 快
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

所以 你还在考虑去旅行吗
So... You still thinking about taking that trip?

Jerry 听着
Jerry, look.

虽然我们的婚姻不完美 但是我哪里也不会去的
We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere.

我们在那冷藏室里的时候
When we were in that freezer,

我意识到那些使命必达先生就和我高中时候的男生一样
I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with.

为了完成自己的"使命"说什么都愿意
Willing to say anything to "complete their task."

我也是其中一员嘛
Was I one of those guys?

区别就在于你没有消失
The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.

那是因为 我害你怀孕了嘛
Well... I got you pregnant.

是啊
Yeah...

这是怎么回事
What the hell happened to this place?

你的使命必达盒子
Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.

他们因为减不掉Jerry的两杆崩溃了
They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.

他可内疚了
He felt terrible.

Jerry智商低又不是我的问题
Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.

爸 你有什么能帮忙清理这里的东西嘛
Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?

我有一个清理必备盒子
Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.

不行 不能再用盒子了
No. No more boxes.

什么嘛 盒子里就一个拖把和地板蜡
What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it.

Wubba lubba dub dubs
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

这是我的新台词
Yeah! That's my new thing!

就像那个 叫Arsenio的家伙
I'm kind of like what's his name Ar-arsenio.

Arsenio Hall 美国喜剧演员

这就是Arsenio在台节目里经常说的
Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show.

Wobble gobba lop bops对吧
Wobble gobba lop bops! Right?

大家 我们下周再见
See you next week, everybody.

笑点完全没有懂
I don't get it.

先生 你得看看这个
Sir, I think you're going to want to see this.

我们在软豆国王衣橱里的保险柜找到了这个
We found it inside a lockbox inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

我们应该把这事公布于众
We have to tell the people.

等等 还是毁掉吧
Wait. Destroy it.

对人民而言 更有意义的是他所代表的价值和理念
Our people will get more from the idea he represented

而不是他的真实面貌
than from the Jelly Bean he actually was.

我是阴道校长 别被我的名字骗了
Principal Vagina here don't let the name fool you.

我在此提醒你们
I'm very much in charge reminding you

今晚是我们的年度流感舞会
that tonight is our annual flu season dance.

我不知道这句话还要说几遍
I don't know how many times I have to say this,

得了流感的同学请待在家里
but if you have the flu, stay home.

嗨
Hey.

举办流感舞会是为了提高防范意识 不是为了庆祝
The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration.

不会有人带着死掉的婴儿过逾越节
you don't bring dead babies to passover.

犹太教逾越节的传说中上帝杀死了埃及所有头胎的牲畜和婴儿

好吧 加油
okay. Here we go.

嗨 Jessica
H-hey, Jessica. Uh...

怎么了 Morty
What's up, Morty?

你想干嘛
what are you doing?

呃
um...

慢着 你不会是打算和她说话吧
Wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her?

我是想来着
well... I mean, I was thinking about it.

哥们儿 别瞎想了
Dude, stay in your league.

瞧她多美
Look at how hot she is.

你也没见我跑到更有钱的片区里更大的学校
You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district

去泡那儿最漂亮的妹子吧
and hitting on their prettiest girl.

噢 谢谢 Brad
Gee, thanks, Brad.

这些傻屌别想靠近你
I throw balls far.

想听好听的 去谈个话家啊(并没有languaer这个词)
You want good words? Date a languager.

别多想 Morty
try not to worry about it, Morty.

你是个好孩子 虽然现在还没有什么优势
You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now,

但等Brad发福以后 你就也能找到妹子啦
but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.

爸 你搞错重点了
You're missing the point, dad.

我不要妹子 我要Jessica
I don't want girls. I want Jessica.

我以前也对某个人有过这样的感觉呢
ah, well, I remember feeling that way about

这个人叫做"你妈"
a young lady named "Your mom,"

这不是在骂人啊
And that's not an urban diss.

你妈妈就是我的Jessica
Your mom was my Jessica.

我还记得我第一次看到她的时候 我就在想
I remember the first time I saw her. I thought

"把她搞怀孕 她就得嫁给我了"
"I should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me."

Rick 你这话不太合适吧
I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate.

抱歉 请接着讲
Sorry, please proceed with your story

你高中时候搞我女儿的事迹吧
about banging my daughter in high school.

感情方面的事儿你最好别听他的 Morty
I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

他的婚姻已经悬于一线了
His marriage is hanging from a thread.

我的婚姻好的很 谢谢你啊
My marriage is fine, thank you.

Jerry 这儿是你家
Jerry, it's your house

你说是什么就是什么吧
whatever you say it is is how it is

但我觉得瞎子都能看出来
but I think a blind man could see that

Beth想结束这段婚姻
Beth is looking for the door.

这事儿我根本不在乎 也都发现了
I barely have a reason to care, and even I noticed.

Rick 别这样说我的父母啊
Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.

听着 Morty 我也不想这么直白地告诉你
Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you,

但所谓的爱情
but what people call "Love"

不过是让动物繁衍后代的化学反应罢了
Is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

开始时让人头昏脑热 然后就慢慢消退
It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades,

只留给你一段失败的婚姻
leaving you stranded in a failing marriage.

我是这样
I did it.

你父母也会是这样
Your parents are gonna do it.

别重蹈覆辙 Morty
Break the cycle, Morty.

升华自我 专注科学
Rise above. Focus on science.

好吧 我去换舞会的衣服了
All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.

我去 看看你妈妈
Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom.

Morty 把螺丝刀递给我
Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?

我的离子除颤器就要完成了
I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

会很棒的
It's gonna be great.

那个 Rick
Hey, listen, Rick.

你之前不是说
Y-y-you know how you said that,

爱情是一种化学反应什么的嘛
you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?

我在想
Well, I was thinking, you know,

你能不能让Jessica的脑子里
w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing

起点什么化学反应
happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know,

让她爱上我什么的
so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing?

比如什么爱情药水之类的东西
You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something?

完全是浪费我的时间
Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.

我不屑做这种事
It's beneath me.

把螺丝刀递给我
Hand me the screwdriver.

不 Rick
you know what? No, Rick!

别想我把螺丝刀递给你
I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.

别想我再给你递任何东西
I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick!

我老是帮你做这个帮你做那个
I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing.

那那那那我呢 Rick
W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick?

你怎怎怎么就不能帮我一次呢 就一次
W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once, for once?

你还真是长大了啊 Morty
You're growing up fast, Morty.

已经长成一个烦人的大麻烦了
You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.

这个叫后叶催产素
listen, this is called oxytocin.

我从田鼠的身体里提取的
I extracted it from a vole.

知道田鼠吗 Morty
Do you know what a vole is, Morty?

知道不
You know what a vole is?

一种会结为终生伴侣的啮齿动物
It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty.

这是在哺乳动物大脑里分泌的一种激素
This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know,

让它坠入爱河
that makes it fall in love.

Morty 我只需要把它和你的DNA混合起来
All right, Morty, I just got to combine it with some of your DNA.

噢 好的
oh, well, okay.

一根头发就行 Morty
a hair, Morty.

就要一根头发
I need one of your hairs.

又不是《权利的游戏》(大尺度剧集)
This isn't "Game of thrones."

好了 Morty
all right, Morty.

只要你把这个抹在别人身上
Whoever you smear this stuff on

这人就会爱上你 永远只爱你一个
will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.

开心了 Morty
Are you happy now, Morty?

恩
heck, yeah!

谢谢 Rick外公
Thank you, grandpa Rick.

没有什么危险或者副作用吧
Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right?

你当我是什么二流科学家吗
w-w-w-what am I, a hack?

放心吧 Morty 绝对安全
Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof.

除非她得了流感
Eh, unless she has the flu.

Beth 你还爱我吗
Beth, do y-you still love me?

这算是什么问题
ugh, what kind of question is that?

"爱"或者"不爱"的问题
the "Yes or no" kind?

Jerry 你会想让流浪汉有房子住吗
Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

想啊
yes.

那你会给他们修房子吗
Are you gonna build them?

不会
no.

那一个肯定的回答又有什么意义呢
Then what good was the "Yes"?

等等 "爱我" 是房子还是流浪汉
wait, I-is loving me the house or the homeless people?

"爱你"是辛苦的劳动
loving you is work, Jerry.

是给流浪汉修收容所的过程
Hard work, like building a homeless shelter

没有人"想"说不
nobody wants to say no to doing it

但总有人要付出努力
but some people put the work in.

所以你说呢
So, what do you say?

你觉得我有在努力吗
Do you see me working here?

我觉得这对话无聊吗
Does this conversation seem tedious to me?

算是吧
Sort of.

那明显我也算是爱你的
Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I?

所以别问了 说不定我会更爱你一点
So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more.

靠 我得去趟马医院
Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.

都这个点了
Puh! This late?

赛马场搞了场夜间德比赛
The racetrack had a starlight derby.

有七匹马撞上了
There was a seven-horse collision,

Davin一个人在那儿
and Davin's there alone.

Davin
Davin.

*流感 唷*

嗨 Jessica
hey, there, Jessica.

哦 抱歉
Whoa! Oh, whoopsie!

天啊 Morty
Oh, my god. Morty.

你今晚真帅啊
You look really nice tonight.

谢谢
Wow, thanks.

我爱你 Morty
I love you, Morty!

我爱你爱到心如火烧
I love you so much, it burns!

天啊
Oh, man!

我也爱你 Jessica
I-I love you too, Jessica!

这傻逼在骚扰你吗 Jessica
Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?

滚开 混球
Leave him alone, Jerk!

我爱他
I'm in love with him!

你永远不可能像他这么男人
He is more man than you will ever be!

*要小心流感*
*This is about flu awareness*

*小心空气中的流感*
*got to be aware of the flu in the air-ness*

*我乃反流感饶舌歌手*
*yo, I'm a flu-hating rapper *

啊 Morty
oh, man, Morty.

真对不起
I'm really sorry.

没事的 Brad
oh, well, n-no problem, Brad.

你很特别 Morty 非常特别
There's something special about you, Morty, so special.

哇 你干嘛
Whoa, take it easy!

别碰他
Get your hands off of him!

滚开 我要和我男人在一起
Back off! I'm trying to be with my man!

够了 Bradley
That's enough, Bradley!

别把你拿来赶走傻屌(投球)的手弄伤了
We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.

阴道校长
Oh principal Vagina.

永远别离开我 Morty
Never leave me, Morty.

永远
Never!

好啊
Hh, sure.

我当然不会离开你
I mean, o-of course not.

你觉得刚才那是怎么回事
W-what do you think that was all about?

管他呢 快抱住我
Who cares? Just hold me.

放开我 我爱你 Morty
Let me go! I love you, Morty!

放开我
let go of me!

Morty
Morty!

她一晚上都要和那人待一起
she's gonna be alone with that guy all night.

在马身体里捣来捣去
yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses.

不是什么浪漫的场景啊
It's not a very romantic setting.

Summer 说不好啊
well, Summer, there's always the possibility

搞不好加班这个事儿就是她编的呢
that she made the whole work thing up.

说不定现在Davin正在她身体里捣来捣去呢
Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.

外公 这太恶心了
Grandpa, so gross!

你说的是我妈妈
You're talking about my mom.

她是我女儿
Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

我辈分比你高
I outrank you.

亲属关系根本没有意义 所以别跟我来这套
Or family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.

她不回我短信
she's not responding to my texts!

小心啊 爸
Careful, dad.

嫉妒会让女人失去兴致的
Jealousy turns women off.

那不是正好吗
Well, isn't that convenient?

被她们劈腿的男人的嫉妒是没用的
Not for the men they cheat on, no.

好吧 我要出去 买点冰激凌
okay, I'm... going to go out... for some ice cream.

可能顺路去趟医院 看看我的老婆
And maybe stop by the hospital... to support my wife...

不带一点怀疑
with my confidence.

天啊 外公 你真是个混蛋
God, grandpa, you're such a dick.

抱歉 Summer
I'm sorry, Summer.

你怎么想我一点都不在乎
Your opinion means very little to me.

你怎么没去那个
How come you're not at this

人人爱的傻舞会呢
stupid dance everyone loves so much?

我才不去 我不要被传染
Screw that. I don't want to get sick.

现在是流感季节
It's flu season.

是吗
It is?

是啊
yeah.

啊噢
uh-oh.

千万别出什么岔子啊
Please just let this work out.

来吧 Morty 来吧
Do it, Morty. Do it.

把我的衣服撕开 和我结为终生伴侣吧
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!

咱能去个隐蔽点的地方吗
Can we maybe go somewhere more private?

Jessica 控制一下自己
Jessica, get a hold of yourself!

你不配得到Morty的基因
you don't deserve to carry morty's genes.

*我爱Morty*
*I love Morty *

*但愿他也爱我*
*and I hope Morty loves me *

*我想抱着他*
*I'd like to wrap my arms around him*

*让他进入我的身体*
*and feel him inside me*

我靠
oh, crap.

Morty
Morty!

Morty 快来
Morty, come on!

我们快走
We got to get you out of here.

通常来说这种事是不会发生的
You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens

但我确实犯了个错
but I made a mistake.

快跑 Morty
Come on, Morty.

咱们赶紧出去
We got to get out of here. Come on.

Morty
Morty!

你没事吧
Are you okay?

我没事
I'm fine!

太好了
Oh, good.

要是你出了什么事 我也活不下去了
If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.

我爱死你了 莫莫
I love you bad, mo-mo!

Morty 校长和我商量过了
Morty, the principal and I have discussed it,

我们都对自己没什么把握
a-a-and we're both insecure enough

所以只好同意3p了
to agree to a three-way!

我把血清给你的时候
I didn't realize when I gave you that serum

不知道Jessica得了流感
that Jessica had the flu

这这这这对我来说可能是
you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have

非常有用的信息好吗 Morty
been valuable information for me, Morty.

这到底是怎么回事 Rick
What the hell is going on, Rick?

看着像是怎么回事
What does it look like?

血清借助病毒
T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus.

变得能通过空气传播了
It's gone airborne, Morty.

妈啦 怎么办啊 Rick
oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?

没事的 Morty 放心
It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.

我赶制了解药
I whipped up an antidote.

我用了螳螂的DNA
It's based on praying-mantis DNA.

螳螂完全和田鼠相反
You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.

它们只交配一次
I mean, they they mate once,

然后就把交配对象的头砍掉
and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.

它们的习性就是这样
I mean, it's a whole ritual.

非常残忍 和田鼠完全相反
It's really gruesome and totally opposite.

完全没有爱可言
There's no love at all.

我加入了一种更具传染性的流感病毒
I-I-I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.

应该就能中和掉之前的血清了
It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.

这事儿很快就能结束了
It'll all be over very shortly.

对了 Morty
Uh, by the way, Morty,

虽然你没问
I know you didn't ask or anything,

但我一点都不想和你发生性关系
but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

这血清对和你有血缘的人是没用的
These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.

好吧 有时候
Okay, well, sometimes,

用科学怎么能理解科学这门艺术
Science is more art than science, Morty.

很多人就是不明白
A lot of people don't get that.

靠 开什么玩笑
Come on. Are you kidding me?

有人吗
Hello!

Morty
Morty!

你不是Morty
You're not Morty!

我们要Morty
Bring us Morty!

在我成功捉奸以前 谁也别想干掉我
Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.

我和Billy上床了
I had sex with Billy.

但你当时已经怀孕了啊
But you were already pregnant!

再差又能怎么样呢
Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen?

抱歉打断《孕妇俏佳人》 插播一则新闻
We interrupt "Pregnant baby" with breaking news.

别啊
Come on.

最新消息 Morty Smith仍然去向不明
This just in, Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown.

什么啊这是
What the hell?

目前唯一已知的就是 他有多么可爱
The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.

我爱他 我想和他做爱
I love him so much, I want to make love to him

然后吃掉他的脑袋
and then eat his head.

我比你更爱他 Harold
I love him more than you do, Harold!

想得美 贱人
You wish, you stupid bitch!

Morty是我的
Morty's mine!

Morty是我的
Morty's mine!

Morty在哪儿
Where is Morty?

天啊 Rick
Oh, my god, Rick.

全世界都被感染了
The whole world is infected!

是啊 传播得这么快真是惊人
Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.

我真是超水平发挥
I've really outdone myself.

超水平发挥
Outdone yourself?!

别开玩笑了 Rick
W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick?

这太糟了
This is not okay!

他们不光是都想要和我做爱
Not only do they all want to have sex with me,

现在事后还要把我吃掉
but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!

我也不知道我当时在想什么
Yeah, I don't know what i was thinking.

螳螂和田鼠完全相反
Mantises are they opposite of voles?

显然DNA没这么简单
I mean, Obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that.

不过呢 Morty
You know what, though, Morty?

有了这个 问题马上就能解决了
This right here's gonna do the the trick, baby.

树袋熊混合上 响尾蛇 黑猩猩 仙人掌
It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus,

鲨鱼 金毛犬 加上一点点恐龙
shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.

应该能把他们变回正常人类了
Should add up to normal humanity.

这根本没道理 Rick
I don't, that doesn't make any sense, Rick.

这怎么就能变回正常人类了
How does that add up to normal humanity?

怎么 Morty 你难道还想看我的运算过程吗
What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?

你是科学家
I'm sorry a-are you the scientist

还是想搞妹子的小孩
or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?

救了那些马真是太好了
Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses,

但就这么结束了 让我觉得有些遗憾
but I'm almost sorry we're finished.

是的 这样的工作很让人有满足感
Yes, it's satisfying work.

不不不 不仅仅是工作
Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work.

我喜欢在那间无菌室里
I love being in that sterilized room,

与世隔绝
sealed off from the world.

只有在那里我才能真正思考和感受
It's the only time I can really think... and feel.

你在干嘛
Hmm, uh, what are you doing?

我在放非洲梦幻流行乐
I'm playing African Dream Pop.

这首African Dream Pop是一首确实存在的remix作品 在Youtube上可以找到 其中许多素材来自Rick and Morty

辛苦工作一晚之后你会做什么呢
What do youdo after a long night?

啊 呃 我得走了
Oh, ha, um, hey, I-b-I'd better get going.

Jerry一直在给我发一些很不好应付的短信
Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.

Beth
Beth...

干嘛 Davin
What is it, Davin?

就这一次 我想知道
Just once, I'd like to know

给你的儿子洗澡是什么感觉
...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.

啥
what?!

Morty闻起来是什么味道
What does Morty's skin smell like?

他的小弟弟有多么柔软
How soft... how soft are his privates?

放开我 Davin
let go of me, Davin!

带我去找Morty
Take me to Morty.

你不是Morty
You're not Morty.

没错
No.

我是撬棍先生 这是我的朋友
I'm Mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend,

也是一根撬棍
who is also a crowbar.

这好蠢啊
That's... stupid.

是吗
Yeah?

看看聪明的下场吧
Well, look where being smart got you.

Jerry 感谢上帝
Jerry! Thank god!

上帝
God?

上帝把人变成了昆虫怪 Beth
God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth.

把它们打死的人是我
I'm the one beating them to death.

感谢我吧
Thank me.

谢谢你 Jerry
Thank you, Jerry.

谢谢
Thank you.

往下看 Morty 欣赏一会儿
Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in,

只要我拉动这个开关 一切就恢复原状了
because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.

快动手吧
Just do it already.

Morty 没什么好急的
Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.

只要恢复了 一切就结束了
I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done.

这事儿就解决了
It's fixed.

我们可以稍微欣赏一会儿嘛
You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.

看看这场面 多疯狂
I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.

Morty 下一次
I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time

你想看到这样的东西得等到什么时候了
you're gonna see something like this?

好好享受一会儿
I mean, soak it in, you know?

多棒阿
It's it's pretty neat.

多有趣啊
It's pretty interesting.

够了 Rick 我要拉开关了
That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.

结果怎么样啊 Morty
W-what do we have here, Morty?

看来是我是对的 你错了
Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?

你现在肯定觉得自己很蠢吧
I-I-I-I-I-I-I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?

你现在肯定惭愧得不行吧
I-I-I bet you feel like the world's smallest man

之前还怀疑我 Morty
that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.

不 Rick 有什么不对
Oh, Rick, something's not right.

不就是你吗
Yeah, you.

- 你从来就没对过  - 不 不是
- You're not right, ever. - No, no!

快看 你这个白痴
Look, you idiot!

高兴了吧 Morty
Bet you're loving this, Morty.

今天肯定是你人生中最美好的一天
This must be the best day of your life.

跟你说了让你别着急
You get to be the mayor of I-told-you town.

不用谢
You're welcome.

抓稳了
Hold on.

真希望这把猎枪是我的大屌
I wish that shotgun was my penis.

叫我海明威(用猎枪自杀)
If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.

我没听懂 我也不用听懂
I don't get it, and I don't need to.

妈 爸
Mom! Dad!

Summer
Summer!

Morty在哪儿
Where's Morty?

我不知道
I don't know.

你觉得Rick外公和这有关吗
Do you think Grandpa Rick had something to do with this?

这么想不太公平吧 Summer
It's not fair to assume that, Summer.

不公平
Oh, not fair?

算了吧
Give me a break.

他就是个自私 不负责任的混蛋 他还离开了我母亲
He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.

真男人会守在他的女人身边
A real man stands by his woman.

Morty 我把世界搞得好像柯南伯格的电影一样
Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't I?

大卫 柯南伯格 加拿大籍导演 擅拍惊悚电影 其不少作品涉及人体变异 如《狂犬病》 《变蝇人》

整个地球上都是柯南伯格式的生物
We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.

不过至少他们不再疯狂地爱你了
A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though.

这算是一大进步了
That's a huge step in the right direction.

天 这简直就是活生生的噩梦
Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare!

你怎么能这么不负责任呢 Rick
How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?

我不负责任
me irresponsible?!

我只是想让你给我递一把螺丝刀而已
You, all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!

是你想让我抛开别的
You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down

给你弄什么迷奸血清
and make you up a... roofie-juice serum

好让你去迷奸你那可怜的同学
so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.

你开什么玩笑 Morty
I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty?

你还想抢占道德制高点
You're gonna try to take the high road on this one?

你就是个小变态 Morty
Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty.

你你你你你就是个猥琐的小变态
Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person.

好吧
All right, fine.

你之前拒绝帮我做血清的时候 我就该听你的
I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.

我愿意承担我这部分的责任 Rick
I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.

但是我告诉你
But I'll tell you something you know what?

你也得承认你的那部分责任
You got to accept your part of the blame!

又不是我搞砸了血清的事
I'm not the one who fouled up the serum!

又不是我
I'm not the one who who who who

把一堆乱七八糟的鬼东西混在一起
haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense

弄出了一堆柯南伯格怪
together and created a bunch of cronenbergs!

- 你得解决这事儿 Rick  - 好吧 好吧 Morty
- You got to fix this, Rick! - All right, all right, Morty.

现在这个情况已经很难挽回了
You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here,

不过我确实有个应急方案
but I do have one emergency solution that I can use

能让一切相对而言恢复正常
that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.

Morty 把这个带上
Here, Morty, put this on

我来搜索一下
while I do a little bit of scouting.

每日时报

基因传染病

已被阻止

哇 Rick 我得说
Wow, Rick, I got to say

你这次真是太厉害了
you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.

我真以为
I mean, I-I really thought that

这儿会永远一团乱下去了
the whole place was gonna be messed up for good,

但你做到了
but here you did it

你一如既往地想出了个疯办法
you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.

真是太走运了
That's some great luck.

得了吧 Morty 跟运气没关系
Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it.

靠的是我的实力
I'm great. That's the real reason.

怎么说 Morty
Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?

能把螺丝刀递给我
Will you hand me a screwdriver

让我完成我的离子除颤器吗
so I can finish my ionic de-defibulizer?

当然 Rick
Sure thing, Rick.

给你
Here's a screwdriver.

好了 Morty
All right, Morty.

谢谢你
Thank you very much.

拧一下
We got one screw turn...

拧两下
and two screw turns... and...

好了 Morty 我们到了
All right, Morty, here we are.

天啊 Rick 那是我们吗
Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?!

我我我我们死了
W-w-w-we're dead!

怎么回事 Rick
What is going on, Rick?

我要崩溃了
I'm freaking out!

冷静点 Morty
Calm down, Morty!

看着我 冷静 Morty
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

- 不行 我接受不了  - 冷静下来 Morty
- No, I can't deal with this! - Calm yourself, Morty.

- 这种事我受不了 Rick  - 冷静 Morty
- I can't deal with this, Rick! - Calm down, Morty.

- 骗人的吧  - 冷静下来 Morty
- This can't be real!  - You got to calm down, Morty.

我我我我们被炸碎了
W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!

闭上嘴听我说
Shut up and listen to me!

没事的
It's fine. Everything is fine.

有无数个平行的现实 Morty
There's an infinite number of realities, Morty

在一小部分平行世界里 我运气好
and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky

让一切恢复了原状
and turned everything back to normal.

我只需要找到其中某一个世界
I just had to find one of those realities

我们俩刚好在这段时间里死了
in which we also happen to both die around this time.

现在我们只需要悄悄取代
Now we can just slip into the place of

这个世界里死掉的自己 就没问题了
our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.

就和什么都没发生过一样 Morty
We're not skipping a beat, Morty.

来帮我搬下尸体
Now, help me with these bodies.

这太疯狂了
This is insane.

Morty 我搬我自己
Look, Morty, I'll grab myself,

你搬你自己 行吗
you grab yourself, okay?

我觉得这样挺公平的
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me, I mean,

这样分配很合理
that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.

那我们以前的世界呢
Rick, what about the reality we left behind?

那Hilter找了治愈癌症方法的世界呢 Morty
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?

最好的办法就是别去想
The answer is don't think about it.

反正这种办法也不是每周都能用
It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.

最多就用个三四次
We get three or four more of these, tops.

把你自己的尸体搬起来
Now, pick up your dead self and come on.

欲速则不达
Haste makes waste.

虽然我觉得你没注意到这个细节
I-I-I don't suppose you've considered this detail,

但很显然 如果我没把一切都搞砸的话
but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did

我们现在就是死人了 再说一次 不用谢
we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.

《Look On Down from the Bridge》 Mazzy Star

鲨鱼这种动物
You know, the thing about a shark...

有一双毫无生气的眼睛
he's got lifeless eyes...

黑黑的眼睛 像木偶的眼睛一样
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

它朝你冲过来的时候 浑然不似活物
When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living

直到它咬住你 接着就是血
until he bites ya, and then the the blood,

鲜红的 还有水里...
and the red, and the water...

你有想过Rick和Morty怎么样了吗
You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?

有时候吧
Sometimes.

这么说好像有点对不起他们
But, I'm ashamed to admit,

但他们走了以后 我终于过得幸福了
now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.

我们到啦 柯南伯格Morty
Here we are, cronenberg Morty

一个所有人都被柯南伯格化了的世界
a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.

我们来了正好呢 柯南伯格Morty
We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.

就和我们从来没离开过柯南伯格世界一样
It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.

是啊 柯南伯格Rick
Yeah, cronenberg Rick,

但我还是会想念柯南伯格世界的
but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world,

因为大家都是柯南伯格版的
because everyone was cronenberged

和我们一样 从一开始就是
all along like us from the beginning, you know?

要是我们没有把
I mean, I-I wish we hadn't genetically ruined

柯南伯格世界基因毁灭掉就好了
cronenberg world  beyond repair like we did,

把所有人都变成了正常的人类
you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.

别担心这种事了 柯南伯格Morty
Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.

咱们就在这儿舒舒服服过吧
Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?

我才不会花70丁丁买一个坏掉的反定帆器
Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator.

这是多相量子共振器
That is multiphase quantum resonator.

- 那它能反定帆吗  - [哔]不能
- Well, does it defraculate? - [Bleep]No.

那不就是个坏掉的反定帆器吗
Then-then-then it's a broken defraculator.

你懂个鸡巴的定帆啊
Like you would even know dick about fraculation.

你们的星球只有手机 信号还这么烂
Your planet just got cellphones, and the coverage still sucks!

你们的人还吃硫呢
Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

就60丁丁了
So let's say 60 smidgens.

算我帮你个忙
I tell you what, I'll do you a favor

我附赠你个屁(硫化氢)
I'll throw in a fart.

Rick 你能不能给我
Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think maybe I could

买件这里的东西啊
get something from this place

就一件纪念品嘛 单纯为了收藏 比如什么酷酷的东西
like, like a souvenir, like just to have like something cool, you know?

这儿就算了 Morty 我们去别的地方
Not here Morty, we'll stop somewhere else

反正哪里都有当铺
because, you know, there's always another pawn shop.

我就是觉得 那边那个机器人
Oh okay, I just, um, you know, that robot over there

看着好酷啊
looked pretty cool, you know?

看着酷是吗
Oh, it looks cool, huh?

因为酷你才想买
That's why you want it?

是啊 跟地球上的东西很不相同嘛
Yeah! You know, I mean it's different from the stuff on Earth,

你带着我跑遍了银河系里面这么多疯狂的地方
and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy,

我都没有什么东西
and, you know, I don't really have anything to,

能纪念这些冒险啊
to remember all the trips by.

这不是挺酷的吗 一个纪念品
It'd be kind of cool, like a souvenir.

万一你去世了什么的怎么办
You know, like, what if you passed away or died or something?

都没有什么东西
I wouldn't even have anything to

能让我缅怀那些酷炫的经历呢
remember all the cool stuff we did, you know?

好吧 共振器我出60
Okay. 60 for the resonator,

外加我外孙想要的那个性爱机器人
and my grandson wants the sex robot.

我们是要假装什么也不知道吗
So, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening?

我不是说这样不好 只是问问而已
I'm not saying that a bad idea, just asking.

Rick 你怎么能让Morty把那东西带回家呢
Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house.

你指望我能干嘛
What do you want form me?

他觉觉觉觉得那东西看着很酷
He thi-, he thou-, he thou-, he th-, he thought it looked cool.

你懂我意思吗
You know what I mean.

呼 啊 好了 接着 回楼上
Whew. Ahh. All right. Back to-, b-back upstair.

不行 我要干预这事
Well, I'm invervening.

干预青春期行为吗
Intervening with puberty?

你会把他变成《红龙》里的拉尔夫费因斯的
You'll turn him into Ralph Fiennes in "Red Dragon."

《红龙》是汉尼拔系列小说中的第一部 后改编为电影 拉尔夫费因斯在其中饰演童年不幸的变态连环杀手"牙仙"

他到了这个年纪了
He's just at that age.

我们为他骄傲就好了
Let's just be proud of him.

天啊 我把标准降到这么低了吗
Jesus. Did I really set the bar that low?

呃 Rick 你能来一下吗 快点
Um, Rick, could you come with me, please, quickly?

如果再听到嘎吱声 我们就干预
Ok, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene.

性爱机器人呢 Morty
Where's the sex robot, Morty?

那就是Gwendolyn 我是说 机器人
That is Gwendolyn. I-I mean, the robot!

她发出了哔哔声 然后变形试图飞走
She started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away!

真奇怪 这一般是男人才会干的事啊
Strange. That's usually the man's job.

知道我什么意思吧 Morty
You know what I'm talking about, Morty?

Wubba lubba dub dub
Wubba lubba dub dub！

Morty 这是我的口头禅 还记得吗
Morty, that's my catchphrase, remember?

还记得我怎么拼出这个口头禅的吗
Remember how-how I cemented that catchphrase?

好吧好吧 不开玩笑了
All right. All ritht, seriously, though.

让我来抓住它
Let me grab this thing.

够了 你这个小淘气
Come on, you... rascal.

这就过分了 噢
Okay, unacceptable! Oh

出什么事了
What is going on?

好吧 啊噢
All right. Uh-oh.

啥叫"啊噢" 那是个啥
"Uh-Oh"? What is that?!

看来Morty的机器人不只是用来打发时间的
Hmm. I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends.

基因编译装置 孵化室
Genetic compiler, incubation chamber.

没错 这是个造娃机
Yep. This, here's some kind of baby maker,

这是个一半Morty一半不知道啥的东西
and that there's half Morty, half who-who knows wh-what?

是我造成的
It's my bad, guys.

我会处理掉的
I'll, I'll take care of it.

- Rick外公  -  不行  - 哇哦
- Grandpa Rick! - No, no! - Whoa whoa whoa!

你这是要干嘛
What do you think you're doing?!

Summer从墨西哥带橄榄回来的时候
Hey, listen. You guys quarantined the house

你们把房子都隔离起来了
when summer brought olives back from Mexico.

这东西说不定能长到特拉华州那么大
I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware.

这东西指不定还会吃脑子呼出宇宙艾滋呢
I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space AIDS.

我们必须得小心
We got to be careful.

该小心的时候我没小心 现在已经没机会了 Rick
I lost the chance to be careful, Rick.

我当爸爸了
I'm a father now!

我该负起责任了
You know, it's time for me to be responsible.

对不对呀
Isn't that right...

别取名字
Don't name it.

小Morty
...Morty Jr.?

靠 取了个名字
Oh， Crap. He named it.

爸 这是个小生命 而且有一半是人类
Well, dad, it's a living thing, and it's half human.

而且它是出生在美国领土上的 所以
And it was born on american soil, which entitles it to...

Jerry 主修公民学是你自己的错
Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake.

别用它来惩罚我们好吗
Don't punish us for it.

好吧 我把这东西带回我的工作间去
Fine. I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop

做点调查
and do a little bit of investigating.

别让这东西离开你们的视线
Do not let that thing out of your sight.

现在看着人畜无害 但以后可能会变得很危险
It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.

就像疯狂小丑波塞一样
Like the Insane Clown Posse.

Insane Clown Posse 美国嘻哈组合

呵呵 这笑话真不错 Jerry
Yeah. Good one, Jerry.

此处指的可能是2003年Blink 182的单曲Easy Target

2003年打电话来把Easy Target要回去
2003 just called and wants its Easy Target back.

他就像是个小版的我
Ohh. He's like a little me!

你们不会真认为他会变成一个怪物的 对吧
Y-you don't think he'll turn into a monster... do you?

孩子都会变成怪物的
They always do.

嘿 1995年打电话来了
Hey, uh, 1995 called!

他们想把"某年打电话来把某东西要回去的句式要回去"
They want their "cartain year called wanting its 'blank' back" formula back!

何必呢 Jerry 何必要费力做这种事
Why, Jerry? why expend the effort?

活着就要费力 生命不息 奋斗不止
Life is effort. I'll stop when I die!

出去
Out.

你干嘛呢
Whatcha doin'?

我没法用我的办法解决这事
Well, I can't solve the problem my way,

多亏了你家里人原始的生物学考虑
thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups.

恶 我好像碰到了一点Morty的精液
Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads.

但说不能我可以给小Morty找到合适的父母
But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr.

在这个机器人的故乡 也就是
on this robot's home world, which is...

仙女座星系的格索尔帕索普星
Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system.

闪开 Summer
Scoot, Summer.

你不需要新的小伙伴吗
Don't you need a new companion

既然现在Morty需要顾家了
now that Morty's in the family way?

我不和小女生出去冒险 Summer
I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer.

哦是吗 两腿中间有根东西
Oh, right. Because there's something about having a wiener

穿个传送门都要强些吗
that would make me better at walking through a hole?

啊啊啊啊
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

该死
Oh, crap.

Rick外公
Grandpa Rick! Ugh!

救命 救命 啊
Help! Help! Aah! Aah!

啊
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Rick外公
Grandpa Rick!

还觉得两腿中间没根东西就穿过传送门是个好主意吗
Still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?

我想回家
I want to go home.

哦 你现在当然想了
Yeah, no duh.

好极了 我现在得拿下整个星球
Great. Now I have to take over a whole planet

就因为你胸前那玩意儿
because of your stupid boobs.

干得很好啊 Morty
You're doing great, Morty

是吗 我也没在干什么呀
Really? You think? I mean, I'm not doing much of anything.

他要是哭我怎么办啊
What do I do if it cries?

那就把他放在边上让他哭个够啊
Then you put it down and let if cry itself out.

这招我们在Summer身上试过
Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer,

然后她就开始脱衣了
and she's gonna end up stripping.

她是不是这样的啊 没错
Isn't she? Yes, she is.

为了吸引我们的注意 她会脱衣服
She's gonna strip for attention.

因为我们不许她这样做
Because she was denied it.

别用你自己缺乏安全感的方式教宝宝
Stop filling it with your own insecurity.

你会把他养成另一个Morty 呃
You're gonna turn it into Morty- uh, um

跟 跟 跟你自己一样
more- more- more of you.

又不是谁都是被心理不正常的科学家像冷血的爬行动物一样养大的
Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist.

搞什么 啊 啊
What the aah! Aah!

听着 你现在的表现是得不到奖励的
Listen to me. I'm not rewarding this behavior.

你们够了 把他给我
Knock if off, both of you! G-give me him!

把我的宝宝给我
Give me my baby!

你们都是疯子
You're both nuts.

我要自己教小Morty
I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself!

*小手在哪里*
*Where's your hands*

*小手在这里*
*There's your hands*

*我们来玩挥挥手*
*And that's how we play handy hands*

你会毁了这个孩子的 Morty
Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty.

至少我们在这点上达成了共识
At least we can agree on that.

谢谢 蠢蠢
Thanks, Dum-Dum.

我说"谢谢 蠢蠢"
I said, "Thanks, Dum-Dum."

再多弄点来
Go get more.

Summer 把你的罩袍穿上
Summer, put your burka on!

这罩袍简直就是侵犯人权
That burka is a human-rights violation,

而且这件上衣花了我不少钱的
and I spend a lot on this top.

我在用一堆性爱娃娃的零件修传送枪
Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts,

而且我还只能用一只手
and I have to do it one-handed

不然这些Belushi就会把你抓走
to keep these Belushis from carting you off.

此处指美国演员Jim Belushi 丹哈蒙非常厌恶他 在Community中也黑过此人

你至少做点贡献 对你的性别感到点惭愧吧
The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.

这地方到底怎么回事
Ugh. What's the deal with this place?

这星球上怎么都是带把儿的
Why is it such a sausage planet,

这些落后的白痴又怎么会造出机器人来的
and how did such backward idiots invent robots?

很显然 在某个时期 这些格索尔帕人 发展到了一定程度
Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved

他们用生育机器取代了女性
that they replaced females with birthing machines.

这样一来 不会被女性分散注意力 也没有唠叨
The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking

让他们专注于战争
allowed them to focus entirely on war,

然后把自己的文明炸回了石器时代
so they bombed themselves back to the stone age,

所以现在他们为了争夺假的[哔]
and now they just fight with each other over fake [Bleep]

整天拿着石头棍子打来打去
with sticks and rocks all day long.

你觉得没有了女性会更有效率
You think it's efficient to get rid of woman?

你见过男厕所门口排队吗
You ever see a line for the men's room?

你听 你有 你明白我的意思吗 Summer
Are you hear- do you li- do you hear me, Summer?

投放
Droppin' loads.

- 投放  - 投放
- Droppin' loads - Droppin' loads

剧情变复杂了啊
The plot thickens.

你还是把眼睛遮住吧 Summer
Uh you might want to cover your eyes, Summer.

好像我多想看似的
Yeah, like it was my dream to watch.

好极了 宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

Summer 抓紧了
Summer, grab- grab hold.

好极了 宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

啊啊
Aaaah!

Rick外公 我们这是去哪啊
Grandpa Rick, where are we going?

显然啊 Summer 看来这个社会的下层阶级
Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society

是被隐藏的统治阶级通过性和高科技控制的
is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class.

听着耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

其实Rick此处提及的是电影《Zardoz》 投放机器人的巨大石人头造型也是出自此电影

票务大师(美国票券经销商)
Ticketmaster

说曹操曹操到 Summer
Oh, there, there we go, Summer.

嘿 哥们儿 兄弟
Hey, hey, brother. Hey, bro.

你们这套好厉害啊
Nice racket you got going on here.

我是来自地球的Rick Sanchez 1-137次元
Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth, dimension c-137.

只有和平的意图 没有任何恶意
Don't mean you any harm. Coming in peace.

挺好的 "邻里和睦"
It's all cool in the, uh- "Good in the neighborhood"

我是想说这个 就这意思
is what I was trying to come- is what I meant.

噢 我懂了 剧情转向了老套的"男人背后都有的"亚马逊人
Oh, I get it. The old behind-every-great-man Amazon twist.

安静
Silence!

希腊神话中的亚马逊人 是骁勇善战的纯女性部族

你的奴隶真是缺少管教
Your slave is ill-mannered.

我的奴隶
My slave?

我们猜你是来自一个落后些的世界
We assume you're from a more primitive world,

男人还被允许作为仆人
where men are still permitted to be servants.

如果他只是个男无赖 说一声
If he is a rogue male, tell us now,

我们现在就杀了他
and we will kill him.

他是我的奴隶 是奴隶 绝对是
He's my slave. He's my slave. He's definitely my slave.

啊 哦哦噢
Ugh! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh!

天啊 这简直是"Wubba lubba dub dub"的反面
Oh, boy. What's the opposite of "Wubba lubba dub dubs"?

对不对 女士们先生们
Am I right, ladies and gentlemen?

这是在逗我吧
Are you guys kidding me?

小Morty
Oh, Morty Jr.!

你是我特别的小家伙 对吧
You're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?

没错 你就是我独一无二的小家伙
You, oh yeah. You're my special little guy.

噢噢 哈哈
Ohh. Ohh, ha ha!

哒
Da.

什么 小Morty
What was that, Morty Jr.?

你是想说爸爸吗
Were you gonna say, "Dada"?

说爸爸
Say, "Dada."

死亡
Death!

爸爸
"Dada."

诅咒
Damnation!

爸爸
Um..."Dada"?

破坏 统治
Destruction. Domination.

好样的
Nice.

C区的蜘蛛还活着
The spider in sector C is still alive.

请据此规划您的行程并做好延误的准备
Plan your route accordingly and expect delays.

我们并不是在告诉您该怎么做
We're not telling you what to do.

我们只是在分享我们的想法
We're just sharing how we feel.

现在播报天气 是只有我 还是其他人也觉得冷
And now weather. Is anyone else cold, or is it just me?

我叫Mar-Sha 格索尔帕索普的统治者
I am Mar-Sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I am here if you need to talk.

这是什么地方
What is this place?

乐土 我们在消极敌对期的时候建造了这个地方
Paradise. We bulit it during the great passive-aggression,

因为他们愈演愈烈的破坏行为
when the females separated from the males

女性脱离了男性
due to their increasingly destructive behavior.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I'm here if you need to talk.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I'm here if you need to talk.

我们从这里将这些代孕机器人投出去
From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates

以维持我们的人口
to maintain our population.

受孕的代孕机会被带回我们的育婴所
Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery.

女性会接受教育
The females are placed into educational programs

让她们能够回馈这片乐土
where they can discover a service to our paradise

同时最大程度地自我实现
that fulfills them most.

至于男性
Males...

他们去外面就好
...they get to play outside.

那还是个婴儿
That was just a baby.

一天之内 他就会长成一个成年的格索尔帕人
And within a day, he'll be an adult male Gazorpian,

宇宙中最为凶残暴力的生物之一
one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe.

等等 我们来这儿是因为有一个男性格索尔帕人出生在了地球上
Wait a minute. We're here becuase a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.

没人和你说话不许随便开口 傻瓜
You speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling!

不过这是真的 有一个你们的孩子出生在了地球上
It's true, though. One of your babies was born on Earth.

你是地球的统治者吗
Are you the ruler of this Earth.

你怎么知道
How did you know?

因为你的上衣
The quality of your top.

喜欢吗
Do you love it?

爱死了
I love it.

- 有什么心事都可以跟我说  - 有什么心事都可以跟我说
- I'm here if you need to talk. - I'm here if you need to talk.

如果这个格索尔帕人是男性
If the Gazorpian is male,

你们的地球情况很不乐观
your Earth is in grave danger.

我们会送你们回去 好把他干掉
We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated.

不过先来点莫吉托鸡尾酒
But first, Mojitos.

我们没时间喝莫吉托了
We don't have time for Mojitos.

你这是对她们不敬
You're insulting them.

我不在乎 Summer
I don't care, Summer.

这地方太烂了
This place is the worst!

我想回家
I want to go home!

你想干嘛一点都不重要
Well, it really doesn't matter what you want,

因为这个地方是由女人统治的
because this is a sane place where women rule.

你知道我对这件事有什么想说的吗
Yeah. You know what I have to say about that?

我简直不敢相信我的耳朵
I cannot believe my ears.

哇
Whoo, boy!

谁把青蛙放出来了哈
Who let the frogs out, huh?

《Who let the frog out》是Crazy Frog的一首单曲

外公
Grandpa!

- 外公  - 这听着是个父权社会的词啊
- Grandpa? - That sounds patriarchal!

意思是"父辈的父亲"
It means "father of fathers".

这么说他不是你的奴隶
Then this one is not you slave,

你们的地球不过是另一个被男人统治的星球罢了
and your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men.

地球没有被男人"统治" 好吗
It's not dominated by us, okay?

地球上的男女是平等的
On Earth, men and women are equals.

平等的 同样的工作我们的工资只有你们的百分之70
Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job!

抓住他们
Seize them!

这种情况下说这个真的好吗 Summer
Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?

给你 爸爸
This is for you, daddy.

天啊
Oh, man!

听我说 小Morty
Um, okay. Listen to me, Morty Jr.

我得跟你说一些很重要的事 好吗
I've got to tell you something very important, okay?

杀戮是不好的
Killing is bad, bad!

你在犯傻吧 爸爸
You're silly, daddy.

不 小Morty 我很认真
No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay?

你得把精力花在别的东西上
You need to put your energy into something else.

跳舞怎么样
I mean, what about dancing?

你想学跳舞吗
Would you like to learn how to dance?

我想跳舞啊 在敌人的坟墓上跳
I'd like to dance, on the grave of my enemies.

不 小Morty
Ohh! No, Morty Jr.!

爸爸 我能去外面吗
Daddy, can I go outside?

不行 绝对不行
No! Absolutely not!

可是人和动物都在外面啊
But that's where all the people and the animals are.

没错 但是你不能出去 因为
Yeah, but you can't go out there because the-

外面的空气对你是有毒的
the air is poisonous for you!

你会死掉的 只要出了这间屋子你就会死
You will die-You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house!

明白吗
You hear me?

- 真的吗  - 比珍珠还真
- For real? - For real times a million, buddy.

我们就好好待在屋子里好吗 我们跳舞吧 来试一下 好吗
So let's just stay inside, and, you know, let's just try dancing, right?

看我呀 看
Look at me. Yay! Look.

来跳舞啊 来嘛 跟我一起跳
We're gonna dance. Come on. Join- dance with me here.

我们喜欢跳舞
We love to dance.

为什么我们喜欢跳舞
Why do we love to dance?

我说喜欢就喜欢
Because I said so!

- 好样的  - 干得好
- Nice.  - Nice.

台阶上的三行字为拉丁文 意为"如果你总想要诬陷"

如果

你总想要

诬陷

你们犯了什么事
So, what are you in for?

因为我两腿之间有根鸡鸡
Because I got- I got a big, you know, penis between my legs.

你做了什么
What- what- what are you in for?

女人所能犯下的最深的罪
The worst crime a female can commit.

Veronica Ann Bennett 因难看的刘海 我宣判你有罪
Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs.

你发现没 刘海难看的人名字总是有三个字
You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names?

你在此被判处沉默刑
You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment!

这一点也不吓人好吗
This is gonna be cake.

Jackie
Jackie!

来自地球的Rick和Summer
Rick and Summer of Earth,

因为你们对女人性的背叛
for the crimes of treason against womankind

以及发出我们不使用的声音
and for creating the sound of which we do not speak

因为这种声音根本不存在
because it does not exist.

我在此判处你们
You're hereby sentenced to-

啥啥啥 在沙发上过夜吗
What, what, what- a night on the couch?

死刑
...Death.

我现在恨死你了
I hate you so much right now.

这是我们这么多年来的第一例死刑
This will be the first instance of capital punishment

因为我们的卓越 已经500年没有过死刑了
in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness,

所以我们只能即兴发挥了
so we are forced to improvise.

我们在那边的岩架上放了一块巨石
We placed a large boulder on that ledge.

天啦 你们打算用巨石压死我们
Holy shit! Y-y-you're gonna crash us with a boulder?

不是 别打岔
No! Stop interrupting!

巨石会落到杠杆装置上
The boulder falls onto a lever

然后弹出刀刃
that will lauch knives.

啥 给我把枪让我把自己崩了吧
What? Just give me a gun. I'll kill myself.

别打岔了 然后刀刃会
Stop interrupting! The knives will-

好吧 你一开始说对了
Fine! You were right the first time, okay?

巨石会压死你们
The boulder crushes you.

我只是不想承认 高兴了吗
I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy?

别这样 别理他们 别理他们就好
No, just ignore them. Ignore them.

真是个混球
Such an asshole.

对不起 Summer
Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

我没有尽到责任 害你让我们卷入了这种事
I feel bad that I let you drag us into this.

我这个外公当得不够好
I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you，

还有 发自内心的说
and, you know, for what it's worth,

上衣很可爱 你穿着很好看
that is a really nice, cute top that you're wearing there.

上衣 我的上衣 就是你之前称赞过的那件上衣
Top. My top. The same top you complimented earlier!

看标签 看上面的字
Look- Look at the tag. Read it.

上面写着"Marc Jacobs"
It says, "Marc Jacobs".

Marc Jacobs 美国知名服装设计师 已出柜

Marc Jacob
Marc? Jacob?

这不是男人的名字吗
These are names of the penis.

没错 一个地球男人设计了这件上衣
Yes. An Earth man made this top.

或许在你们的星球上 性别隔离是对的
Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do,

但有一部分男性是作为同性恋出生在地球上的
But on Earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay,

所以我的衣服才比你们所有人的衣服都好看
which is why my clothes are better than all of yours.

创造时尚的男人
A man made something fashionable?

这是事实 有时候事实是残酷的
It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts,

但它必须被接受 就好比我跟你说
but it must be accepted, like if I told you

你粉底的颜色选错了
that you're using the wrong color foundation for you skin

而且到脖子那儿就没了
and it ends at your neck,

你看着就跟派对小丑一样
making you look like a party clown.

好吧 我记住了
Okay, ouch. Noted.

但如果你们把格索尔帕索普星的法律强加在地球上
But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazor's laws on Earth,

那你们比这个乱发出屁声的男人也好不到哪儿去
you're no better than the man whose farts shall remain unspoken.

如果你们觉得我的上衣很好看 那你们就不能处死我们
And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute.

很好 给这些地球人一艘太空船
Very well. Give the Earth people a spacecraft

让他们回那个奇怪的星球去吧
so they may head back to their weird planet,

那里男女平等 但又不尽然
where women are kind of equal but not really.

干得好 Summer 谢谢了 妹子们
Good job, Summer. And thanks, girls.

我跟你说 你们这些妹子真是厉害啊
You know, you girls are really something, I'll tell you that.

我刚到这儿的时候
You know, when we first got here, I was like...

给他们艘飞船 快点
Give them a ship now.

小Morty 你在抽烟
Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

这样可不行
That is not okay!

你能干嘛 禁我足吗
What are you gonna do? Ground me?

反正我也不能出去
I can't go outside anyway!

那又怎么样 你可以在屋子里玩啊
So what?! You could do things inside!

你可以弹吉他啊 你可以手淫啊
You could play guitar. You could masturbate.

我不想手淫 我想征服地球
I don't want to masturbate. I want to conquer the planet!

又来了
Oh, here we go again!

如果你征服了地球 谁还会爱你呢 小Morty
Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr.?!

爱 你就只关心爱
Love, that's all you care about!

那武器呢 统治敌人呢
What about weapons?! What about domination of the enemy?!

够了 不许再看历史频道了
All right, that's it. No more history channel!

这台电视只许用来看动画和玩电子游戏
This TV is for cartoons and video games only!

我讨厌电子游戏
I hate video games!

给我收回这句话 把遥控器给我
You take that back! Give it to me! Ugh!

我不是故意的
I-I-I didn't mean, I didn't mean that.

我真的不是故意的 对不起
I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

我受不了了
I can't take this anymore!

我宁愿呼吸毒气也不愿意再和你多待一分钟
I'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you!

不不不 不要
No! No, no, no! Stop!

我的人生就是一个谎言
My life has been a lie!

上帝已死
God is dead!

政府烂透了
The government's lame!

感恩节其实是屠杀印第安人的节日
Thanksgiving is about killing Indians!

耶稣不是出生在圣诞的
Jesus wasn't born on Christmas!

他们改了日期
They moved the date!

这是异教徒的节日
It was a pagan holiday!

爸
Oh, dad!

怎么了 Morty
Yes, Morty?

我儿子要占领地球 我却还不到开车的年龄
My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive!

你能帮我把他找回来吗
Can you help me get him back?!

可以吧 Morty 应该可以吧
I suppose, Morty. I suppose.

不过呢 先让我从这"早告诉你了"的高杯中啜饮一口
But first, a deep sip from a very tall glass of "I told you so."

天啊 得了吧
Oh, my god! Please, dad! Come on!

废弃工厂

禁止入内

爸 他在那儿
Dad, there he is!

天啊 快住手
Oh, God. Hey, stop that!

天啊 天啊 爸
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Dad!

小Morty 不要
Morty Jr., no!

是我啊 是爸爸 没事的
It's me! It's dad. It's okay!

把车放下 小Morty
Put the car down, Morty Jr.

不 不 小手在哪里
No! No! Wh-where's your hands?

*小手在哪里*
*Where's your hands?*

我的车
My car!

*我们来玩挥挥手*
*And that's how we play handy hands*

闪开 Morty
Out of the- out of the way, Morty!

- 不  - Morty 这是全宇宙最暴力的生物之一
- No! - Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe!

他是我儿子
He's my son!

你想要伤害他 就先夸过我的尸体吧 Rick
And if you hurt him, you'll have to kill me, Rick!

爸 我好迷茫
Dad, I'm so confused!

我知道 小Morty 对不起
I know, Morty Jr. I'm sorry.

我最后还是像我父母对我那样 和你撒谎 对你大喊大叫了
I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me.

父母也不过是有了小孩的孩子罢了
You know, parents are just kids having kids.

前一分钟 你还觉得那个闪闪的机器人很好看
One minute, you like how a shiny robot looks.

下一分钟 你就在和你的外星儿子肉搏了
The next minute, you're in a fist fight with your alien son.

我是外星人
I'm an alien?

我们都有糟糕的冲动 邪恶的念头
We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts.

我们只是要学会把它们传变成别的有用的东西
We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive.

但我想杀掉我看见的每一个人
But I want to murder everyone I see.

说不定就有一份工作适合有这样想法的人呢
Well, you know, I mean, maybe there's a job out there for people that feel that way.

的确是有的
Actually, there is.

嗨 我是Brad Aderson 全国连载的连环漫画《大丹麦狗马默杜克》的作者
Hi. I'm Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Marmaduke".

你应该考虑从事创作
You should consider being a creative.

我深受自己那些无法控制的念头的困扰
I'm haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of

我几乎每天脑海中萦绕着致残和性侵
mutilations and sexual assaults on a near daily basis.

但我把它们变为了我的作品
But, you know, I channel it all into my work.

哦 哇
Oh. Wow.

我看《大丹麦狗马默杜克》的时候从没发现这一点啊
Huh. I never got that impression from reading "Marmaduke".

难道你觉得我在想方设法地让你笑吗
Well, did you get the impression that I was trying to make you laugh?

不是吧 那是Brad Anderson
Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson.

看见了吗 你听到了吧 小Morty
Aw, see? You hear that, Morty Jr.?

或许你也可以从事某种创作呢
Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind.

或许吧
Maybe!

我一直都挺想让自己的脸出现在某本小说的背面
I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel.

虽然我真正想做的是割开别人的喉咙 但除了这个
I mean, what I really want to do is slit people's throats, but beyond that...

你一定可以的 儿子
I know you can do it, son.

我想我该找个地方自己住了
I think it's time I get a place of my own.

我保证 只要我缺钱或是没地方洗衣服了都会给你打电话的
I promise I'll call you every day I need money or a place to do
laundry.

我想你儿子会拿他小说的稿费赔我的车后轴的吧
So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?

挺有趣的吧 Summer 我们做了这么多事
Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did,

都没起什么作用 没有什么意义
nothing really mattered and there was no point to it?

是不是让你什么都没有思考
Kind of makes you wonder, huh, about nothing?

你确定你不会重新考虑下
Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy

你不带女孩子去冒险这件事
about taking girls on adventures?

不 鉴于我们今天的经历
No. I'd say, given what we've been through,

我只想说我一直都是对的
that I was right the whole time

任何关于性别政策的感悟
and any epiphanies about gender politics

都只是你身为女性的不安全感的表现而已
were a projection of your feminine insecurity.

不过你把这艘粉色太空船拿去吧
But, hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship?

开着它到处转转 好好玩玩
Go ride around and have a jolly old time.

这样说不定你就会闭嘴了
Maybe that'll shut you up.

爸 Summer 这么长时间你们跑哪儿去了
Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time?

在格索尔帕索普星 你呢
On Gazorpazorp. Where were you?

我在看报纸
I was reading a newspaper.

真有意思 Beth
Oh, that's interesting, Beth.

好玩的是
You know, it's funny.

我也听说了点儿新闻
I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself.

看着 听着
Take a look. T-take a listen.

Wubba lubba dub dubs

You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white,

呃 负罪感 白人负疚感

White Guilt 一些白人因种族和殖民主义而背负的个人或集体的内疚感 这个词通常带有贬义

Milk-toast piece of human garbage.

天哪 格索尔菲猫 这太 你懂的
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's, you know,

你平时我就挺刻薄的 但都没这个刻薄
you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.

我[哔]才不管
I don't give a [Bleep].

我[哔]是格索尔菲猫 贱人
I'm Gazorpazorp[Bleep]filed, bitch.

快[哔]把肉馅玉米卷饼给我
Now give me [Bleep] enchiladas.

嘿 Rick 他们找了Bill Murray给这个配音吗
Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this?

Bill Murray 美国演员 为2004年电影《加菲猫》以及2006年的续作中的加菲配音

听起来好像Bill Murray啊
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

不 Morty 这是Lorenzo Music
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

Lorenzo Music 1982-1994年间为动画片《加菲猫》配音 在我们的时间线里 他在2001年去世了

在那个世界里他还活着
In this reality, he's still alive.

好吧 他是叫"Lorenzo Music"吗
Oh, okay. Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

没错 我很确定
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

他也给"捉鬼敢死队"里那人配过音
He also did the voice of that one guy from "Ghostbusters",

Lorenzo Music配音的是动画《The Real Ghostbusters》(1986-1991) Bill Murray出演的是电影(1984)

挺奇怪的
which is really strange

因为Bill Murray在电影里扮演的就是那个角色
because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie.

后来他们给加菲猫拍电影的时候
But then, when they made the movie,

Bill Murray又给格索尔菲猫 我是说加菲猫 配的音
Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp- or Garfield, I mean.

真有意思 Rick
Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick.

那这些事也有在那个平行世界里发生吗
So all that happened in this reality, too?

我哪知道
I don't know.

只是和你闲聊而已 Morty
Just making conversation with you, Morty.

怎么 你觉得我我我什么都知道吗
What, you think I'm a- I'm- I know everything about everything?

你真的说服了我放弃堕胎吗
Did you really talk me out of the abortion?

我们 我们在去诊所的路上轮胎爆了
Well, we- we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.

我以为 在我的脑海里
I think, in my head,

我的坚持都是为了孩子
I was doing it all for the kids.

而现在大女儿却要去捣腾绿松石了
And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise.

那不是冰毒的代号就是啥搞冰毒的办法
Which is either code for crystal meth or a gateway to it.

所以我们根本没为孩子做什么
So we didn't do the kids any favors.

所以我们还在一起是为了对方 不然
So we should stay together for each other and ourselves or...

不然
Or...

男人 女人 现在又来了象鼻人
Man, woman, and now trunkman?

重现场景 但绝对真实

我们知道科学已经创造出了有象鼻的人
We know science has created men that have a trunk

使他们和男性与女性伴侣都可以发生性行为
that allows them to have sex with both male and female parteners.

重现场景 但绝对真实

但我们不希望这些人结婚
But we don't like the idea of these people getting married.

坚持底线吧 各位
Put a line in the sand, everybody.

为XW2提案投上反对的一票
Vote "no" on proposition XW2

就是提出象鼻人可以结婚的那个
The act that says trunkpeople can get married.

谁需要呢
Who needs it?

大家好
Hi.

我是一个象鼻人 我想要
I'm a trunkperson and I want,

我也像你们一样能感受到内心的爱
I feel love in my heart, too, just like you.

我希望能同时向一个男人和一个女人表达这份爱
I want to be able to express that love with both a man and a woman.

但如果Denny和Denny合唱团得逞的话 我就没法这样了
And I won't be able to, if Denny and the Denny Singers get their way.

嘿 就让象鼻人做爱结婚吧 听到没
Hey, let the trunkpeople have sex and get married, huh?

由象鼻人赞助播出
Paid for by turnkpeople.

我都要留着自己吃
I'm keeping them all for me.

Last bite.

现在它们都舒舒服服地待在我的肚子里啦
Oh now they're all resting comfortably in my stomach.

哦 感觉真是太棒了
Ooh, am I feeling good.

不 走开
No! Get away from me!

离我远点
Get away from me!

已经没有草莓小粒粒了 不
There's no more strawberry snibbles, no!

上帝啊 上帝啊
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

好痛啊
It hurts!

我的内脏都露出来了
My entrails are out!

都这样了你们为啥还想吃
Why would you even want to eat these?

都泡在我的胃酸里了
They're soaked with my stomach acid.

哦 上帝 主啊 救世主
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lord, Savior,

圣灵啊 救救我吧
and Spirit, save me.

但很高兴你克服了这个心理障碍
But I'm proud of you that you did it.

谢谢 警长

然后木星
And then Jupiter...

其实 冥王星好像不是行星
Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto is a Planet.

儿子 冥王星当然是行星
Of course Pluto is a planet, son.

我三年级就知道了
I learned that in the third grade.

啊 对 但是后来有人改了
Well, yeah, but you know they changed it.

Morty 行星这种事怎么会改呢
Morty, nobody changed the planets.

我刚在谷歌上查了
I just Googled it.

冥王星不是行星
Pluto is not a planet.

2006年就改了
They changed it in 2006.

对 这个我听说了
Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

你不同意
You disagree?

不同意
That's right.

科学中产生分歧很正常 Morty
It's possible to disagree in science, Morty.

冥王星以前是行星
Pluto was a planet.

后来被一些自以为是的狗屁委员会否定了
Some committee of fancy assholes disagree.

我否定回去 把乒乓球给我
I disagree back. Give me a Ping-Pong ball.

好
Um, okay.

我 我要去
I-I just have to...

去找Rick 然后背着我说冥王星的事吗
Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto?

Oh. Okay, good.

这一定会很好玩的
This is gonna be fun.

Morty 让我 让我
Hey, Morty, let me let me let me

问你个问题

这世上有邪力吗 如果有
Does Evil exist, and if so,

有办法检测和测量吗
can one detect and measure it?

呃
Um...

这是个设问句 Morty
Rhetorical question, Morty.

答案是"有并且可以 只要你是天才"
The answer's "yes, you just have to be a genius."

真赞
Cute.

你姐的老板给了我这个显微镜
Your sister's boss give me a microscope

这东西会使让我变成弱智
that would have made me retarded.

噢 噢 天啊 Rick
Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick.

我觉得你不该用这个词
I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know?

Morty 我没有对残障人士不敬的意思
Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled.

我是在陈述事实 如果我用了这显微镜
I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope,

这东西就会使我的智商降低
it would have made me mentally retarded.

That's retarded(真逊 真差劲)
常因为暗含对残障人士的不尊重而被认为是"政治不正确"的话
retard一词本指先天残障 后引申出"糟糕 愚蠢"之意

Rick 我说的不是逻辑问题
Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick.

我觉得这个词已经变成了某些自己以为是的政治集团
I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups

拿来说事儿的东西了
that feel like they're doing the right thing.

真扯淡
That's retarded.

你们在说什么
What are you guys talking about?

显然 啥都没说
Apparently, nothing.

你问他冥王星是不是行星了对吧
You asked him if Pluto is planet, didn't you?

- 没有  - 不是
- No! - It's not.

闭嘴 Rick
Shut up, Rick.

哇啊
Whoa.

我不管别人说什么
I don't care what anyone says.

如果它以前可以是行星 那现在也可以
If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again.

行星 行星 行星 行星
Planet, planet, planet, planet.

科学一点吧 Jerry
Stay scientific, Jerry.

这瓶须后水的确让女人为我倾倒

你可以拿回去了
Here. You can have this back.

你没有用吗
You didn't use it?

我当然用了 用来开发了这个
Sure I did, to develop this.

能让丑女人变美但会让她们失明的美容霜

真漂亮
That's beautiful.

你知道三小时后就变成它穿着你了吗
You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours?

你是想让我报警吗
Do I need to call the police?

拿去 你可以用我的电话
Here, you can use my phone.

别担心
Don't worry.

它不会让你失聪的 我又不是黑心商

至少他在社区很活跃
At least he's active in the community.

What do you do?

你吃我们的 然后做些小玩意

- I'd rather not, actually.  - Yes, perhaps not during business hours.

我说了 我要填写冥王星是行星的声明
I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet.

那我儿子的科学课就要挂科了
Well, then my son's going to fail his science class,

如果那样的话
and when that happens,

我第一个起诉的就是你们
I'm suing you first.

我算明白NASA里的"A"是什么意思了
I think I know what the "A" in NASA stands for.

爸爸 你这游戏最后打算怎么办
Dad, what's your endgame?

这不是游戏 傻瓜
Ain't no game, sucka.

我就做一个八颗行星的太阳系不好吗
Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets?

不是还简单些吗
It's even easier.

当然 那我们为什么不直接把伽利略烧死在刑柱上
Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake

因为他说太阳是圆的

科学并不总是那么简单的 Morty
Science isn't always easy, Morty.

Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?!

我是小疯疯国王 冥王星的统治者
I'm King Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto.

我们在例行监视你们星球的时候偶然发现了你
We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world.

你真是给了航空航天局的人点颜色啊
You really gave it to those guys at NASA.

我只是 你懂的 有时候科学有关信念
I was...you know, sometimes science is about conviction.

我要向你们介绍一些非常赞同你们的人
I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.

哦 我
Oh, I...

冥王星的子民们
Plutonians.

Jerry Smith是地球来的科学家
Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth,

他正在创造一个太阳系的模型

Jerry 向冥王星宣布你的决定
Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision.

呃 冥王星是个行星
Um...Pluto's a planet.

冥王星是个[哔]行星 贱人
Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch!

天哪
Oh, man.

他的脑子绝对会被冲昏
This is definitely gonna go to his head.

好商店 好地方 再见
Great store. Great Place. Bye.

好吧
Huh. Okay.

说实话 summer 我本以为你外公闹了一通以后
I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst.

会影响我的生意
would have disrupted business,

但这真是塞勒姆女巫审判以来我过得最好的周末了
But this is the best weekend I've had since Salem.

真棒 那中午吃"美满康"怎么样
Nice. "Wholesome Delight" for lunch?

Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?

哇哦 哇 悠着点 亲爱的
Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

还有什么限制吗
Oh, is there a limit?

都是免费的 对吧
Everything is free, right?

这么说吧 你付的确实不是钱
Let's just say you don't pay... with money.

说得真好
That was perfect.

你会以被诅咒为代价 对吧
You pay with the curses, right?

呃 但 Tate太太你为何想要被诅咒的东西
Um... I, well... but, Mrs. Tate why do you want cursed items?

我会去"诅咒净"移除诅咒的
Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at "Curse Purge Plus."

就那个在电视上的家伙
You know, the guy on TV?

什么
What?

你有从一家神秘的古董店或是
Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff

二手店收到些稀奇古怪的玩意吗
from a mysterious antique or thrift store

这些东西可以给你神力但却以出乎预料的方式狠[哔]了你
that gives you powers but [Bleep] you in unforeseeable ways?

把东西带来"诅咒净"
Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus."

我靠科学收钱解咒
I use science to un-curse the items for cash,

然后你可以继续保有神力
and you get to keep the powers.

这家伙得了双可让他跑得飞快的神奇运动鞋
This guys got mysterious sneaker to make him run faster, but guess what?

但他必须以跑至生命的尽头为代价 这就一文不值了
He would have to run until he died,making them worthless.

我解了咒 让这鞋值
I remove the curse, making them worth, like,

说不好 800万美元
I don't know, 8 million dollars?

奥林匹克见
See you at the olympics.

这个有诡异智力的玩偶会威胁要杀死带走它的那家人

一切皆可减免
Everything's deductible.

再不需要出卖灵魂来换取好东西

欢迎回到"早安 冥王星"
We're back on "Good moring, Pluto."

让我们欢迎今早的来宾 地球科学家Jerry smith
And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry smith,

他的大胆宣言已经登上头条 那就是
who's making headlines with his bold announcement, that is,

是什么 Jerry
What? Jerry?

冥王星是一颗行星
Pluto is a planet.

- 快听听  - 说得好
- Well, how about that.  - I love it.

Morty Smith 我叫关德宽
Morty Smith, I'm Scroopy noopers.

我是一名科学家
I'm a scientist.

我能带你去看样东西吗
Can I show you something?

还是免了吧
Uh, I better not.

立马来
Right now.

这是冥王星的地下中心 Smith先生
The center of Pluto, Mr.Smith,

它是由钚(以冥王星命名)构成的
is made of a substance called "Plutonium".

这些矿井开采钚并传输到整个城市
Mines like these suck plutonium up to the cities,

大公司将其用作能量供给
where corporations use it to power everything,

从钻石汽车到黄金浴室
from diamond cars to golden showers.

不断地开采导致冥王星不断地萎缩
And the more we remove, the more pluto shrinks.

就像这样 又缩小了一点
There it goes again. Just shrank a little.

但是几年前 你们的科学家注意到了冥王星的不断变小
But a few years ago, your scientists noticed pluto had gotten so small,

已经不能再称为一颗行星了
they couldn't even call it a planet anymore.

事实上冥王星是因为当初科学家对其质量计算错误误将其归为行星

那本该是敲醒我们的警钟
Should've been our wake-up call.

但那些冥王星的富人们却不愿清醒
But the rich plutonians won't wake up,

他们十分喜欢你爸爸告诉所有人冥王星还是颗行星
and they love your dad telling everyone pluto's a planet,

因为这就意味着他们还能继续开采
because that means they can keep mining

直到冥王星从行星变为小行星 然后是流星 最终变为...
until pluto goes from planet to asteroid, to meteor, and finally...

派对吗
A party?

你们家的人都是傻子吗
Is everyone in your family an idiot?

反正我和我爸是
Well, for sure me and my dad are.

好吧 你要做的就是让他承认这个说法
Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that,

那样你就能够拯救40亿人的生命
and you could save four billion lives.

好吧 但问题是 我爸很没有安全感
Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure.

有意思
Hmm, funny.

所需先生 店里这么多东西
Mr.Needful, out of everything in the store,

猴爪 出自 W. W. Jacobs的同名短篇惊悚小说 其中的猴爪可以满足三个愿望 但每一个愿望都会带来不可预料的代价

你绝对猜不到没被卖掉的居然是这件
you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of.

哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

天哪
Oh, my god.

我希望这个桌子能变轻点
I wish this desk  was lighter.

我希望这个扣结能变松点
I wish this knot was looser.

赶紧的
Come on.

我不
I don't...

我在做什么傻事呢
Wait, what am I doing?

我希望我会做心肺复苏
I wish I knew CPR.

1 2 3 1 2 3
1 2 3, 1 2 3...

哦 天啊
Oh, jesus.

猴抓这么用可真是浪费
What a waste of a monkey paw.

所需先生 你怎么能做这么可怕的事呢
Mr Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible.

我是魔鬼啊
I'm the devil.

我失败了还能怎么办 吃个冰淇林吗
What should I do when I fail, get myself an ice cream.

你还没有失败
You haven't failed.

像Rick这种人让我一无是处
People like Rick are making me obsolete.

说实话
I mean, seriously.

我也许是个魔鬼 但你外公他才是真正的魔鬼
I may be "the devil", but your grandpa is the devil.

我只想回地狱
I just want to go to the hell,

那里所有人都觉得我聪明又有趣
where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny.

不 这不公平
No! It's not fair.

这个镇上所有的人都从你这儿得到了想要的东西 包括Rick
Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick.

我是你唯一的朋友 我什么都得不到吗
I was your only friend, and I get nothing?

好吧 我会给你一样东西
Ok, I'll give you one thing.

说吧
Name it.

我想要帮助你
I want to help you.

这招漂亮
Clever twist.

我可是师从高人 你个老混蛋
I learned from the best, you old fart.

现在我们给你补水去
Now, let's get you hydrated.

这看起来是个 被诅咒的拳击手套
Looks like we've got...haunted boxing gloves

能让你获得1936年的重量级拳击冠军
that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936,

之后你就会困在那里 不断赢同一场比赛直到永远
and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity.

我可以弄掉"永远"的诅咒和没用的部分
I can take out the "eternity" and the padding,

你就有一个可以穿越时空的连指手套了
and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens.

Rosemary's Baby 1968年经典恐怖电影

这不是"魔鬼圣婴"吗
Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.

生意怎么样
How's business?

这是我们最后的库存
Here's the last of our inventory.

我们准备申请破产 然后重组
We're going to file chapter11 and do some restructuring.

这意思不就是"你赢了 Rick"
Sounds like code for "you win, Rick".

这就对你这么重要吗
That was important to you, wasn't it.

不 这对你那蠢恶魔朋友非常重要
Nope, It was important to your dumb devil friend.

对我来说 这不过是像
To me, this was all just a bit,

兔八哥里的一集 兔八哥扮作指挥家狠狠作弄了一个歌剧演员

兔八哥恶整歌剧家20分钟而已
like when bugs bunny [bleep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes.

他差点自杀
He tried to kill himself.

真的 哎哟我的老天爷啊
Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.

但你知道吗 Rick外公
But, you know what,grandpa Rick?

他很坚强 他决不放弃
He's strong, and he's vever going to give up.

好吧 我可不在乎
Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.

我知道
Oh, I know.

所有人都知道你不在乎
Everyone knows you don't care.

怎样
So?

那祝你不在乎的愉快
So have fun not caring.

我一直愉快
I always do.

很好
Good.

没错 好得很
Yeah, It is good.

再好不过
It's the best.

可不是么 拜
I'm sure it is. Bye.

回见
Later.

我来取我的亡灵猫和小孩
I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.

好的 稍等
Yeah, uh...give me a sec.

这是员工们的健康计划的表单
These are the forms for the employee health plan.

好吧 把它们放在我的...呃
All right,Put them on my...eh

我玩腻了 都走吧
I just get board. Everybody out.

好了 这次集会结束后
All right, just one more rally

咱们就回去做你的科学作业
then I promise we'll get back to your science project.

爸 冥王星不是一颗行星 大公司在让它不断缩小
Dad, pluto isn't a planet. It's shrinking because of corporations.

好吧 这不是那个反行星的极端疯子关德宽
Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job scroopy noppers was screaming

在筹资部外面嚷嚷的吗
about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser.

你是想说四十亿冥王星人都错了
Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?

你说过科学并不简单
You said science wasn't easy.

我说的是科学并不总是简单的
I said science isn't always easy.

很显然 这意味着有时候会很简单
Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy.

我们别纠结这个文字游戏了 儿子
Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son.

爸 整个行星危在旦夕
Dad, their whole planet is dying.

哈 你刚叫它行星
Ha, you called it a planet.

将军
Checkmate.

你们好啊 冥王星众们
What's up, pluto?

Smith先生 麻烦把你刚才和我说的和我朋友在说一遍 来吧
Mr.Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me. Go on.

我那热情的母亲刚刚给我上了九根腌瓜 其中一根就是冥王星
My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is pluto.

天哪 他可真是个天才
My god, the man's a genius.

打扰一下
Um, excuse me.

Morty 怎么了
Morty, what?

爸 你怎么看最近发表在《冥王星科普》上的报告
Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by 《The Pluto Science Reader》

"地心钚元素开采是造成星球地震 地表陷落及萎缩的罪魁祸首"
"linking pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinking to deep-core plutonium drilling?"

儿子 那你怎么看你5岁时拉在自己的裤子上后
Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants,

把沾上粑粑的小裤裤扔出的卧室窗外
and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window,

因为你认为这就跟扔垃圾一样
because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?

我修剪树篱时就看见它挂在上面
I mean, I'm trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there.

难道要让我以为这是屎兔兔干的
Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?

说得真好 爸
Good one, Dad.

嘿 Morty 你想去...噢
Hey, Morty, you want to go on a...oh.

W-w-what's going on?

你能帮我做那个破科学作业吗
Listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project?

随便吧
Whatever.

Jerry 你现在一定非常兴奋吧
Jerry, you must be so excited.

冥贝尔奖可是科学家能获得的最高荣誉啊
The Pluo-Bel Prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive.

真是荣幸又不太好意思呢
I'm flattered and humbled.

这句不错 发表感言的时候记得用上
I like that.Use that in your sppech.

还有 提一下冥王星是行星这事 人们可喜欢了
Also, talk about Pluto being a planet. People like that.

殿下 我们逮到关德宽了
Your Highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers.

你是不能扼杀事实的 父亲
You can't kill the truth, father.

- 什么  - 我能理解你的困惑

冥塔那摩湾是个军事监狱 玩个文字游戏
Pluotonamo Bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words.

他刚刚叫你"爸爸"吗
Did he call you "father"?

关德宽 那个反行星狂热份子是你儿子

The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry.

冥王星是个冷冰冰的矮行星啊
Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.

是个什么?
It's a what?

Huh? Oh, planet.

"冥王星是个冷冰冰的行星" 我是这个意思
"Pluto is a cold, cold planet." That's what I meant.

快去让他们欢呼尖叫吧
Knock them dead out there, you.

冥王星
Pluto is...

不是一颗行星
not a planet.

它不是一颗行星
It's not a plant.

扎克伯格曾将facebook共同创始人排挤出公司
I was zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.
原意 扎克伯格毛还没长齐我就在干这种翻脸不认人的事了

我翻脸的速度可是比翻书还快啊
I was zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.

我可是魔鬼啊 婊子
I'm the devil, bitch! What, what.

我靠
Hey!

Morty
Hey, Morty.

爸 你怎么这么快就从冥王星回来了
Oh, hey dad. What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?

总是有些人接受不了事实
Some people just can't handle the truth.

特别是像我一样的傻子
Especially dummies like me.

Morty 我知道我没有外公Rick这么聪明
Morty, I'm not as smart as your Grandpa Rick,

但我保证再也不会因为这个给你添麻烦了
but I promise never to make that your problem again.

爸 没有人比Rick还聪明
Hey, dad. Nobody is smarter than Rick.

但是也没人能取代你是我爸的事实啊 在这点上你比谁都在行
But nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that.

哇
Wow...

这真是荣幸又不太好意思呢 儿子 谢谢你
That's...humbling and flattering, son. Thank you

我们一起把那8大行星太阳系模型做完吧
What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system?

我还是把这个交上去拿个"A"就好了啦
Um... I'm just gonna take this in and get an "A."

- 黄油  - 但是...
- Butter - But...

作为一个爸爸 你比谁都在行
You're a genius at being my dad, dad.

所以不要再计较了
Quit while you're a head.

还有 下次进来时记得敲门
And also, knock next time, you know.

我是说 我正在房间里 我都14了
I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14.

我面前放着一台电脑
I got a computer in here, you know.

我想我懂你的意思
Oh... I think I understand.

你这样不敲门就进来 真的是在玩火哦
You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.

懂了啦 不用再说了
I get it, say no more.

总有一天啊
I mean, one of these days, you know.

你会看见...
You're gonna end up seeing something...

我知道了 记住了啦 晚安
I got it! Noted! Good night.

你的那个代理外公怎样了
How's your pretend Grandpa doing?

别称 "恶魔"
AKA "The Devil."

- 他把我甩了  - 那还真是对不起啊
- He dumped me. - Sorry.

我们是有学到什么我没有领悟的大道理吗
Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing?

不确定
Not sure.

或许往深层次想
Maybe in a much bigger way,

所需先生同样满足了我们两个的愿望
Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted.

我一直嫉妒你和Morty成天在一起
Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty,

而你也没有意识过 其实你很重视我对你的肯定
and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval.

- 不 这太蠢了  - 是啊 一点满足感都没有
- No, that's dumb. - Yeah, not satisfying.

不过嘛 如果你只是想得到满足感的话
I'll tell you what though, if it's satisfaction you're after,

我有个好主意
I think I might have an idea.

行啊 我们就这么办吧
Totally, let's do it.

就这样 我把我的店面推上了成功的最前线
And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the front.

谢谢你 西雅图
Thank you, Seattle.

Rick Summer
Rick? Summer?

- 傻逼贱人  - 你个贱婊子
- Stupid mother[Bleep]. - Your stupid bitch.

傻逼贱人 这招如何
Stupid mother[Bleep]. How do you like that?

这招又如何
How do you like that?

为什么
Why?

因为有时候你最需要的 只是让别人付出他们应付的代价
Because sometimes what you really need, is for someone else to pay a horrible price.

- 我们成功了  - 是啊 兄弟  - 太值了
- We did it. - Yeah, Bro. - We totally worth it.

- 圆满搞定呢  - 是啊
- We just pulled it off. - Yeah, Bro.

马丁·路德·金诞辰

Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives.

我要给你做飞碟形煎饼
I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

哦 没这个必要 Beth 正常煎饼就行了
Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.

哦上帝
Oh, my God!

这是怎么回事
Oh, what is happening?!

周年纪念快乐 爸爸
Happy anniversary, dad.

哦 我懂了
Oh, I get it.

正常煎饼就已经像飞碟了
Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.

好吃 其实为了感谢你一直忍受我 我应该给你做早饭的
Mmm. I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.

你应该给我们弄一整家餐厅
You should be making us a whole restaurant.

胡说 有你在身边 我们再开心不过了
Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around.

我只希望能多陪陪你(看见更多的你)
I just wish I got to see more of you.

地球空间C-137的Rick Sanchez
Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension c-137,

你因对平行空间的其他Rick犯下的罪行
you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks

而被跨维度Rick委员会批准逮捕
by the authority of the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.

- 嘿 搞什么鬼  - 冻住Jerry
- Hey! What the heck?! - Neutralize the Jerry.

等等 别 我可以
Wait! No! I'll...

爸爸
Dad!

- 爸爸  - Rick
- Dad! - Rick!

大家别紧张
Everybody, relax.

我认识这些混蛋 我就是这些混蛋
If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes,

他们只想把我拽到他们那傻逼俱乐部
they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse

问几个浪费时间的问题
and waste my time with a bunch of questions.

咱们快把这事儿结了吧
Let's get it over with.

- 带上他的Morty  - 哦天
- Bring his Morty. - Oh, man.

别把我的Morty卷进来
Leave my Morty out of this.

你在拒绝加入委员会的时候就已经失去了说这话的权利
You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-join the Council.

Jerry怎怎怎么办
W-w-w-what about Jerry?

你们至少把我女儿的白痴解冻了行吗
Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

给你任何东西
...give you anything!

我收藏了很多珍稀古董钱币 拜托别伤害我
I have a rare antique-coin collection! Just don't hurt me!

好吧 可能不是古董 但也是限量版铸币呢
Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting.

上面印的小R2-D2取代了乔治华盛顿
They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington.

R2-D2 星球大战系列中出现的机器人角色

咱们儿子被拐走了
Our son's been abducted!

我买那些硬币你一直很不满
You hate me for buying those coins!

天哪 Rick 这是什么地方
Geez, Rick, w-what is this place?

Rick们的大本营
The citadel of Ricks.

这是Rick委员会的秘密总部
It's the secret headquarters for the Council of Ricks.

Rick委员会
Council of Ricks?

戏仿The Council of Reeds 由多个平行宇宙的Reed Richards组成的委员会(神奇四侠里的神奇先生)

你知道的 Morty 我在宇宙中树敌无数 他们视我的天才为威胁
As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat,

包括星系恐怖分子 下星系独裁者 和多数跨星系政府
galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government.

只有是有蠢驴的地方 就有人看我不爽
W-w-wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa,

而且不同平行宇宙里不同版本的我都是这样
and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem,

所以有几千个我傻逼一样地想凑在一起
so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together

像牛群 鱼群
like a herd of cattle or a school of fish

或者在雅虎知道上回答问题的人一样
or those people who answer questions on Yahoo! answers.

嘿 居然有牛仔版的我
Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me.

你真是没见过世面
Geez, you're easy to impress.

没错 大多数时间线都有个Rick 而大多数Rick都有个Morty
Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty.

这地方就是个你和我的名人录
This place is a real who's who of who's you and me.

快用Morty闪耀胸章把你无聊的旧Morty
Turn your boring, old Morty into a f...

变成热辣的时尚宣言吧
hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers.

嘿 看这个
Hey, check this out.

- 给我Morty  - 傻死了
- Show me the Morty. - Dumb.

打扰一下 先生 你为你的Morty投保了吗
Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured?

- 要知道 每年都有成百上千的Morty受伤  - 滚
- You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured... - Back off!

我不喜欢这地方
Not my cup of tea, this place.

我认为作为一个Rick而存在 重点就是作为"一个"Rick
I say the point of being a Rick is being A Rick.

把你的反Rick言论留给Rick委员会听吧 恐怖Rick分子
Save your anti-Rick speech for the Council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

嘿 把你的Rick规则留给Rick小绵羊吧 蠢猪Rick
Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

[哔]我啊 哥们
[Bleep] me, pal.

[哔]你 不不不不不 [哔]我啊
[Bleep] you? No, no, no, no, no, [Bleep] me.

把全息图呈上来
Bring up the holograms.

有27个Rick在自己的平行空间里被残忍杀害
27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines,

空前猖獗的对Rick的屠杀
an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic.

你还有什么可说的 地球C-137的Rick
What say you, Earth Rick c-137?

你觉得是我干的
You think I did this?

为什么每次有Rick踢到了脚趾总是我先被抓来
Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?

你有不和委员会合作的前科
You have a history of non-cooperation with the Council.

没错 那个以前被称作Rick的科学家不也是吗
Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick.

为为为什么他没被抓过来铐住
W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs?

因为他也死了
Because he's dead, too!

你还想让我们审问谁 你最符合凶手的特征
Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile.

在所有中央有限曲线上的Rick中
Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve,

你是反抗者 离群者
you're the malcontent, the rogue.

我只是Rick 在组成这个愚蠢的联盟以前 你们也是
I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.

你们想免受政府的迫害 于是你们自己变成了愚蠢的政府
You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government.

所以我比这里的每一个Rick都更像真正的Rick
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

尽情议论吧 混蛋们
Yeah, murmur it up, D-bags.

不好意思 家里还有涂了糖浆的煎饼等着我呢
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them.

马上吸收的糖浆就会把煎饼变成恶心的浆糊了
They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste,

我不想像Andy Rooney一样
and I hate to get all Andy Ronney about it,

Andy Ronney 美国电视新闻节目《60分钟时事杂志》主持人之一

但我认为我们都喜欢一碟松软的糖浆蛋糕
but I think we all like fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top,

而且我们都希望被指责的时候对方拿出证据
and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence!

用加拿大人的话来说 后会有期
So, as they say in Canada, peace oot!

证据 好主意 扫描他的传送门枪
Evidence! Good idea. Scan his portal gun!

哦 拜托 不要看别人的传送门枪历史记录啊
Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's portal-gun history.

谁都去过奇怪的地方
We-we all go to weird places.

没错 但似乎只有你一个人去过所有
Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to

谋杀发生的平行世界和其中谋杀发生的地点
the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred.

什么 那太不合Rick理了 我显然是被陷害的
What?! That's Rick-diculous! I'm obviously being set up.

地球C-137的Rick 委员会判处你受刑于极苦机械
Earth Rick c-137, the Council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom,

你的意识和无意识将被互换
which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds,

使你一切的憧憬都毫无意义 让你所知的一切都无法触及
rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp.

而且 每过十秒它就会扎一次你的蛋蛋
Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls.

我不想再听了
I've heard enough.

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

不不 没叫你
Unh-unh. Not you.

不
No!

啊
Aaaah!

哦 哦
Oh! Oh!

你好 我想点一大份人 加量
Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please.

白人 不不不不 黑人 再加一半西班牙裔
White people. No, no, no, no. Black people. And Hispanic on half.

欢迎来到油腻腻老奶奶世界

人口: 可多了 亲爱的

你好 我想点一大份沙发椅 多加点椅量
Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please.

高脚椅 不不不不 躺椅 和半个轮椅
High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner. And wheelchair on half.

- 哪个门都有可能  - 混...
- They could have gone into anyone of these. - Son of a...

- 天啊  - 哦天  - 我们跟丢了
- Oh, geez. - Oh, man! - We lost 'em.

你好 我想点一大份电话 加量
Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please.

手机 不不不不 旋转式电话 和半个公用电话
Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary. And pay phone on half.

这够他们忙一阵的了
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

他们肯定搞错了吧
Those guys were wrong right?

你不会杀掉你自己的 那些自己
You would not kill yourself... yourselves.

当然不会 Morty
Of course not, Morty.

这对我有啥好处
How could that profit me?

但是的确有人在杀Rick们
But someone out there is killing Ricks,

在我们洗清罪名之前 委员会不会善罢甘休
and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names

得找到真正的Rick杀手
by finding the real Rick-Killer.

我害怕 Rick
I'm scared, Rick.

我们是不是该回家准备点武器 就像《末日生存者》那节目一样
Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons, like that show "Doomsday Preppers."

国家地理频道电视节目

那不是我的风格 Morty
Not really my style, Morty.

而且 家里估计已经全是Rick了
Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now.

听好了 Jerry
All right, listen, Jerry.

如果Rick打电话来 这设备能追踪到他的位置
If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location.

你只需要把时间拖够30秒
You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer.

谁想喝柠檬汁
Who wants lemonade?

噢 太好了
Oh, yeah. Mmm!

哦 好喝
Oh! Delicious!

Beth 你真贤惠
Beth. You're a treasure.

在我的世界里也有一个像你一样的Beth 只不过
I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what?

她没有你那么美丽动人
She's not as brilliant or attractive.

哦 谢谢
Aw. Thank you.

她做到了 做到了
Oh! She did! She did it!

喂
H-hello?

嗨 Jerry 我是Rick
Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

Rick 嗨
Rick! Hey.

你好啊
What's, what's up?

听着 风声太紧 我们没地方可去
So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn,

所以 Morty和我打算把飞船开进黑洞
so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole.

- 什么  - 你能接受得了吧
- What? - Is that cool with you, dawg?

Rick 不 Morty
Rick, no! Morty!!

追踪到了
We got it.

电话来自...
The call's coming from...

这间屋子
inside the house

瞅瞅他的表情 你真傻
Look at his face! You dummy!

真不敢相信我们女儿能嫁给你
Ugh. Can't believe our daughter married you.

太容易了
Too easy!

这帮Rick应该会浪费些时间逗Jerry玩
The Rick are probably gonna waste some time missing with Jerry.

他们起不了什么作用的
They won't be able to help themselves.

但是等他们玩够了 就会来找我们
But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us.

您点的电话蛤蜊和意大利电面配电话丸
Phones a la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls.

- 还需要什么  - 再多来点电话条
- Anything else? - Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

马上来 先生
Right away, sir.

你知道吗 Rick 当我第一次看到那么多Rick和Morty时
You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Morty,

我在想 "天啊 我们的关系一下就不那么独特了"
I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond."

但是仔细想想 我们的关系一定非常特别
But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special

才能让我们跨越无数的时空紧紧相连
to span over all those different time lines.

只能是这样 你是一个掩护
Yeah, it's got to be that way. You're a camouflage.

掩护
Camouflage?

你在说什么 Rick
W-w-w-what are you talking about, Rick?

Rick的天才使得我们的脑电波非常独特且易追踪
Rick have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius.

躲避敌人雷达的最好办法就是
The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is

在一个可以使脑电波互补的人身边 这样就无法被追踪了
to stand near someone with complementary brain wave that make ours invisible.

明白吗 当Rick和Morty在一起时
See, w-w-w-when a Rick I-is with a Morty,

天才的脑电波就被抵消了 因为你有 呃
the genius waves get canceled out by the, Uh...

...Morty脑电波
...Morty waves.

是因为我们的性格非常不同吗
Um... because o-our personalities are so different?

哦 妈的
Oh, shit, dawg.

我的传送枪被人远端入侵了
My portal gun was hacked pemotely, Morty

很明显就是真凶 他想陷害我
Obviously by the real killer, to frame me.

但是我能追踪他的信号
But I was able to track the signal.

快 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

啊 噢
Uh-oh.

打扰了 我们追踪到一对极度危险的罪犯
Excuse me. We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals

就在这里
to this exact location.

他们和我们长得一模一样
They look exactly like us,

为了避免混淆 我们用红叉
so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us

标记自己
each with a red "X" right now.

这样的话 如果谁有枪
That ways, if someone has a gun and we both tell you

而我们都说杀掉另一个"我" 因为他才是那个坏人
to shoot the other one because they're the evil one,

你就知道是谁在说谎了
you'll know who's lying.

嗨 看那
Hey, check it out.

妈的
Damn it!

嗨 你还没给钱呢
Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

红叉 红叉
T-the red "X"! Red "X"!

嗨 还好那家宇宙折扣店 有这款实验室外套
Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats

和你最爱的小黄体恤衫 是吧 Morty
and you favorite kind of shirt in stock, Huh, Morty?

对 Rick 你都说了好几遍了
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time.

你不用老说这个事儿了
You don't have to keep saying it over and over.

这地方真够偏僻的
Man, this place is way off the grid.

这家伙真不想让人发现
This guy does not want to be found.

如果这家伙是Rick 是不是他也需要用Morty来隐藏自己
Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just to stand by a Morty to hide?

Morty不就起这个作用吗
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are

人肉隐身衣
Human cloaking devices?

Morty 你这反应实在是有点小题大做了
Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.

我的天啊 Rick 看
Oh, my god, Rick, look!

有好多人被绑起来 盖满了那栋建筑
There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!

不是人 是Morty们
Not people, Morty. Mortys.

天啊
Oh, god!

为什么有人会这么干
W-w-why would somebody do this?

太残忍了
It's horrible!

想不被官僚体系的走狗发现 一个Morty足够了
Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats,

但你得用一个Morty矩阵 并且让他们极度痛苦
but you get- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain,

才能瞒过其他的Rick [哔]
that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks mother[Bleep]

我以前构想过一个类似的概念
I fiddled with a concept like this once.

理论上 Morty 只是理论上
On paper, Morty. On paper.

我是不会做这种事的 这就是粗劣的浪费和滥用
I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill.

达到相同的效果 完全只需要
I mean, you could accomplish the same result with,

五个Morty和一个跨接电缆
like, five Mortys and a jumper cable.

这我也不会真做的
Which I also wouldn't do!

我只是想表示 他这技术太烂了
I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.

咖啡时间
Coffee time!

好 哟 哟 哟
Yeah! Yo, yo, yo, yo!

就等这个呢
That's what I like to hear!

嗨 Jerry
Hi, Jerry.

别烦我 我在工作
Leave me alone. I'm working.

是吗 你是做什么的
Oh, you are? W-w-w-what do you do?

我是做广告的 待业中
I-I'm, I'm in between advertising jobs.

广告 哇
Advertising? Wow!

就是说 大家不知道自己应该买什么东西 你的工作就是帮助他们
So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then you help them?

要更复杂一点
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

你就是干这个的
Well, I mean, you do it,

而且你看起来干这行就很厉害
and you seem like a guy who really has it all together.

老兄 你是
Dude, are you,

你是在讽刺我 对吗
You're being a dick, right?

哦 天啊 不 不是
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not.

我一点都不想冒犯你
I-I-I wouldn't want to offend you in any way.

你真的是Rick吗
You're really a rick?

我当然是 就像我的Morty是一个Morty一样
Of course I am, just as much as my Morty's a Morty.

嗨 他长得好像《面具》里的Eric Stoltz
Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "Mask."

《面具》 1985年电影 Cher和Eric Stoltz均为主演

故事主角是一个面部严重扭曲的年轻男孩

就是里面有雪儿的那部
You know, the one with Cher in it?

对的 Jerry
That's right, Jerry!

他来自的时空 所有的人长得都像Eric Stoltz的《面具》里的人
He-- he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz "Mask" people.

他是Eric Stoltz面具版Morty
He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

他是被分配给我的 因为我从来没有我自己的小孩
They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own.

但我如果有小孩
But if I did, boy,

我希望他们能像你一样聪明成功
I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.

嗨 瞧啊
Hey, get a load of this.

Jerry在和傻瓜Rick聊天
Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick.

你俩真配
This is perfect.

我不是傻瓜Rick
I'm not boofus Rick!

我是从J19-ZETA-7空间来的Rick
I'm Rick J19-ZETA-7!

噢 那个空间的人不都是吃屎长大的吗
Oh, is that the time line where everybody eats poop?

Jerry 你知道这家伙吃屎吗
Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?

嗨 我不吃屎
Hey, I don't eat poop!

你们总是欺负我
Y-You guys are always so mean to me.

我觉得我应该告诉你 Jerry
I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry.

我是所有Rick当中最差劲的
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

谁说的 其他的你吗
According to who, other versions of you?

要说我这辈子如果明白了什么
If I've learned one thing,

不论你在人生中做什么决定
it's that before you get anywhere in life,

都不要听你自己的
you got to stop listening to yourself.

哇 你真是太有智慧了 Jerry
Wow. you really are wise, Jerry.

所以你才会做广告工作吧
I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising.

你能这么想 你就已经是最棒的Rick了
The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.

你从来就没关心过我
You don't care about me at all!

我和你的外套没任何区别
I'm no different than that jacket you've got on!

或者是你的破传送枪
Y-y-y--o-or your stupid portal gun!

我就是个工具
I'm just a tool!

我 我 我就是个物件
I-I-I'm just an object!

你非要这么较真我也没办法 Morty
Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty.

现在 看在上帝的份上 安静点吧
Now, for the love of god, be quiet.

咱们必须要先发制人
The point of this is to get the drop on the guy.

Rick 我告诉你
You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something!

我不只是个人肉护盾
I'm more than a human shield!

对 你说得非常对
Yeah, that's right. You are.

你是完美的 无可穿透的人体护甲 Morty
You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty,

因为我有多聪明你就有多傻
because you're as dumb as I am smart,

所以当我说"闭嘴"时 你最好乖乖闭嘴
which is why when I say "shut up," it's really good advice.

全拜你所赐 Morty
Great, nice work, Morty.

看看你自己 C-137 你真是个难对付的客户
Ooh. Look at you, C-137. You, aren't you a tough customer.

慢慢鼓掌 没搞错吧(各种电影反派经典登场)
The slow clap? Really?

这有点被玩烂了吧 老兄
Kind of played out, dude.

在这个次元还没有
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

事实上 这就是我发明的 这里以前没人这么干过
In fact I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before.

哎哟 真是好厉害呢
Well, La-di-da.

嘿 别学我
Hey, that's mine!

我不喜欢那个Rick的样子 Morty
I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty.

我们得逃出去
We got to escape.

我才不会帮你呢 Rick
I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

你是个怪物
Y-you're a monster.

别蛮不讲Rick理 Morty
Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty.

你能不能别这么说话了 很蠢的
W-will you stop saying that? It's stupid.

把他的Morty带走
Take his Morty away.

- 跟我走  - 好啊 高兴得很
- Come with me. - Yeah, gladly.

天哪 这些个Rick啊
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

嘿 老兄 你好像知道这里是怎么运作的
Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works.

有没有什么方法可以关闭这些线路
Is there any way we could shut down that grid

放掉外面那些Morty
and rescue all those Mortys outside?

这样做毫无意义
It would be pointless.

Morty们根本没机会打败Rick
Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.

进去吧
In here.

多美啊 不是吗
Ah. Isn't it beautiful?

是啊是啊 就像梦幻庄园的发薪日
Yeah, yeah. Looks like payday at Neverland Ranch in here.

梦幻庄园 曾是迈克尔杰克逊的私家游乐园和住所 财政状况不佳

叮
Zing!

他听懂了
That guy got it.

啊 啊 啊 Rick 安静
Unh-unh-unh, Rick, quiet.

别错过了我的交响曲
You're missing my symphony.

嘿 我觉得比蒙福之子的歌好听
Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons. Zip!

Mumford & Sons 英国民谣乐队 拿过第五十五届格莱美

这家伙真上道
This guy is on it!

他可不是在笑你的蠢笑话 Rick
He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick.

那不过是他每隔10秒随意发出的声音
That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds.

看吧 Rick 你不像你想象的那么聪明
You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are.

是我想让你找到我
I wanted you to find me.

我们没有多大的差别 你和我
We're not so different, you and I.

可不是嘛
Yeah, Duh!

看见这个了吗 Rick
See this right here, Rick?

我进行了大规模数字运算
I crunched the numbers.

然后列出了所有的Rick
I created a spectrum of all the Ricks.

我按照邪恶的程度来排列他们
I listed them out from most evil to least evil.

我在这里
Here's where I am.

看 你就在这里 Rick
And look it right here's where you are, Rick.

而这里这家伙 超级古怪
This guy right here, super-weird.

我懂了 你想让我跟你合作
I get it. So you want me to team up with you

去搞垮Rick议会 对吗
to take down the council of Ricks, right?

你就想干这个对吧
Is that where you're going with this?

因为我就会这么干
'Cause that's where I'd be going.

得了吧 我自己做得挺好的
Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.

我只用把你大脑的内容下载下来
I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain

然后杀了你
and then kill you.

好 如果我们加入一点硝酸钛
Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate

还有少量的氯化酒石酸盐
and just a tad of chlorified tartrate.

不用烤的巧克力蛋糕
Ovenless brownies!

嗯 嗯 太了不起了
Mmm. Mmm! It's incredible

天才的头脑能完成多么美妙的事啊 只要弄明白什么才是最重要的
What a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order.

过奖了 不是我一个人的功劳 Jerry
Well, come on. I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

这是你的想法 来吧 Jerry
It was your idea. Come here, Jerry!

嘿 过来
Hey, come here.

我想给你看个东西
I-I want to show you something.

好 看 所有人因为我买了这个而嘲笑我
Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me getting these,

但是你是天才科学家 你觉得如何
but you're a genius scientist. What do you think?

总统头像的地方刻的是星球大战机器人
There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be.

这么说吧 Jerry 我不会告诉你说
You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you

这些东西会升值 或者保值
what these will increase in value or even hold there current value.

但是 你买这些东西就是因为你喜欢
The truth is, you bought them because you like them.

他们对你来说很有价值 这就够了
They have value to you. That's what matters.

你会在这待多久
How long are you staying?

直到我们找到你的Rick
Untill we find your Rick.

我已经找到了
I found mine.

已经找到了
I found mine.

救命
Help!

逃不出去的 孩子
There is no escape, my son.

我们可以在来世寻得宁静
We will find our peace in the next world.

那 你们就这么放弃了吗
So what Y-y-y-you're just gonna give up?

我们是屈从于本真Morty的神力
We're giving in to the power of the one true Morty.

总有一天 他会回来的
One day, he will return.

赞美本真Morty
Praise the one true Morty.

善美Morty

我觉得我们不该上这种网站

Morty 快看这个网页

好了 Morty们 听着
All right, Mortys, listen up.

我叫Morty Smith 来自地球空间C-137
My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137.

我知道你们很害怕 因为我也很害怕
I know you're are scared, because I'm scared.

但那不是我们臣服于命运的借口
But that's no reason to accept our fate!

我们是Morty 我们的存在和Rick无关
We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick!

我们的命运由自己掌握
Our destiny is our own!

听起来好像本真Morty会说的话
This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.

我受够了做人肉护盾
I'm sick of being a human shield.

我想当一个园丁
I-I-I w- I want to be a gardener!

我想写真正疯狂刺激的动作小说
I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!

我不只是一个铁锤
I'm more than just a hammer!

他就是本真Morty
He is the one true Morty!

本真Morty
The one true Morty!

喂 老实点
Hey, keep it down!

你的人生真精彩呀 Rick
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

真可惜你看不到你的人生走向终结了
It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.

你在哭吗 为了一个Morty
You're crying? Over a Morty?

不 我只是对蠢货过敏
No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

真可悲
Ugh. Pathetic.

我们都知道 如果世界上有什么真理
We both know that if there's any truth in the universe,

那就是Rick从来不会在意Morty
it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.

尽管来吧 小混蛋
Do your worst, you little bastards!

杀了我啊 来啊 来啊
Kill me! Do it! Do it!

Morty 谢天谢地 把我弄出来
Morty! Thank god! Get me out of this.

快啊
Come on!

你真幸运 我不是Rick
You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

知道啦 没时间扯这些了
Point taken, but this is no time for arcs.

喂 你好
Yeah, hello.

嘿 我和O.J.有什么不同
Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?

O.J.辛普森 著名的辛普森杀妻案

啊 你是谁
Huh? W-who is this?

不同点就在于 我找到真凶啦 贱人
I found the real killer, bitch!

快过来吧
Get over here!

喂 傻瓜 完事了 该走了
Yo, Ding-Dong, we're done here. Time to go.

哦 Jerry 我想该说再见了
Well, Jerry I guess this means goodbye.

啊 一定要走吗
W-w-well, does it have to?

我是说 你 你长得跟Rick一样
I mean, you, you look just like Rick.

说不定我们可以 除掉他
We could maybe, you know, get rid of him.

我可不是说一定要杀了他
I'm not saying kill him, necessarily.

我 我也不是说一定不能杀了他 但是
I, I'm also not saying necessarily not to kill him, but

Jerry 我们都知道 没用的
Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work.

是时候回归各自的生活了
It's time to go back to our lives.

我爱你 Jerry 我爱你
I love you Jerry, I love you.

这些Morty会怎么样
W-what, w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys?

回家里 照常上学
They'll go back to their fimilies, attend school regularly,

玩电子游戏 交女朋友
play video games, date girls.

没了Rick的可怜小混蛋们
Poor little Rick-less bastards.

地球Rick C-137 委员会为其错误的指控道歉
Earth Rick C-137, the council apologizes for its false accusation,

作为对我们犯下的错误的弥补
and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake,

我们将给予你这张票券作为补偿
we would like to compensate you with this voucher

用于免费换取一个替代的Morty
for a free replacement Morty in the event that

以防你当前的Morty...
your current Morty should...

你们能选个好点的时机吗
Uh, guys, not a good time.

Morty 我们走
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

现在能说了吧
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

我这个人肉隐形衣还是很厉害的
I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device.

救了你一命
Saved your ass.

行了 Morty
All right, Morty.

少得意了 小心把逼吹破
Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.

真是难以置信 Rick
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

刚才那么好的机会
That right there, that w- that was a great opportunity

你能稍微有点人性吗
to show a little humanity, you know?

和我稍微增进点感情
to connect with me a little.

你要想增进感情 去加入个什么傻逼俱乐部
Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club,

就和那帮傻Rick一样
like all those dumb Ricks.

或许我不愿意真情流露
You know, maybe I don't connect

是因为我是最Rick的Rick
because I'm the Rick-est Rick there is.

所以 不用说
And, you know, it would g-go without saying

最Rick的Rick身边会有最Morty的Morty
that the rickest Rick would have the Morty-est Morty.

不用说 是吗
It would go without saying, huh?

当然了 你听见我说出来了吗
Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?

没
Nah.

最Morty的Morty
The Morty-est Morty.

不要太得意了 Bstuer Brown
Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown.

一个自大的Morty会导致很严重的后果
A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems.

对大家都没好处
It can be a real bad thing for everybody.

是吗 为什么
Oh, yeah? How's that?

你再大点我会跟你解释清楚的
U-uh, I'll explain when you're older.

真惨
What a mess.

Buster Brown 漫画角色 一个特别淘气的小男孩

骄者必亡
Pride cometh before the fall.

他这算是罪有应得了吧
I guess he got what he deserved.

那是什么
What is that?

把激光除解器递给我
Hand me the laser defibulator.

我能来帮忙吗
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

不 打扫厕所去
No! Go clean the toilets.

或不定有便便愿意和你交朋友
Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.

你让我们觉得做自己很惭愧
You make us ashamed to be ourselves.

天 我以前见过这种科技
My god. I've seen this technology before.

这个Rick被人远程遥控了
This Rick was being controlled remotely,

是别的什么人的傀儡
peppeteered by somebody else.

这是接收器
This is the receiver.

可是发射器在哪儿呢
Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

Blonde Redhead 《For The Damaged Coda》

Wubba dubba dub dub
Wubba dubba dub dub!

没什么 我只是来 检查下烟雾报警器
Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.

行吧 快出去
All right. Ok, get out.

那个傻逼在那儿干嘛
What's that dipshit doing out there?

你和他是朋友
Are you friends with him?

你知道他吃自己的屎的吧
You know he eats his own shit, right?

天啊 太有料了
Oh, my god, this is rich!

得有10个Rick我要打电话过去
I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.

Morty和我在车库里弄的合成激光鳗鱼正在氧化呢
Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage.

喂 好好听我说
Hey, don't blow me off.

我要定个规矩
I am drawing a line, okay?

要是我们回来发现房子和孩子有任何损伤
Any damage to this house or these children when we get back,

你就再也不能跟Morty去冒险了
and...n-no more adventures with Morty.

噢 天哪 Rick
Aw, geez, Rick.

要是我妈都这么说了 那肯定是认真的
If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.

- 没错  - 没错
- That's right. - That's right.

等等 啥
Wait. What?

听着 作为看护者我可以承诺
Listen, you have my words as a caregiver,

一切都会没事的
everything's gonna be fine.

万一有事 那就听你的 不跟Morty去冒险了
And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever.

就像那首老歌唱的
It's like that old song

"Blop blop-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"
"Blop blop-a noop noop a-noop noop noop."

你们不知道这首歌吗 Tiny Rogerts唱的
Y-you guys know that song? From Tiny Rogerts?

没听说过吗
You never heard of it?

就是 50年代的黑人娘炮
You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?

都不知道吗 唉 算了
No-nobody? A-all right, whatever.

管他的呢 快去你们那蠢旅游吧
Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip.

家里不准搞任何破坏
Not one thing out of place.

一处都不行
Not a single thing.

哇 既然已经踏上了不归路
Well, we're past the point of no return.

我要开个派对
I'm going to have a party.

我找到Jello了 你能把你妈的伏特加偷出来吗
I found Jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka?

她当然有 我在你们家洗衣房里看到了
Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room.

听着 你们两个不能同时否认啊
Listen, you can't both be in denial about it.

好 再见
Okay bye.

Summer 不许你开派对
Summer, you can't throw a party!

记得老妈讲的吗
Remember what mom said?

是啊 要是事情搞砸了 你和外公Rick会受惩罚
Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished.

而我嘛 只是个普通人 Morty
I'm only a human being, Morty.

Rick 快告诉Summer不许开派对
Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!

Summer 你不能开派对
Uh, Summer, you can't have a party.

因为我要开派对 小妞
Because I'm having a party, bitch!

什么 Rick 不行
Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!

你说你要开派对是什么意思
What do you mean  you're having a party?

会有第三次元的鼻涕怪
Are some glip glops from the third dimension

跑过来打牌吗
going to come over and play cards or something?

"鼻涕怪" 你真走运 没让塔夫落基人听见
"Glip glop?" You're lucky a Trafilorkian doesn't hear you say that.

这是他们的敏感词吗
Is that like their N-word?

就好像敏感词和屏蔽词生了个娃
It's like the N-word and the C-word had a baby

然后被各种侮辱犹太人的词汇养大
and it was raised by all the bad words for jews.

听我说 我觉得我们三个可以
Listen, I think the three of us could just,

玩点简单的 比如出去逛逛街
have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know,

类似这种亲人间的互动
you know, doing a little bonding and...

去你的 这可是我和那些酷家伙
Screw that. This is my chance to

建立关系的机会
gain some footing with the cool kids.

这就是你开派对的目的
That's why you party?

孩子 你还真是花季少女啊
Boy, you really are 17.

那你为什么开派对
Why do you party?

当然是要嗨翻天啊 小屁孩
To get wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!

让你那些科幻朋友
Just keep your Sci-fi friends

离我的酷炫朋友远一点
away from my awesome ones.

好啊 你也让你的酷炫朋友
Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends

离我的小鱼面包远一点
away from my canapes.

晚餐过后 泰坦尼克2号 就会
After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to

泰坦尼克

享受浪漫

经典重现

被轨道系统引导到我们的假冰山
the rail system near our replica iceberg,

然后这些管道里的液压
and the hydraulics encased in these tubes

会将整艘船沉入冰冷的海底
will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.

这么经典的东西用这么老套的轨道系统
A rail system seems archaic for a attraction this impressive.

确定会沉吗
Are you sure the ship will sink?

我可以保证这船会沉的 它都沉了几千次了
I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before.

它是必沉无疑的
It is un-unsinkable.

看 这是去船头的队伍
Look, it's the line for bow!

Jerry 我好想回去边喝酒边看书
Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a margarita and read.

不介意我跳过"我是世界之王"的桥段吧
Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?

这不是"我是世界之王"的桥段
Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit.

那是Jack和Fabrizio
That's Jack and Fabrizio.

这里是Rose对Jack说 "Jack 我在飞翔"桥段
This is where Rose says, "I'm flying Jack!"

随便吧 当独自来演戏的也没差
But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone.

那 她怎么样
Well, what about her?

打扰一下 女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

你能否代替我一下
Would you like my place in line?

我 可能会有麻烦的
I, uh, I could get into trouble.

我们不会说出去的
We won't tell.

所以 你也是泰坦尼克迷吗
So... You're a Titanicfanatic?

恩 是的 我从刚开张就在这工作了
Oh, yes. I worked here since it opened,

但是我从来都没能参与进来
but I've never been able participate.

乐意效劳 Rose
Happy to help... Rose.

我超爱看多P群射的 不过
I love watching Bukkake. I mean, like,

我不知道自己情不情愿这么做
I don't know if I personally would ever do it...

The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?

外公
Ugh! Grandpa!

鸟人
Birdperson!

很高兴没有紧急情况
I am pleased there is no emergency.

真有紧急情况 是操蛋的情况啦
Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A f**king emergency!

你上次打炮是什么时候啊 老哥
When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?

鸟人的交配季真是 不容易啊
It has been a... challenging mating season for Birdperson.

那今晚你可以鸟嘴湿润啦 客官
Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah.

去找点乐子吧 鸟鸟鸟人
Go have some fun out there. Birdp-Bird-Birdperson.

天呐 你到底请了多少人啊 Rick
Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?

人类吗 6个
Uh... people? Mm, six.

唷 你们好吗 鼻涕怪
Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

我靠
Oh, man!

你们知不知道家里是有垃圾桶的
Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?

我靠 搞什么
Hey, uh, what the hell?

噢 这就是为什么不能邀请肉食怪和素食怪
Ooh. That's why you never invite a Floopy Poop and

参加同一个派对
a Shmoopy doop to the same party.

噢 噢 这太恶了
Oh, oh, g--oh, that's disgusting!

你们居然在我父母的床上搞
You guys are in my parents bed!

哦 对不起 我就是有点不舒服
Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well.

想躺一会儿
I just needed to lie down for a bit.

哦 好 不好意思
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

天啊 这是在逗我吗
Oh, my god! Are you kidding me?!

大家都不了解齿轮战争的主要原因是
The thing people don't realize about the gear wars is

他们根部不了解齿轮
that it was never really about the gears at all.

哦 对 绝对的
Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no to-totally.

Rick 你要快点停止
Rick, you got to stop

Morty
Morty!

你见过齿轮头吗
Have you met Gearhead?

嗨 你好
Hey, how's

Morty 他非常想听听关于齿轮产战争的事
Morty here, he he would love to hear all about the gear wars.

你对齿轮战争了解多少
How familiar are you with the gear wars, exactly?

呃 完全没头绪
Uh... not at all.

噢 太好了 我嫉妒你
Oh, boy. I envy you.

好的 这要从754年前说起
Okay, it was about 754 years ago.

噢 嗨 Morty
Oh, hey Morty!

给你介绍我的好朋友螃蟹人
Have you-- have you met my buddy Scropon?

又来了 Rick
Not again, Rick.

上个家伙陈词滥调的给我讲了20分钟
That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know?

于此同时整座房子快被摧毁了
And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!

哇 Morty 这家伙的整个星球都被摧毁了
Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.

放尊重点
Have a little perspective.

嗨 Rick 真是个屎瓜派对啊 老兄
Hey, Rick, Squanchy  party, bro!

屎瓜奇
Aw! Squanchy!

这里有没有好地方让我屎瓜一下
Is there a good place for me to squanchar round here?

屎瓜奇 你可以随处屎瓜
Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man.

米卡苏卡萨 老兄
Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

太好了
All right!

我喜欢你的屎瓜
I like your squanch!

Rick 屎瓜究竟是什么意思
Uh, Rick what exactly is "squanching"?

Morty 听着 在过去的一年中我们经理过这么多超酷的历险
Morty, listen we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year,

现在是时候放松一下了
but it's time to relax.

如果我现在放松的话 估计以后我们就没法历险了
Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!

天哪 Morty 你愁死我了
Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out.

在这几个小时内 咱们能不能假装什么事都没发生
Can't we just pretend like every thing's fine for a few hours,

然后好好享受一下 所有事以后再说
enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?

你说的容易啊 Rick
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick.

因为你什么都不在乎
You know, you like not caring about stuff.

可我怎么办
You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?

别捣乱 慢动作孟巴斯
Knock it off, Slow Mobius!

哈哈 对不起 老兄 我就想秀一下我的超能力
Ha ha! sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!

不敢相信 她真的来了
I can't believe she's here.

那你还傻站着干嘛Morty
Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty?

去和他搭讪啊
Go. Talk to her.

今夜 你的目标就是壮大自己的男子气概
Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.

噢 Rose
Oh, Rose. Whee!

这个 不会是我想的那个吧
Is that what I think it is?

嗯 每对情侣都有机会重演Jack在海上淹死的桥段
Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.

太浪漫了
It's so romantic.

我等不及和Beth一起经历
I can't wait to do that with beth.

我不明白 Jerry
I don't know, Jerry.

恕我直接 你老婆看起似不怎么感兴趣
With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.

快看
Look!

前方有冰山
Iceberg, right ahead!

自助餐现已关闭
The buffet is now closed.

前方有冰山 自助餐现已关闭
Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.

长官
Uh, sir?

没有出现故障
There's not a problem.

什么叫没有出现故障
What do you mean there's not a problem?

制导系统没有把我们带入碰撞航线
The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course.

船就要错过冰山了
This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!

快想办法
Well, do something!

转舵 撞上去
Steer into it!

我尽力
I'm trying!

太迟了
It's too late.

女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

不要振作起来
Don't brace yourselves.

不 不 搞什么啊
No! No! What happened?!

他们的制导系统坏了
Their rail system must have failed.

我的天啊 我们沉不了了
Oh, my god! we're not gonna sink!

今晚一定要搞个女的
Totally gonna get laid tonight.

我喜欢你的羽毛
I like your feathers.

它们就是为了吸引异性
They are designed to attract the attention of the female.

看来起作用了
It's working.

Tammy 我应该告诉你
Tammy, I should let you know

我刚与我的灵魂配偶结束了一段密切的结合
I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.

我不需要灵魂结合
I'm not looking to get into a soul bond.

我需要的是
I'm just looking for...

相信这个我能做到
I believe birdperson can arrange that.

Summer 好久没见你上长笛练习课了
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.

Summer 别告诉我你认识她
Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her.

你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

我都不知道她来干嘛
I don't even know what she's doing here.

这不行 Summer 这是个派对
Whoa. Not cool, Summer. This is a party.

所有人都应该被受欢迎
Everybody should be welcome.

麻烦了 是谁邀请的阿道夫·林肯勒?
Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?

不是所有人都应该被受欢迎的吗
I thought everyone was welcome.

这不一样
It's not the same Summer.

林肯勒是个疯子
Lincoler is a crazed maniac

他是由阿道夫希特勒和亚布拉罕林肯的基因混合创造出来的
just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral super leader

奥地利裔德国政治人物，纳粹党党魁，1934年至1945年为德国元首.

Adolf Hitler 阿道夫·希特勒

Abraham Lincoln 亚伯拉罕·林肯 美国政治家、思想家。第16任美国总统，颁布了《宅地法》、《解放黑人奴隶宣言》

道德中立的超级领袖
by combing the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.

但结果却是一个差劲 神经的失败者
Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.

Rick 你把我带到这世上 让我看到了这个苦难 罪恶的
Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured

二次元世界
by the duality of its being.

或许我应该在你生命流逝中看到世界的和平
But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body!

靠 你干什么 老兄
Whoa. What's up, man?

和你没关系 娃
I have no quarrel with you, boy.

"娃" 你什么意思
"Boy"? What's that supposed to mean?

只是 听着 我不是有意的  只是
It's just... look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but...

别看我 老哥
Don't look at me, dude.

你瞧 我有一半是亚伯拉罕·林肯 所以
Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so

所以我应该跪在你面前 拍你马屁吗
So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!

这 不是 但是 那个...
Well, no, but... you know?

那个什么
What do I know?

第三帝国将会统治一千年
That the third Reich will reign for a thousand years?

 纳粹德国有两个官方国名

分别为1933年至1939年使用的第三帝国和1939年至1945年的大德意志帝国.

别烦他 Brad
Leave him alone, Brad.

闪一边去 Jessica
Stay out of this, Jessica!

打他 Brad 打他 打他
Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass!

打他 打他
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

Brad
Brad!

蠢货
Stupid!

Rick
Rick!

我这是在帮你Morty
I just did you a favor, Morty.

不好意思让你看到了刚刚的局面
Sorry about all that.

Rick的狐朋狗友可多了
Rick has some really strange friends.

Brad简直就是个混球
Brad is such a jerk.

整天想着该如何逞男人
He's always tyring to prove what a man he is.

我只想找个温柔体贴的男朋友罢了
I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.

Jessica 我带你去看些东西吧
Jessica, can I show you something?

哇 瞧瞧这里的东西
Wow, look at all this stuff.

是啊 这里可是我和外公Rick的科学工作室
Yeah. This is me and my Granda Rick's sci-fi workshop.

看看这个
Check this out.

好漂亮哦
It's beautiful.

其实嘛 Jessica
You know, Jessica.

我有些想和你说却一直没说出口的话
There's something I've always wanted to tell you.

那是什么啊 Morty
What's that, Morty?

- 我觉得你是世界上  - 不 那个
- I think that you're the most... - No, that...

衣柜里好像传出了奇怪的声音
Those weird sounds coming from the closet over there.

- 我的天哪  - 喂 我在这里屎瓜呢
- Oh My God. - Hey, I'm squanching in here.

天哪 真是恶心透了
Oh my god, that is so disgusting.

好痛 哦 啊 完了
Ow... oh, oh, crap.

天上有硕大的行星
Big star in the sky.

供氧不成问题的大气层
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

巨型的睾状怪物
Giant testicle monsters.

这里没问题 我们继续狂欢吧
We'll be fine. Let's party.

我对天发誓 Morty
I swear to god, Morty.

要不是里面那群人还在狂欢
If it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there,

我现在肯定在对你发火
I would be so furious with you right now.

听到了没 Morty
Oh, man. You hear that, Morty.

你可真把Summer惹毛了
You really lucked out with Summer on that one.

你们是怎么保持淡定的
How are you guys not freaking out right now?

整栋屋子现在可都在异次元
The whole house is sitting in another dimension.

我们该怎么办啊
I mean, what the hell are we supposed to do?

爸妈回来 会秒杀我们的
Mom and dad are gonna kill us.

- 我要疯掉了啊 Rick  - 冷静 Morty 冷静
- I'm losing it here, Rick. - Relax, Morty, relax.

没事的
It's gonna be fine.

我们只要出去找些凯拉辛结晶回来就行了
All we have to do is go out and find us some Kalaxian Crystals.

我操
Shit, mother f**kers.

Morty 这里以南几英里的地方就有凯拉辛结晶了
Kalaxian Crystals, Morty, just a few miles south of here.

行 我们出发吧
Ok, let's go then.

我们必须现在去找结晶 Rick
We got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.

等 等 等 Morty 我不能和你去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, I can't go with you.

我得呆在这里 保证这里一切安好
I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know.

我是说 万一有人不下心摔碎了什么的
I mean, who knows what... what if somebody breaks something?

我也是 得留下来
Yeah, me too. I should stay.

你们谁有阿司匹林吗
You guys have any Aspirin?

Morty 太好了
Oh, hey, Morty. This is perfect.

你可以带着林肯勒一起去
You can take Lincoler with you.

拜托 我现在哪里也不去 没看见我受伤了吗
Hey man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.

闭嘴 林肯勒
Shut up, Lincoler.

这是作为损毁客厅的补偿
It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.

对哦 Nancy 你也应该去的
Yeah, and Nancy, you should go too.

什么 为什么是我
What? Why... why me?

因为 因为你 很会吹笛子嘛
Because... you... you're so good at playing the flute.

不好意思给大家带来了不便
Sorry for the inconvenience folks.

泰坦尼克

我们应该很快就能进行沉船了
We should resume sinking shortly.

与此同时 请待在船上
In the mean time, please stay on the ship

客户服务

并享受这免费赠送的卡梅隆洋葱圈
and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion Rings.

真是太好了 船不沉就算了
Great. Not only the ship not sinking,

还被剧透了
but now the fourth wall has been broken.

我要回房 去看完那本小说了
I am gonna go back to the room and finish my book.

你应该去找那个叫Lucy的女人
You should find that Lucy woman.

但 但是
But...but...

那个 Jerry 我带你去看些东西吧
You see, Jerry. May I show you something?

如果一切按照计划行驶
Had everything gone as planned,

这整片区域都会被淹没
this entire area would be underwater.

我挺想看到那场景的
I would have liked to see it.

真是一场"泰坦尼克"悲剧啊 懂吗
This trip has been a "Titanic" faliure. Get it?

- 哦哦哦  - 抱我 Jerry
- Ooh. - Draw me, Jerry.

天哪 那个 Lucy 啊
Oh... boy... Lucy, wow...

这 和我想象的不太一样
Uh... This isn't what I had in mind.

但是时刻总算到来了
But it's the perfect moment.

我们梦寐了16年的场景啊
We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.

那个 不是像现在这样的 也不是和你
Um... Not like this... Not...not with you.

- 你会抱我的  - 啊啊啊
- You are gonna draw me. - Aah.

然后你要在那辆车里干我
Then you're going to f**k me in that car over there.

说来也奇怪 我觉得所有男人都生来是平等的
It's weird, cause I definitely think that all men are created equal.

- 但是 与此同时又  - 行了
- But, at the same time... - Okay...

结晶应该就在这里附近了
Um... the crystals should be really close.

在那里
There they are.

等等 这里不太对劲
Wait. Something's not right.

快拿结晶
Get the crystals.

野兽交给我处理就好
I'll handle the beast.

准备从你那可悲的基因里解脱吧
Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes.

Summer会重新喜欢上我的
Summer's gonna like me again.

林肯勒 快 我们快离开这里吧
Lincoler, come on. Let's get out of here.

我的旅程结束了 Morty
My journey is over, Morty.

我有件重要的事要告诉你
I have something important to tell you.

*我的齿轮 旋转了千年*
*And the gears, they tuned for a thousand years*

*直到末日才终结*
*Until the dark day that they stopped*

Rick 我拿到了 我拿到结晶了
Rick, I got them. I got the crystals.

太好了 Morty
Alright, you did it, Morty.

Rick 等等
Rick, wait.

你得知道件事情
There's something you need to know.

不是林肯勒 我们是绝对拿不到结晶的
I couldn't have done it without Lincoler.

他说他很抱歉
He said that he was really sorry

然后 他一直像爱爸爸那样爱着你
and that he loves you like a father.

他只是想被你接受
He only wanted you to accept him

他希望自己所做的最后一点一滴能挽回他在你心中的印象
and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.

他牺牲了自己来拯救大家 Rick
He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick.

他死了
He died.

至少他没有白白牺牲
Well, at least he didn't die in vain.

他拿到了结晶
He got these crystals.

而这些宝贝们来拯救这无聊至极的派对了
And these babies just saved this lame-ass party.

Wubba lubba dub dub
Wubba lubba dub dub.

放点什么啦 快点 放点音乐
Play something. Somebody, play something.

等等 你说什么
Wait a minute, what?

*右脚往前踩 左脚往后踏*
*Put your right foot forward and your left foot back*

*像诺迪克跑步机 两边走动*
*Then slide around like a NordicTrack*

*往左*
*Move to the left*

*往右*
*Step to the right*

*抖抖胳膊 看看灯*
*Wiggle your elbows, and look up into the light*

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

慢动作孟巴斯 来一束时间光波
Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam.

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

这就是Rick舞
That's the Rick dance. Alright.

刚刚那是个啥
What the hell was that?

我以为找结晶是为了让我们回家
I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something.

什么 不 不 不 我随时都能把我们送回去
What? No, no, no... I can get us home whenever I want to.

对了 说起那些结晶
But, listen. Speaking of those crystals,

其余能给我吗
can I get the rest of them?

我渐渐回来了 Morty
I'm starting to come down, Morty.

凯拉辛结晶效果强劲就是时效太短
Crystal Kalaxian is a strong but fleeting high.

我就是这么看这结晶的 Rick
That's what I think of your crystals, Rick.

Morty 你个蠢货
Oh, Morty. You idiot.

还有谁有K-辛么
Does anybody else have any more K-Lax?

鸟人 屎瓜
Birdperson? Squanchy?

不要屎瓜我啦
Don't squanch at me.

好了 大伙 派对正式结束
Alright, everybody. Party is officially over.

Rick 现在立刻把我们带回家
Rick, take us home now.

行啦 行啦 行啦 Morty 你个派对老鼠屎
Alright, alright. Fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill.

- Morty 你太可恶了  - 管你叫什么名字的 你最烂了
- Boo, boo. Morty sucks. - Boo. You suck whatever your name is.

烂透了 Morty 你烂到爆了
Boo. Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

齿轮才刚刚开始转呢
But these gears just started turning.

快画完了吗 Jerry
Almost finished, Jerry?

呃 快了
Uh, almost.

我还没有完全捕捉到你美丽双眸的神韵
I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.

肯定也差不多了 快过来
I'm sure it's good enough,move!

每个周末都有几对Jack和Rose在这辆车上度过他们的泰坦尼克浪漫之旅
Every weekend Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car,

而我负责事后清理
and I have to mop it up.

这厢板掉下来能让清理容易点
The floor drops out to make it easier.

现在轮到我在车里翻云覆雨了
But now it's my turn.

我们将会达到快乐的巅峰 把车里搞得雾气腾腾
We're going to get it， nice and steamy in there,

我要在有蒸汽的玻璃上留下一个大手印
And I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint.

然后你要进入我的身体 好好爱惜我
And then you're going to love inside of me.

不能弄得一团糟 事后也不能清理
No mess, no clean.

Beth
Beth!

你看到我认为亚马逊电纸书不好使一定很高兴吧
Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.

我忍不住地觉得挺愧疚的
I can't help but feel a little guilty.

我没把Lucy往强奸犯那方面想
I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

那强奸犯应该长什么样子 Beth
What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth?

应该是一个穿着牛仔外套
Is it a Slavic man wearing a denim jacket

留着稀拉胡子 一嘴水泡还有廉价香槟味
With a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne

斯拉夫男人吗
waft over his blister-pocked lips?

你在说什么
What?

行啦 至少你免费得到了些东西
Well, at least you got all these free stuff.

应该够满足你的泰坦尼克瘾一阵子的了
Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.

我坐不下了
I'm not going to fit.

Beth 听我说
Beth,listen to me.

你会成功离开这里的
You're going to get out of here.

你会继续你的生活 然后
You're gonna go on,and...

Jerry 把那块门板扔了吧
Jerry, just leave the door.

这不是门板 Beth 这是残骸
It's not a door, Beth. It's debris.

我不管 快扔了它
I don't care, just leave it.

好吧
Yeah,okay.

是海角惊魂耶
"Cape Fear"! "Cape Fear"!

《海角惊魂》 1962电影 讲述一名刚出狱的强奸犯怪罪于导致他入狱的律师，对他复仇的故事

我在复原海角惊魂里的场景耶
I'm I'm doing I'm I'm going to do like from "Cape Fear"!

屎瓜们
Hey, squanchers!

派对在我家继续屎瓜着
The party's squanching on at my place!

太好了 我也要去
Cool, I'm coming too.

哦 不 对于一个屎瓜派对来说你不够屎瓜
Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.

什么
What?

Nancy告诉了我们你有多贱
Nancy told us what a bitch you are.

各位 说真的 Nancy
Guys, seriously. Nancy?

Summer 你为人太差
Summer, you're a bad person.

你只想着让受欢迎的人喜欢你
All you care about is having popular people like you.

这可不是阿道夫·林肯勒主张的
That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

好吧 搞清楚他的主张不容易
Well, it was hard to pin down what he stood for,

但是他肯定不是为这个而死的
But it's certainly not what he died for.

下次我再开派对
Next time I party

我就只管让自己兴奋得精疲力尽就好
I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.

你太明智了
You're so wise.

我帮你一起收拾好吗
May I assist you with that?

当然好 谢谢
Uh, sure, yeah, thanks.

Morty 你知道"Wubba lubba dub dub"什么意思吗
Morty, do you know what "Wubba lubba dub dub" means?

那只是Rick愚蠢又没有逻辑的口头禅而已
Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.

这并不是没有逻辑的
It's not nonsense at all.

在我们那里
In my people's tongue,

这句话的意思是"我很痛苦 请帮帮我"
It means "I am in great pain,please help me"

那我告诉你吧 他说的意思正好相反
Well, I got news of you, he's saying it ironically.

不 Morty
No, Morty.

你的外公确实非常痛苦
Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain.

这就是他不得不麻痹自己的原因
That is why he must numb himself.

- 得了吧 呃  - 我叫鸟人
- Come on,uh... - Birdperson

得了吧 鸟人
Come on ,Birdperson.

Rick没有那么复杂
Rick's not that complicated.

他只是一个大混蛋而已
He's just a huge asshole.

那为什么你还这么在乎以后能不能和他
Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to

继续探险之旅
continue on your adventures together?

看起来命运给了能让你永远远离Rick
It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity

获得自由的机会啊
to free yourself of Rick forever.

你知道吗 你说对了
You know what? You're right.

我根本不应该担心
I shouldn't even care.

这也许是对我最有利的事了
This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.

我已经厌烦和Rick一起探险了
I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.

我们那儿还有一句谚语"Gubba nub nub doo rahkah"
My people have another saying "Gubba nub nub doo rahkah."

意思是"只要这事能让你安心入睡 就去做吧"
It means "whatever lets you sleep at night."

嘿 爸妈已经快到家了
Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.

这是你抉择的时刻 Morty
This is your moment, Morty.

明智地选择吧
Choose wisely.

Tammy
Tammy!

天啊 我们完蛋了
Wow, we are so screwed.

Rick 醒一醒
Rick, wake up!

等下 等下 停
Wait, wait, wait, stop.

Rick 你得赶快做点什么
Rick, you got to do something quick!

我爸妈快到家了
My parents are home.

好 好的 等 等会儿
Uh, all all right, all right. Hold hold on.

真解渴
Ah, so good.

我的天啊 他们上车道了
Oh,my god. They're walking up the driveway.

把那个东西拿给我
Bring me the thing.

啊 什么东西
What what thing?

那个东西 就是那个
The thing, the thing, the...

上面有按钮和灯的那个 还能响的东西
It's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It beeps.

Rick 车库里所有东西都长这样
Rick, that describes everything in your garage!

你是说这个吗
Do you mean this?

Summer拿 拿对了
Summer for for the win!

好了 现在就行了
All right, that should do it.

你干了什么
Whoa! What did you do?

你自己看
