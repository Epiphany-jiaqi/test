  <o:Description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think of a Kafka story as a perfect work of literary art, as approachable as it is strange, and as strange as it is approachable.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Michael Hofmann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Product Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Metamorphosis and Other Stories&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;strong&gt;Franz Kafka&lt;/strong&gt;, is part of the &lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Classics_聽series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of &lt;em&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Classics&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp;amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. &lt;em&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Classics &lt;/em&gt;pulls together a constellation of influences鈥攂iographical, historical, and literary鈥攖o enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually unknown during his lifetime, &lt;strong&gt;Franz Kafka&lt;/strong&gt; is now one of the world鈥檚 most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man鈥檚 anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka鈥檚 masterpiece, 鈥淿The Metamorphosis_,鈥?a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing together some of Kafka鈥檚 finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author鈥檚 artistry. 鈥淿The Judgment_,鈥?which Kafka considered to be his decisive</o:Description>

bear to lie still even at night, and eating gave him scant pleasure, so as a
distraction he acquired the habit of crawling crisscross over the walls and
ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=Para17 style='margin-top:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>FRANZ KAFKA</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>Franz Kafka was born in Prague in 1883 into a
middle-class Jewish household in which he grew up with feelings of inferiority,
guilt, resentment, and confinement. He was the eldest of his parents’ six
children; two brothers died in infancy, and he had three sisters. Franz’s
domineering father expected his son to take up a profitable business career
that would ensure social advancement for the family, as well as a successful
marriage promising the same. His mother was submissive to her husband, always
siding with him in matters concerning Franz. Toward her son she was alternately
fawning and neglectful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka earned his
doctorate in law in 1906 but decided against practicing, to the disappointment
of his father. Instead, in 1908 he took a position at an insurance agency,
which left afternoons and evenings open for writing, and at which he remained
until 1922—two years before his death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s literary
method follows the logic of dreams and other unconscious processes, and his
stories read like allegories without an established point of reference. Kafka’s
best-known story, “The Metamorphosis” (1915), in which he translated his
experience as family breadwinner into a parable of alienation, transformation,
and ultimately death, epitomizes his style. During his early writing life Kafka
was introduced to the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky,
and Thomas Mann, and became part of a literary and philosophical circle that
included Oskar Baum, Martin Buber, and Felix Weltsch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka had
significant relationships with several women during his brief life, notably
Felice Bauer, to whom he became engaged in 1914 and 1917; Julie Wohryzek;
Milena Jesenská-Pollack, his Czech translator, with whom he became involved in
1920; and Dora Diamant, a young Polish woman he met a year before his death.
Kafka’s sporadic literary career was in part fueled by these relationships,
which varied in degree of dysfunction, and in which he vacillated emotionally,
paralleling his mother’s behavior toward him as a boy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Diagnosed with
tuberculosis in 1917, Kafka saw the publication of a limited number of his
works during his lifetime, including “The Judgment” (1913), “The Stoker”
(1913), for which he received the Fontane Prize in 1915, “The Metamorphosis”
(1915), “A Country Doctor” (1919), and “In the Penal Colony” (1919). In 1924
Kafka asked his confidant Max Brod to burn his remaining unpublished
manuscripts. Instead, Brod dedicated the rest of his life to the full
publication of Kafka’s works. Among these are the novels <span class=0Text>The
Trial</span> (1925), <span class=0Text>The Castle</span> (1926), and <span
class=0Text>Amerika</span> (1927). Franz Kafka died on June 3, 1924, near Vienna.</span></p>

<p class=Para17 style='margin-top:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>INTRODUCTION</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>FRANZ KAFKA’S FICTION DOESN’T make sense. Kafka
was no doubt aware of the resulting awkwardness, and perhaps he hoped to hide
from future readers when he asked his confidant Max Brod to destroy all his
unpublished manuscripts upon his death. Kafka’s writing is on the one hand
specific and realistic, and on the other incomprehensible. His literary puzzles
resemble the unreal landscapes and structures of M. C. Escher’s drawings and
lithographs. Actually, Escher’s imagery offers a useful way to visualize
Kafka’s literature. As if leading the reader up and down endless staircases of
logic, Kafka focuses on multiple dualities at once, all of which crisscross in
three dimensions. Rather than a linear argument, Kafka writes a spiral one,
which often makes readers dizzy, if not seasick. Interestingly, metamorphosis
was one of Escher’s favorite subjects, and three of his most famous woodcuts
share this title with Kafka’s novella. Metamorphosis, Anthony Thorlby argues,
is the theme implicit in all Kafka’s prose (“Kafka’s Narrative: A Matter of
Form”; see “For Further Reading”). Kafka’s content is somehow incongruous with
his form, and as a result, the language must either undergo a metamorphosis
itself to accommodate his pen, or perish—and sometimes it does both. At its
best, Kafka’s prose is re-formed into a new mode of signification; at its
worst, his words are deformed, depleted, meaningless. In striving to fit his impossible
situations into the feeble vehicle of language, Kafka knowingly embarks on a
failed enterprise. He attempts to express the inexpressible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The metamorphosis
of his writing, Kafka’s real accomplishment, takes readers to a place at once
familiar and unfamiliar. Intrigued by this immediacy, critics have celebrated
Kafka for his “universality.” This flattery overreaches perhaps, but the term
“universal” was not picked by accident. Kafka’s fiction examines a universe
largely unexplored in the literature preceding him, one full of implications
that venture into the remote regions of human psychology. It’s a universe with
different rules than those governing our reality. And there’s no map.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Kafka’s
universe nonetheless resonates deeply with who we are and who we’ve become.
Early readers who hailed Kafka’s universality had never seen their lives in
books, and they had only dimly recognized the “Kafkaesque” as an unnamed thing.
Kafka was among the first to describe bourgeois labor and its degrading impact on
the soul. In his fable “Poseidon,” Kafka even portrays the god of the sea as
consumed with tedious, never-ending paperwork. Kafka brings to mind a
vocabulary of images—an endless trail of meaningless forms to be filled out, a
death apparatus to rival Poe’s pendulum, a man wearing a bowler hat, a gigantic
insect. Thanks to interpretations like Orson Welles’s film version of <span
class=0Text>The Trial</span>, Kafka’s universe has expanded to include rows of
office desks, oppressive light, and snapping typewriters. Kafka understood the
trajectory of bureaucracy, and his literature predicts the nightmarish
corporate world we live in today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s fiction,
though concrete in its particulars, suggests an array of interpretive
possibilities. “The Metamorphosis” alone has inspired Catholics to argue a case
of transubstantiation, Freudians to extrapolate Gregor’s castration by his
father, and Marxists to infer the alienation of man in modern society. Kafka’s
descriptions vacillate between realism and allegory—a narrative style best described
as parabolic. But unlike a traditional parable with an easy moral, Kafka’s
parables resist successful comprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This volume has as
its parentheses Kafka’s two best-known parables, “A Message from the Emperor”
and “Before the Law.” They both illustrate Kafka’s near-nauseating ability to
describe infinite regress. “A Message from the Emperor” checks any firm
interpretation with its simple but devastating phrase “or so they say” (p. 3)
in the opening line, which calls into question the tale’s validity, as if the
account is rumored. Additionally, the “you,” the second person, has dreamed the
whole thing up (p. 3). This second piece of information not only contradicts
the first, it turns the parable on its head—why would someone, especially
“you,” which seems to refer to the reader, dream up something so unnecessarily
complicated, especially when it concerns something as momentous as an emperor’s
message? This “you” can stand for Kafka himself—a writer who saw an infinite
corkscrew of obstacles spiraling before him, and yet felt compelled to record
his own deliberate steps. “Before the Law” also features an Inferno-like
layering and again pits an unsophisticated character against an implacable
system, unknowable in its complexity. Though the man from the country never
recognizes it, his defeat by the Law, capital L, is a foregone conclusion. The
Law’s only purpose is to shut out the man and, in so doing, to destroy him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s parables
are epitomes of his larger works (“Before the Law,” though published first on
its own, is actually part of <span class=0Text>The Trial</span>). Their
shortness only concentrates the reader’s perplexity. Robert Wenniger claims
that Kafka’s father engendered in Kafka a disparity between language and
meaning. In fact, silence was Kafka’s typical response to his father. By
writing incomprehensible texts, Wenniger argues, Kafka assumes the role of the
father, an authorial position over the reader (Wenniger, “Sounding Out the
Silence of Gregor Samsa: Kafka’s Rhetoric of Dyscommunication”). This leaves the
reader confused and vainly searching for meaning. Of course, Kafka shares this
privilege with many of the world’s great writers, whose work is often a
challenge to interpret. In “On Parables” Kafka writes, “Parables really set out
to say merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that
already” (<span class=0Text>The Complete Stories</span>, 1971, p. 457).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In Kafka’s
formulation, the parable is used by the sage to gesture toward something larger
than, or invisible to, himself. The need to make this gesture is innate. But
the parable dissolves the moment we understand it; the gesture would not be
beyond language if it could be defined. We <span class=0Text>lose in parable</span>
the moment we pin things down to an accessible meaning. Realizing it is
impossible to discuss or interpret Kafka without losing in parable is the first
and perhaps only step we can take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s parables
not only fall apart once we interpret them, they are impossible to put into
practice. If anything, his parables guarantee the failure not only of his
characters, but of readers wishing to abstract any lessons applicable to their
own lives. Failure, it seems, is Kafka’s true subject. To get at this
conundrum, we must explore discretely the dichotomies Kafka himself con
flates—dreams versus reality, idleness versus work, vermin versus human, child
versus adult. For Kafka, each of these antagonistic pairs represents an
authorial relationship. It is possible to lump the lowly—dreams, idleness,
vermin, child—on one side, and the authority figures—reality, work, human, adult—on
the other. But ultimately this equation is too simple, for Kafka himself fails
to pick a side. He calls both sides into question and finds them equally
detestable. Unbraiding Kafka’s authorial relationships is the only way to find
out why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dreams—and, perhaps
more importantly, nightmares—held a singular influence over Kafka and his
writing. Kafka’s nightmares are so natural, so convincing, that they creep into
the reader’s mind almost subliminally. He metamorphoses reality into a new,
insidiously darker one, often within a single sentence. In “The Judgment,”
Georg’s father throws at him an old, unfamiliar newspaper (p. 64), an actual
object that evidences a deception, staggering in its elaborateness—Georg’s
father has been feigning his infirmity, only pretending to read his newspapers,
for years! In “The Metamorphosis,” Kafka speeds time ticklessly: “It was half
past six and the hands were steadily advancing, actually past the half hour and
already closer to three quarters past” (p. 8). Later, the head clerk arrives at
the Samsa flat to investigate Gregor’s tardiness, <span class=0Text>at the
moment of his tardiness</span>. Even if Gregor’s absence from work was judged
grave enough to send the head clerk himself, the event remains absurd. Somehow,
the head clerk would have had to foresee Gregor’s lateness and taken an early
train to show up at the flat just minutes after Gregor should have been at his
office desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In “A Country
Doctor,” the sudden, ominous appearance of the groom is punctuated by his
mysterious knowledge of the maid’s name and his tacit intent to ravish her.
Following this, the doctor is whisked away in his newly harnessed trap, as if
beyond his control, completely unable to assist his maid, who locks herself in
the house: “I hear my front door splinter and burst as the groom attacks it,
and then my eyes and ears are swamped with a blinding rush of the senses. But
even this lasts only a moment, for, as if my patient’s courtyard opens just
outside my gate, I am already there” (p. 124). The ten-mile distance between
the doctor’s village and his patient’s house, the reality that precipitated the
need for strong horses in the first place, evaporates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nightmare-turned-reality
is the power of “The Metamorphosis.” Gregor Samsa is a different animal, a
unique figure even among canonical supernatural tales. Without the permanence
of Gregor’s monstrous form, we would be left with something like the absurd
comedy of Gogol’s “The Nose,” in which Kovalyov’s nose leaves his face to
prance about the town disguised as a state councillor but in the end returns to
its proper place unchanged. Without Gregor’s inimitable subjectivity, we would
be left essentially with the horror of Oscar Wilde’s <span class=0Text>The
Picture of Dorian Gray</span>, in which the painting of Dorian becomes
monstrous while Dorian himself remains ageless, until the fey moment when the
two destroy each other, leaving only a moral behind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Instead, we arrive
at a story that cannot claim the supernatural as one of its elements. The
mystery of “The Metamorphosis” emerges in one of the most famous, and most
variously translated, lines in Western literature—its first: “As Gregor Samsa
awoke from unsettling dreams one morning, he found himself transformed in his
bed into a monstrous vermin” (p. 7). This is marvelously funny. Instead of waking
up from a nightmare, Gregor wakes up into one. Reality, the only balm for bad
dreams, is significantly less reassuring when you wake up hideously disfigured.
But in Kafka’s fiction, the rational and the irrational intertwine menacingly.
Often these irrational elements spring from the minds of his characters and
manifest themselves physically. Ideas are metamorphosed into reality, with
little effort on the characters’ parts. Here Gregor’s idea, originating in his
“unsettling dreams,” has followed him into the real world. The echo and
confirmation of this reality comes in the second paragraph: “It was no dream”
(p. 7). Unlike Lewis Carroll’s Alice, who, after transforming several times,
wakes up, Gregor’s most bizarre adventure is real, and has only just begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka treats the
bed, representative of both illness and idleness, as the birthplace of these
irrational ideas. The first sentence introduces Gregor not only in his
nightmarish form but also ensnared in his bed, as if caught in the grips of tangling
irrationality. Gregor spends most of the first section of “The Metamorphosis”
trying to extricate himself from his bed: “in bed he could never think anything
through to a reasonable conclusion” (p. 9). In viewing the chaos of his legs
waving in the air, Gregor tells himself “that he could not possibly stay in bed
and that the logical recourse was to risk everything in the mere hope of
freeing himself from the bed” (p. 10). By escaping, he hopes to shut out the
irrationality of his new form and return to his old self. We learn that Gregor
was unrelentingly reasonable as a human; the head clerk booms through the door,
“I have always known you to be a quiet, reasonable man and now you suddenly
seem to be indulging in rash eccentricities” (p. 14). For a brief second,
Gregor even entertains simply sleeping it off (p. 7) or resting in bed in hope
of a cure (p. 10). Here he employs a reverse logic, an irrational hope that the
bed will magically restore his “unquestionable state” (p. 11). It does not. In
fact, Gregor’s human form isn’t restored once he’s free from bed either. But
his irrational belief that it would be was itself generated in the bed. This
divides Kafka’s universe into the irrational—dreams, notions deriving from the
bed—and the rational—reality, working, family. The surreality of Kafka’s
fiction consists in his constant traffic between these two realms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In Kafka’s story
“Wedding Preparations in the Country,” Eduard Raban fantasizes about splitting
into two forms: one, to remain in bed all day, dreaming; the other, to go forth
and conduct the business of the world. Interestingly, Raban envisions the “bed”
form as a large beetle, the worldly self as the shell of his human form. Raban
thinks to himself,</span></p>

<p class=Para14 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>I would pretend it was
a matter of hibernating, and I would press my little legs to my bulging belly.
And I would whisper a few words, instructions to my sad [human] body, which
stands close beside me, bent. Soon I shall have done—it bows, it goes swiftly,
and it will manage everything efficiently while I rest (<span class=0Text>Complete
Stories</span>, p. 56).</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>Kafka differentiates the two tales by treating
Raban’s splitting as “pretend,” and Gregor’s transformation as real. But in
truth, Gregor invents his transmutation just as Raban invents his. The
metamorphosis does not happen <span class=0Text>to</span> Gregor. It’s
something he consciously—or perhaps more aptly, subconsciously—wills upon
himself. Gregor thinks of himself as “condemned to serve” (p. 11), as trapped.
When Gregor makes his first appearance before his family in his changed form,
he reveals his total willingness to give up his job: “If they were shocked,
then Gregor was no longer responsible” (p. 15). This passage betrays Gregor’s
premeditation and points to the idea that Gregor <span class=0Text>wanted</span>
to change into a monstrous vermin—something incapable of working in an office.
While not consciously desirous of his new form, he’s sentient of his situation
and very much in control. Of course, in attempting to shirk his
responsibilities and escape the confines of the office, the lonely hotel rooms,
and his family’s flat, Gregor confines himself even further; his room becomes
his sole domain, and eventually even it metamorphoses into a storage closet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s metaphor of
a man’s transformation into vermin is unique not only because the change comes
from the man himself, but also because it critiques modernity and the
impossibility of living functionally within it. In this sense “The
Metamorphosis” stands as one of the greatest indictments against work ever
written. Gregor’s impetus to transform reflects the illogicality of working
life, the impossibility of sustaining a work ethic. After the novella’s
fantastic first sentence, Gregor searches for clues that might explain his
newfound condition. After ignoring the overwhelming evidence of his new body after
the briefest of perusals, Gregor looks about his room. Out his window, he
perceives dreary weather, which causes him to feel “quite melancholy” (p. 7).
It is typical Kafka for a man, who has most recently discovered he occupies the
form of a monstrous vermin, to feel saddened by the weather. But this
melancholic whim extends beyond Kafka’s humor and points to Gregor’s chronic
dread of mornings. It’s a prelude to his vitriolic damnation of working life:</span></p>

<p class=Para14 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Oh God,” he thought,
“what a grueling profession I picked! Traveling day in, day out. It is much
more aggravating work than the actual business done at the home office, and
then with the strain of constant travel as well: the worry over train
connections, the bad and irregular meals, the steady stream of faces who never
become anything closer than acquaintances. The Devil take it all!” (pp. 7-8).</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>Gregor does not mince words: grueling,
aggravating, strain, worry, bad—all followed by an imprecation. Deeper still,
the diatribe is prompted by a “faint, dull ache” (p. 7) in his side. How
telling that Gregor, who has so recently lost his familiar, human form, should
notice an ache and immediately think of his job. Whether this pain merely
reminds him of the rigors of labor or is a soreness actually caused by it, Gregor
innately associates work with pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The ritualized
actions listed in Gregor’s exclamatory account of his job give the impression
of a thoroughly regimented life-style. Because we never know Gregor in his
human form, we have to piece him together after the fact. It seems Gregor’s
human self was like most of us at some point or another—weak, afraid,
submissive to corporate and familial pressures. He lacks the space for
creativity, and even irrationality. Immediately upon his awakening, Gregor’s
gaze falls upon the illustration of a woman that hangs in a frame he carved
with his fretsaw. The pride and enthusiasm he has for his gilt frame is
evident, and it resurfaces when he protects it from his sister and mother (p.
33) in their unwitting attempt to strip away the only proof that Gregor was
once human. The picture represents Gregor’s single creation—or in Marxist
terms, the one product he is allowed to keep. For Gregor, work precludes the
possibility of creation; in the life of a traveling salesman, the gilt frame is
the exception rather than the rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But why go to the
trouble of changing into a monstrous vermin? Why didn’t Gregor just quit his
job? For Gregor this was impossible: “If I were not holding back because of my
parents, I would have quit long ago” (p. 8). A loyal and loving son, Gregor
feels obligated to pay off his parents’ debt. Simply quitting would betray that
loyalty. After his transformation, Gregor overhears his family discuss their
bleak financial situation and feels “flushed with shame and grief” (p. 27). He
despairs of the prospect of any one of his family members, especially his
sister Grete, working to make ends meet. Gregor blames himself for spoiling the
quiet life he had previously provided for them. He knows firsthand the impersonality,
the lifelessness of modern labor, and he shudders at the thought of his family
experiencing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The family members
do indeed get jobs, and as they do so, they complete the reversal of Gregor’s
metamorphosis. The transformation of Gregor into vermin, and his resulting
abdication of the breadwinner role, forces the Samsa family to transform <span
class=0Text>from</span> vermin. The family members, who have lived
parasitically off Gregor, change into tired, silent, and empty people who more
and more resemble the pre-insect Gregor. They must work even when they are at
home to accommodate their three boarders, and thus they degrade into obsequious
servants. Eventually the sister is resolute in her decision that Gregor must be
gotten rid of: “We all work too hard to come home to this interminable torture”
(p. 46). Here, because the family’s day is filled with the torment of working,
the additional strain of Gregor becomes unbearable. Their inability to
disengage from work in the evening deprives them of the only possible respite
from labor, and life without some kind of rest is torture. The worst irony is
that taking care of the verminous Gregor is a filthy chore. Gregor, by escaping
work, has not only forced his former dependents into labor, but has <span
class=0Text>become</span> work: disgusting work that only his disgraced family
can perform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka returns again
and again to the idea of vermin—the revolting nomads who communicate like birds
in “An Old Leaf,” the dehumanized, emaciated hunger artist, the strange mouse
people, among whom even Josephine barely distinguishes herself, and the man
from the country in “Before the Law,” who by the end holds the fleas in the
doorkeeper’s fur collar above himself. Max Brod actually refers to “The
Metamorphosis” as Kafka’s “vermin story” (<span class=0Text>Franz Kafka: A
Biography</span>, 1960, p. 18). Additionally, Kafka regularly inserts <span
class=0Text>himself</span> in his fiction, giving his characters names like K.
Some critics have even connected the two short <span class=0Text>a</span>s of
Samsa with the identical vowel construction of Kafka. Vermin is in the eye of
the beholder, and Kafka clearly sees a self-resemblance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For Kafka, thinking
about vermin was a way to understand the universe, and his own place in it. “A
Message from the Emperor” begins by describing “you” as the emperor’s “single
most contemptible subject, the minuscule shadow that has fled the farthest
distance from the imperial sun” (p. 3). The “you” lives in shadow like a rat or
a cockroach. Further, this shadow darkens against the authorial source of
light, “the imperial sun.” The lowliness of vermin is created by a hierarchy,
at the top of which is an amorphous, omnipotent authority. Kafka’s short
parable “The Emperor” echoes this idea: “When a surf flings a drop of water on
to the land, that does not interfere with the eternal rolling of the sea, on
the contrary, it is caused by it” (<span class=0Text>The Basic Kafka</span>,
1979, p. 183). Interestingly, Kafka again chooses a laborer to play the role of
vermin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In Kafka’s universe
authority and vermin are natural enemies, and each gives rise to the other. In
“Letter to His Father,” Kafka addresses himself in the voice of his father,
Hermann:</span></p>

<p class=Para14 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>There are two kinds of
combat. The chivalrous combat, in which independent opponents pit their
strength against each other, each on his own, each losing on his own, each
winning on his own. And there is the combat of vermin, which not only sting
but, on top of it, suck your blood in order to sustain their own life (<span
class=0Text>Dearest Father</span>, p. 195).</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>Herr Kafka represented the ultimate figure of
authority for Franz, who here accuses himself of operating on the level of
vermin. Moreover, this passage lashes out against the inequality intrinsic to
an authorial relationship. Kafka’s suspicion of authority governs every word he
writes. Throughout his life Kafka committed himself to many
things—intellectualism, vegetarianism, teetotaling, Judaism, a string of
women—but his subscription to each of these was never total. Once Kafka came to
regard any philosophy as nothing more than a system of rules to be enforced, a
dogma both bigger and smaller than himself, he withdrew from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In Kafka’s story “A
Report to an Academy,” the narrator, who five years previous had occupied the
form of an ape, has been transformed into a human. In this tale it is difficult
to draw a black line between the narrator’s two selves; the differences are
subtle. The narrator’s tone implies that his gradual transformation from an ape
into a human represents an improvement. But Kafka questions this authorial
status of humans. Driven by the desire to escape his cage, the ape observes his
observers; the narrator writes, “it was so easy to imitate these people” (<span
class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>, p. 255). Thus Kafka diffuses the
differences between animals and humans. In so doing, he extends the reader’s
natural sympathy for human characters to include vermin, and applies the
reader’s natural aversion to vermin to humans instead. In Kafka’s fiction, it
is possible for humans and vermin to function as mutual metaphors, and though
the dichotomy between vermin and human remains, it becomes increasingly
difficult to choose a side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor Samsa plays
host to the conflict between vermin and human in that he does not disown his
mind as he does his body. Throughout the novella, he retains his human
consciousness, memory, and ability to understand human speech and intentions.
Because of his residual human perception, Gregor never sees his armor-plated
form as even <span class=0Text>potentially</span> liberating; instead his
in-habitation of an insect’s body is tortured and guilt-ridden. Wilhelm Emrich
argues that the impersonal nature of modern life prevents Gregor from
recognizing the freedom of his “pre-human” form (commentary in <span
class=0Text>The Metamorphosis</span>, Bantam edition, 1972). Instead Gregor
views it as monstrous, alien, and other. During Gregor’s initial reconnaissance
of his room, he seeks solace from his former humanity; his gaze falls upon his
work samples, his desk, his gilt frame. He all but ignores his new, unsightly
form. Gregor hungers obsessively for the explainable; his absolute need to
hurry off to work represents a severe form of denial, itself a human tendency:
“What if I went back to sleep for a while and forgot all this foolishness” (p.
7). He courts rationality out of an obligation to his former self. But his
feigned, humanlike demonstrations are silly: trying to stand upright, speaking
to his parents and the head clerk, returning to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Upon seeing his
unpacked samples, Gregor admits to himself that he does not feel “particularly
fresh and energetic” (p. 8), an absurd notion for a man-size insect to ponder.
He presumes the change in his voice to be caused by a severe cold, “an ailment
common among traveling salesmen” (p. 10). But Kafka does not let Gregor off so
easily. By positioning the head clerk at the bedroom door, Kafka keeps the
reader from believing in Gregor’s self-delusion. Upon hearing Gregor speak, the
head clerk says, “That was the voice of an animal” (p. 15). Gregor’s metamorphosis
is real, and his efforts to deny it are frail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In “Wedding
Preparations” by contrast, Raban dreams of frittering away his days in bed. His
weightless disposition comes from his ability to indulge in his irrational
side. The pre-vermin Gregor would have considered such an activity frivolous.
Before his transformation, Gregor never gave in to distractions other than
fretsawing. He stayed home each night and busied himself constantly, “reading
the paper or studying train schedules” (p. 12). Kafka himself worked at the
same job all his life. At his office, he wrote tracts such as “On Mandatory
Insurance in the Construction Industry” and “Workers’ Accident Insurance and
Management.” In the evenings Kafka remained cloistered in his room, where he
worked on his various manuscripts. By contrast, Gregor has no such dedication;
he’s learned to suppress his personality, to submit unconditionally to
authority. As the head clerk has it, Gregor’s reasonableness derives from not
indulging in “rash eccentricities” (p. 14). In fact, Gregor champions himself
for his impersonal habit of locking the doors at night (p. 9). For Kafka, an
oppressive rationality and the human experience, at least within the modern
bourgeois value system, are synonymous. Gregor, who is fluent only in
rationality and is loyal to the human social ideal, is tortured by his
insectival state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Consequently,
Gregor fails to see that he’s capable of conscious irrationality. The
metamorphosis seems a mistake, a wrong turn, a trap out of which the only escape
is death. Walter Sokel goes so far as to say that Gregor’s true form <span
class=0Text>is</span> death (commentary in <span class=0Text>The Metamorphosis</span>,
Bantam edition, 1972). Perhaps in this light Gregor’s insect form represents a
slow death, a chronic, fatal illness. Kafka saw his tuberculosis as a
liberation; interestingly, he called it “the animal.” Further, Kafka found his
passages on death to be his most compelling pieces of writing. But “The
Metamorphosis” is more than a tale of suicide. For if Gregor is ultimately dead
in the first sentence, what is the point of reading further? There must be a
glint of hope for his salvation—and there is. If Gregor is capable of turning
himself into a monstrous vermin, then he can change back. He just doesn’t want
to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It is guilt—that
most revolting of all human sentiments—that prevents Gregor from embracing his
insect form. Out of guilt, Gregor chooses not to relinquish his role of family
provider. Though he laments his obligation, he never gives it up. In the final
section, Gregor considers “the idea that the next time the door opened he would
take control of the family affairs as he had done in the past” (p. 39). Rather
than the absurdity of Gregor’s earlier denials, here Kafka focuses on Gregor’s
ability to puzzle out his situation. There is an implied agency, as if Gregor
truly possesses the ability to snap out of his state and return to his old
self. Whatever his decision, he can’t help but fail. His escape is ultimately
doomed by his utter devotion to his family, which never diminishes. The guilt brought
on by Gregor’s newfound inability to provide for his family—financially and
emotionally—prevents him from attaining any sort of liberation. Perhaps
recognizing this conundrum, Gregor chooses to remain an insect. Though both
conditions are unlivable, he prefers vermin life to human; it’s the lesser of
two tortures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s story “The
Burrow” concerns a character who inhabits the space <span class=0Text>between</span>
human and vermin. Though the narrator differentiates himself from the “field
mice” (<span class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>, p. 326) and “all sorts of
small fry” (<span class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>, p. 327) that occupy his
burrow, he uses his unspecified but presumably human body in an animal fashion.
He pounds the tunnel walls firm with his forehead (<span class=0Text>Complete
Stories</span>, p. 328); he fights and kills rats with his jaws (<span
class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>, p. 329). Yet the burrow itself, which the
narrator dubs “Castle Keep,” is the result of deliberate, extensive planning
and constant maintenance. Further, the burrow’s effectiveness and
impregnability inspire the narrator’s dreams: “tears of joy and deliverance
still glisten on my beard when I awaken” (<span class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>,
p. 333).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The logic that
gives rise to Castle Keep is one twisted by absolute isolation. It is the logic
of both fantasy and ignorance, a child’s uninformed rationale. In fact, the
burrow is much like a child’s fort—but one inhabited by someone driven insane
with fear. The narrator’s incessant calculations and preparations become
increasingly insular, until his mind is saturated with a baseless paranoia.
This compulsively cogitative yet ultimately ignorant perspective is much like
the psychology of Dostoevsky’s underground man. By the end of “The Burrow” the
narrator’s mind no longer resembles human consciousness at all, but instead a
fight-or-flight, animal mentality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The rift between
child and adult roles is at the heart of “The Metamorphosis.” Gregor, like the
narrator of “The Burrow,” possesses the mentality of a child. In Kafka’s
universe the child is the least authorial figure, and therefore can be likened
to vermin. It is natural for Gregor’s parents and the head clerk to speak to
Gregor condescendingly through the door. It’s almost as if they regard Gregor
as throwing a childish fit. Later, the family, led ferociously by the father,
forces Gregor into his room like a naughty child. And Gregor, for his part, has
no interest in adult matters. He loathes his profession. He has no intention of
finding a companion; the only woman in his life, besides his sister and mother,
is the pin-up girl in the gilt frame. When Gregor looks around his room, Kafka,
again with excruciating humor, describes it as “a regular human bedroom” (p.
7)—as if Gregor’s room would be decorated to the tastes of a monstrous vermin.
But the precise phrase in the original German, <span class=0Text>kleines
Menschenzimmer</span>, implies that it resembles a child’s room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor, like Georg
Bendemann of “The Judgment,” is typified by his familial relationships. (The
other “son,” Karl Rossmann of “The Stoker,” differs because we meet him on his
trip to America—he’s on his own.) Both Gregor and Georg are confined to their
parents’ homes as adults. Adult children regularly slip into childhood roles
when visiting their parents. But for Kafka’s characters, this stunting is not
temporary. Kafka himself lived with his parents until a year before his death,
and right before he died he was forced to return because of his tuberculosis.
Living for so long in proximity to his parents made Kafka feel like a child—the
same child he was prior to his physical and literary development. These developments
vanished before his parents, who remained relatively unchanged—they even
outlived him!—and whose authorial position over him was total. Walter Benjamin
once described a photograph of Kafka in which Kafka’s “immensely sad eyes
dominate the landscape” (“Franz Kafka: On the Tenth Anniversary of His Death”).
Thomas Mann wrote about Kafka in much the same way—painting a man with “large
dark eyes, at once dreamy and penetrating” and an “expression at once childlike
and wise” (commentary in <span class=0Text>The Castle: The Definitive Edition</span>).
The only difference is that Mann was talking about Kafka’s final portrait, and
Benjamin was looking at a picture of Franz taken when he was six years old.
Kafka never grew up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka’s suffocation
as an adult child leaves its trace on Gregor and Georg, who each suffers a
child’s frustration at having no say, yet finds himself in a caretaker’s role
fraught with responsibility and guilt. Each is sentenced to death by his
parents. Gregor’s devotion to his parents and his sister forces him to
interpret the family’s grievances as a condemnation, whereas Georg’s judgment
is about as direct as you can get. And, hauntingly, Gregor and Georg each
carries out his own sentence. The adult child—another of Kafka’s fusions of
different states—is little prepared for the world. Even Eduard Raban’s fantasy
of splitting into two selves in “Wedding Preparations” is a child’s attempt at
evasion: “Can’t I do it the way I always used to as a child in matters that
were dangerous?” (<span class=0Text>Complete Stories</span>, p. 55). The answer
to Raban’s question is no. Kafka’s characters, regardless of how much agency
they possess, are doomed to fail. As Kafka writes in “A Message from the
Emperor,” the messenger’s arrival “could never, ever happen” (p. 3).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If we think of
Gregor as having a child’s mentality, it is natural to sympathize with
him—especially if we see him as trapped in the role of family provider. This
sympathy is not altogether different from what we feel toward Dickens’s Oliver
Twist, that supreme victim of child labor. Yet this sympathy does not hold, for
it is always followed by a repulsion toward Gregor’s physical ity: “A brown
fluid had come from his mouth, oozed over the key, and dripped onto the floor”
(p. 16). Kafka further complicates matters by writing “The Metamorphosis” in
the third person. This mode of narration allows for Gregor’s death at the end,
which confirms definitively that the metamorphosis was not a hallucination or a
dream. But though the narrative follows Gregor’s awareness, we always have enough
room to reevaluate how we feel about him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Some of our
sympathy falls to the sister, and even to the feeble parents—none of whom are
fit to work. But ultimately we remain loyal to Gregor, especially because his
family forsakes him. His sister stops tending to him (p. 40) and locks him in
his room (p. 48); his mother faints upon seeing an enormous insect clinging to
the wall (p. 33); the father, in brief, subjects him to every abuse imaginable.
At the expense of Gregor’s sacrifice, the sister, at the end of the story,
stretches her arrogant body and gets the liberation Gregor longed for. Under
Gregor’s care first, and then her parents’, the sister enjoys a healthy
childhood, one leading to physical and mental development, and one in which she
isn’t trapped. Yet our loyalty to Gregor extends even beyond his death, and his
sister’s cheery success story offers but a bitter pill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the pivotal
scene of “The Metamorphosis,” Gregor’s sister begins to play her violin.
Listening to her music, Gregor “felt as though the path to his unknown hungers
was being cleared” (p. 44). We have no indication that Gregor Samsa enjoyed
music while he was human; his intention to send his sister to the Conservatory
was to him a financial endeavor, an investment in her future. Yet to be moved
by music is essentially human; it reflects sensitivity. The life Gregor led as
a human being left no room for this kind of appreciation. But, by regressing
into an animal, his sensibility has become refined rather than coarsened. As
vermin he comes closer to a spiritual liberation, of which human beings at
their best are capable. Perhaps in death Gregor attains salvation, the ultimate
metamorphosis. But regardless, he’s started down that path in life, through
humility and contemplation. The Samsa family, which does not comprehend this
less visual transformation in Gregor, interrupts it. Instead of liberation
Gregor attains only confinement—both spatial and metaphysical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In “The
Metamorphosis” the physical transformation, rather than its dénouement, is
merely a premise. By contrast, Ovid’s classic, <span class=0Text>Metamorphoses</span>,
focuses on the process and novelty of transformation. Ovid consistently
establishes an explicit causal, if not moral, relationship between a
character’s actions and the consequence of metamorphosis. In the tale of
Arachne, another story of a human transformed into a bug, haughty Arachne
refuses to admit that her spinning skills derive from any teacher or divine source.
The spinster goes so far as to challenge Minerva (the Roman correlate of the
Greek goddess Athena) to a spinning contest. After Arachne defeats Minerva, the
latter strikes her with a wooden shuttle—an action much like a spanking or a
public caning. Out of despair Arachne tries to hang herself, but Minerva
simultaneously spares and punishes the weaver by changing her into a spider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This metamorphosis
is not mysterious. Arachne’s transformation is the direct result of Minerva’s
anger, caused by Arachne’s own impudence. For Ovid, Minerva and the rest of the
deities represent the highest authority; the gods are not to be challenged or
regarded as equals. Even though Minerva is defeated, her authority is absolute.
As Arachne attempts suicide—again, to make the final transformation—her agency
is stripped by Minerva, who has other transformative plans in mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It is easy to
decipher the story of Arachne, whether you take her side or Minerva’s, but
Kafka’s moral, if there is one, is not obvious or logical. The abandonment a
reader feels at the end of any text is especially acute with Kafka. The few
clues he leaves us are not only incomplete, they are contradictory. Kafka is
notoriously incapable of completion. His three novels—<span class=0Text>The
Trial</span>, <span class=0Text>The Castle</span>, and <span class=0Text>Amerika</span>,
all of them unfinished—were assembled by Max Brod, whom we have to thank for
exhuming a Franz Kafka who seems to come very close, one might guess, to saying
what he means. But whenever Kafka reached so deeply within himself—whether in
the guise of Joseph K., simply K., or Karl Rossmann—he eventually abandoned the
work. His one pride was the torrential composition of “The Judgment,” which he
wrote in a single night. Perhaps any project that took more than eight hours to
finish lost its luster; perhaps an “opening out of the body and the soul” (<span
class=0Text>Diaries, 1910-1913</span>, p. 276) was too painful for an extended
period; and perhaps this explains why Kafka went years at a time without
writing a word of fiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Kafka regarded the
end of “The Metamorphosis”—its composition interrupted by a business trip—as
“unreadable.” He also wrote in his diary that he found it “bad,” but of course
Kafka relished his failure. Failure is precisely what he expected and resolved
to accomplish—and he hid behind it. Kafka’s literature has no end, no borders
like those that frame Escher’s artworks. He does not write in black and white.
And unlike Escher, Kafka was unable to manage the subject of liberation with
any success. Yet it is “The Metamorphosis,” and not necessarily “The Judgment,”
that is remembered by readers and that will be taught in schools forever.
Kafka, it seems, is at his best when he fails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His failure puts
the burden of meaning on readers. We must reconstruct Kafka, as we do Gregor
Samsa. That is what critics have been trying to do for generations—indeed,
Kafka’s reputation wasn’t made until after his death. He is locked in time and
cannot be questioned. In the end, Kafka and his fiction are inextricable. The
only way out is to metamorphose Kafka into something we can parse. We have to
insinuate ourselves into his universe, his allegory. Only in this way can we
see our own reality for the puzzle it is. As the disconnect between author and
reader dissolves, Kafka’s language becomes a metaphor for the greater
disconnection between ourselves and our environment. Though we lose in parable,
perhaps in reading Kafka we can finish what he himself could not complete and,
in so doing, nourish our own unknown hungers.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>THE EMPEROR, OR SO they say, has sent you—his
single most contemptible subject, the minuscule shadow that has fled the
farthest distance from the imperial sun—only to you has the Emperor sent a
message from his deathbed. He has had the messenger kneel beside his bed and he
has whispered the message to him; so important was this message that he has
made him repeat it in his ear. He has confirmed the accuracy of the words with
a nod of his head. And then, before all the spectators assembled to witness his
death—every wall obstructing the view had been knocked down and on the
free-standing, vaulted staircases, all the dignitaries of the empire were gathered
in a circle—before them all, he has dispatched the messenger. The messenger
sets off at once, a strong and tireless man; sometimes thrusting ahead with one
arm, sometimes with the other, he beats a path through the crowd; where he
meets resistance, he points to the sign of the sun on his breast, and he forges
ahead with an ease that could be matched by no other. But the throng is so
thick, there’s no end to their dwellings. If only there were an open field
before him, how fast he would fly; soon you would surely hear the glorious
rapping of his knock on your door. But instead, how vain his efforts are; he is
still only forcing his way through the chambers of the innermost palace; he
will never reach the end of them, and even if he did he’d be no closer; he
would have to fight his way down the steps, and even if he did he’d be no
closer; he would still have to cross the courtyards, and after the courtyards
the second, outer palace, and still more stairs and courtyards, and still
another palace, and so on for thousands of years, and even if he did finally
burst through the outermost gate—but that could never, ever happen—the empire’s
capital, the center of the world, flooded with the dregs of humanity, would
still lie before him. There is no one who could force his way through here,
least of all with a message from a dead man.—But you sit at your window and
dream it up as evening falls.</span></p>

<p class=Para19><span lang=EN>AS GREGOR SAMSA AWOKE from unsettling dreams one
morning, he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. <a
href="#filepos445242"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>1</span></span></a> He lay on his
hard armorlike back and when he raised his head a little he saw his vaulted brown
belly divided into sections by stiff arches from whose height the coverlet had
already slipped and was about to slide off completely. His many legs, which
were pathetically thin compared to the rest of his bulk, flickered helplessly
before his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos75644></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“What has happened
to me?” he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human bedroom, if a
little small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Above the desk, on
which a collection of fabric samples was unpacked and spread out—Samsa was a
traveling salesman—hung the picture that he had recently cut out of an
illustrated magazine and put in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady, sitting
upright, dressed in a fur hat and fur boa; her entire forearm had vanished into
a thick fur muff which she held out to the viewer.<a href="#filepos445899"><span
class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>2</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor’s gaze then
shifted to the window, and the dreary weather—raindrops could be heard beating
against the metal ledge of the window—made him quite melancholy. “What if I
went back to sleep for a while and forgot all this foolishness,” he thought.
However, this was totally impracticable, as he habitually slept on his right
side, a position he could not get into in his present state; no matter how
forcefully he heaved himself to the right, he rocked onto his back again. He
must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to see his
twitching legs, and stopped only when he felt a faint, dull ache start in his
side, a pain which he had never experienced before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Oh God,” he
thought, “what a grueling profession I picked! Traveling day in, day out. It is
much more aggravating work than the actual business done at the home office,
and then with the strain of constant travel as well: the worry over train
connections, the bad and irregular meals, the steady stream of faces who never
become anything closer than acquaintances. The Devil take it all!” He felt a
slight itching up on his belly and inched on his back closer to the bedpost to
better lift his head. He located the itching spot, which was surrounded by many
tiny white dots that were incomprehensible to him, and tried to probe the area
with one of his legs but immediately drew it back, for the touch sent an icy
shiver through him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He slid back into
his former position. “This getting up so early,” he thought, “makes you totally
stupid. A man needs sleep. Other traveling salesmen live like harem women. For
example, when I come back to the hotel late in the morning to write up the new
orders, these men are still sitting at breakfast. I should try that with my
boss. I would be thrown out on the spot. Who knows, however, if that wouldn’t
be for the best. If I were not holding back because of my parents, I would have
quit long ago. I would go up to the boss and tell him my heartfelt opinion. He
would be knocked off the desk. This too is a strange way to do things: He sits
on top of the desk and from this height addresses the employees, who must step
up very close because of the boss’s deafness. Well, I have not entirely given
up hope, and as soon as I have saved the money to pay off the debt my parents
owe him—it might still be another five or six years—I’ll definitely do it. Then
I’ll cut myself free. For the time being, however, I must get up because my
train leaves at five.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And he looked at
the alarm clock ticking on the bureau. “God Almighty!” he thought. It was half
past six and the hands were steadily advancing, actually past the half hour and
already closer to three quarters past. Did the alarm not ring? One could see
from the bed that it was correctly set for four o’clock and so it must have
gone off. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that furniture-rattling
ringing? Well, he hadn’t slept peacefully but probably all the sounder for it.
But what should he do now? The next train left at seven o’clock, and in order
to catch it he would have to rush around like mad, and the sample collection
was still unpacked and he was not feeling particularly fresh and energetic. And
even if he caught the train, a bawling out from the boss was inescapable,
because the office messenger had arrived by the five o’clock train and reported
his absence long ago; he was the boss’s creature, mindless and spineless. What
if Gregor reported in sick? This would be extremely painful and suspicious, as
he had not once been ill during his five-year employment. The boss would
certainly come over with the health insurance doctor, reproach the parents for
their lazy son, and cut off all excuses by referring to the health insurance
doctor, for whom there were only healthy but work-shy people. And would he be
so wrong in this case? Actually Gregor felt perfectly well, apart from a
drowsiness that was superfluous after so long a sleep; in fact he even had a
great appetite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As he urgently
considered all this, without being able to decide to get out of bed—the alarm
clock struck a quarter to seven—there was a timid knock at the door by his
head. “Gregor,” a voice called—it was the mother—“it’s a quarter to seven.
Didn’t you want to get going?” That sweet voice! Gregor was shocked when he
heard his voice answering, unmistakably his own, true, but a voice in which, as
if from below, a persistent chirping intruded, so that the words remained
clearly shaped only for a moment and then were destroyed to such an extent that
one could not be sure one had heard them right. Gregor wanted to answer
thoroughly and explain everything, but restricted himself, given the
circumstances, to saying: “Yes, yes, thank you, Mother, I’m just getting up.”
Due to the wooden door, the change in Gregor’s voice was probably not apparent
on the other side, for the mother contented herself with this explanation and
shuffled away. However, this short conversation brought to the attention of the
other family members that Gregor, quite unexpectedly, was still at home, and
the father was already knocking, gently, but with his fist, on one of the side
doors. “Gregor, Gregor,” he called, “what is the matter?” And after a little
while he called again, in a louder, warning voice: “Gregor, Gregor!” At the
other side door the sister softly pleaded: “Gregor? Aren’t you feeling well? Do
you need anything?” To both doors Gregor answered: “I’m all ready,” and strove,
through enunciating most carefully and inserting long pauses between each word,
to keep anything conspicuous out of his voice. The father went back to his
breakfast, but the sister whispered: “Gregor, open up, I beg you.” Gregor,
however, had no intention whatsoever of opening the door and instead
congratulated himself on the precaution he picked up while traveling of locking
the doors at night, even at home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>All he wanted to do
now was to get up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed, and, most important,
eat breakfast, and only then consider what to do next, because, as he was well
aware, in bed he could never think anything through to a reasonable conclusion.
He recalled how he had often felt slight pains in bed, perhaps due to lying in
an awkward position, pains that proved imaginary when he got up, and he was
eager to see how today’s illusion would gradually dissolve. He had no doubt
that the change in his voice was nothing more than the presentiment of a severe
cold, an ailment common among traveling salesmen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The coverlet was
easy to throw off; he needed only to puff himself up and it fell off by itself.
But then things became much more difficult, especially since he was excessively
wide. He would have needed arms and hands to prop himself up, instead of which
he had only the many little legs that continually waved every which way and
which he could not control at all. If he wanted to bend one, it was the first
to stretch itself out, and if he finally succeeded in getting this leg to do
what he wanted, the others in the meantime, as if set free, waved all the more
wildly in painful and frenzied agitation. “There’s no use staying in bed,”
Gregor said to himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>First he attempted
to get the lower part of his body out of bed, but this lower part, which he had
not yet seen and about which he could form no clear picture, proved too onerous
to move. It shifted so slowly, and when he had finally become nearly frantic,
he gathered his energy and lunged forward, without restraint, in the wrong
direction and so slammed against the lower bedpost; the searing pain that shot
through his body informed him that the lower part of his body was perhaps the
most sensitive at present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He then tried to
get the top part of his body out first, and cautiously moved his head toward
the edge of the bed. This went smoothly enough, and despite its girth and mass
the bulk of his body slowly followed the direction of his head. But when he
finally got his head free over the bedside, he became leery of continuing in
this vein, because if he fell it would be a miracle if he did not hurt his
head. And he must not, especially now, lose consciousness at any price; better
to stay in bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But when he had
repeated his former efforts and once more lay sighing and watching his puny
legs struggle against each other, possibly even more viciously, and had found
no way to bring peace and order to this random motion, he again told himself
that he could not possibly stay in bed and that the logical recourse was to
risk everything in the mere hope of freeing himself from the bed. But at the
same time he did not forget to remind himself periodically that better than
rash decisions was cool, indeed the very coolest, deliberation. In these
moments, he fixed his gaze as firmly as possible on the window, but
unfortunately the sight of the morning fog, which had even obscured the other
side of the narrow street, offered little in the way of cheer or encouragement.
“Seven o’clock already,” he said to himself at the new chiming of the alarm
clock, “seven o’clock already and still such thick fog.” And for a little while
he lay still, breathing lightly as if he expected total repose would restore
everything to its normal and unquestionable state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But then he said to
himself: “Before a quarter past seven I absolutely must be out of bed. Besides,
by that time someone from the office will have come to ask about me, because
the office opens before seven o’clock.” And now he began rocking the whole
length of his body in a steady rhythm in order to pitch it out of the bed. If
he dropped from the bed in this way, he could probably protect his head by
lifting it sharply as he fell. His back seemed to be hard, so it would not be
harmed by the fall to the carpet. His greatest concern was for the loud crash
he was likely to make, provoking fear if not terror behind all the doors.
Still, it must be risked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Gregor was
sticking halfway out of the bed—the new method was less a struggle than a game,
he had only to inch along by rocking back and forth—it struck him how much
easier it would be if someone came to help. Two strong people—he thought of his
father and the maid—would surely suffice: They would only have to slip their
arms under his curved back to lift him from the bed, bend down with their
burden, and be patient and watchful while he engineered his swing over to the
floor, where he hoped his tiny legs would find some purpose. Now, putting aside
the fact that all the doors were locked, should he really call for help?
Despite his predicament, he could not suppress a smile at these thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was already out
so far that he could barely keep his balance while vigorously rocking, and very
soon he would have to decide one way or the other, because in five minutes it
would be a quarter past seven—then the doorbell rang. “That’s someone from the
office,” he said to himself, and slightly stiffened although his legs only
danced more wildly. Everything was still for a moment. “They’re not going to
answer,” Gregor said to himself, clinging to some absurd hope. But then of
course the maid marched sharply to the door as usual and opened it. Gregor
needed only to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting to know who it
was—the head clerk himself. Why was Gregor condemned to serve at a firm where
the smallest infraction was seized upon with the gravest suspicion; was each
and every employee a scoundrel; was there no loyal and dedicated man serving
them who, having spent several hours of the morning not devoted to the firm,
might become so overcome by pangs of remorse as to be actually unable to get
out of bed? Would it not have been enough to send an apprentice to inquire—if
any inquiry were actually necessary; did the head clerk himself have to come,
and did the whole innocent family have to be shown that only the head clerk
could be entrusted to investigate this suspicious matter? And owing more to the
anxiety these thoughts caused Gregor than to any real decision, he swung
himself with all his might out of the bed. There was a loud thud but not really
a crash. The fall was broken somewhat by the carpet, and his back was more
flexible than Gregor had thought, so there resulted only a relatively
unobtrusive thump. However, he had not been careful enough about raising his
head and had banged it; he twisted it and rubbed it against the carpet in pain
and aggravation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Something fell in
there,” said the head clerk in the adjoining room to the left. Gregor tried to
imagine whether something similar to what had happened to him today might one
day befall the head clerk; the possibility really had to be granted. But as if
in rude reply to the question, the head clerk now took a few decisive steps in
the next room, which caused his patent leather boots to creak. From the room to
the right the sister informed Gregor in a whisper: “The head clerk is here.” “I
know,” Gregor said to himself, not daring to raise his voice loud enough for
his sister to hear.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos90117></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Gregor,” the
father said, now from the room on the left, “the head clerk has come and wants
to know why you did not catch the early train. We don’t know what to tell him.
Besides, he wants to speak to you personally, so please open the door. He would
surely be so kind as to excuse the untidiness of the room.” “Good morning, Mr.
Samsa,” the head clerk was calling out amiably. “He is not well,” said the
mother to the head clerk while the father was still speaking through the door,
“he’s not well, sir, believe me. Why else would Gregor miss a train! All that
the boy thinks about is work. It almost makes me mad the way he never goes out
in the evening; he’s been in the city eight days now, but he’s been at home
every night. He sits with us at the table quietly reading the paper or studying
train schedules. His only amusement is busying himself with his fretsaw.<a
href="#filepos477363"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>c</span></span></a> For example, he
spent two or three evenings carving a small frame, you’d be amazed how pretty
it is, he hung it in his room, you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens up. I’m
glad, sir, that you are here; we would never have gotten Gregor to open the
door ourselves, he’s so stubborn and he’s certainly not well even though he
denied it this morning.” “I’m just coming,” said Gregor slowly and carefully,
not moving so as not to miss one word of the conversation. “I can’t think of
any other explanation, madam,” said the head clerk; “I hope it’s nothing
serious. On the other hand I must say we businessmen—fortunately or
unfortunately, as you will—are often obliged to simply overcome a slight
indisposition to tend to business.” “So can the head clerk come in now?” asked
the impatient father, knocking on the door again. “No,” said Gregor. The room
on the left fell into an uncomfortable silence, the sister began sobbing in the
room on the right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Why did the sister
not join the others? She had probably just gotten out of bed and had not yet
begun to dress. And why was she crying? Because he would not get up and let the
head clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job, because the boss
would again start hounding Gregor’s parents for their old debts? These were
surely unnecessary worries at the moment. Gregor was still here and would not
think of deserting his family. Of course, he was currently lying on the carpet
and no one who knew of his condition could seriously expect that he would admit
the head clerk. This petty discourtesy, for which a suitable explanation could
easily be found later, could hardly be grounds for Gregor’s immediate
dismissal. And it seemed to Gregor that it would be more reasonable if they
were now to leave him in peace instead of bothering him with their crying and
pleading. But the others were obviously distressed by the uncertainty, and this
excused their behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Mr. Samsa,” the
head clerk now called, raising his voice, “what is the matter? You are
barricading yourself in your room, giving only yes and no answers, causing your
parents serious and unnecessary concern, and neglecting—I just mention this in
passing—your professional responsibilities in an outrageous manner. I am
speaking here in the name of your parents and your boss, and I seriously beg
you to give a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, just
astonished. I have always known you to be a quiet, reasonable man and now you
suddenly seem to be indulging in rash eccentricities. The Chief did point out a
possible explanation for your absence early today—concerning the cash payments
that were recently entrusted to you—but in fact I practically gave him my word
of honor that this could not be the true explanation. Now, however, I see your
incredible obstinacy and have completely lost any desire to intercede on your
behalf. And your position is by no means unassailable. I originally intended to
speak with you privately, but since you are pointlessly wasting my time, I see
no reason why your good parents shouldn’t also hear. Your recent performance
has been highly unsatisfactory; it is admittedly not a heavy business season,
but a season of no business at all, I assure you, Mr. Samsa, does not exist,
cannot exist.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“But, sir,” cried
Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in his agitation, “I’ll open the
door immediately, this instant. A slight indisposition, a spell of dizziness
prevented me from getting up. I’m still lying in bed. But now I am feeling
completely refreshed. I’m just getting out of bed. Please be patient a moment!
I’m not as well as I thought. But really I’m all right. These things can just
wipe you out so suddenly. Only last night I felt fine, my parents can tell you,
or actually last night I already had some sign of it. They must have noticed
it. Oh, why did I not report it at the office! But one always thinks that one
will overcome an illness without staying home. Sir, please spare my parents!
There are no grounds to the accusations you’ve just made against me, no one has
said so much as a word about them to me. Perhaps you haven’t seen the latest orders
I sent in. In any event, I will be on the eight o’clock train. I’ve been
invigorated by these few hours of rest. Don’t let me keep you further, sir,
I’ll be in the office myself immediately. Please be good enough to tell them
and convey my respects to the Chief!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And while Gregor
blurted all this out, hardly knowing what he said, he had easily, probably due
to the exercise he had had in bed, reached the bureau and was now trying to
pull himself upright against it. He actually wanted to open the door, to
actually show himself and speak to the head clerk; he was eager to find out
what the others, who so desired to see him now, would say at the sight of him.
If they were shocked, then Gregor was no longer responsible and could be calm.
But if they accepted everything calmly, then he too had no reason to get worked
up and could, if he rushed, actually be at the train station by eight o’clock.
At first he kept sliding off the smooth bureau but finally gave himself a last
powerful push and stood upright; he no longer paid attention to the pains in
his lower abdomen, however burning. He then let himself fall against the back
of a nearby chair, his little legs clinging to the edges. In this way he also
managed to gain control of himself and fell silent, as he could now listen to
the head clerk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Did you understand
even a word?” the head clerk asked the parents. “He isn’t making fools of us?”
“For God’s sake,” cried the mother, already weeping, “maybe he is seriously ill
and we’re tormenting him. Grete! Grete!” she then screamed. “Mother?” called
the sister from the other side. They were communicating across Gregor’s room.
“You must go for the doctor immediately. Gregor is sick. Run for the doctor.
Did you just hear Gregor speak?” “That was the voice of an animal,” said the
head clerk, in a noticeably low tone compared to the mother’s shrieking. “Anna!
Anna!” yelled the father through the foyer to the kitchen, clapping his hands,
“go get a locksmith at once!” And already the two girls were running through
the foyer with a rustling of skirts—how had the sister dressed so quickly?—and
throwing open the house door. The door could not be heard closing; they must
have left it open as is usual in houses visited by great misfortune.<a
href="#filepos446544"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>3</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor had become
much calmer however. Apparently his words were no longer understandable even
though they were clear enough to him, clearer than before, perhaps because his
ear had become accustomed to their sound. But at least it was now believed that
all was not right with him and they were ready to help him. He felt cheered by
the confidence and surety with which the first orders were met. He felt
encircled by humanity again and he expected great and miraculous results from both
the doctor and the locksmith, without truly distinguishing between them. In
order to have the clearest voice possible for the decisive conversations to
come, he coughed a little, taking pains to stifle the sound, as it may not have
sounded like a human cough and he could no longer trust his own judgment about
it. Meanwhile in the adjoining room it had become completely still. Maybe the
parents were sitting at the table whispering with the head clerk, or maybe they
were all leaning against the door, listening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With the aid of the
chair, Gregor slowly pushed himself to the door, then let go and threw himself
against it and held himself upright—the pads of his little legs were slightly
sticky—and rested there for a moment from his exertions. He then attempted to
unlock it by taking the key into his mouth. Unfortunately he appeared to have
no teeth—how then should he grasp the key?—but on the other hand his jaws were
certainly very powerful, and with their help he got the key to move, ignoring
the fact that he was somehow harming himself, because a brown fluid had come
from his mouth, oozed over the key, and dripped onto the floor. “Do you hear
that,” said the head clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” This was a
great encouragement to Gregor, but they should all, the mother and father too,
have shouted: “Go, Gregor,” they should have shouted: “Keep going, keep going
with that lock!” And imagining that they were intently following his every
move, he obliviously clenched the key in his jaws with all the strength he
could muster. In accordance with the progress of the key, he danced around the
lock, holding himself up only by his mouth, and as needed he either hung on to
the key or pressed his whole weight down against it. It was the sharp click of
the lock finally snapping back that abruptly roused him. Breathing a sigh of
relief, he said to himself: “So I didn’t need the locksmith after all,” and
pressed his head against the handle in order to completely open the door.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos100607></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since he had to
pull the door open in this way, it was opened quite wide while he himself still
could not be seen. He first had to slowly circumnavigate one of the double
doors and do it very carefully so as not to flop onto his back before entering
the room. He was still busy with this involved maneuver and had no time to be
distracted by anything else when he heard the head clerk burst out with a loud
“Oh!”—it sounded like a gust of wind—and now he also saw the head clerk,
standing closest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and
backing away slowly as if repelled by an invisible and relentless force.<a
href="#filepos447008"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>4</span></span></a> The
mother—standing there, despite the presence of the head clerk, with her hair
still undone and bristling all over—first looked at the father with clasped
hands, then took two steps toward Gregor and fell down amid her billowing
skirts, her face sinking out of sight onto her breast. The father, furiously
shaking his fists as if willing Gregor to go back in his room, looked
uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes in his hands, and sobbed
with great heaves of his powerful chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor did not now
enter the room but instead leaned against the other, firmly locked wing of the
door so that only half of his body could be seen and his head above it, tilting
as he peered out at the others. In the meantime it had grown much brighter; a
section of the endless dark gray building across the street was clearly
visible—it was a hospital, with regular windows breaking through the matte
façade; the rain was still falling but now only in large individually formed
and visible drops that struck the ground one at a time. The many breakfast
dishes lay on the table, as breakfast was the most important meal of the day
for the father, the time when he would pore over the different newspapers for
hours. On the wall just opposite hung a photograph of Gregor from the time of
his military service, showing him as a lieutenant and, with a carefree smile
and his hand on his sword, demanding respect for his bearing and uniform. The
door to the foyer was open, and since the apartment door was also open, one
could see out to the landing and the top of the stairs leading down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well now,” said
Gregor, well aware that he alone had remained calm, “I will get dressed
immediately, pack my samples, and be on my way. Will you all, will you let me
go catch my train? Now you see, sir, I’m not stubborn and I’m happy to work;
traveling is difficult but I couldn’t live without it. Where are you going,
sir? To the office? Yes? Will you report on everything truthfully? A man can
suddenly be incapable of working, but this is the precise moment to remember
his past performance and to consider that later, after resolving his
difficulties, he would work all the harder and more diligently. I am so deeply
obligated to the Chief, as you well know. And besides, I am responsible for my
parents and sister. I am in a tough bind but I’ll work myself back out of it.
Please do not make it more difficult than it already is. I beg you to speak up
for me in the office! No one likes traveling salesmen, I know. They think we
make a slew of money and lead charmed lives. There’s no particular reason for
them to further examine this prejudice. But you, sir, you have a better
perspective than the rest of the office, an even better perspective, in all
confidence, than the Chief himself, who, in his capacity as employer, allows
his opinion to be easily swayed against an employee. You know very well that a
traveling salesman, out of the office for almost the entire year, can easily
fall prey to gossip, coincidences, and unfounded grievances against which he
cannot possibly defend himself because he almost never hears about them except
when returning home from an exhausting trip; he personally suffers the grim
consequences, the causes of which he can no longer determine. Sir, do not leave
without giving me a word to show that you think me at least partially right!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But with Gregor’s
first words the head clerk had already turned away and with gaping lips simply
looked back over his twitching shoulder at Gregor. And during Gregor’s speech
he did not stand still for a moment but crept step-by-step to the door, his
eyes never leaving Gregor, as if obeying some secret injunction to leave the
room. He was already in the foyer, and from the sudden movement with which he
took his last step from the living room, one might believe he had just burned
the sole of his foot. In the foyer, however, he stretched his right hand far
out toward the stairs as if some supernatural deliverance were awaiting him
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor realized
that he must on no account let the head clerk leave in this frame of mind or
his position in the firm would be seriously jeopardized. The parents did not
understand this so well; they had convinced themselves over the years that
Gregor was set for life at this firm, and besides, they were so preoccupied
with the current problem that they had lost all sense of the future. But Gregor
did have this foresight. The head clerk had to be detained, calmed, persuaded,
and ultimately won over; the very future of Gregor and his family depended on
it. If only the sister had been there! She was perceptive; she had already
begun to cry when Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And the head
clerk, that ladies’ man, would certainly have let her guide him; she would have
closed the apartment door and assuaged his fears in the foyer. But the sister
was not there and Gregor would have to handle the situation himself. And
without stopping to think that he still had no idea what powers of movement he
had or even to think that very possibly—indeed probably—his words would once
again be unintelligible, he let go of the wing of the door and flung himself
through the opening; desiring to go toward the head clerk, who was already on
the landing and ludicrously clutching the banister with both hands, Gregor
instead, while groping for support, fell with a little cry onto his numerous
little legs. This had barely happened when, for the first time that morning, he
felt a sense of physical well-being: The little legs had firm ground beneath
them, he was delighted to note that they were completely under his command,
they even strained to carry him off wherever he might desire, and he already
believed that the final alleviation of all his grief was imminent. But at that
same moment, as he lay there rocking from his restrained movement not far from
his mother—in fact just in front of her—she, who had seemed so self-absorbed,
suddenly sprang up with arms wide and fingers outstretched, shouting: “Help,
for God’s sake, help!” She bent her head down as if to see Gregor better but
instead ran contradictorily and madly backward and, having forgotten that the
laden table stood behind her, sat down on it thoughtlessly and hastily,
seemingly oblivious to the large overturned coffee pot next to her from which
coffee was pouring in a steady stream onto the carpet.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos107989></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Mother, Mother,”
Gregor said softly, and looked up at her. The head clerk had momentarily
slipped his mind and he could not help snapping his jaws in the air at the
sight of the flowing coffee. This caused the mother to scream again; she fled
from the table and fell into the father’s arms as he rushed to her. But Gregor
now had no time to waste on his parents; the head clerk was already on the
stairs, with his chin on the banister he was looking back one last time. Gregor
broke into a run to be sure to catch him; the head clerk must have suspected
this because he leaped down several steps and disappeared; he was still
yelling, “Aaahh!” which rang throughout the whole staircase. Unfortunately the
head clerk’s flight seemed to totally confuse the father, who until now had
remained relatively calm, for instead of going after the head clerk or at least
not hindering Gregor’s pursuit, he seized in his right hand the head clerk’s
walking stick (which along with his hat and overcoat had been left behind on a
chair) and with his left hand grabbed a large newspaper from the table and,
stamping his feet, proceeded to brandish the walking stick and newspaper in
order to drive Gregor back into his room. No plea of Gregor’s helped, nor
indeed was any plea understood; however humbly he turned his head, the father
merely stamped his feet all the more forcefully. Across the room the mother,
despite the cool weather, had thrown open a window and was leaning far out of
it with her face buried in her hands. A strong draft swept in from the street
to the staircase, the window curtains swelled, the newspapers on the table
rustled, stray pages fluttered over the floor. The father drove Gregor back
relentlessly, hissing like a savage.<a href="#filepos447410"><span class=2Text><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>5</span></span></a>
As Gregor was as yet unpracticed in moving backward, it was very slow going. If
only Gregor had been permitted to turn around, he would have been in his room
at once, but he was afraid to make the father impatient by this time-consuming
rotation, and at any moment the stick in the father’s hand threatened to deal a
fatal blow to the back or the head. In the end, however, there remained no
other choice, for Gregor observed to his horror that he could not control his
direction when moving backward, and so he began as quickly as possible, which
was actually very slowly, to turn himself around. Perhaps the father recognized
his good intentions because he did not interfere; instead he occasionally even
directed the movement from a distance with the tip of his stick. If only the
father would quit that infernal hissing! It made Gregor completely lose his
head. He was almost turned all the way around when, distracted by the hissing,
he made a mistake and turned back the other way for a stretch. When he
successfully ended up headfirst in front of the doorway, it was obvious that
his body was too wide to get through as it was. Naturally it did not occur to
the father in his present mood to open the other wing of the door to give
Gregor a wide enough passage. He was fixed on the idea of getting Gregor back
in his room as quickly as possible. And he would never have allowed the
elaborate preparations that Gregor needed to pull himself upright and perhaps
attempt to go through the door that way. Rather, he drove Gregor forward, as if
there were no obstacle, with a considerable amount of noise; it no longer
sounded like just one father behind him and now it was really no longer a joke,
and Gregor—come what may—thrust himself into the doorway. One side of his body
rose up and he lay at an angle in the doorway, one of his flanks was scraped
raw and the white door was stained with ugly blotches, he was soon stuck fast
and could not move on his own, the little legs on one side hung trembling in
midair and on the other side they were pinned painfully to the floor—when his
father gave him a terrific shove from behind and he flew, bleeding profusely,
far into the room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then all was
still.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos112122></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=Para18><span lang=EN>II </span></p>

<p class=Para19><span lang=EN>IT WAS TWILIGHT WHEN Gregor awoke from his deep
slumber. Even without being disturbed he doubted he would have slept much later,
as he felt so well rested, but it seemed to him that a furtive step and a
cautious shutting of the foyer door had roused him. The glow of the electric
street lamps shone in pale patches on the ceiling and upper parts of the
furniture, but where Gregor slept it was dark. Slowly, still groping awkwardly
with his antennas, which he was only now learning to appreciate, he pushed
himself over to the door to see what had been happening. His left side felt
like a single long unpleasantly taut scar and he actually had to limp on his
two rows of legs. One little leg, moreover, had been seriously injured during
the course of the morning’s events—it was nearly a miracle that only one had
been hurt—and dragged behind him lifelessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Only when he
reached the door did Gregor discover what had actually tempted him there: the
smell of something edible. For there stood a bowl filled with fresh milk in
which small slices of white bread were floating. He could have almost laughed
for joy, as he was even hungrier than in the morning, and immediately plunged
his head, almost up to the eyes, into the milk. But he quickly withdrew it in
disappointment; not only was eating difficult on account of his tender left
side—and eating had to be a collaboration of the whole heaving body—but he did
not care at all for the milk, which was otherwise his favorite drink and surely
the reason his sister had set it out for him. In fact, it was almost in
revulsion that he turned away from the bowl and crawled back to the middle of
the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the living room,
as Gregor could see through the crack in the door, the gas was lit; although
the father usually liked to read the afternoon paper at this hour in a loud
voice to the mother and sometimes to the sister as well, not a sound was heard.
Well, perhaps this custom of reading that the sister had told him about and
wrote of in her letters had been recently discontinued. But it was so silent
everywhere, even though the apartment was certainly not empty. “What a quiet
life the family has led,” Gregor said to himself, and felt, as he stared
pointedly into the darkness, a great surge of pride that he had been able to
provide his parents and his sister such a life and in such a beautiful
apartment. But what if all the tranquillity, all the comfort, all the
contentment were now to come to a horrifying end? So as not to dwell on such
thoughts, Gregor started to move and began crawling up and down the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Once during the
long evening, one of the side doors and then the other was opened a small crack
and quickly shut again; someone had apparently had the urge to come in but had
then thought better of it. Gregor now stationed himself directly before the
living room door, determined to persuade the hesitant visitor to come in or at
least discover who it might be, but the door was not opened again and Gregor
waited in vain. That morning, when the doors had been locked, they all wanted
to come in; now after he had opened the one door and the others had been opened
during the day, no one came and the keys were now on the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was late into
the night before the light went out in the living room, and it was now obvious
that the parents and the sister had stayed awake until then, because he could
clearly discern that all three were tiptoeing away. Certainly no one would come
in to Gregor until morning, therefore he had a long undisturbed time to ponder
how best to reorder his life. But the high-ceilinged, spacious room in which he
was forced to lie flat on the floor filled him with an unaccountable dread; it
was, after all, his own room which he had inhabited for five years, and with an
almost involuntary movement—and not without a faint feeling of shame—he
scurried under the sofa, where, despite his back being slightly squashed and
being unable to raise his head, he felt immediately cozy and only regretted
that his body was too wide to fit completely underneath the sofa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There he stayed the
whole night, sometimes dozing but then waking up with a start from hunger
pains; sometimes he worried and entertained vague hopes, but it all led him to
the same conclusion: For now he must lie low and try, through patience and the
greatest consideration, to help his family bear the inconvenience he was bound
to cause them in his present condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So early in the
morning that it was almost still night, Gregor had an opportunity to test the
strength of his new resolutions, because the sister, nearly fully dressed,
opened the door from the foyer and eagerly peered in. She did not immediately
find him, but when she noticed him underneath the sofa—well, he had to be
somewhere, he couldn’t have just flown away—she was so startled that, unable to
control herself, she slammed the door shut from the outside. But, as if
regretting her behavior, she instantly reopened it and tiptoed in as though she
were visiting someone seriously ill or even a stranger. Gregor had pushed his
head forward to the edge of the sofa and was watching her. Would she notice
that he had left the milk untouched not from any lack of hunger and bring
something he liked better? If she did not do so on her own, he would rather
starve than bring it to her attention, although he was extremely hard-pressed
not to dart out from under the sofa and throw himself at her feet to beg for
something good to eat. But the sister immediately and with surprise noticed the
bowl, still full except for a little milk that had spilled around it, and
promptly picked it up, not with bare hands of course but with a rag, and
carried it out. Gregor was exceedingly curious as to what she would bring
instead, and he advanced all sorts of theories. But he could never have guessed
what in the goodness of her heart the sister actually did. To find out his
likes and dislikes, she brought him a wide selection all spread out on an old
newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables, bones covered with congealed
white sauce from supper the night before, some raisins and almonds, a cheese
that Gregor had declared inedible two days before, dry bread, bread with
butter, and bread with butter and salt. Beside this she set down the bowl, now
presumably reserved for Gregor’s exclusive use, which she had filled with
water. And it was out of delicacy, knowing Gregor would not eat in her
presence, that she hurriedly removed herself and even turned the key in the
lock to indicate to Gregor that he was free to indulge himself as comfortably
as he pleased. Gregor’s little legs whizzed toward the food. His wounds must
have already been fully healed, he felt no more injury; he marveled at this and
thought about when he had cut his finger with a knife over a month ago and how
this wound had still bothered him just the day before yesterday. “Have I become
less sensitive?” he thought, sucking greedily at the cheese, to which he was
initially and primarily drawn before all the other food. With tears of
gratitude he quickly devoured, one after the other, the cheese, the vegetables,
and the sauce; the fresh food on the other hand did not appeal to him and he
even dragged what he did want to eat a bit farther away. He had long finished
with everything and lay drowsily on the same spot when the sister, to signify
her return, slowly turned the key in the lock. This jerked him into action, as
he was dozing, and he rushed back under the sofa. But he truly had to force
himself, even for the short time that the sister was in the room, to stay
beneath the sofa, because he had bloated slightly from the large meal and he
could barely breathe in such strict confinement. In between minor bouts of
suffocation, he watched with bulging eyes as the unsuspecting sister swept up
not only the remaining scraps but even what Gregor had not touched, as if they
now had no more use, and dumped it all quickly into a bucket that she covered
with a wooden lid and carried away. Hardly had she turned her back when Gregor
came out from under the sofa, stretched, and puffed himself out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor was fed
twice daily in this way, once in the morning while the parents and the maid
still slept, and once after dinner was eaten while the parents napped for a
short time and the sister could send the maid on some errand. The parents
certainly did not want Gregor to starve, but perhaps it was as much as they
could bear to hear about it, perhaps the sister wanted to save them from even
the smallest possible discomfort, as they surely had enough to bear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor had no idea
what excuse was used that first morning to put off the doctor and locksmith,
because as no one could understand him, no one thought, including the sister,
that he could understand them, and so he had to content himself, whenever his
sister was in the room, with hearing a sigh now and then or an appeal to the
saints. A little time later, when she was a bit more at ease—of course it was
never a question of being completely at ease—Gregor sometimes caught a remark
that was meant kindly or at least could be so considered. “Oh, he enjoyed it
today,” she said when Gregor had eaten well, or when he had not, which was more
frequently the case, she would say almost sadly, “It’s all been left again.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Although Gregor
could get no news directly, he overheard a great deal from the neighboring
rooms, and as soon as he heard voices he would run over to the corresponding
door and press his entire body against it. There was no conversation,
especially early on, that did not concern him even if only indirectly. At every
meal for two whole days there were discussions about what should be done, but
this same theme was also debated between meals, because there were always at
least two family members home since no one wanted to be alone in the apartment
and it certainly could not be left empty under the circumstances. Furthermore,
on the very first day, the cook—it was not entirely clear what and how much she
knew of the situation—begged the mother on her knees to be discharged immediately,
and when she took her leave a quarter of an hour later, she was tearfully
thankful for the dismissal, as if it were the greatest service they had ever
conferred upon her, and with no prompting swore a dreadful oath never to
breathe to anyone a word of what had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Now the sister also
had to cook, as did the mother, but this was not much trouble, as the family
ate almost nothing. Again and again Gregor heard one encouraging another in
vain to eat and receiving no answer but: “Thank you, I’ve had enough,” or
something very similar. Perhaps they did not drink either. The sister often
asked the father whether he would have some beer and kindly offered to procure
it herself, and when the father did not reply she suggested that she could send
the janitor’s wife to fetch it to offset any hesitation, but then in the end
the father answered with a firm “No,” and it was discussed no further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the course of
the very first day, the father explained the family’s financial position and
prospects to both the mother and the sister. Now and then he rose from the
table to get some receipt or notebook from the small safe he had managed to
rescue from the collapse of his business five years earlier. He could be heard
opening the complicated lock, removing the desired document, and closing it
again. The father’s explanations were the first encouraging news Gregor had
heard since his captivity. He had been of the opinion that nothing had been
salvaged from the father’s business; at least the father had said nothing to
the contrary, although Gregor had also never asked him. Gregor’s only concern
at that time had been to do whatever he could to have the family forget as
quickly as possible the financial misfortune that had plunged them into total
despair. And so he began to work with consuming energy and was promoted, almost
overnight, from a minor clerk to a traveling salesman with much greater
potential to earn money, and his success was soon transformed, by way of
commission, into cash that he could then lay on the table before the astonished
and delighted family. Those had been happy times and they had never returned,
at least not with the same brilliance, even though Gregor later earned enough
to meet the expenses of the entire family and did so. They had simply grown
used to it, both the family and Gregor; the money was gratefully accepted and
gladly given but it no longer brought any particular warmth. Only the sister
remained close to Gregor, and it was his secret plan that she, who unlike
Gregor greatly loved music and played the violin movingly, should be sent to
the Conservatory next year despite the considerable expense it was sure to
incur, which would just have to be met in some other way. During Gregor’s short
stays in the city, the Conservatory would often come up in conversation with
the sister but always as a beautiful dream that could never be realized. The
parents were displeased to hear even these innocent allusions, but Gregor had
very definite ideas about it and intended to announce his plan on Christmas
Eve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Such were the
thoughts, utterly useless in his present condition, that went through his head
as he stood listening, glued to the door. Sometimes, from general weariness he
could listen no longer and carelessly let his head slump against the door, but
he promptly recovered because even the small noise he had made had been heard
in the next room and had silenced them all. “What’s he up to now?” the father
said after a while, obviously turning toward the door, and only then did the
interrupted conversation resume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor was now very
thoroughly informed—because the father tended to repeat his explanations,
partly because he had not dealt with these matters himself in a long time and
partly because the mother did not always understand the first time—and
discovered that despite the disaster a sum, admittedly very small, remained
from the old days and had increased slightly in the meantime due to the
untouched interest. And besides that, the money Gregor brought home every
month—he had kept only a few guilder for himself—had not been entirely depleted
and had now accumulated into a small capital sum. Behind the door Gregor nodded
his head emphatically, delighted to learn of this unexpected frugality and
foresight. Of course he actually could have used this extra money to further
pay off the father’s debt to the Chief, thus bringing much closer the day he
could have rid himself of this job, but doubtless things were better this way,
the way his father had arranged them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>However, this money
was by no means sufficient to support the family on the interest; the principal
might support the family for a year, or two at the most. So it was just a sum
that should not be touched, put aside for emergencies, and the money to live on
would still need to be earned. Now the father was certainly healthy but an old
man who had not worked in five years and could not be expected to do much;
during these years, the first leisure time in his laborious albeit unsuccessful
life, he had gained a lot of weight and become quite sluggish as a result. And
how should the elderly mother earn a living, when she suffered from asthma and
even a walk through the apartment was trying, leaving her gasping for breath
every other day on the sofa by an open window? And should the sister work, still
a child of seventeen whose life had been so pleasant until now—dressing nicely,
sleeping late, helping with the housework, enjoying a few modest amusements,
and above all playing the violin? At first, whenever the conversation turned to
the need to earn money, Gregor let go of the door and threw himself onto the
cool leather sofa nearby, he felt so flushed with shame and grief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He often lay there
through the whole night, not sleeping a wink, just scrabbling on the leather
for hours. Or, not shying from the great effort, he would push a chair over to
the window, climb up to the sill, and lean, propped up on the chair, against
the windowpanes, evidently in some vague remembrance of the freedom he had once
found in gazing out. For actually he now saw things just a short distance away
becoming dimmer each day; he could no longer make out the hospital opposite,
whose sight he used to curse for having seen it all too often, and if he were
not so certain that he lived on the quiet but decidedly urban Charlotte Street,
he could have believed that he was gazing out the window at a barren wasteland
where the ashen sky merged indistinguishably with the gray earth. The observant
sister had needed to notice the chair standing by the window only twice;
whenever she straightened the room after that, she carefully replaced the chair
at the window and now even left the inner casements open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If only Gregor had
been able to speak with the sister and thank her for everything she was obliged
to do for him, he could have borne her ministrations more easily; as it was
they oppressed him. The sister certainly tried to lessen the general
awkwardness of the situation as much as possible, and as time went by she
naturally succeeded more and more, however with the passing time Gregor too saw
everything more clearly. Her very entrance was terrible for him. Hardly had she
entered when she rushed directly to the window without taking the time to close
the door—although she was usually so careful to shield everyone from the sight
of Gregor’s room—tore the window open with hasty hands as if almost
suffocating, and stayed there awhile, even when it was bitterly cold, breathing
deeply. This bustle and racket of hers tortured Gregor twice a day, and he lay
the entire time quaking under the sofa, knowing very well that she would have
spared him this if it were at all possible to remain in a room with Gregor with
the window shut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Once, approximately
a month after Gregor’s transformation, when there was no reason for the sister
to be especially alarmed at his appearance, she came a little earlier than
usual and caught Gregor perfectly still, gazing out the window, thus giving him
a particularly frightful aspect. It would not have surprised Gregor if she had
not come in, as his position prevented her from immediately opening the window,
but not only did she not enter, she actually jumped back and shut the door; a
stranger could easily have thought Gregor had been lying in wait for her and
meant to bite her. Gregor naturally hid himself at once under the sofa but had
to wait until noon for the sister’s return, and then she seemed much more
uneasy than usual. He concluded that the sight of him was still repulsive to
her and was bound to remain repulsive, and that she must have exercised great
self-control not to take flight at the sight of even the smallest portion of
his body protruding from under the couch. To spare her from even these
glimpses, he dragged the sheet to the sofa on his back one day—this required
four hours’ work—and laid it in such a way as to conceal himself entirely, so
the sister could not see him even if she stooped down. If she did not find the
sheet necessary, she certainly could have removed it, because it was clear
enough that Gregor could not possibly be pleased by his total confinement, but
she left the sheet as it was, and Gregor imagined he caught a grateful look
once when he cautiously raised the sheet a little with his head to see how the
sister was taking the new arrangement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>During the first
two weeks, the parents could not bring themselves to enter his room and he
often heard them praising the efforts of the sister, whereas earlier they had
frequently been annoyed with her because she appeared to them to be a somewhat
useless girl. Now, however, both the father and the mother often waited outside
Gregor’s room while the sister cleaned up inside, and as soon as she stepped
out she had to report fully to them on exactly how the room looked, what Gregor
had eaten, how he had behaved this time, and whether perhaps some slight improvement
was noticeable. Incidentally, the mother wanted to visit Gregor relatively soon
but the father and the sister put her off with logical arguments that Gregor
listened to very attentively and approved of wholeheartedly. But later she had
to be held back by force, and when she cried out: “Let me go to Gregor, he’s my
unfortunate son! Can’t you understand that I must go to him?” Gregor then
thought that it would perhaps be beneficial if the mother did come in, not
every day of course, but maybe once a week; she understood everything much
better than the sister, who for all her pluck was still just a child and may
have ultimately undertaken such a difficult task out of childish recklessness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor’s desire to
see the mother was soon fulfilled. During the daytime Gregor did not want to
show himself at the window, if only out of consideration for his parents, but
he could not crawl around very far in the few square meters of floor, nor could
he bear to lie still even at night, and eating gave him scant pleasure, so as a
distraction he acquired the habit of crawling crisscross over the walls and
ceiling. He especially liked hanging from the ceiling; it was entirely
different from lying on the floor, he could breathe more freely and a mild
tingling ran through his body, and in the near joyful oblivion in which Gregor
found himself up there he could, to his own surprise, lose hold and plunge to
the floor. But naturally he now had much more control over his body than before
and was not harmed by even so great a fall. The sister immediately noticed
Gregor’s newfound entertainment—after all he did leave behind the sticky traces
of his crawling here and there—and she got it into her head to allow Gregor the
widest crawling space possible by the removal of the furniture that hindered
him, namely the bureau and the desk. She was not, however, able to do this
alone; she did not dare ask for the father’s help and the maid would certainly
not help her because, although she, a girl of about sixteen, had had the
courage to stay on after the cook’s departure, she had asked for the privilege
of keeping the kitchen door locked at all times and opening it only upon
specific requests. This left the sister no choice but to ask the mother at a
time when the father was out. The mother did come with exclamations of excited
delight but fell silent outside the door to Gregor’s room. Naturally the sister
first checked to see that everything was in order in the room and only then
admitted the mother. Gregor had very hastily pulled the sheet down lower in
tighter folds so that it really looked like a sheet casually thrown over the
couch. He refrained from peeking out from under the sheet this time, renouncing
this very first sight of his mother, and was only glad she had come at all.
“Come in, you can’t see him,” said the sister, evidently leading the mother by
the hand. Gregor now heard the two frail women pushing the extremely heavy old
bureau from its place and the sister taking on most of the work, not heeding
the warnings of the mother, who feared she might overexert herself. It took a
very long time. After struggling for a good quarter of an hour, the mother
declared that they had better leave the bureau where it was; first, it was just
too heavy, they would not be finished before the father’s arrival, and Gregor’s
every movement would be hindered with the bureau in the middle of the room, and
second, it was not at all certain that removing the furniture was doing Gregor
any great service. It seemed to her that the opposite was true: The look of the
empty wall was heartrending, and wouldn’t Gregor feel that same way since he
had been used to the furniture for so long and might feel bereft in the empty
room. “And doesn’t it look,” concluded the mother very softly, in fact she
practically whispered the whole time as if, not knowing Gregor’s precise
whereabouts, she did not want him to hear even the sound of her voice, as she
was convinced that he could not understand the words, “and doesn’t it look, by
removing all the furniture, like we’ve abandoned all hope of his recovery and
are callously leaving him completely on his own? I think it would be best if we
tried to keep the room exactly as it was before, so that when Gregor comes back
to us he can find everything unchanged and forget that much more easily what
happened in the meantime.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Upon hearing the
mother’s words, Gregor realized that the lack of any direct human exchange,
coupled with the monotony of the family’s life, must have confused his mind; he
could not otherwise explain to himself how he could have seriously wished to
have his room cleared out. Did he really wish his warm room, comfortably
furnished with old family heirlooms, to be transformed into a lair in which he
would certainly be able to crawl freely in any direction, but at the price of
rapidly and completely forgetting his human past? He had indeed been so close
to forgetting that only the voice of the mother, so long unheard, brought him
to his senses. Nothing should be removed, everything must stay as it was, he
could not do without the beneficial influence of the furniture on his state of
mind, and if the furniture impeded his senseless crawling about, it was not a
loss but a great boon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Unfortunately,
however, the sister thought differently; she had grown accustomed, not entirely
without reason, to being especially expert in any discussion with her parents
concerning Gregor, and so now the mother’s advice was grounds enough for her to
insist on removing not only the bureau and desk, as she had originally planned,
but also the rest of the furniture, with the exception of the indispensable
sofa. This determination of course did not arise only from childish defiance
and the self-confidence she had recently and so unexpectedly developed at such
a cost; she had in fact observed that Gregor needed more room to crawl, and as
far as one could see, he never used the furniture. Her determination may also
have arisen from the romantic enthusiasm of girls her age that seeks expression
at every opportunity and tempted Grete to overplay the horror of Gregor’s
predicament in order that she might perform even more heroically on his behalf
than previously. For in a room where Gregor alone ruled over the bare walls, no
one other than Grete was likely to dare set foot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And so she refused
to be shaken from her resolve by the mother, who seemed extremely anxious and
unsure of herself in this room and soon quieted and helped the sister, to the
best of her abilities, to push the bureau outside. Now, in a pinch Gregor could
do without the bureau but the desk must absolutely stay. And no sooner had the
women left the room, grunting and heaving with the bureau, than Gregor poked
his head out from under the sofa to ascertain how he could cautiously and
tactfully intervene. But as luck would have it, it was the mother who returned
first while Grete was still in the next room with her arms around the bureau,
rocking it and trying to shift it on her own but naturally not budging it an
inch. The mother, however, was unaccustomed to Gregor’s appearance and it might
have sickened her; so Gregor panicked and scuttled back to the other end of the
sofa, but he could not prevent the sheet from stirring a little in front. This
was enough to catch the mother’s eye. She froze, stood still for a beat, then
retreated to Grete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Although Gregor
said over and over to himself that nothing out of the ordinary was happening,
that some furniture was just being moved around, he soon had to concede that
the coming and going of the women, their soft exclamations, the scraping of the
furniture along the floor were all like a roaring rising up and pressing in
around him, and no matter how he tucked in his head and legs and flattened his
body to the floor, he was forced to admit that he could not stand the ruckus
much longer. They were clearing out his room, taking from him everything that
he loved; they had already dragged out the bureau, which contained the fretsaw
and other tools, and now they were prying loose the firmly entrenched desk, at
which he had done his assignments during business school, high school, and even
as far back as elementary school—there was now no longer any time to
contemplate the finer intentions of the two women, whose existence he had
actually almost forgotten, because from sheer exhaustion they were struggling
in silence and only the heavy shuffling of their feet could be heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And so he broke
out—the women were in the next room, leaning on the desk to catch their
breath—and ran in four different directions, not knowing what to save first; then
he saw on the otherwise barren wall opposite him the picture of the lady
swathed in furs and quickly scrambled up and pressed himself against the glass,
a surface he could stick to and that soothed his heated belly. At the very
least this picture, which Gregor now completely concealed, would be removed by
no one. He twisted his head around to the living room door to observe the
women’s return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They had not taken
much of a break and were already headed back; Grete had put an arm around the
mother and was almost carrying her. “So what should we take now?” said Grete,
looking around. And then her eyes met Gregor’s gaze from the wall. It was
probably due only to the presence of the mother that she maintained her
composure, bent her head down to the mother to keep her from looking up, and
said, rather shakily and without thinking: “Come, why don’t we go back to the
living room for a moment?” It was clear to Gregor that she intended to get the
mother to safety and then chase him down from the wall. Well, just let her try!
He cleaved to his picture and would not relinquish it. He would rather fly in
Grete’s face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Grete’s words
had quite unnerved the mother; she took a step to the side, took in the huge
brown splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, before realizing what she saw was
actually Gregor, screamed in a loud, harsh voice: “Oh God! Oh God!” and
collapsed, arms, outflung in total abandon, onto the sofa and did not move.
“Gregor, you!” yelled the sister, glaring fiercely and raising her fist. These
were her first direct words to him since the metamorphosis. She ran to the next
room for some kind of aromatic spirits to revive the mother from her faint;
Gregor wanted to help too—there was time enough to save the picture—but he was
stuck fast to the glass and had to wrench himself free, then he also ran into
the next room, as if to offer advice as he used to, but had to stand idly
behind her once there while she was rummaging among the various bottles; she
was freshly shocked when she turned around, one of the vials fell to the floor
and shattered, a splinter of glass sliced Gregor’s face and a corrosive
medicine splashed around him; Grete, without further delay, grabbed as many
vials as she could hold, ran with them to her mother, and kicked shut the door.
Gregor was now cut off from the mother, who might be near death because of him;
he could not open the door for fear of frightening away the sister, who had to
stay with the mother; there was nothing to do but wait, and plagued with worry
and self-reproach he began to crawl, to crawl all over, over everything, walls,
furniture, ceiling, and finally fell in despair, when the whole room was
spinning, onto the middle of the large table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A little while
passed, Gregor still lay prostrate and everything was quiet; perhaps this was a
good sign. Then the doorbell rang; the maid was naturally locked in the kitchen
so Grete had to answer it. It was the father. “What’s happened?” were his first
words; Grete’s appearance must have told all. Grete answered in a muffled voice,
her face obviously thrust against the father’s chest: “Mother fainted, but
she’s better now; Gregor’s broken out.” “Just as I expected,” said the father.
“I keep telling you, but you women won’t listen.” It was clear to Gregor that
the father had misinterpreted Grete’s all too brief statement and assumed
Gregor was guilty of some kind of violence. Gregor now had to try to placate
the father, for he had neither the time nor the means for an explanation. And
so Gregor flew to the door of his room, crouching against it, to show his
father as soon as he came in from the foyer that he had every intention of
returning at once to his room and that it was not necessary to drive him back;
if only someone would open the door, he would immediately disappear.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos146371></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But the father was
in no mood to make such fine distinctions. “Ah!” he cried as soon as he
entered, in a tone both furious and exultant. Gregor drew his head back from
the door and raised it toward the father. He had not at all pictured his father
like this as he was standing there now; admittedly he had been too preoccupied
of late with his newly discovered crawling to concern himself about what was
going on in the household, and he really should have been prepared for some
changes. And yet, and yet could this indeed still be the father? The same man
who used to lie wearily buried in bed when Gregor left for a business trip; who
welcomed his return in the evening by merely raising his arms to show his joy,
not being quite able to get up, and reclining in an armchair in his robe; who,
during the rare family walks a few Sundays a year and on the highest holidays,
shuffled laboriously between Gregor and the mother, always moving a bit slower
than their already slowed pace, bundled in his old overcoat and carefully plodding
forward by meticulously placing his cane; and who, when he wanted to say
something, nearly always stood still and gathered everyone around him?<a
href="#filepos447661"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>6</span></span></a> Now, however, he
held himself erect, dressed in a tight blue uniform with gold buttons, like
that of a bank messenger; his heavy double chin bulged over the high stiff
collar of his jacket; from under the bushy eyebrows his alert black eyes
flashed penetratingly; his previously disheveled white hair was combed flat,
exactingly parted and gleaming. He tossed his cap, on which there was a gold
monogram, very possibly a bank’s, clear across the room in an arc and onto the
sofa, and with his hands in his pockets and the tails of his long uniform
jacket thrown back, he went after Gregor with a grimly set face. He probably
did not know what he himself intended to do, nevertheless he lifted his feet
unusually high and Gregor was astonished at the gigantic size of his boot
soles. But Gregor did not dwell on this; he had known from the very first day
of his new life that the father considered only the strictest measures
appropriate when dealing with him. And so he ran from the father, stopping only
when the father stood still, and scurried away again as soon as the father
moved. In this way they circled the room several times without anything
decisive happening; in fact they proceeded so slowly it did not look like a
chase. With this in mind Gregor kept to the floor for the moment, especially
since he feared the father might view an escape to the walls or ceiling as a
particularly malevolent act. At the same time Gregor had to admit that he could
not keep up with this running for long, because for every step the father took
Gregor had to execute a countless number of maneuvers. He was already short of
breath, as his lungs had never been all that reliable in his previous life. He
staggered along, his eyes barely open, trying to focus all his energy on
running; in this daze he could not think of anything to do but run, and had
already almost forgotten that the walls were available to him, although in this
room they were blocked by elaborately carved furniture, thorny with points and
notches—suddenly something that had been lightly tossed almost hit him, but
landed next to him and rolled in front of him. It was an apple,<a
href="#filepos448300"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>7</span></span></a> and a second
instantly flew in his direction. Gregor froze in terror; further running was
useless, for the father was determined to bombard him. He had filled his
pockets from the bowl on the sideboard and was now throwing apple after apple,
taking no more than general momentary aim. These small red apples rolled around
the floor as if electrified and collided with each other. One weakly lobbed
apple grazed Gregor’s back and harmlessly slid off. But another, pitched
directly after it, actually lodged itself in Gregor’s back; Gregor tried to
drag himself away, as if this shockingly unbelievable pain would ease with a
change in position, but he felt nailed to the spot and stretched out, all his
senses in complete confusion. And it was with his last conscious sight that he
saw the door of his room burst open and in front of the screaming sister the
mother tearing out in her chemise, because when she fainted the sister had
undressed her to let her breathe more freely. He saw the mother run to the
father, stumbling over her loosened petticoats as they slipped to the floor one
by one, and press herself against him, uniting them in her embrace—now Gregor’s
vision failed him—and with her arms flung around his neck, she begged the
father to spare Gregor’s life.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos151171></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=Para18><span lang=EN>III </span></p>

<p class=Para19><span lang=EN>GREGOR’S SERIOUS INJURY, FROM which he suffered
for almost a month—the apple remained embedded in his flesh as a visible
souvenir because no one had the courage to remove it—served to remind even the
father that Gregor, despite his now pathetic and repulsive shape, was a member
of the family who could not be treated as an enemy; on the contrary, in
accordance with family duty they were required to quell their aversion and
tolerate him, but only tolerate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And now, although
Gregor had lost some mobility, most likely permanently due to his injury, and
traversing his room now took many long minutes like an old invalid—crawling above
floor level was out of the question—he was granted, in his mind, entirely
satisfactory compensation for this deterioration of his condition: toward
evening every day the living room door, which he got used to watching intently
for an hour or two beforehand, was opened, so that lying in the darkness of his
room and unseen from the living room, he could view the whole family at the
brightly lit table and could listen to their conversation more or less with
their consent, completely unlike his prior eavesdropping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Of course there no
longer were the lively conversations of earlier times that Gregor would
wistfully recall whenever he’d had to sink down into the damp bedding of some
small hotel room. Now it was mostly very subdued. The father fell asleep in his
armchair soon after supper, and the mother and the sister would caution each
other to keep still; the mother, bent over toward the light, sewed delicate
lingerie for an apparel shop; the sister, who had taken a job as a salesgirl,
was studying shorthand and French in the hope of attaining a better position in
the future. The father sometimes woke up and, as if he were not aware he had
been sleeping, would say to the mother: “How long you’re sewing again today!”
and instantly fall back asleep while mother and sister exchanged a tired smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Out of some absurd
obstinacy, the father refused to take off his messenger’s uniform even in the
house, and while the dressing gown hung uselessly on the clothes hook, the
father sat fully dressed in his chair, as if he were ever ready for duty and
awaited, even here, his superior’s call. As a result the uniform, which was not
new to begin with, became more and more seedy despite all the efforts of the
mother and sister, and Gregor often spent whole evenings staring at this
garment, covered with greasy stains and gleaming, constantly polished gold
buttons, in which the father slept awkwardly but very peacefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As soon as the
clock struck ten, the mother tried to rouse the father with gentle words and
then persuade him to go to bed, for he simply was not getting any proper rest
where he was, something he sorely needed since he had to go on duty at six.
But, with this stubbornness that he had acquired since becoming a bank
messenger, he always insisted on staying longer at the table even though he
nodded off regularly, and it was then a monumental task to coax him into
exchanging the chair for the bed. However much the mother and sister prodded
him with admonishments, he would go on shaking his head slowly with his eyes closed
for another quarter of an hour and refuse to get up. The mother plucked at his
sleeve, cajoling softly in his ear, and the sister left her lessons to help the
mother, all to no avail. The father only ensconced himself farther in the
chair. Not until the two women pulled him up under the arms would he open his
eyes and look back and forth from the mother to the sister, with the customary
remark: “What a life. This is the rest of my old age.” And supported by the two
women, he rose haltingly to his feet as if he himself were his greatest burden
and allowed the women to steer him to the door, where he shrugged them off and
labored on alone, while the mother dropped her sewing and the sister her pen to
run after him and aid him further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Who in this
overworked and exhausted family had time to fuss over Gregor more than was
absolutely necessary? The household was even further reduced; the maid was
dismissed after all and a huge bony charwoman with white hair flapping around
her head came mornings and evenings to see to the heaviest chores; the mother
took care of everything else on top of her copious sewing. Even various pieces
of family jewelry, which the mother and sister used to joyously display at
parties and celebrations, had to be sold, as Gregor learned from a discussion
of the obtained prices one evening. However, their most persistent lament was
that they could not leave this apartment, much too large for their present
needs, because it was inconceivable how Gregor was to be moved. But Gregor
fully comprehended that it was not only consideration for him that prevented a
move, for he could easily have been transported in a suitable crate with a few
airholes; what truly hindered them was an utter hopelessness and the belief
that a plight had befallen them unlike any other that had been visited upon
their friends or relatives. They carried out the world’s demands on poor people
to the extreme: The father fetched breakfast for the minor bank clerks, the
mother sacrificed herself to the underwear of strangers, the sister ran to and
fro behind the counter at customers’ beck and call, but beyond this the family
had no more strength. And the wound in Gregor’s back began to hurt anew
whenever the mother and sister, after putting the father to bed, returned to
the table, left their work idle, drew close to each other, and sat cheek to
cheek, and whenever the mother, pointing toward Gregor’s room, now said: “Go
shut that door, Grete,” and Gregor was in darkness again while next door the
women mingled their tears or stared dry-eyed at the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor spent the
days and nights almost entirely without sleep. Sometimes he mulled over the
idea that the next time the door opened he would take control of the family
affairs as he had done in the past; these musings led him once more after such
a long interval to conjure up the figures of the boss, the head clerk, the
salesmen, the apprentices, the dullard of an office messenger, two or three
friends from other firms, a sweet and fleeting memory of a chambermaid in one
of the rural hotels, a cashier in a milliner’s shop whom he had wooed earnestly
but too slowly—they all appeared mixed up with strangers or nearly forgotten
people, but instead of helping him and his family they were each and every one
unapproachable, and he was relieved when they evaporated. Then other times he
could not be bothered to worry about his family, he was filled with rage at
their miserable treatment of him, and even though he could not imagine anything
that might spark his appetite he still devised plans to raid the pantry and,
even if he was not hungry, get the food due him. No longer concerning herself
about what Gregor might particularly care for, the sister hastily shoved any
old food through the door to Gregor’s room with her foot, both morning and noon
before she raced to work, and in the evening cleared it all out with one sweep
of the broom, indifferent to whether the food had only been tasted or—as was
most frequently the case—left completely untouched. The cleaning of his room,
which she now always did in the evening, could not have been more cursory.
Grimy dirt streaked the walls, layers of dust and filth had settled everywhere.
At first, whenever the sister came in, he would station himself in corners
particularly offensive in this respect as if to impart some reproach. But he
could have waited there for weeks without the sister showing any improvement;
she could see the dirt just as well as he, but she had simply made up her mind
to leave it there. At the same time, with a testiness that was new to her and
had in fact overtaken the whole family, she made certain that this tidying
remained in her sole domain. The mother once subjected Gregor’s room to
thorough cleaning that was effected only after many buckets of water—all this
dampness sickened Gregor of course, and he lay sprawled on the sofa, embittered
and immobile—but the mother’s punishment was not far off. Because as soon as
the sister noticed the change in Gregor’s room that evening, she ran into the
living room deeply insulted and despite the mother’s hands, raised imploringly,
burst into a fit of tears while the astonished parents—the father was naturally
shocked out of his chair—looked on helplessly. Then they quickly started in;
the father admonished the mother to his right for not having left the cleaning
of Gregor’s room to the sister and shouted at the sister to his left that she
was never again allowed to clean Gregor’s room; meanwhile the mother tried to
drag the overexcited father to the bedroom, the sister shaking with sobs beat
her small fists on the table, and Gregor hissed furiously because no one had
thought to close his door and spare him this racket and spectacle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But even if the
sister, worn out by her job, ceased to tend to him as she used to, there was no
need for the mother’s intervention or for Gregor to be at all neglected. For
now there was the charwoman. This old widow, who must have weathered the worst
in her long life with the help of her sturdy bone structure, was not
particularly disgusted by Gregor. Without being truly nosy, she happened to
open the door to Gregor’s room one day and, at the sight of Gregor—who was
completely caught off guard and, although no one chased him, began running back
and forth—she merely stood still, her arms folded over her middle, in amazement.
Since then she never failed to briefly open the door a crack every morning and
evening to look in on Gregor. Initially she would also call him over to her
with words she probably considered friendly, like “Come on over, you old dung
beetle!”<a href="#filepos448880"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>8</span></span></a> or “Just look at
the old dung beetle!” Gregor did not respond to these overtures but remained in
his place as if the door had never been opened. If only they had ordered this
charwoman to clean his room every day instead of allowing her to uselessly
barge in on him whenever the whim seized her! Early one morning—a heavy rain,
maybe a sign of the coming spring, was pelting the windowpanes—Gregor was so
exasperated when the charwoman started up again with her sayings that he turned
toward her as if to attack, albeit decrepitly and slowly. Instead of being
frightened, however, the charwoman simply raised a chair that was close to the
door and stood there with her mouth wide open; it was clearly her intention to
shut her mouth only when the chair was smashed on Gregor’s back. “So you’re not
coming any closer?” she inquired when Gregor turned back around, and calmly put
the chair back down in the corner.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos162553></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gregor now ate next
to nothing. Only when by chance he passed the food set out for him would he
take a bite just for fun, hold it in his mouth for hours, and mostly spit it
back out. At first he thought he was mourning the state of his room and that
this kept him from eating, but he soon grew accustomed to precisely these
changes. It had become habit to put anything that had no other place in the
house in this room, and these things now amounted to a lot because a room in
the house had been let to three gentlemen boarders.<a href="#filepos449703"><span
class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>9</span></span></a> These dour men—all three had full beards, as Gregor
ascertained once through a crack in the door—were passionate about order, not
only in their room but, since they were boarding there, throughout the whole
household, especially the kitchen. They could not abide useless, let alone
dirty, junk. Besides, they had for the most part brought their own household
goods with them. For this reason many things had become superfluous, and while
they had no commercial worth they also could not be thrown away. All these
things ended up in Gregor’s room. This included the ash can and the rubbish bin
from the kitchen. Anything deemed useless for now was hastily hurled into
Gregor’s room by the charwoman; Gregor was usually lucky enough to see just the
object in question and the hand that held it. Perhaps the charwoman intended to
collect these things as time and opportunity afforded, or to throw everything
out together, but in fact they lay wherever they happened to land unless Gregor
waded through the junk pile and set it in motion, at first out of necessity
because there was no other free space to crawl but later with increasing
pleasure, though after these forays he lay still for hours, achingly tired and
miserable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since the boarders
sometimes took their evening meal in the common living room as well, the living
room door stayed shut certain evenings, yet Gregor was easily reconciled to the
door’s closing: On many evenings it was opened he had not taken advantage of it
but, without the family noticing it, had lain in the darkest corner of his
room. One time, however, the charwoman had left the living room door slightly
ajar and it stayed open, even when the boarders entered in the evening and the
lamp was lit. They sat at the head of the table where the father, mother, and
Gregor had sat in the old days; they unfolded their napkins and took knife and
fork in hand. The mother at once appeared in the doorway with a platter of meat
and directly behind her was the sister with a heaping dish of potatoes. Thick
plumes of steam rose from the food. The boarders bent over the dishes as if to
examine them before eating; in fact the one in the middle, seemingly regarded
as an authority by the other two, cut into a piece of meat still on the
platter, evidently to determine whether it was tender enough or needed to be
sent back to the kitchen. He was satisfied and mother and sister, who were
anxiously watching, released their breath and began to smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The family itself
ate in the kitchen. Nevertheless the father came into the living room before
retiring to the kitchen, bowed deeply, hat in hand, and made the rounds of the
table. The boarders stood up as one and mumbled something into their beards.
When they were alone again they ate in virtual silence. It seemed odd to Gregor
that out of the myriad noises from the meal, he could always distinguish the
mashing teeth, as if to indicate to Gregor that teeth were needed in order to
eat and even the best of toothless jaws could do nothing. “I’m hungry enough,”
said Gregor to himself mournfully, “but not for these things. How these
boarders stuff themselves and here I am starving to death!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On this very
evening—Gregor could not remember having heard the violin all this time—the
sound of the violin came from the kitchen. The boarders had already finished
their supper, the middle one had taken out a newspaper and distributed a sheet
each to the two others, and they were now leaning back, reading and smoking.
When the violin began playing they all looked up, got to their feet, and
tiptoed to the foyer door, where they huddled together. They must have been
heard from the kitchen because the father called out: “Are the gentlemen
disturbed by the violin playing? It can be stopped at once.” “On the contrary,”
said the middle gentleman, “wouldn’t the young lady care to come in here with
us and play where it is more spacious and comfortable?” “Oh, certainly,” cried
the father, as though he were the violinist. The boarders retreated to the room
and waited. Soon the father entered with the music stand, the mother with the
music, and the sister with the violin. The sister calmly prepared everything to
start playing; the parents, who had never before let a room and were
consequently excessively polite to the boarders, did not dare to sit in their
own chairs; the father leaned against the door with his right hand tucked
between two buttons of his fastened uniform jacket; the mother, however, was
offered a chair by one of the gentlemen and sat down where he had chanced to
put it, off in a corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The sister began to
play; the mother and father on either side of her attentively followed the
movement of her hands. Gregor, seduced by the playing, had ventured farther
forward and his head was already in the living room. His growing lack of
concern for the others hardly surprised him, whereas previously he had prided
himself on being considerate. And yet now he had more reason than ever to stay
hidden: He was coated with the dust that blanketed his room and blew around at
the slightest movement, bits of fluff, hair, and food stuck to his back and
trailed from his sides; he was so deeply indifferent that he would not turn
over and scrape his back clean against the carpet as he once did several times
a day. And despite his condition, he was not ashamed to inch farther onto the
immaculate living room floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>No one, to be sure,
paid him any mind. The family was completely absorbed by the violin playing;
the boarders on the other hand had at first stood with their hands in their
pockets so close behind the sister that they could all have read the music,
which must have irritated her, but they soon withdrew to the window and stayed
there with lowered heads and half-heard grumblings while the father eyed them
nervously. Indeed it was more than obvious that their hopes of hearing the
violin played well or entertainingly were disappointed, that they had had
enough of the recital and were only suffering through this disturbance of their
peace out of politeness. In particular, the manner in which they blew their
clouds of cigar smoke to the ceiling through their mouths and noses displayed
severe aggravation. And yet the sister played so beautifully. Her face was
tilted to one side and she followed the notes with soulful and probing eyes.
Gregor advanced a little, keeping his eyes low so that they might possibly meet
hers. Was he a beast if music could move him so? He felt as though the path to
his unknown hungers was being cleared. He was grimly determined to reach the
sister and tug on her skirt to suggest that she take her violin and come into
his room, for no one here was as worthy of her playing as he would be. He would
never let her leave his room, at least as long as he lived; for the first time,
his horrifying appearance would work to his advantage: He would stand guard at
all the doors simultaneously, hissing at the attackers; the sister, however,
would not be forcibly detained but would stay with him of her own free will.
She would sit beside him on the sofa, she would lean down and listen as he
confided how he had intended to send her to the Conservatory and how, if
misfortune had not interfered, he would have announced this plan to everyone
last Christmas—had Christmas really passed already?—and brooked no argument.
After this declaration the sister would burst into emotional tears and Gregor
would raise himself to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which she kept bare
since she started working, wearing no ribbon or collar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Herr Samsa!”
yelled the middle man to the father, and without wasting another word pointed
his index finger at Gregor, who was slowly crawling forward. The violin stopped
abruptly, and the middle boarder first smiled at his friends, shaking his head,
and then looked at Gregor again. Rather than drive Gregor out, the father
seemed to consider it more urgent to pacify the boarders, although they were
not upset in the least and appeared to be more entertained by Gregor than the
violin playing. The father rushed to them and tried to herd them back to their
room with his outstretched arms while at the same time blocking their view of
Gregor with his body. They now became a bit annoyed, but it was not clear
whether the father’s behavior was to blame or whether the realization was
dawning on them that they had unwittingly had a neighbor like Gregor. They
demanded explanations from the father, they raised their arms at him and
nervously yanked their beards, then they very reluctantly backed away toward
their room. In the meantime the sister woke up from the bewildered state she had
fallen into after the sudden interruption of her music; after she listlessly
dangled the violin and bow awhile in her slack hands and gazed at the music as
though she were still playing, she pulled herself together, put the instrument
in the mother’s lap (the mother was still seated, gasping asthmatically for
breath), and ran into the next room, which the boarders were rapidly nearing
under the father’s pressure. One could see blankets and pillows fly in the air
around the bed and arrange themselves under the sister’s practiced hands.
Before the men even reached the room she had finished making the beds and
skipped out. Once again the father seemed so overpowered by his own obstinacy
that he had forgotten the very least courtesy due his tenants. He just kept
pushing and pushing them up to the very door of the room, where the middle
boarder brought him to a halt by thunderously stamping down his foot. “I hereby
declare,” he said, raising his hand and looking around for the mother and
sister, “that in view of the revolting conditions prevailing in this household
and family”—here he promptly spat on the floor—“I give immediate notice.
Naturally I will not pay a cent for the days I have already spent here; on the
contrary I shall seriously consider pursuing some legal claim against you
that—believe me—will be quite easy to substantiate.” He stopped and stared
directly before him as though awaiting something. Sure enough, his two friends
jumped in with the words: “We too give our notice.” Thereupon he grabbed the door
handle and banged shut the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The father
staggered and groped for his chair, which he collapsed into; it looked like he
was stretching out for his usual evening nap, but the seemingly uncontrollable
bobbing of his head revealed that he was anything but asleep. All this time
Gregor had lain quietly where the boarders had first spied him. The
disappointment at his plan’s failure and perhaps also the weakness caused by
his persistent hunger kept him firmly rooted to the spot. He feared, with a
fair degree of certainty, that in the next moment he would bare the brunt of
the whole disaster, and so he waited. He did not stir, even when the violin
slipped from the mother’s shaky fingers and fell from her lap with a
reverberating twang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“My dear parents,”
said the sister, pounding the table with her hand by way of introduction,
“things can’t go on like this. Maybe you don’t realize it, but I do. I refuse
to pronounce my brother’s name in front of this monstrosity, and so I say: We
have to try to get rid of it. We’ve done everything humanly possible to care
for it and tolerate it; I don’t believe anyone could reproach us.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“She’s absolutely
right,” the father said to himself. The mother, who was still struggling to
catch her breath and had a wild look in her eyes, began to cough hollowly into
her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The sister rushed
to the mother and cradled her forehead. The father’s thoughts seemed to have
cleared in the aftermath of the sister’s words; he sat up straight, played with
the cap of his uniform among the dishes that still lay on the table from the
boarders’ supper, and from time to time glanced over at Gregor’s inert form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“We have to try to
get rid of it,” said the sister, addressing only the father because the mother
could hear nothing over her coughing. “It’ll kill you both, I can see that
coming. We all work too hard to come home to this interminable torture. And I
can’t stand it anymore.” And she began sobbing so violently that her tears
coursed down onto the mother’s face, where she mechanically wiped them away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Oh, child,” said
the father compassionately and with apparent understanding, “what can we do?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The sister just
shrugged her shoulders, displaying the helplessness that had overtaken her
during her crying jag in stark contrast to her former self-confidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“If only he could
understand us,” the father said, almost as a question; the sister, still
sobbing, vehemently waved her hand to show how unthinkable it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“If only he could
understand us,” repeated the father, closing his eyes to absorb the sister’s
conviction that this was impossible, “then we might be able to come to some
sort of agreement with him. But as it is—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“It has to go,” the
sister cried, “that’s the only way, Father. You have to try to stop thinking
that this is Gregor. Our true misfortune is that we’ve believed it so long. But
how can it be Gregor? Because Gregor would have understood long ago that people
can’t possibly live with such a creature, and he would have gone away of his
own accord. Then we would have no brother, but we could go on living and honor
his memory. But instead this creature persecutes us and drives out the
boarders; it obviously wants to take over the whole apartment and throw us out
into the gutter. Just look, Father,” she suddenly screamed, “he’s at it again!”
And in a state of panic that was totally incomprehensible to Gregor—she even
abandoned the mother, she literally bolted from the chair as if she would
rather sacrifice the mother than stay in the vicinity of Gregor—she rushed
behind the father, who got to his feet only out of agitation from her behavior
and half-raised his arms as if to protect her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Gregor had no
intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. He had merely begun
to turn around to start the journey back to his room, although it was an
alarming operation to watch, since his enfeebled condition forced him to use
his head to achieve the complex rotations by alternately lifting it and then
banging it down. He paused and looked around him. His good intentions appeared
to have been recognized; it had only been a momentary alarm. Now they all
watched him in glum silence. The mother lay back in her chair, her legs
outstretched but squeezed together and her eyes almost shut from exhaustion;
the father and sister sat side by side—her hand around his neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now maybe I can
turn around,” Gregor thought, and resumed his labor. He could not help panting
from the effort and had to rest every once in a while. At least he left on his
own with no one harassing him. As soon as he had finished turning, he started
to crawl straight back. He was astonished by how far away the room was and
could not understand how he had recently and in his pathetic condition so
unknowingly traveled that great a distance. He was so intent on crawling
rapidly that he barely noticed that not a single word or any interference came
from his family. Only when he was already in the doorway did he turn his
head—not all the way, for he felt his neck stiffening—and saw that nothing had
changed behind him except that the sister had risen. His final gaze fell on the
mother, who was now deeply asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was hardly in
his room when the door was shut hastily, then bolted and locked. The sudden
noise behind him rattled Gregor so much that the little legs gave way beneath
him. It was the sister who had been in such a rush. She had been standing by
ready and waiting and had lightly leapt forward before Gregor even heard her
coming; “Finally!” she cried to the parents as she turned the key in the lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“What now?” Gregor
wondered, peering around in the darkness. He soon discovered that he could no
longer move at all. This did not particularly puzzle him, rather it seemed
unnatural to him that he had actually been able to walk on these skinny little
legs. Otherwise he felt relatively comfortable. Of course his whole body ached,
but it seemed to him that the pain was gradually fading and would eventually
disappear altogether. He could hardly feel the rotten apple in his back and the
enflamed area around it, which were covered over by soft dust. His thoughts,
full of tenderness and love, went back to his family. He was even more firmly
convinced than his sister, if possible, that he should disappear. He remained
in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck
three in the morning. He hung on to see the growing light outside the window.
Then his head sank involuntarily to the floor and his last feeble breath
streamed from his nostrils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the charwoman
came early in the morning—from sheer energy and impatience she always slammed
all the doors, no matter how many times she had been asked not to, so it was
impossible for anyone to sleep peacefully after her arrival—she found nothing
unusual during her brief customary visit to Gregor’s room. She thought he was
lying motionless on purpose, pretending to sulk; she imbued him with all manner
of intelligence. Since she happened to be holding the long broom, she tried to
tickle him from the doorway. When this produced no response she became annoyed
and began to jab at Gregor; it was only when her shoves were met with no
resistance and moved him from his place that she became alerted. She soon
grasped the truth of the matter; her eyes went wide and she gave a low whistle
but did not hesitate to tear open the Samsas’ bedroom door and yell into the
dark: “Come and look at this, it’s croaked; it’s lying there, dead as a
doornail!”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos182116></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Herr and Frau Samsa<a
href="#filepos450195"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>10</span></span></a> sat up in their
matrimonial bed, struggling to overcome the shock of the charwoman’s
announcement before realizing its full import. Then they each clambered quickly
out of bed from either side, Herr Samsa wrapped the blanket around his
shoulders and Frau Samsa came out in her nightgown, and so attired they stepped
into Gregor’s room. Meanwhile the living room door also opened, where Grete had
slept since the advent of the boarders; she was fully dressed as though she had
not slept all night and her wan face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?” said Frau
Samsa, and looked up inquiringly at the charwoman, although she could have
investigated herself and it was plain enough without examination. “I’d say so,”
said the charwoman, and to prove it she pushed Gregor’s corpse well to one side
with the broom. Frau Samsa made a move to stop her, but checked it. “Well,”
said Herr Samsa, “thanks be to God.” He crossed himself and the three women
followed suit. Grete, her eyes never leaving the corpse, said: “Look how thin
he was. It’s so long since he’s eaten anything. The food came out just as it
was brought in.” Indeed, Gregor’s body was completely flat and dry; this could
be truly appreciated for the first time, since it was no longer supported by
the little legs and nothing else distracted their gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Grete, come in
with us for a while,” said Frau Samsa, with a sad smile, and Grete traipsed
after her parents into their bedroom without looking back at the corpse. The
charwoman shut Gregor’s door and opened the window wide. Although it was very
early in the morning, there was a mildness in the fresh air. It was, after all,
already the end of March.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The three boarders
emerged from their room and looked around in astonishment for their breakfast;
they had been forgotten. “Where is breakfast?” the middle gentleman gruffly
demanded of the charwoman. But she just shushed the men with a finger to the
mouth and silently ushered them into Gregor’s room. They filed into the now
fully lit room and circled around Gregor’s corpse, with their hands in the
pockets of their rather shabby coats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Just then the
bedroom door opened and Herr Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one
arm and his daughter on the other. They were all a little teary-eyed, and from
time to time Grete pressed her face against her father’s sleeve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Leave my house at
once!” pronounced Herr Samsa, and pointed to the door without releasing the
women. “Whatever do you mean?” said the mildly disconcerted middle boarder,
with a sugary smile. The two other gentlemen stood with their hands held behind
their backs, incessantly rubbing them together as if in gleeful anticipation of
a terrific row that they were bound to win. “I mean exactly what I said,”
answered Herr Samsa, making a beeline for the boarders with his two companions
in tow. The middle boarder quietly stood his ground at first, eyeing the floor
as if reordering things in his head. “Well then, we’ll be going,” he said, and
looked up at Herr Samsa as though in a sudden fit of humility he were seeking
fresh approval for this decision. Herr Samsa just nodded briefly several times
with his eyes bulging. Thereupon the gentleman immediately strode into the
foyer; his two friends had been standing at attention for a while and now
positively chased after him, seemingly fearful that Herr Samsa might reach the
foyer before them and cut them off from their leader. In the foyer, all three
took their hats from the coatrack, their canes from the umbrella stand,
silently bowed, and then left the apartment. In what proved to be unfounded
mistrust, Herr Samsa and the two women stepped out onto the landing and,
leaning on the banisters, they watched the gentlemen slowly but surely descend
the long staircase, disappearing on each floor at a certain turn and then
reappearing a moment later; as they dwindled down, the family’s interest in
them waned, and when a butcher’s boy cockily carrying a tray on his head swung
past them and on up the stairs, Herr Samsa and the women quit the banister and,
as if relieved, returned to the apartment.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos186609></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They decided to
spend the day resting and going for a walk; they not only deserved this respite
from work, they desperately needed it. So they sat down at the table to write
three letters of excuse,<a href="#filepos450686"><span class=2Text><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>11</span></span></a>
Herr Samsa to the bank director, Frau Samsa to her client, and Grete to the
shopkeeper. While they were writing, the charwoman came in to announce that she
was off, as her morning chores were done. The three scribes merely nodded at
first without looking up, but when the charwoman kept hovering they eyed her
irritably. “Well?” asked Herr Samsa. The charwoman stood grinning in the
doorway as if about to report some great news for the family but would only do
so after being properly questioned. The little ostrich feather sitting almost
erect on top of her hat, which had annoyed Herr Samsa throughout the whole of
her employ, fluttered about in all directions. “Well, what is it then?” queried
Frau Samsa, for whom the charwoman had the most respect. “Well,” answered the
charwoman, interrupting herself with good-natured chuckling, “well, you don’t
have to worry about getting rid of the thing next door. It’s already been taken
care of.” Frau Samsa and Grete bowed their heads to the letters as if to resume
writing; Herr Samsa, who realized that she was eager to begin describing the
details, cut her short with a definitive gesture of his hand. But since she
could not tell her story, she remembered that she was in a great hurry, and,
obviously insulted, she called out: “So long, everyone,” then furiously whirled
around and slammed out of the apartment with a terrific bang of the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“She’ll be
dismissed tonight,” said Herr Samsa, receiving no reply from either his wife or
daughter, for the charwoman had dismantled their barely maintained composure.
They got up, went to the window, and stayed there hugging each other. Herr
Samsa turned in his chair and quietly watched them a little while. Then he
called: “Come now, come over here. Put the past to rest. And have a little
consideration for me too.” The women promptly obeyed him, caressed him, and
hurriedly finished their letters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Then all three left
the apartment together, which they had not done in months, and took a trolley
to the countryside on the outskirts of town. Their trolley car had no other
passengers and was flooded with warm sunshine. Leaning back comfortably in
their seats, they discussed their prospects for the future and concluded, on
closer inspection, that these were not at all bad; for all three had jobs
which, although they had never really questioned each other about this, were
entirely satisfactory and seemed to be particularly promising. The greatest
immediate amelioration of their circumstances would easily come to fruition
with a change of residence: They wanted to take some place smaller and less
expensive but better situated and more efficiently designed than the apartment
they had, which had been Gregor’s choice. It occurred almost simultaneously to
both Herr and Frau Samsa, while they were conversing and looking at their increasingly
vivacious daughter, that despite the recent sorrows that had paled her cheeks,
she had blossomed into a pretty and voluptuous young woman. Growing quieter and
almost unconsciously communicating through exchanged glances, they thought it
was time to find her a good husband. And it was like a confirmation of their
new dreams and good intentions that at their journey’s end their daughter
jumped to her feet and stretched her young body.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>IT WAS A SUNDAY morning at the peak of spring.
Georg Bendemann, a young businessman, sat in his own room on the second floor
of one of the low, shabbily constructed houses that stretched alongside the
river in an extensive row, almost indistinguishable from each other except in
height and color. He had just finished writing a letter to a childhood friend
who now lived abroad, he fiddled with the letter as he languidly sealed it, and
then, with his elbow propped up on the writing desk, gazed out the window at
the river, the bridge, and the faintly green hills on the far bank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He recalled how his
friend, disgruntled by his prospects at home, had more or less fled to Russia.
Now he ran a business in St. Petersburg that started off very well but had long
since faltered, as the friend bitterly complained during his increasingly rare
visits. And so he was pointlessly grinding himself down in a foreign country,
an unfamiliar full beard barely hiding the face Georg had known so well since
childhood and a sallow complexion indicating an advancing disease. By his own
account he had no real contact with the local colony of his countrymen and
virtually no social intercourse with the Russian families and so resigned
himself to becoming an incurable bachelor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>What could one
write to such a man, a man who had obviously gone astray and who was certainly
to be pitied but could not be helped? Should he be advised to come home, to
transplant his life and resume all the old friendships—nothing prevented this—and
generally rely on the help of friends? But all this would mean to him, and the
more tactfully it was put the more offensive it would be, was that his every
effort had been for naught, and he should finally abandon them, that he should
return home and suffer being viewed by everyone as the prodigal returned
forever, that only his friends had any understanding of things, and that he was
a big child who must simply listen to those friends who had remained home and
been successful. And after all, could one be assured that there would be any
purpose to all this certain pain inflicted upon him? Perhaps it would be
impossible to coax him home at all—he himself said that he no longer understood
the goings-on here at home—and so he would remain banished despite everything,
embittered by his friends’ advice and further alienated from them. But if he
did actually follow their advice and then could not get along at home—not out
of malice but through force of circumstance—either with his friends or without
them, suffering the humiliation of becoming truly friendless and homeless,
would it not be better for him to stay abroad, just as he was? Could one really
imagine, considering the circumstances, that he could make a successful go of
it back here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For these reasons
it was impossible to send any of the real news, if one wanted to keep up a
correspondence at all, that one would nonchalantly reveal to the most casual
acquaintance. It was more than three years since the friend’s last visit, a
circumstance he ineffectually blamed on Russia’s uncertain political situation,
which apparently would not permit even the shortest trip of a small business
man while hundreds of thousands of Russians peacefully traveled the world over.
In the course of these three years, however, much had changed in Georg’s own
life. The news of his mother’s death—she died two years ago and Georg had since
been living with his elderly father—had reached the friend, who sent a letter
expressing his condolences so dryly that it could be concluded that the grief
over such an event could not be felt from such a distance. But since that time
Georg had tackled his business, as well as everything else, with more fervor.
Perhaps his father had insisted on running the business his own way during the
mother’s lifetime and prevented Georg from making his own mark; perhaps his
father, while still working, had become less active since her death;
perhaps—and indeed this was most probable—accidental good fortune had played a
far more important role, but whatever the cause, the business had grown quite
dramatically during these two years: The personnel had been doubled, the
profits had increased fivefold, and there was undoubtedly further prosperity
just around the corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Georg’s friend
had no inkling of this change. Earlier, perhaps the letter of condolence was
the last time, he had tried to lure Georg into emigrating to Russia and
expounded upon the prospects that St. Petersburg offered in precisely Georg’s
line of business. The figures he quoted were minuscule compared to the scale
Georg’s business had assumed. But Georg was not inclined to write of his
commercial success to his friend, and were he to do so now, it would appear
especially peculiar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So Georg always
confined himself to relating the trivial matters that randomly arise from a
disorganized memory on a reflective Sunday. His sole desire was to leave intact
the picture of the hometown the friend must have constructed over the years and
had come to accept. Thus it happened that Georg had informed his friend in
three fairly widely spaced letters about the engagement of an inconsequential
person to an equally inconsequential girl until, quite contrary to his
intentions, the friend became interested in this noteworthy event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Yet Georg preferred
writing about these sorts of things rather than admit that he himself had
gotten engaged a month ago to a Fraulein Frieda Brandenfeld, a girl from a
well-to-do family. He often spoke of his friend to his fiancée and the strange
relationship that had developed from their correspondence. “So he won’t be
coming to our wedding,” she said, “and yet I have the right to meet all your
friends.” “I don’t want to trouble him,” Georg replied; “please understand me,
he would probably come, at least I think so, but he would feel obligated and
hurt and he might even envy me; at any rate he’d feel dejected and, with no
other recourse, he’d have to go back alone. Alone—do you know what that is?”
“Yes, but might he not learn of our marriage some other way?” “I can’t help
that of course, but it’s unlikely considering his circumstances.” “If you have
such friends, Georg, you should never have even gotten engaged.” “Well, we both
have that cross to bear, but now I wouldn’t have it any other way.” And when,
breathing quickly under his kisses, she still protested with: “It really does
offend me,” he decided there wouldn’t be much harm in telling his friend
everything. “This is how I am and so this is how he must take me,” he said to
himself. “I can’t fashion myself into a different person who might be better
suited to be his friend.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And in the long
letter he had written that Sunday morning, he did in fact announce to his
friend his engagement with the following words: “I have saved the best news for
last. I have become engaged to a Fraulein Frieda Brandenfeld, a girl from a
well-to-do family that only settled here long after your departure, so that you
most likely don’t know them. There will be time to tell you more about my
fiancée later, but for today suffice it to say that I am very happy and that,
insofar as our own relationship is concerned, the only difference is that you
have exchanged a quite ordinary friend for a happy one. Furthermore, in my
fiancée, who sends her warm regards and who will shortly be writing to you
personally, you will acquire a sincere friend, a not wholly unimportant thing
for a bachelor. I know there is much to keep you from visiting us, but wouldn’t
my wedding be precisely the right occasion for overcoming these obstacles? Be
that as it may, do as you see fit, all other considerations aside.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg had been
sitting at his writing desk with this letter in his hand for a long time, his
face turned to the window. With a vacant smile, he had barely acknowledged the
greeting of an acquaintance passing in the street below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He finally tucked
the letter into his pocket, left his room, crossed a little passageway, and
entered his father’s room, which he had not set foot in for months. Indeed,
there was usually no cause for him to do so, since he saw his father regularly at
the office; middays they always dined together at a restaurant, and although
they fended for themselves in the evening, they usually—unless Georg, as was
most often the case, went out with friends or, more recently, visited his
fiancée—sat for a while, each with his own newspaper, in their common living
room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg was shocked
to see how dark his father’s room was even on this sunny morning. The high wall
towering on the other side of the narrow courtyard really cast quite a shadow.
His father was sitting by the window in a corner elaborately decorated with
mementos of Georg’s late mother, reading a newspaper held up at an angle from
his eyes to compensate for some deficiency in his vision. The remains of his
breakfast, not much of which seemed to have been eaten, stood on the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Ah, Georg!” said
his father, and promptly rose to meet him. His heavy dressing gown swung open
as he walked and the skirts flapped around him.—“My father is still such a
giant,” Georg remarked to himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“It’s unbearbly
dark in here,” he then said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, it certainly
is dark,” his father agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“And you’ve shut
the window too?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I prefer it like
this.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well, it’s quite
warm outside,” said Georg, almost as an addendum to his previous comment, and
sat down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His father cleared
away the breakfast dishes and put them on a chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I only wanted to
tell you,” continued Georg, blankly mesmerized by the old man’s movements,
“that I’ve written to St. Petersburg of my engagement.” He drew the letter out
of his pocket a little, then let it drop back down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“To St.
Petersburg?” the father asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“To my friend
there,” said Georg, seeking his father’s eye.—“He’s so different at the
office,” he thought, “sitting here so expansively with his arms crossed over
his chest.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes. To your friend,”
the father emphasized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well, you know,
Father, that I didn’t want to tell him about my engagement at first. Out of
consideration for him, no other reason. You know yourself he’s a difficult man.
I said to myself that, however unlikely, considering his solitary life, he
might hear of my engagement some other way. I can’t stop that, but he wasn’t
going to hear it from me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“And now you’ve
reconsidered?” asked his father, placing the huge newspaper on the windowsill
and his spectacles on top of it, then covering them with his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, now I’ve
reconsidered. If he is a good friend of mine, I said to myself, then my happy
engagement should also make him happy. And so then I didn’t hesitate any longer
to tell him. But before I posted it, I did want to let you know.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Georg,” said his
father, opening wide his toothless mouth, “listen to me! You’ve come to me with
this matter to consult me. No doubt that’s to your credit. But it is nothing,
less than nothing, if you do not tell me the whole truth. I don’t want to stir
up inappropriate matters here. Since the death of our dear mother, certain
unpleasant things have occurred. Perhaps the time to speak of them will come
too and perhaps it will come sooner than we think. At the office there is much
that escapes me, perhaps things aren’t exactly being kept from me—I won’t
assume they are being kept from me—but I’m not up to it any longer: My memory’s
failing and I can’t keep track of so many things anymore. First of all, that’s
the course of nature, and second, I was hit harder than you by the death of our
precious mother.— But since we’re just talking about this, this letter, I beg
of you, Georg, don’t lie to me. It’s a trivial matter, barely worth one’s
breath, so don’t lie to me. Do you really have this friend in St. Petersburg?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg stood up,
embarrassed. “Never mind my friends. A thousand friends cannot replace my
father. Do you know what I think? You’re not taking good enough care of
yourself. But your age demands it. You know very well that you are indispensable
to me at the office, but if the business is going to endanger your health, then
tomorrow I’ll shut it down for good. But that won’t do. We have to make changes
in your daily routine. From the ground up. You sit here in the dark while the
living room is streaming with light. You pick at your breakfast instead of
nourishing yourself properly. You sit by a closed window when the air would do
you so much good. No, Father! I will fetch the doctor and we will follow his
instructions. We’ll switch rooms, you’ll take the front room and I’ll take this
one. It won’t be any different for you, we’ll move all your things in there.
But all in due time, just lie down in bed for a bit now, you really need to
rest. Come, I’ll help you undress, you’ll see, I know how. Or would you rather
go straight to the front room and lie down in my bed for now? That would be the
most sensible thing.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg stood close
to his father, whose head, with its fleecy white hair, had sunk onto his chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Georg,” his father
said softly, without moving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg immediately
knelt down by his father, he saw the enormous pupils fixing him from the
corners of the eyes in his father’s worn face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You have no friend
in St. Petersburg. You have always been a prankster and you’ve also never
spared me from your pranks. How could you possibly have a friend there! I
simply can’t believe it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Just think back a
bit, Father,” said Georg, lifting his father out of the chair and slipping off
the dressing gown as soon as he rather feebly stood there, “it’ll soon be three
years since my friend came to visit us. I still remember that you didn’t
especially like him. At least twice I pretended to you that he wasn’t here,
even though he was sitting in my room. I could understand your aversion to him
perfectly well, my friend has his quirks. But then you got along with him quite
well later on. At the time I felt very proud that you were listening to him,
nodding and asking him questions. If you think about it, you’re bound to
remember. He used to tell us the most incredible stories of the Russian
Revolution. Like the time he was on a business trip to Kiev, and during a riot
he saw a priest on a balcony who had cut a broad bloody cross into his palm and
raised it, appealing to the mob. You’ve even repeated this story once or
twice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Meanwhile Georg had
successfully eased his father back into the chair and carefully removed the
socks and the long woolen underclothes he wore over his linen underwear. At the
sight of these rather soiled undergarments he reproached himself for neglecting
his father. It would certainly have been his duty to ensure that his father had
clean clothes. So far he had not explicitly discussed his father’s future with
his fiancée, for they had both tacitly assumed that he would remain on in the
old house by himself. But Georg now resolved, with swift and firm
determination, to move his father into his new household with him. It almost
seemed, on closer inspection, that the care his father would get there might
come too late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He carried his
father to bed in his arms. During the few steps to the bed he noticed, with an
awful feeling, that his father was playing with his watch chain as he curled
against Georg’s chest. He could not lay him down right away because he clutched
the watch chain so fiercely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But no sooner was
he in bed than all seemed well. He covered himself up and then drew the
blankets especially high over his shoulders. He looked up at Georg with a not
unfriendly gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You are beginning
to remember him, aren’t you?” asked Georg, giving him an encouraging nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Am I well covered
now?” his father asked, as if he could not check to see whether his feet were
covered or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So you’re already
quite snug in bed,” remarked Georg, and he tucked the blankets more closely
around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Am I well covered?”
his father repeated, and seemed to be keenly interested in the answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Don’t worry,
you’re all covered up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“No!” shouted his
father, so loudly that the answer slammed back into the question, throwing off
the blankets with such force that they unfurled completely for a moment in the
air, and then springing to his feet in bed. He had only one hand on the ceiling
to steady himself. “You wanted to cover me up, I know it, you little cretin,
but I’m not covered up yet. And even if I’m at the end of my strength, it’s
still enough for you, more than enough for you. Yes, I know your friend. He
would have been the son after my own heart. That’s why you’ve been cheating him
all these years. Why else? Do you think I haven’t wept for him? And that’s why
you lock yourself up in your office, the chief is busy, mustn’t be disturbed—so
you can write your deceitful little letters to Russia. But fortunately no one
has to teach a father to see through his son. And just when you thought you had
him down, all the way down, so far down you can sit your backside on him and he
won’t move, then my fine son decides to get himself married!”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos209821></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg stared up at
the monstrous specter of his father.<a href="#filepos451294"><span class=2Text><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>12</span></span></a>
His friend in St. Petersburg, whom his father suddenly knew so well, wrenched
his heart as never before. He imagined him lost in the vastness of Russia. He
pictured him standing in the doorway of his empty, plundered warehouse. He
could barely stand amid the wreck of his showcases, his ruined wares, and the
falling gas brackets. Why did he have to move so far away?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now listen to me!”
his father cried, and Georg, nearly half frantic, ran to the bed to absorb
everything, but stopped midway there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Because she lifted
her skirts,” his father started simpering, “because she pulled up her skirts
like this, the nasty little goose,” and demonstrated by hiking his shirt high
enough to reveal the scar on his thigh from his war days, “because she lifted
her skirts like this and like that, you threw yourself on her, and in order to
have your way with her undisturbed, you disgraced your mother’s memory,
betrayed your friend, and shoved your father into bed so that he can’t move.
But can he move, or can’t he?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And he stood up, independent
of any support, and kicked out his legs. He was radiant with insight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg stood in a
corner, as far from his father as possible. He had already made up his mind
years ago to guard his every move so as to be on the lookout for a surprise
attack from above, behind, or below. He recalled this long-forgotten resolve
just now and as quickly forgot it, like a short length of thread drawn through
the eye of a needle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“But your friend
has not been betrayed after all!” cried his father, punctuating his words with
a pointed finger. “I’ve been representing him locally.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“What a comedian!”
burst from Georg, but he realized just as soon the damage that had been done,
and only too late bit down—his eyes bulging—so hard on his tongue that he
recoiled in pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, I have been
acting out a play! A play! Great word! What other comfort was left for an old
widowed father? Tell me—and when you answer, still be my living son—what was
left for me, in my back room, plagued by a disloyal staff, and old to the very
marrow? And my son saunters exultantly through the world, closing deals I had
prepared, falling all over himself with joy, and slinking away from his father
with the stiff mug of an honorable man! Do you think I didn’t love you, I who
fathered you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now he’s going to
lean forward,” thought Georg; “what if he fell and shattered to pieces!” These
words buzzed through his brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His father did lean
forward but did not tumble. Since Georg had not come any nearer, as expected,
his father righted himself again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Stay where you
are, I don’t need you! You think you still have the power to come over here and
only hold back of your own free will. Don’t fool yourself! I am still stronger
by far. Alone I may have had to yield, but Mother left her strength to me, your
friend has joined me in a splendid alliance, and I have your clientele here in
my pocket!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“He even has
pockets in his nightshirt!” Georg said to himself, and believed that this
remark could render his father ridiculous before the whole world. But this
thought stayed with him only a moment, because he always forgot everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Just bring your
fiancée around here on your arm! I’ll sweep her from your side, you don’t know
how quick!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg grimaced in
disbelief. His father merely nodded at Georg’s corner, assuring the truth of
his words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“How you amused me
today, coming to ask me if you should tell your friend about your engagement.
He already knows it, you stupid boy, he knows everything! I’ve been writing
because you forgot to take away my writing things. That’s why he hasn’t come
here for years, he knows everything a hundred times better than you; he
crumples your unread letters in his left hand while he holds up his right hand
to read my letters!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He flung his arms
over his head in his enthusiasm. “He knows everything a thousand times better!”
he cried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Ten thousand
times!” said Georg, to ridicule his father, but the words came out of his mouth
deadly earnest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“For years I’ve
been waiting for you to come to me with this question! Do you think I’ve been
interested in anything else? Do you believe I read newspapers? Look!” and he
threw at Georg a sheet of newspaper that had somehow been swept into the bed.
It was an old newspaper whose name was entirely unfamiliar to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“How long you
fought off your adulthood! Your mother had to die, she couldn’t witness the
joyous day; your friend is rotting in Russia, three years ago he was already
yellow enough to toss out, and as for me, you can see how I’m faring. You can
see that much!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So you’ve been
waiting to pounce on me!” cried Georg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a pitying tone,
his father casually remarked: “You probably meant to say that earlier. Now it’s
beside the point.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And then louder:
“So now you know what else existed in the world outside of you, before you knew
only about yourself! Yes, you were a truly innocent child, but you were even
more truly an evil man!—And for that reason, I hereby sentence you to death by
drowning!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Georg felt forcibly
driven from the room, the crash of his father falling to the bed still rained
down on him as he fled. On the stairs, which he slipped down as he would a
hill, he ran into the cleaning woman, who was on her way up to do the morning
tidying. “Jesus!” she yelped, and covered her face with her apron, but he was
already gone. He leapt from the door and across the road, driven toward the
water. Already he clung to the railing like a starving man to food. He swung
himself over, like the outstanding gymnast he had been in his youth, the pride
of his parents. He was still clinging with a weakening grip when he spied an
approaching motor bus through the railings that would easily dampen the sound
of his fall; he softly called out: “Dear parents, I have always loved you,” and
let himself drop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At that moment an
unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>AS SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KARL ROSSMANN, whose poor
parents had sent him off to America because a maid had seduced him and then had
his child, sailed into New York harbor on the now slowly moving ship, he saw
the Statue of Liberty, which he had already been watching from far off, stand
out as if shining in suddenly brighter sunlight. The arm with the sword<a
href="#filepos452005"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>13</span></span></a> reached up as if
freshly thrust out, and the free breezes blew around the figure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So high!” he said
to himself, and without any thought of disembarking, he was pushed farther and
farther along, all the way to the railing, by the constantly swelling throng of
porters pressing past him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On his way by, a young
man with whom he had been briefly acquainted during the voyage said to him:
“Well, don’t you feel like going ashore yet?” “Oh yes, I’m ready,” said Karl,
laughing, and out of sheer joy and youthful strength, he hoisted his trunk onto
his shoulder. But as he looked beyond his acquaintance, who was already moving
off and lightly swinging his stick, he remembered with dismay that he had left
his own umbrella below deck. He hastily begged his acquaintance, who seemed
none too pleased, to be kind enough to watch his trunk a moment; he surveyed
his surroundings to regain his bearings and hurried off. Down below he was
disappointed to find that a passageway that would have shortened his route
considerably was barred now for the first time, probably because of all the
disembarking passengers, and he had to arduously make his way through a long
series of small rooms, down countless short staircases, one after another,
through continually winding corridors, past a room with a deserted desk, until
finally, as he had only gone this way once or twice before and always in a
large group, he was utterly lost. In his bewilderment he came to a stop by a
small door, and because he encountered no one and could hear only the endless
trampling of thousands of human feet overhead, and from a distance like a sigh
the final whine of the engines shutting down, he began, without consideration,
to pound on the door.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos219622></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“It’s open,” a
voice called from inside, and Karl opened the door with a genuine sigh of
relief. “Why are you pounding on the door like a madman?” asked a huge man,
barely glancing at Karl. Through some kind of overhead hatch murky light, long
stale from its use on the decks above, seeped into the miserable cabin, where a
bed, a closet, a chair, and the man were crowded together side by side as if
stowed there. “I’ve lost my way,” said Karl. “I never really noticed it during
the voyage, but this is an awfully large ship.” “Yes, you’re right about that,”
the man said with a certain degree of pride but did not stop fiddling with the
lock of a small footlocker that he kept pressing shut with both hands to hear
the catch snap home. “But come on in!” the man continued. “You don’t want to
stand around outside!” “Am I intruding?” asked Karl. “No, how would you be
intruding!” “Are you German?” Karl tried to reassure himself further because he
had heard a lot about the dangers that threatened newcomers to America, from
the Irish especially.<a href="#filepos452258"><span class=2Text><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>14</span></span></a>
“That I am, yes indeed,” said the man. Karl still hesitated. Then the man
unexpectedly seized the door handle and swiftly shut the door, sweeping Karl
into the cabin. “I can’t stand being peered at from the corridor,” he said,
fiddling with the chest again; “they all run by and peer in, who can put up
with it!” “But the corridor is totally empty now,” said Karl, who was pressed
uncomfortably against the bedpost. “Yes, now,” said the man. “But we’re talking
about now,” thought Karl; “this is a difficult man to talk to.” “Why don’t you
lie down on the bed, you’ll have more room,” said the man. Karl crawled in as
best he could and chuckled loudly at his first unsuccessful attempt to pitch
himself across the bed. But as soon as he was in the bed he exclaimed: “Good
God, I’ve completely forgotten my trunk!” “Well, where is it?” “Up on deck,
someone I met is watching it. Now what was his name?” And from a secret pocket
that his mother had sewn into his jacket lining specially for this voyage, he
fished out a visiting card. “Butterbaum, Franz Butterbaum.” “Is your trunk
really necessary?” “Of course.” “Well then, why did you give it to a complete
stranger?” “I had forgotten my umbrella down below and ran to get it, but I
didn’t want to lug my trunk along. And then I got lost too.” “Are you alone? No
one accompanying you?” “Yes, I’m alone.”—“Maybe I should stick with this man,”
went through Karl’s mind, “where could I find a better friend?” “And now you’ve
also lost your trunk. Not to mention the umbrella.” And the man sat down on the
chair as if he had developed some interest in Karl’s problem. “But I don’t
believe the trunk is really lost yet.” “Believe what you want,” said the man,
vigorously scratching his short, dark thatch of hair, “on a ship the morals
change as often as the ports. In Hamburg, your Butterbaum might have guarded
your trunk; here there’s most likely no trace left of either of them.” “Then I
must go look for it immediately,” said Karl, looking around to see how he could
leave. “Stay where you are,” the man said, and thrust a hand against Karl’s
chest, pushing him roughly back onto the bed. “But why?” Karl asked peevishly.
“Because it makes no sense,” said the man; “in a little while I’m going and
then we can go together. Either the trunk is stolen and there’s no help for it,
or the man has left it there and we’ll find it all the more easily when the
ship is empty. The same goes for your umbrella.” “Do you know your way around
the ship?” asked Karl warily, as it seemed to him that there must be some catch
in the otherwise convincing notion that his things would be best found on an
empty ship. “Well, I’m a stoker,”<a href="#filepos478163"><span class=2Text><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>f</span></span></a>
the man said. “You’re a stoker!” Karl cried happily, as if this exceeded all
expectation and, propping himself up on his elbows, he inspected the man more
closely. “Just outside the cabin where I slept with the Slovak there was a
porthole through which you could see into the engine room.” “Yes, that’s where
I worked,” said the stoker. “I have always been interested in technology,” said
Karl, pursuing his own train of thought, “and would surely have become an
engineer later on if I hadn’t had to leave for America.” “Why did you have to
leave, then?” “Oh, that!” said Karl, waving away the whole business with his
hand. At the same time he looked at the stoker with a smile as if asking his
indulgence for what he hadn’t even admitted. “I’m sure there was some reason,”
said the stoker, and it was hard to tell whether he was demanding or dismissing
the story behind that reason. “Now I could become a stoker too,” said Karl, “my
parents don’t care what becomes of me.” “My job will be free,” said the stoker,
and as a show of this he put his hands in the pockets of his creased and
leathery, iron gray trousers and flung his legs across the bed in order to
stretch them out. Karl had to move over closer to the wall. “Are you leaving
the ship?” “Yes, we’re moving out today.” “But why? Don’t you like it?” “Well,
that’s the way things go, it’s not always a matter of what pleases you or not.
But as a matter of fact you’re right, I don’t like it. You’re probably not
seriously thinking of becoming a stoker, but that’s exactly when it’s easiest
to become one. So, I strongly advise you against it. If you wanted to study in
Europe, why don’t you want to study here? The American universities are
incomparably better than the European ones.” “It’s certainly possible,” said
Karl, “but I have almost no money for a university. I did read about someone
who worked all day and studied at night until he got a doctorate and became a
mayor, I believe, but that requires a lot of perseverance, doesn’t it? I’m
afraid that’s something I lack. Anyway, I was never a very good student, and
leaving school was not particularly hard on me. And perhaps the schools here
will be even more stringent. I speak almost no English. And besides, I think
people here are prejudiced against foreigners.” “So you’ve found that out
already? Well, that’s good. Then you’re my man. Look, we’re on a German ship,
it belongs to the Hamburg-America line, so why aren’t we all Germans here? Why
is the chief engineer a Romanian? His name is Schubal. It’s beyond belief. And
that villain makes us slave away on a German ship! Don’t go thinking”—he was
out of breath and flailing his hand—“that I’m complaining just to complain. I
know you have no influence and are just a poor young lad yourself. But it’s a
shame!” And he beat the table repeatedly, his eyes fixed on his fist as he
banged. “I’ve served on so many ships”—and he fired off twenty names as if they
were one word, making Karl dizzy—“and I’ve always excelled, I was praised, the
captains always liked my work, I even worked for several years on the same
merchant ship”—he stood up as if this had been the high point of his life—“and
here on this tub, where everything is done by the book and no brains are
required, here I’m no good, here I’m always in Schubal’s way, I’m a lazybones
who deserves to be thrown out and only get his pay out of mercy. Can you
understand that? I can’t.” “You shouldn’t put up with that,” said Karl
heatedly. He felt so at home here on the stoker’s bed that he had almost lost
any sense of being on the unsteady ground of a ship off the coast of an unknown
continent. “Have you been to see the captain? Have you asked him to see to your
rights?” “Oh, go away, just go away. I don’t want you here. You don’t listen to
what I say and then you give me advice. How am I supposed to go to the
captain?” And the stoker wearily sat down again and buried his face in both
hands.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos227861></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I can’t give him
any better advice,” Karl said to himself. And the overwhelming thought occurred
to him that he would have been better off going after his trunk instead of
staying here and offering advice that was only considered stupid. When his
father had handed over the trunk to him for good he had jokingly asked: “How
long will you keep it?” and now this precious trunk might already be well and
truly lost. His sole consolation was that his father, even if he did make
inquiries, could hardly find out about his present situation. The shipping
company could only say that he had gotten as far as New York. But Karl was
sorry that he had hardly used the items in the trunk, though he ought to have,
for instance, long since changed his shirt. So he had economized in the wrong
place, and now, at the very start of his career, when it was necessary to
arrive neatly dressed, he would have to appear in a dirty shirt. Otherwise the
loss of the trunk would not have been so bad, as the suit he was wearing was
actually better than the one in the trunk, which was only an emergency suit
that his mother had had to mend just before his departure. Now he also
remembered that a piece of Verona salami was still in his trunk; his mother had
packed this as a special treat, but he had eaten only the tiniest bit of it
because he had had no appetite during the voyage and the soup served in
steerage<a href="#filepos478406"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>g</span></span></a> amply sufficed.
But he would gladly have that sausage in hand now, so that he could present it
to the stoker. For people such as this are easily won over if one slips them
any old trifle; Karl had learned that from his father, who by distributing
cigars won over all the underlings with whom he had to do business. At present
all Karl had to give away was his money, and he did not want to touch that for
the moment, considering he might have already lost his trunk. Again his
thoughts returned to the trunk, and now he could not understand why he had kept
watch over it so vigilantly during the voyage that it had almost cost him his
sleep, when he had later allowed the same trunk to be taken from him so easily.
He remembered the five nights during which he had incessantly suspected a
little Slovak, lying two berths to his left, of having designs on the trunk.
This Slovak had merely been waiting for Karl to be overcome by fatigue and nod
off for a moment so that he could hook the trunk and pull it over to him with a
long pole that he played or practiced with all day long. During the day the
Slovak seemed innocent enough, but as soon as night fell he would periodically
rise from his berth and mournfully eye Karl’s trunk. Karl could see him quite
clearly, for there was always someone lighting a lamp here or there, even
though this was forbidden by the ship’s regulations, with the restless anxiety
of an emigrant trying to decipher the incomprehensible brochures from the
emigration agencies. If such a light was nearby, Karl could doze off for a
while; but if the light was far away or it was totally dark, then he had to
keep his eyes open. This strain had thoroughly exhausted him and now it may
have all been in vain. Oh, that Butterbaum, if he ever saw him again somewhere!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At that instant the
absolute silence was broken by brief little thuds in the distance like
children’s footsteps; they came nearer and grew louder until it was the steady
tread of men marching. They were evidently walking single file as was natural
in the narrow passage, and a clattering sound like weapons could be heard.
Karl, who had been on the verge of stretching out on the bed and sleeping, free
from worry over trunks and Slovaks, started up and nudged the stoker to fully
alert him, as the head of the procession seemed to have just reached the door.
“That’s the ship’s band,” said the stoker, “they’ve been playing on deck and
now they’re going to pack up. It’s all clear now and we can go. Come on!” He
seized Karl by the hand, took a framed picture of the Madonna off the wall at
the last moment and stuffed it in his breast pocket, grabbed his footlocker,
and hastily left the cabin with Karl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now I’m going to
the office and giving those gentlemen a piece of my mind. There are no more
passengers, so I don’t have to mince words.” The stoker kept repeating
variations of this, and as he went along he kicked out sideways, attempting to
stomp on a rat that scurried across their path but only driving it faster into
a hole that it reached in the nick of time. The stoker was generally slow in
his movements, for while his legs were long they were just too heavy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They passed through
a section of the kitchen where some girls in dirty aprons—they were
deliberately splashing themselves—were washing dishes in large tubs. The stoker
called over a girl named Line, put his arm around her waist, and led her a ways
away while she pressed herself coquettishly against his arm. “It’s time to get
our pay, do you want to come along?” he asked. “Why should I bother; bring the
money back here,” she replied, and slipped under his arm and ran away. “Where
did you pick up that beautiful boy?” she called back, but did not wait for an
answer. There was laughter from all of the girls, who had stopped their work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Karl and the
stoker kept walking until they came to a door with a small pediment over it
supported by little gilded caryatids. It looked quite extravagant for a ship’s
decor. Karl realized that he had never been in this area of the ship, which had
probably been reserved for first- and second-class passengers during the
voyage, whereas now all the partitions had been removed for the scouring of the
ship. In fact, they had already run into some men with brooms on their
shoulders, who had greeted the stoker. Karl marveled at the intense flurry of
activity; he knew little of it, of course, in steerage. Running along the
passageways there were also wires from electrical lines, and a little bell
could be heard ringing constantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The stoker
respectfully knocked at the door, and when a voice called, “Come in,” he
motioned at Karl with a wave of his hand to be brave and enter. This he did,
but then remained standing by the door. Beyond the three windows of the room he
saw the waves of the ocean, and his heart soared as he took in their buoyant
motion, as if he had not been looking incessantly at the ocean for five long
days. Immense ships were crossing in front of one another, yielding to the
swell of the waves only as much as their tonnage allowed. Through narrowed eyes
the ships appeared to be staggering under their own massive weight. Their masts
bore slim but elongated flags which were drawn taut by the ships’ movement yet
kept fluttering to and fro. Salvos, probably fired from warships, rang out; one
such ship was passing fairly nearby and its gun barrels were glinting in the
sunlight, seemingly enveloped by the sure, smooth, but rippling glide of the
ship through the water. The smaller ships and boats, from the doorway at least,
could only be seen in the distance as swarms of them darted through the gaps
between the larger ships. But beyond all this towered New York, examining Karl
with the hundred thousand windows of its skyscrapers. Yes, in this room one
knew where one was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three gentlemen
were sitting at a round table, one a ship’s officer in a blue naval uniform and
the other two, officials of the harbor authority, in black American uniforms.
On the table lay a mountainous stack of different documents, which the first
officer skimmed through with pen in hand, then turned over to the other two,
who read them, made excerpts, then filed them away in their briefcases, except
when one of the two officials, who was almost constantly clacking his teeth,
dictated something for his colleague to record.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A small man sat at
a desk by one window with his back to the door and fussed over weighty ledgers,
which were arranged side by side on a solid bookcase just in front of him.
Beside him lay an open cash box, which appeared empty at first glance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The second window
was clear and provided the best view. But two gentlemen stood by the third
window, conversing in low tones. One of them, who was leaning against the
window, also wore a naval uniform and was toying with the hilt of a sword. The
man with whom he was speaking was facing the window, and every so often his
movements partially revealed a row of medals on the other man’s chest. He was
dressed in civilian clothes and held a thin bamboo cane which, since he stood
with his hands on his hips, also jutted out like a sword.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos236957></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl did not have
much time to ingest all this, for an attendant quickly stepped up to them and
asked the stoker, with a purposeful look conveying that he had no business
here, what it was he wanted. Responding as softly as he had been asked, the
stoker replied that he wished to speak to the chief purser.<a
href="#filepos478703"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>h</span></span></a> The attendant,
for his part, dismissed this request with a wave of his hand but nevertheless
tiptoed, giving the round table a wide berth, over to the man with the ledgers.
This gentleman—as was obvious—abruptly stiffened at the attendant’s words but
eventually turned to face the man who wanted to speak to him and proceeded to
gesticulate furiously at the stoker to ward him off and then, as a further
precaution, at the attendant too. The attendant returned to the stoker and said
in a confidential manner: “Get out of this room at once!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Upon receiving this
response, the stoker looked down at Karl as if Karl were his heart to which he
was silently bemoaning his sorrows. Without further thought Karl charged
forward and ran straight across the room, brushing the officer’s chair on his
way past; the attendant also set off running, crouching low with arms spread
wide and ready to scoop, as if he were hunting some sort of vermin, but Karl
was the first to reach the chief purser’s desk, which he held on to tightly in
case the attendant should try to drag him away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Naturally the whole
room came immediately to life. The ship’s officer at the table sprang to his
feet; the men from the harbor authority looked on calmly but attentively; the
two gentlemen by the window had moved side by side; the attendant, feeling out
of place now that his superiors were interested, stepped back. The stoker
waited anxiously by the door for the moment when his help would be needed. The
purser finally swung his armchair forcefully around to the right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl, rummaging in
his secret pocket, which he had no qualms about revealing to these people,
pulled out his passport, which he opened and laid on the desk in lieu of
further introduction. The purser seemed to consider the passport irrelevant,
for he flicked it aside with two fingers, whereupon Karl, as if this formality
had been concluded to his satisfaction, put it back in his pocket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Please allow me to
say,” he then began, “that in my opinion the stoker has been done an injustice.
There is a certain Schubal on board who’s on his case. The stoker has worked on
many ships, all of which he can name and all of which were very satisfactorily
served; he is industrious and serious about his work, and it’s difficult to comprehend
why his performance would not be up to standard on this ship, where the duties
are not nearly so taxing as they are, for example, on a merchant ship.
Therefore it can only be slander that prevents his advancement and robs him of
the reward that would otherwise assuredly be his. I have only outlined this
matter in general terms, he can enumerate his specific grievances for you
himself.” Karl had directed his remarks to all the gentlemen present because
they were all in fact listening, and it seemed much more likely that a just man
could be found among all of them than that this just man should be the purser.
Karl had also been clever enough to conceal the fact that he had known the
stoker only a short time. But he would have spoken more effectively if he had
not been disconcerted by the red face of the man with the bamboo cane as he
first viewed it from his current position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Every single word
is true,” said the stoker before anyone asked him anything or even looked in
his direction. This over zealousness would have been a gross error if the
gentleman with the medals, who, it suddenly dawned on Karl, was obviously the
captain, had not clearly made up his mind already to hear the stoker out. For
he extended a hand and called to the stoker: “Come here!” with a voice firm
enough to be hit with a hammer. Now everything hinged upon the stoker’s
conduct, for Karl did not doubt the justness of his cause.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Fortunately it
became evident at this point that the stoker was an experienced man of the
world. With perfect calm he reached into his little chest and unerringly pulled
out a small bundle of papers and a notebook, and then, as if it were the most
natural thing to do, he completely ignored the purser, walked directly to the
captain, and spread out his evidence on the windowsill. Having no choice, the
purser was forced to make his own way across. “The man is a known whiner,” he
said by way of explanation. “He spends more time in my office than the engine
room. He has driven that poor, calm Schubal to distraction. Now listen for
once!” He turned to the stoker. “This time you’re really taking your
obtrusiveness too far. How many times have you already been thrown out of pay
rooms, and it served you right with your demands, which are without exception
totally and completely unjustified! How many times have you then come running
to the purser’s office! How many times have you been told nicely that Schubal
is your immediate superior, with whom you have to come to terms yourself! And
now you even have the gall to come in here when the captain’s present and you
have no shame about pestering him; you even have the effrontery to go so far as
to bring this boy along, whom you’ve trained as the mouthpiece for your
ridiculous accusations, and yet this is the first time I have ever seen him on
this ship!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl had to
forcibly restrain himself from jumping forward. But the captain had already
intervened, saying: “Let’s listen to what the man has to say. In any case
Schubal is becoming much too independent for my liking, by which, however, I
don’t mean to imply anything in your favor.” These last words were directed to
the stoker; it was only natural that the captain could not immediately take his
side, but everything appeared to be moving in the right direction. The stoker began
his explanations and was in control of himself enough at the start to give
Schubal the title of “Mister.” How Karl rejoiced, standing at the purser’s
abandoned desk, where he took great pleasure in pressing down on a postal scale
again and again.—Mr. Schubal is unfair! Mr. Schubal prefers foreigners! Mr.
Schubal had ordered the stoker out of the engine room and made him clean
toilets, which was certainly not the stoker’s job!—At one point, Mr. Schubal’s
competence was challenged as being more apparent than actual. At that moment
Karl eyed the captain very closely and openly, as if they were colleagues, to
ensure that the captain would not be unfavorably influenced by the stoker’s
somewhat awkward manner of expression. Still, nothing tangible emerged from the
stream of words, and even though the captain’s gaze was still fixed ahead of
him as a sign of his resolve to hear the stoker through to the end this time,
the other gentlemen were growing impatient and soon the stoker’s voice no
longer dominated the room unquestionably, which was disturbing to Karl. First,
the gentleman in civilian clothes started playing with his bamboo cane, tapping
it, albeit softly, against the parquet floor, and the other gentlemen naturally
looked his way from time to time. The harbor officials, who were obviously in a
hurry, took up their documents again and began, if somewhat distractedly, to
look through them; the ship’s officer edged closer to his table, and the chief
purser, believing he had won this round, heaved a deep and ironic sigh. Only
the attendant seemed exempt from the gathering lack of interest; sympathetic to
the sufferings of a poor man surrounded by the great, he nodded earnestly at
Karl as if he wanted to explain something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Meanwhile, outside
the windows, life in the harbor continued: A flat barge with a mountain of
barrels, which must have been ingeniously stowed because none of them rolled
around, tugged past and almost completely darkened the room; small motor-boats,
which Karl could have minutely examined if he had had the time, roared by in
straight lines, each obeying the jerking hands of a man standing upright at the
wheel; here and there peculiar bobbing objects surfaced on their own from the
restless waves and were submerged just as quickly, sinking before Karl’s
astonished eyes; boats from the ocean liners surged past, rowed by furiously
working sailors and full of still, expectant passengers sitting exactly as they
had been squeezed in, although some of them could not resist turning their
heads to look at the shifting scenery. An endless movement, a restlessness
passed from the element of restlessness to the helpless human beings and their
works!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But everything
called for haste, for clarity, for accurate description, and what was the
stoker doing? He was certainly talking up a storm, his trembling hands were
long past being able to hold the papers on the windowsill, complaints about
Schubal came flooding into his mind from all directions, and in his opinion,
each and every one would have sufficed to bury Schubal forever, but all he
could present to the captain was a pitiful tangle of everything jumbled
together. For a long time the gentleman with the bamboo cane had been whistling
up at the ceiling, the harbor officials had already detained the ship’s officer
at their table and showed no signs of releasing him, the chief purser was
visibly held back from an outburst only by the calmness of the captain, and the
attendant was standing at the ready, awaiting at any moment the captain’s
orders concerning the stoker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl could remain
idle no longer. Therefore he approached the group slowly, considering all the
quicker how to tackle the situation as cleverly as possible. It was now or
never, it could not be long before they were both thrown out of the office. The
captain might well be a good man and in addition he might, or so it seemed to
Karl, have some special reason for demonstrating that he was a fair superior at
present, but in the end he was not an instrument that one could play into the
ground—and that was just how the stoker was treating him, although it was only
out of his profound sense of indignation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So Karl said to the
stoker: “You must tell the story more simply, more clearly; the captain can’t
fully appreciate it the way you’re telling it now. Does he know all the
engineers and cabin boys by their last names, let alone by their first names,
so that you just mention such a name and he instantly knows who it is? Sort out
your complaints and tell him the most important first and then the others in
descending order; perhaps then you won’t even have to voice most of them.
You’ve always explained it to me so clearly!” “If one could steal trunks in
America, one could also lie now and again,” he thought to justify himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If only it would
help! Might it not be too late already? The stoker did fall silent upon hearing
the familiar voice, but his eyes were so blinded by tears of wounded pride,
awful memories, and the extreme distress of the moment that he could barely
recognize Karl anymore. How could he now—and Karl privately realized this upon
seeing his silent friend—how could he suddenly change his tack now when he felt
that he had already said all there was to say without receiving the slightest
acknowledgment, and yet on the other hand he had really not said anything at
all and could hardly expect these gentlemen to listen to everything again. And
at this particular point Karl, his sole supporter, steps in wanting to give
good advice but instead shows him that everything, absolutely everything is
lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“If only I’d come
forward sooner instead of staring out the window,” Karl said to himself, bowing
his head before the stoker and slapping his hands on his thighs to signal that
all hope had vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But the stoker
misinterpreted this, probably sensing that Karl was secretly reproaching him,
and with the honest intention of convincing him otherwise, he superseded all
his previous deeds by starting to argue with Karl. Now of all times—when the
gentlemen at the round table had long since grown aggravated by the pointless
barrage that was disrupting their important work, when the chief purser had
gradually found the captain’s patience incomprehensible and was on the verge of
exploding, when the attendant, by now fully reestablished within the sphere of
his superiors, was measuring the stoker with menacing looks, and when the
gentleman with the bamboo cane, to whom even the captain was sending friendly
glances now and then, was completely inured to and even disgusted by the stoker
and pulled out a small notebook and, evidently preoccupied with other matters,
let his eyes wander back and forth between the notebook and Karl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, I know, I
know,” said Karl, who was having difficulty fighting off the stoker’s tirade
yet still managed to keep up a friendly smile throughout the quarreling,
“you’re right, quite right, I’ve never once doubted it.” He would have liked to
restrain the stoker’s flailing hands for fear of being struck, or better yet,
he would have liked to press him into a corner and whisper a few calm, soothing
words that no one else need hear. But the stoker was beyond the pale. Karl
began to take some comfort in the thought that, if necessary, the stoker could
overpower all seven men present with the strength of his despair. However, on
the desk, as a peek in that direction informed him, there lay a panel crammed
with push buttons connected to electrical wires: One hand simply pressing them
down could turn the entire ship rebellious, its passages full of hostile men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Here, the seriously
indifferent gentleman with the bamboo cane stepped up to Karl and asked, not
too loudly but audibly enough to be heard above all the stoker’s racket: “So
what is your name?” At that moment, as if someone behind the door were awaiting
this remark, there came a knock. The attendant looked over to the captain, who
nodded. At this the attendant went to the door and opened it. Outside, in an
old imperial coat, stood a man of medium build who, judging by his appearance,
did not seem suited to engine work but was nevertheless—Schubal. If Karl had
not inferred this from the look in everyone’s eyes, which exuded a certain
satisfaction that even the captain was not immune to, then he would have been
horrified to realize it by looking at the stoker, who clenched his fists at the
end of his stiffened arms as if this concentration of force were the most
important thing to him, something for which he was willing to sacrifice the
very life in his body. All his strength, even the power to keep himself
upright, was concentrated in his fists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And so here was the
enemy, jaunty and fresh in his festive dress, a ledger under one arm—probably
records of the stoker’s work and pay—making it unabashedly clear by scanning
each face in turn that it was his intention to ascertain the mood of each
individual. All seven were already friends of his, for even if the captain had
had reservations about him, or perhaps had only pretended to, he could probably
not find fault with Schubal after all the pain he had just been subjected to by
the stoker. A man like the stoker could not be dealt with severely enough, and
if Schubal were to be reproached for anything at all it was for failing to
succinctly and sufficiently subdue the stoker’s recalcitrance and thus prevent
him from having the audacity to appear before the captain today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Now one might still
assume that the confrontation between the stoker and Schubal could not fail to
have the same effect upon men as it would certainly have before a higher
tribunal; for even if Schubal could disguise himself well, he might not be able
to keep up this ruse to the very end. A single flash of his wicked temperament
would be enough to enlighten these gentlemen, and Karl wanted to make sure of
that. He already had some insight into the acumen, the weaknesses, the moods of
these men individually, and from that standpoint the time he had already spent
here had not been wasted. If only the stoker were in better shape, but he
seemed entirely incapable of fighting. If Schubal were held in front of him, he
would probably have battered that hated skull with his fists. But even the few
steps separating them were most likely more than the stoker could manage. Why
had Karl not foreseen the so easily foreseeable: That Schubal was bound to turn
up in the end, if not of his own accord, then summoned by the captain? Why had
he not discussed a plan of action with the stoker on the way here instead of
simply marching, hopelessly unprepared, through a random door, which in fact is
what they did? Was the stoker still capable of speech, of saying yes and no as
would be necessary during the cross-examination, which, however, would only
happen in the most hopeful scenario? The stoker stood there, his legs spread
apart, his knees slightly bent, his head half raised, and the air flowing
through his open mouth as if he had no lungs within to process it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl on the other
hand felt more vigorous and alert than he had perhaps ever been at home. If
only his parents could see him now: fighting the good fight in a foreign
country before highly respected persons, and although not yet triumphant,
entirely prepared for the ultimate conquest! Would they revise their opinion of
him? Sit him down between them and praise him? Look once, just once, into his
devoted eyes? Uncertain questions, and the most inappropriate moment to ask
them!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I have come here
because I believe the stoker is accusing me of some sort of dishonesty. A girl
from the kitchen told me she’d seen him on his way here. Captain, sir, and the
rest of you gentlemen, I am ready to refute any charge with my own documents
and, if necessary, with statements by impartial and unbiased witnesses who are
waiting outside the door.” So spoke Schubal. This was indeed the clear speech
of a man, and from the change in the listeners’ faces one might have thought
that these were the first human sounds they had heard in a long time. They
failed to notice, of course, that even this eloquent speech had holes in it.
Why was the first word that occurred to him “dishonesty”? Should the
accusations have started here, rather than with his national prejudices? A girl
from the kitchen had seen the stoker on his way to the office and had
understood immediately? Was it not a sense of guilt that sharpened his mind?
And he had automatically brought witnesses along with him and then called them
impartial and unbiased? A fraud, nothing but a fraud! And these gentlemen
tolerated it and even acknowledged it as proper conduct? Why had he apparently
let so much time elapse between the kitchen girl’s message and his arrival
here? Evidently it was for the purpose of allowing the stoker to weary the men
to the point where they would gradually lose their capacity for clear judgment,
which Schubal had most to fear. Had he not, obviously having stood behind the
door for a long time, only knocked after the gentleman asked his casual
question and when he had reason to hope that the matter of the stoker was
disposed of?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was all very
clear and that was how it was unwittingly presented by Schubal, but it had to
be clarified for these gentlemen in a different, more tangible manner. They
needed to be jolted awake. So Karl, quick, at least take advantage of what time
is left to you before the witnesses arrive and take over everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At that moment,
however, the captain waved off Schubal, who—since his affair appeared to be
momentarily postponed—immediately stepped aside and was joined in quiet
conversation by the attendant; the two men kept leering at the stoker and
gesturing emphatically, and it seemed to Karl that Schubal was rehearsing his
next grand speech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Didn’t you wish to
ask the young man something, Mr. Jakob?” the captain said to the gentleman with
the bamboo cane amid general silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Indeed,” he said,
acknowledging this courtesy with a slight bow. And then he asked Karl once
more: “So what is your name?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl, who believed
the main issue would best be served by dispensing with the stubborn inquisitor
quickly, answered tersely and without his usual custom of presenting his
passport, which he would have had to hunt for first: “Karl Rossmann.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well,” said the
man addressed as Mr. Jakob, taking a step backward at first with an almost
incredulous smile. The captain too, the chief purser, the ship’s officer, and
even the attendant were all extremely astonished upon hearing Karl’s name. Only
the men from the harbor authority and Schubal remained indifferent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well,” repeated
Mr. Jakob, approaching Karl somewhat stiffly, “then I am your Uncle Jakob and
you are my dear nephew. I suspected it all along!” he said to the captain
before he embraced and then kissed Karl, who suffered all this in silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“And what is your
name?” Karl asked very politely, yet wholly unmoved after he felt himself
released; he struggled to foresee the consequences this latest development
might have for the stoker. For the moment, there was no indication that Schubal
could derive any benefit from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You don’t seem to
understand your luck,” said the captain, believing that Karl’s question had
wounded Mr. Jakob’s personal dignity, since he had withdrawn to the window,
evidently to conceal his agitated face, which he kept dabbing at with a
handkerchief. “That’s Senator Edward Jakob who has just introduced himself to
you as your uncle. Now a brilliant career awaits you, no doubt completely
contrary to your previous expectations. Try to grasp this as best you can right
now and pull yourself together!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Indeed I do have
an Uncle Jakob in America,” said Karl, turning to the captain, “but if I
understood correctly, Jakob is merely the Senator’s surname.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So it is,” said
the captain expectantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well, my Uncle
Jakob, who is my mother’s brother, has Jakob for his Christian name, but his
surname would naturally be the same as my mother’s, whose maiden name is
Bendelmayer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Gentlemen!”
exclaimed the Senator, reacting to Karl’s statement as he cheerfully returned
from his recuperative break at the window. Everyone present, except for the
harbor officials, burst out laughing, some as if moved to do so, others for no
apparent reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“But what I said
was by no means ridiculous,” thought Karl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Gentlemen,”
repeated the Senator, “you are taking part, contrary to both my intentions and
yours, in a little family scene, and therefore I cannot avoid providing you
with an explanation, since I believe only the captain”—at this mention they
exchanged bows—“is completely informed of the circumstances.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now I must really
pay attention to every word,” Karl told himself, and was delighted to note,
from a sideways glance, that life was beginning to return to the stoker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“During all the
long years of my sojourn in America—although the word ‘sojourn’ is hardly
fitting for an American citizen, which I am heart and soul—well, during all
these long years, I have been living entirely without contact with my European
relatives for reasons that, in the first place, have no business here, and
secondly, would truly be too painful to discuss. I actually dread the moment
when I may be forced to explain them to my dear nephew, and unfortunately it
will be impossible to avoid frank references to his parents and their nearest
and dearest.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“He is my uncle, no
question,” Karl told himself as he listened; “he’s probably changed his name.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“My dear nephew is
now—let us use the proper word—quite simply cut off by his parents, the same as
a cat tossed out the door when it has become annoying. I wish by no means to
gloss over what my nephew did to be so punished, but his fault was such that
its mere mention is absolution enough.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“That sounds fair
enough,” thought Karl, “but I don’t want him to tell everyone the story.
Besides, he can’t possibly know about it. Who could have told him?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“He was, in fact,”
his uncle continued, occasionally rocking forward on his bamboo cane, whereby
he did indeed successfully avoid the unnecessary solemnity the situation was
otherwise bound to assume, “in fact, he was seduced by a maidservant, Johanna
Brummer, a woman of thirty-five. I do not mean to offend my nephew by using the
word ‘seduced,’ but it is difficult to find another word equally suitable.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl, who had moved
much closer to his uncle, turned around at this point to gauge the reactions on
the faces of those present. No one was laughing, they were all listening
patiently and earnestly. After all, one does not laugh at a senator’s nephew at
the first opportunity that presents itself. The most that could be said was
that the stoker was smiling at Karl, albeit faintly, which was encouraging in
the first place as a sign of renewed life and pardonable in the second as Karl,
in the stoker’s cabin, had tried to keep secret this very same affair that was
now being made public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now, this Brummer
woman,” his uncle went on, “had a child by my nephew, a healthy boy who was
christened Jakob, no doubt after my humble self, who I’m sure was casually
mentioned by my nephew but made a great impression on the girl. Fortunately, I
may add. For the parents, in order to avoid paying for child support or being
further involved in personal scandal—I must emphasize that I am not familiar
with either the laws over there or the parents’ situation—therefore, so as to
avoid paying for child support and their son’s scandal, they shipped my dear
nephew off to America miserably unprovided for, as one can see, so that he
would soon, without the miracles that still happen, at least in America, in all
likelihood have met his lonely end in some alley near New York harbor if that
maid hadn’t sent me a letter, which reached me the day before yesterday after a
long odyssey and which provided me with the whole story, a personal description
of my nephew, and also, very sensibly, the name of the ship. If my purpose here
were to entertain you gentlemen, I could read a few passages of this letter”—he
pulled out and flourished two huge, densely written pages from his pocket. “It
would surely affect you, as it was written with a somewhat simple yet well
intentioned cleverness and with much love for the father of the child. But I
wish neither to entertain you anymore than is necessary to enlighten you nor to
potentially wound any feelings my nephew may still harbor; he can, if he so desires
for his own information, read the letter in the privacy of the room that
already awaits him.”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos265927></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Karl however had no
feelings for that girl. In the rush of memories from an ever-dimming past, she
sat in her kitchen, with her elbows propped up on the kitchen cupboard. She
would stare at him whenever he would come into the kitchen for a glass of water
for his father or to pass on some instructions from his mother. Sometimes she
would be writing a letter, awkwardly sitting beside the kitchen cupboard and drawing
her inspiration from Karl’s face. Sometimes she would hide her eyes behind her
hands, and then no words could get through to her. Sometimes she would kneel in
her narrow little room next to the kitchen, praying before a wooden cross; Karl
would then shyly watch her from the passage through the narrow crack of the
door. Sometimes she raced around the kitchen and jumped back, laughing like a
witch, if Karl got in her way. Sometimes she would shut the kitchen door after
Karl came in and hold on to the latch until he demanded to leave. Sometimes she
brought him things he did not at all desire and pressed them silently into his
hands. But one time she said, “Karl,” and led him, still shocked at the
unexpected familiarity, into her little room, which she then locked with much
grimacing and sighing. She almost choked him as she clung to his neck, and
while asking him to undress her, she actually undressed him and put him into
her bed as if she wanted no one else to have him from now on and wished to
caress him and coddle him until the end of the world. “Karl, oh, my Karl!” she
cried, as if by gazing at him she were confirming her possession, while Karl
saw absolutely nothing and felt uncomfortable in the warm bedding that she
seemed to have piled up specially for his benefit. Then she lay down next to
him and wanted to extract some secrets from him, but he could tell her none and
she was annoyed, either in jest or in earnest; she shook him, she listened to
his heart beating, she offered her own breast for him to do the same, but she
could not induce Karl to do so; she pressed her naked belly against his body,
fondled him between the legs so repulsively that Karl thrust his head and neck
from the pillows, then ground her belly against him a few times—it felt as if she
were part of him, and perhaps this was the reason he was seized by a dreadful
helplessness. He was weeping when he finally reached his own bed, after she
entreated him repeatedly to visit her again. That was all it was and yet his
uncle had succeeded in making a grand story out of it. And that cook<a
href="#filepos452559"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>15</span></span></a> had evidently
been thinking of him and notified his uncle of his arrival. That was very kind
of her and he hoped to one day repay her<a href="#filepos452806"><span
class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“And now,” cried
the Senator, “I would like to hear loud and clear whether I am your uncle or
not.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You are my uncle,”
said Karl, kissing his hand and receiving a kiss on the forehead in return.
“I’m very glad to have met you, but you are mistaken if you believe that my
parents speak only ill of you. But aside from that, your speech contained
several errors, that is to say, I mean, everything didn’t really happen like
that. But you can’t judge things so well from here, and besides, I don’t think
it will cause any great harm if these gentlemen are slightly misinformed about
the details of a matter that could hardly interest them very much.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well said,”
remarked the Senator, guiding Karl over to the visibly sympathetic captain and
asking: “Don’t I have a splendid nephew?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I am happy,” said
the captain, with a bow that only a militarily trained person can execute, “to
have made your nephew’s acquaintance, Mr. Senator. It is a particular honor for
my ship to have provided the setting for such a meeting. But the voyage in
steerage must have been less than pleasant, it’s difficult to know who’s
traveling down there. Of course we do everything possible to make the
passengers in steerage as comfortable as possible, much more, for example, than
the American lines, but we have not succeeded yet in making this excursion a
pleasure.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“It did me no
harm,” said Karl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“It did him no
harm!” the Senator repeated, laughing loudly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Only I’m afraid
I’ve lost my trunk—” and with this he was reminded of everything that had
happened and all that still remained to be done; he looked around him and saw
all those present, still in their former positions, ogling him and struck dumb
with awe and amazement. Only the harbor official, as much as their harsh
complacent faces could be read, betrayed regret at having come at such an
inopportune time, and the pocket watch they had now laid before them was
probably more important to them than anything that was happening or might still
happen in the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The first person to
express his sympathy, after the captain, was oddly enough the stoker. “I
heartily congratulate you,” he said, and shook Karl’s hand, trying to impart
something like appreciation with this gesture. When he attempted to turn and
address the same words to the Senator, the Senator pulled back as if the stoker
were overstepping his bounds, and the stoker left off immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But the others now
understood what was expected of them and formed a huddle around Karl and the
Senator at once. And so it happened that Karl received congratulations from
Schubal, which he accepted and thanked him for. The last to step in, once order
was somewhat restored, were the harbor officials, who said a couple of words in
English that made an absurd impression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Senator was now
well disposed to make the most of this pleasurable occasion by recalling, for
his own benefit and that of the others, some of the more incidental details,
which were naturally not only tolerated but greeted with interest. Thus he
pointed out that he had recorded in his notebook, should he need them on short
notice, Karl’s most distinguishing features as listed in the cook’s letter. And
then, during the stoker’s unbearable rambling, he had taken out the notebook
for no other purpose than to distract himself and tried, for the sake of
amusement, to compare Karl’s appearance with the cook’s observations, which
were naturally not up to the standards of a detective. “And that is how one
finds one’s nephew!” he concluded, in a tone that seemed to invite further
congratulations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“What will happen
to the stoker now?” asked Karl, ignoring his uncle’s latest anecdote. He
believed his new position gave him the freedom to express whatever crossed his
mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“The stoker will
get what he deserves,” said the Senator, “and what the captain deems
appropriate. I believe we have had enough and more than enough of the stoker,
and I’m sure that every gentleman present here will agree.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“But that’s not the
point in a matter of justice,” said Karl. He stood between his uncle and the
captain and believed, perhaps because of this position, that he could influence
a decision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And yet the stoker
seemed to have abandoned all hope. His hands were shoved halfway into his
trouser belt, which had been exposed along with a strip of checked shirt due to
his agitated movements. This did not trouble him in the least: He had vented
all his woes and now they might as well see the few rags that covered his body,
after which they could carry him away. He imagined that Schubal and the
attendant, being the two lowest in rank of those present, should perform this
final kindness. Schubal would have his peace then and no longer be driven to
distraction, as the chief purser had put it. The captain would be free to hire
no one but Romanians, Romanian would be spoken everywhere, and maybe everything
really would run smoother that way. No stoker would be yammering away in the
purser’s office; only his last yammering would be fondly remembered since, as
the Senator had explicitly stated, it led indirectly to the recognition of his
nephew. This nephew, by the way, had previously attempted to help him a number
of times and had been more than fully repaid by the stoker’s aid in the
recognition; it did not even occur to the stoker to ask anything further of him
now. Besides, even if he were the Senator’s nephew, he was still a long way
from being a captain and it was from the captain’s lips that the foul verdict
must fall.—And in accordance with this view, the stoker did his best to avoid
looking at Karl but, unfortunately, in this room full of enemies there was no
other place to rest his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Do not
misunderstand the situation,” the Senator said to Karl; “it may be a matter of
justice, but at the same time it is a matter of discipline as well. Both
matters, especially the latter, are for the captain to decide in this case.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So it is,”
murmured the stoker. Those who heard and understood this smiled uneasily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“In any event, we
have kept the captain from his official duties far too long, and these
undoubtedly accumulate immeasurably upon arriving in New York, so now it is
high time we left the ship rather than make matters worse by turning this petty
squabble between two engineers into a bigger incident through our completely
unnecessary intervention. And I do understand your conduct perfectly, my dear
nephew, but that is precisely what gives me the right to take you away from
here posthaste.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“I will have a boat
lowered for you immediately,” said the captain, without, to Karl’s utter
amazement, raising the least objection to the uncle’s words, although these
could unquestionably be considered self-abasement on his uncle’s part. The
chief purser raced to his desk and telephoned the captain’s order to the
boatswain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Time’s running
out,” Karl said to himself, “but I can do nothing without offending everyone. I
can’t desert my uncle after he’s just found me again. The captain is certainly
polite, but that’s where it ends. When it comes to discipline, his courtesy
stops, and I’m sure my uncle spoke from the captain’s soul. I don’t want to
speak to Schubal and I regret I ever shook his hand. And all the other people
here aren’t worth a hill of beans.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And with these
thoughts in his mind, Karl walked slowly over and drew the stoker’s right hand
out of his belt, gently cupping it in his own. “Why don’t you say anything?” he
asked. “Why do you take everything lying down?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The stoker merely
furrowed his brow, as if searching for the right words to express what he had
to say. Meanwhile he gazed down at Karl’s hand and his own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You’ve been
wronged like no one else on this ship, that I know.” And Karl ran his fingers
to and fro between the fingers of the stoker, who peered around with gleaming
eyes as if he were experiencing a joy that no one ought to begrudge him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“But you must
defend yourself, say yes and no; otherwise people will have no idea of the
truth. You must promise me that you will do as I say, for I have every reason
to fear that I will no longer be able to help you.” And now Karl wept as he
kissed the stoker’s hand, and then took that cracked and almost lifeless hand
and pressed it to his cheeks like a treasure that must be forsaken. —But his
uncle the Senator was already at his side, leading him away, if only with the gentlest
of pressures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“The stoker seems
to have cast a spell over you,” he said, glancing knowingly at the captain over
Karl’s head. “You felt lost, then you found the stoker, and now you feel
grateful, that’s all very commendable. But don’t go too far, if only for my
sake, and please try to understand your position.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Noises erupted
outside the door and shouts were heard, it even sounded as if someone were
being brutally shoved against the door. A sailor entered in a rather disheveled
state and had a girl’s apron tied around his waist. “There’s a crowd of people
out there,” he yelled, swinging his elbows as if he were still in the crowd. He
finally collected himself and was about to salute the captain when he noticed
the apron, ripped it off, threw it to the floor, and shouted: “This is
disgusting, they’ve tied a girl’s apron on me.” Then he clicked his heels
together and saluted. Someone almost laughed, but the captain said severely:
“That’s what I call a good mood. Just who is it outside?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“They’re my witnesses,”
said Schubal, stepping forward. “I humbly beg your pardon for their improper
behavior. When the crew has the voyage behind them, they sometimes go a little
crazy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Call them in
immediately!” commanded the captain, and turning directly to the Senator,
politely but rapidly said: “Please be so good as to take your nephew and follow
this sailor, who will bring you to the boat, Mr. Senator, sir. I hardly need
say what an honor and a pleasure it has been, Mr. Senator, to have met you in
person. I only hope to have the opportunity soon to continue our interrupted
conversation about the state of the American fleet, sir, and that it may be
interrupted in as agreeable a manner as today.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“This one nephew is
enough for now,” said Karl’s uncle, laughing. “And now please accept my deep
gratitude for your kindness, and I bid you farewell. It is by no means
impossible, after all, that we”—he hugged Karl closely to himself—“might be
able to spend a longer time with you on our next journey to Europe.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“That would please
me greatly,” said the captain. The two gentlemen shook hands, Karl could only
mutely grasp the captain’s hand, for the captain was already preoccupied with
the fifteen or so people led by Schubal, who were pouring into the room
slightly cowed but still very noisy. The sailor asked the Senator if he could
be permitted to lead the way, and then he cleared a path through the crowd for
the Senator and Karl, who passed easily through the bowing people. It was
apparent that these people, a good-natured bunch in general, regarded Schubal’s
quarrel with the stoker as a joke that was still amusing even in the presence
of the captain. Among them, Karl noticed Line the kitchen maid, who, winking
gaily at him, put on and tied the apron the sailor had thrown down, for it
belonged to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Still following the
sailor, they left the office and turned into a short pasageway, which, after a
few steps, brought them to a smaller door from which a short ladder led down to
the boat that had been made ready for them. The sailors in the boat, into which
their guide had leapt in a single bound, stood up and saluted. The Senator was
just admonishing Karl to exercise caution in climbing down when Karl, still on
the topmost rung, burst into violent sobs. The Senator put his right hand under
Karl’s chin and held him tight, stroking him with his left hand. Clinging
together in this way, they slowly descended step-by-step and landed in the
boat, where the Senator selected a comfortable seat for Karl just opposite
himself. At a sign from the Senator the sailors pushed off from the ship and
were immediately rowing at full steam. They were hardly a few yards from the
ship when Karl made the unexpected discovery that they were on the same side of
the ship as the windows of the office. All three windows were filled by
Schubal’s witnesses, who greeted them with friendly waves; even Karl’s uncle
acknowledged them with a wave, and a sailor accomplished the feat of blowing
them a kiss without ever breaking his even stroke. It was truly as if the stoker
no longer existed. Karl more closely examined his uncle, whose knees were
almost touching his, and he began to doubt whether, for him, this man could
ever replace the stoker. And his uncle, avoiding his gaze, stared out at the
waves jostling their boat.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>“IT’S AN EXCEPTIONAL APPARATUS,” the officer said
to the world traveler and, with a certain admiration, surveyed the apparatus
that was, after all, quite familiar to him. The traveler appeared to have
accepted purely out of politeness the commandant’s invitation to attend the
execution of a soldier, who had been condemned for insubordination and
insulting a superior officer. There did not seem to be much interest in the
execution throughout the penal colony itself. In any event, the only other
persons present besides the officer and the traveler in this small but deep and
sandy valley, surrounded by barren slopes on all sides, were the condemned
man—a dull, thick-lipped creature with a disheveled appearance—and a soldier,
who held the heavy chain that controlled the smaller chains attached to the
condemned man’s ankles, wrists, and neck, chains that were also linked
together. But the condemned man looked so submissively doglike that it seemed
as if he might have been allowed to run free on the slopes and would only need
to be whistled for when the execution was due to begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler was
not particularly enthralled by the apparatus and he paced back and forth behind
the condemned man with almost visible indifference while the officer made the
final preparations, one moment crawling beneath the apparatus that was deeply
embedded in the ground, another climbing a ladder to inspect its uppermost
parts. These were tasks that could really have been left to a mechanic, but the
officer performed them with energetic eagerness, perhaps because he was a
devoted admirer of the apparatus or because, for whatever other reasons, the
work could be entrusted to no one else. “Now everything’s ready!” he called out
at last, and climbed down from the ladder. He had worked up a sweat and was
breathing with his mouth wide open; he had also tucked two very fine ladies’
handkerchiefs under the collar of his uniform. “Surely these uniforms are too
heavy for the tropics,” said the traveler instead of inquiring, as the officer
expected, about the apparatus. “Of course,” the officer said, washing the oil
and grease from his hands in a nearby bucket of water, “but they represent home
for us; we don’t want to forget about our homeland—but now just take a look at
this machine,” he immediately added, drying his hands on a towel and
simultaneously indicating the apparatus. “Up to this point I have to do some of
the operations by hand, but from now on the apparatus works entirely by
itself.” The traveler nodded and followed the officer. Then the officer,
seeking to prepare himself for all eventualities, said: “Naturally there are
sometimes problems; I hope of course there won’t be any problems today, but one
must allow for the possibility. The apparatus should work continually for
twelve hours, but even if anything does go wrong, it will be something minor
and easy to repair at once.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Won’t you sit
down?” he inquired at last, pulling out a cane chair from a whole heap of them
and offering it to the traveler, who was unable to refuse. The traveler was now
sitting at the edge of a pit, and he glanced cursorily in its direction. It was
not very deep. On one side of the pit, the excavated earth had been piled up to
form an embankment, on the other side of the pit stood the apparatus. “I don’t
know,” said the officer, “whether the commandant has already explained the
apparatus to you.” The traveler made a vague gesture with his hand, and the
officer could not have asked for anything better, for now he was free to
explain the apparatus himself. “This apparatus,” he said, grabbing hold of the
crankshaft and leaning against it, “was the invention of our former commandant.
I myself was involved in the very first experiments and also shared in the work
all the way to its completion, but the credit for the invention belongs to him
alone. Have you ever heard of our former commandant? No? Well, it wouldn’t be
too much to say that the organization of the whole penal colony is his work. We
who were his friends knew long before his death that the organization of the
colony was so perfectly self-contained that his successor, even if he had a
thousand new schemes brewing in his head, would find it impossible to alter a
thing from the old system, at least for many years to come. Our prediction has
indeed come true, and the new commandant has had to acknowledge as much. It’s
too bad you never met the old commandant!—but,” the officer interrupted
himself, “I’m rambling, and here is his apparatus standing right in front of
us. It consists, as you can see, of three parts. In the course of time each
part has acquired its own nickname. The lower part is called the bed, the upper
one is the designer, and this one in the middle here that hovers between them
is called the harrow.” “The harrow?” asked the traveler. He had not been
listening very intently; the sun beat down brutally into the shadeless valley
and it was difficult to collect one’s thoughts. He had to admire the officer
all the more: He wore his snugly fitting dress uniform, hung with braiding
weighted with epaulettes; he expounded on his subject with zeal and tightened a
few screws here and there with a screwdriver while he spoke. As for the
soldier, he seemed to be in much the same condition as the traveler: He had
wound the condemned man’s chain around both his wrists and propped himself up
with one hand on his rifle; his head hung down and he took no notice of
anything. The traveler was not surprised by this, as the officer was speaking
in French and certainly neither the soldier nor the condemned man understood
French. It was therefore that much more remarkable that the condemned man
nevertheless strove to follow the officer’s explanations. With a drowsy sort of
persistence he directed his gaze wherever the officer pointed, and when the
traveler broke in with his question, he, like the officer, looked at the
traveler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, the harrow,”
answered the officer, “a perfect name for it. The needles are arranged
similarly to the teeth of a harrow and the whole thing works something like a
harrow, although it is stationary and performs with much more artistry. You’ll
soon understand it anyway. The condemned man is laid here on the bed—you see,
first I want to explain the apparatus and then start it up, that way you’ll be
able to follow it better; besides, one of the gears in the designer is badly
worn, it makes a horrible screeching noise when it’s turning and you can hardly
hear yourself speak; unfortunately spare parts are difficult to come by around
here—well, so here is the bed, as I said before. It’s completely covered with a
layer of cotton wool, you’ll find out what that’s for later. The condemned man
is laid facedown on the cotton wool, naked of course; here are straps for the
hands, the feet, and here for the neck, in order to hold him down. So, as I was
saying, here at the head of the bed, where the condemned man is at first laid
facedown, is the little felt gag that can be adjusted easily to fit straight
into the man’s mouth. It’s meant to keep him from screaming or biting his
tongue. The man has to take the felt in his mouth since otherwise the neck
strap would break his neck.” “That’s cotton wool?” asked the traveler, leaning
forward. “It certainly is,” the officer said with a smile, “feel for yourself.”
He grabbed hold of the traveler’s hand and guided it over the bed’s surface.
“It’s specially prepared cotton wool, which is why you don’t recognize it; I’ll
come to its purpose in a minute.” The traveler was starting to feel the
stirrings of interest in the apparatus; he gazed up at it with one arm raised
to shield his eyes from the sun. It was a large structure. The bed and the
designer were the same size and looked like two dark steamer trunks. The
designer hung about two meters above the bed; they were joined at the corners
by four brass rods that practically gleamed in the sunlight. The harrow was
suspended on a steel band between the two trunks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The officer had
barely noticed the traveler’s previous indifference but definitely sensed his
burgeoning interest, so he paused in his explanations in order to give the
traveler time for undisturbed observation. The condemned man imitated the
traveler, but since he could not shield his eyes with a hand, he blinked up
into the sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“So, the man lies
down,” said the traveler, leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes,” said the
officer, pushing his cap back a little and mop-ping his sweaty face with his
hand, “now listen! Both the bed and the designer have their own electric
battery; the bed needs one for itself and the designer needs one for the
harrow. As soon as the man is strapped in, the bed is set in motion. It quivers
with tiny, rapid vibrations, both from side to side and up and down. You will
have seen similar contraptions in sanitariums, but for our bed, all the
movements are calibrated precisely, for they must correspond to movements of
the harrow. But it is the harrow that actually carries out the sentence.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“And just what is
the sentence?” inquired the traveler. “You don’t know that either?” the officer
said in astonishment, and bit his lip. “Excuse me if my explanations seem a bit
incoherent, I beg your pardon. The commandant always used to take care of the
explanations, but the new commandant seems to scorn this duty; but that such a
distinguished visitor”—the traveler attempted to wave this distinction away
with both hands, but the officer insisted on the expression—“that such a
distinguished visitor should not even be made aware of the form our sentencing
takes is a new development, which”—an oath was about to pass his lips but he
checked himself and said only: “I was not informed of this, it’s not my fault.
In any case, I’m certainly the man best equipped to explain our sentencing,
since I have here”—he patted his breast pocket—“the relevant drawings made by
our former commandant.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Drawings by the
commandant himself?” the traveler asked. “Was he everything himself? Was he
soldier, judge, engineer, chemist, draftsman?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes sir, he was,”
the officer answered, nodding his head with a remote, contemplative look. Then
he examined his hands closely; they did not seem to be clean enough for him to
handle the drawings, so he went over to the bucket and washed them again. Then
he drew out a small leather folder and said: “The sentence does not sound
severe. Whatever commandment the condemned man has transgressed is engraved on
his body by the harrow. This man, for example”—the officer indicated the
man—“will have inscribed on his body: ‘Honor thy superiors!’ ”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler
briefly looked at the man, who stood, as the officer pointed him out, with
bowed head, apparently straining with all his might to catch something of what
was said. But the movement of his thick, closed lips clearly showed that he
understood nothing. There were a number of questions the traveler wanted to
ask, but at the sight of the man he asked only: “Does he know his sentence?”
“No,” said the officer, eager to continue his explanations, but the traveler
interrupted him: “He doesn’t know his own sentence?” “No,” repeated the
officer, and paused for a moment as if he were waiting for the traveler to
elaborate on the reason for his question, then said: “It would be pointless to
tell him. He’ll come to know it on his body.” The traveler would not have
spoken further, but he felt the condemned man’s gaze trained on him; it seemed
to be asking if the traveler approved of all this. So after having already
leaned back in his chair, he bent forward again and asked another question:
“But does he at least know that he’s been sentenced?” “No, not that either,”
the officer replied, smiling at the traveler as if expecting him to make more
strange statements. “Well,” said the traveler, “then you mean to tell me that
the man is also unaware of the results of his defense?” “He has had no
opportunity to defend himself,” said the officer, looking away as if talking to
himself and trying to spare the traveler the embarrassment of having such
self-evident matters explained to him. “But he must have had some opportunity
to defend himself,” the traveler said, and got up from his seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The officer
realized that his explanations of the apparatus were in danger of being held up
for quite some time, so he approached the traveler, put his arm through his,
and gestured toward the condemned man, who was standing up straight now that he
was so obviously the center of attention—the soldier had also given the chain a
jerk—and said: “Here’s the situation. I have been appointed judge in this penal
colony—despite my youth—as I was the previous commandant’s assistant in all
penal matters and also know the apparatus better than anyone else. The guiding
principle for my decisions is this: Guilt is unquestionable. Other courts
cannot follow that principle because they have more than one member and even
have courts that are higher than themselves. That is not the case here, or at
least it was not so during the time of the former commandant. Although the new
one has shown signs of interfering with my judgments, I have succeeded in
fending him off so far and shall continue to do so—you wanted to have this case
explained; it’s quite simple, as they all are. A captain reported to me this
morning and charged this man—who is assigned to him as an orderly and sleeps in
front of his door—with sleeping on duty. You see, it is his duty to get up
every time the hour strikes and salute the captain’s door. This is certainly
not a tremendously difficult task but a necessary one, as he must be alert both
to guard and wait on his master. Last night the captain wanted to find out
whether the orderly was performing his duty. When the clock struck two, he
opened the door and found the man curled up asleep. He took his horsewhip and
lashed him across the face. Now instead of rising and begging for pardon, the man
grabbed his master by the legs, shook him, and cried: ‘Throw away that whip or
I’ll swallow you whole’—those are the facts. The captain came to me an hour
ago, I wrote down his statement and immediately followed it up with the
sentence. Then I had the man put in chains. That was quite simple. If I had
called for this man first and interrogated him, it would only have resulted in
confusion. He would have lied, and had I been successful in exposing those
lies, he would just have replaced them with new ones, and so on. But as it
stands now, I have him and I won’t let him go—is everything clear now? But
time’s marching on, the execution ought to be starting and I haven’t finished
explaining the apparatus yet.” He pressed the traveler back into his seat, returned
to the apparatus, and began: “As you can see, the shape of the harrow
corresponds to the human form; here is the harrow for the upper body, here are
the harrows for the legs. For the head there is just this one small spike. Is
that clear?” He bent forward toward the traveler amiably, eager to furnish the
most comprehensive explanations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With a furrowed
brow the traveler examined the harrow. He was not satisfied with the
explanation of the judicial process. Still, he had to remind himself, this was
a penal colony, special measures were needed here, military procedures must be
adhered to up to the very end. He also placed some hope in the new commandant,
who intended to introduce, albeit slowly, new procedures that the officer’s
narrow mind could not conceive of. These thoughts led him to his next question:
“Will the commandant attend the execution?” “It’s not certain,” the officer
said, wincing at the direct question, and his friendly expression clouded over.
“That is why we must hurry. As much as it pains me, I’ll have to cut my
explanations short. But of course tomorrow, after the apparatus has been
cleaned—its only drawback is that it gets so messy—I can go into more detail.
So for now, just the essentials: When the man is laid down on the bed and it has
started vibrating, the harrow is lowered onto his body. It automatically
adjusts itself so that the needles just graze the skin; once the adjustment is
completed, the steel band promptly stiffens to form a rigid bar. And now the
performance begins. An uninformed observer would not be able to differentiate
between one punishment and another. The harrow appears to do its work in a
uniform manner. As it quivers, its points pierce the body, which is itself
quivering from the vibrations of the bed. So that the progress of the
sentencing can be seen, the harrow is made of glass. Securing the needles in
the glass presented some technical difficulties, but after many attempts we
were successful. We spared no effort, you understand. And now anyone can
observe the sentence being inscribed on the body. Don’t you want to come closer
and examine the needles?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler rose
to his feet slowly, walked across, and bent over the harrow. “You see,” said
the officer, “there are two types of needles arranged in various patterns. Each
long needle has a short one adjacent to it. The long needle does the writing,
and the short one flushes away the blood with water so that the writing is
always clearly legible. The bloody water is then conducted through grooves and
finally flows into this main pipe, which empties into the pit.” With his finger
the officer outlined the exact route the bloody water had to take. When, in
order to make the image as vivid as possible, he cupped his hands under the
mouth of the pipe as if to catch the outflow, the traveler drew his head back
and, groping behind him with one hand, tried to return to his chair. To his
horror he then saw that the condemned man had also accepted the officer’s
invitation to examine the harrow more closely. He had tugged the sleepy soldier
forward a little and was leaning over the glass. One could see that he was
searching, with a puzzled expression, for what the gentlemen had been
examining, but since he had not heard the explanation he was not successful. He
bent this way and that; he repeatedly ran his eyes over the glass. The traveler
wanted to drive him back because what he was doing was probably a criminal
offense, but the officer restrained the traveler with a firm hand and with the
other hand picked up a clump of dirt from the embankment and hurled it at the
soldier. The soldier jerked awake and saw what the condemned man had dared to
do; he dropped his rifle, dug in his heels, yanked the condemned man back so
forcefully that he immediately fell, and then stood over him, watching him
writhe around and rattle his chains. “Get him on his feet!” shouted the
officer, for he noticed that the traveler was dangerously distracted by the
condemned man. The traveler even leaned across the harrow, taking no notice of
it, only concerned with what was happening to the condemned man. “Be careful
with him!” the officer yelled again. He circled the apparatus and grasped the
condemned man under the armpits himself; with the help of the soldier he hauled
him to his feet, which kept slipping and sliding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now I know all
there is to know about it,” the traveler said as the officer returned to his
side. “All but the most important thing,” he replied, seizing the traveler by
the arm and pointing upward. “Up there in the designer is the machinery that
controls the movements of the harrow, and this mechanism is then programmed to
correspond with the drawing of the prescribed sentence. I am still using the
former commandant’s drawings. Here they are”—he pulled some sheets out of the
leather folder—“unfortunately I can’t let you touch them, they’re my most
prized and valuable possession. Just sit, and I’ll show them to you from here,
then you’ll be able to see everything perfectly.” He held up the first drawing.
The traveler would gladly have said something complimentary, but all he saw was
a labyrinth of crisscross ing lines that covered the paper so thickly that it
was difficult to discern the blank spaces between them. The officer said: “Read
it.” “I can’t,” said the traveler. “Well, it’s clear enough,” remarked the
officer. “It’s very artistic,” the traveler offered evasively, “but I can’t
make it out.” “Sure,” agreed the officer, with a laugh, and put away the
folder, “it’s not calligraphy for schoolchildren. It must be carefully studied.
I’m sure you’d eventually understand it too. Of course the script can’t be too
simple: It’s not meant to kill on first contact, but only after twelve hours,
on average; but the turning point is calculated to come at the sixth hour. So
the lettering itself must be surrounded by lots and lots of flourishes; the
actual wording runs around the body only in a narrow strip, and the rest of the
body is reserved for the ornamentation. Now do you appreciate the work of the
harrow and the whole apparatus? —Just watch!” and he leaped up the ladder,
rotated a wheel, and called out: “Look out, step to the side!” then everything
started up. If it had not been for the screeching gear it would have been
fantastic. As if he were surprised by the noisy gear, he shook his fist at it,
then shrugged apologetically to the traveler and clambered down the ladder to
check the working of the apparatus from below. Something that only he could
detect was still not in order; he climbed up again and reached inside the
designer with both hands, then, instead of using the ladder, slid down one of
the rails to get down quicker and started hollering into the traveler’s ear at
the top of his lungs in order to be heard above the din: “Are you following the
process? First, the harrow begins to write; as soon as it has finished the
initial draft of the inscription on the man’s back, the layer of cotton wool is
set rolling and slowly turns the body onto its side, giving the harrow fresh
room to write. Meanwhile, the raw flesh that has already been inscribed rests
against the cotton wool, which is specially prepared to staunch the bleeding
immediately and ready everything for a further deepening of the script. Then,
as the body continues to turn, these teeth here at the edge of the harrow tear
the cotton wool away from the wounds and toss it into the pit; now there is
fresh work for the harrow. So it keeps on writing more and more deeply for all
twelve hours. For the first six hours the condemned man is alive almost as
before, he only suffers pain. The felt gag is removed after two hours, as he no
longer has the strength to scream. This electrically heated bowl at the head of
the bed is filled with warm rice gruel, and the man is welcome, should he so
desire, to take as much as his tongue can reach. No one ever passes up the
opportunity; I don’t know of one, and my experience is vast. The man loses his
pleasure in eating only around the sixth hour. At this point I usually kneel
down to observe the phenomenon. The man rarely swallows the last mouthful but
merely rolls it around in his mouth and spits it into the pit. I have to duck
just then, otherwise he would spit it in my face. But how still the man becomes
in the sixth hour! Enlightenment comes to even the dimmest. It begins around
the eyes, and it spreads outward from there—a sight that might tempt one to lie
down under the harrow oneself. Nothing more happens, just that the man starts
to interpret the writing, he screws up his mouth as if he were listening.
You’ve seen yourself how difficult the writing is to decipher with your eyes,
but our man deciphers it with his wounds. Of course it is hard work and it
takes him six hours to accomplish it, but then the harrow pierces him clean
through and throws him into the pit, where he’s flung down onto the cotton wool
and bloody water. This concludes the sentence and we, the soldier and I, bury
him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler had
his ear cocked toward the officer and, with his hands in his pockets, was
watching the machine at work. The condemned man watched as well but with no
understanding. He was bent slightly forward, watching the moving needles
intently when the soldier, at a sign from the officer, sliced through his shirt
and trousers from behind with a knife so that they slipped off him; he tried to
grab at the falling clothes to cover his nakedness, but the soldier lifted him
up in the air and shook off the last of his rags. The officer turned off the
machine, and in the ensuing silence the condemned man was placed under the
harrow. The chains were removed and the straps fastened in their stead; for a
moment this almost seemed a relief to the condemned man. The harrow now lowered
itself a bit farther—as this was a thin man. When the needle points reached his
skin, a shudder ran through him; while the soldier was busy with the condemned
man’s right hand, he stretched the left one out in a random direction; it was,
however, in the direction of the traveler. The officer kept glancing at the
traveler out of the corner of his eye as if to ascertain from his face how the execution,
which had been at least nominally explained to him by now, impressed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The wrist strap
snapped; the soldier had probably pulled it too tight. The officer’s help was
required; the soldier showed him the frayed piece of strap. So the officer went
over to him and said, still facing the traveler: “The machine is very complex
so something or other is bound to break down or tear, but one mustn’t allow
this to cloud one’s overall judgment. Anyway, a substitute for the strap is
easy to find: I will use a chain—of course the delicacy of the vibrations for
the right arm will be adversely affected.” And while he was arranging the
chain, he remarked further: “The resources for maintaining the machine are
quite limited these days. Under the old commandant I had unlimited access to a
fund set aside for just this purpose. There was a store here that stocked all
sorts of spare parts. I must confess I wasn’t exactly frugal—I mean before, not
now as the new commandant claims, but he uses everything as an excuse to attack
the old ways. Now he’s wrested control of the machine fund; if I request a new
strap, the old one is required as evidence and the new one takes ten days to
arrive and is of inferior quality, not much use at all. But in the meantime,
how I’m supposed to operate the machine without a strap—no one worries about
that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler
reflected that it is always dicey to meddle decisively in the affairs of other
people. He was neither a citizen of the penal colony nor a citizen of the state
to which it belonged. If he were to condemn, to say nothing of prevent, the
execution, they could say to him: “You are a foreigner, keep quiet.” He could
make no answer to that, he could only add that he himself didn’t understand his
actions, for he traveled solely as an observer and certainly had no intention
of revamping other people’s judicial systems. But in the present circumstances
it was very tempting: The injustice of the process and the inhumanity of the
execution were unquestionable. No one could assume any selfish interest on the
traveler’s part, as the condemned man was a complete stranger, not even a
fellow countryman, and he certainly inspired no sympathy. The traveler himself
had been recommended by men in high office and received here with great
courtesy, and the very fact that he had been invited to attend this execution
seemed to suggest that his views on the judicial process were being solicited.
And this was all the more probable since the commandant, as had just been made
plain, was no fan of this procedure and was nearly hostile in his attitude
toward the officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Just then the
traveler heard the officer howl in rage. He had just succeeded, and not without
difficulty, in shoving the felt gag into the mouth of the condemned man who, in
an uncontrollable fit of nausea, squeezed his eyes shut and vomited. The
officer rushed to pull him away from the gag and turn his head toward the pit,
but it was too late, the vomit was running down the machine. “It’s all that
commandant’s fault!” he shouted, thoughtlessly shaking at the brass rods
closest to him. “The machine is as filthy as a sty.” With trembling hands, he
showed the traveler what had happened. “Haven’t I spent hours trying to explain
to the commandant that no food should be given for a whole day preceding the
execution? But there are other opinions in this new, permissive regime. The
commandant’s ladies stuff the man’s gullet full of sweets before he’s led away.
He’s lived on stinking fish his whole life and now he must dine on sweets! But
that would be all right, I wouldn’t object to it, but why can’t they get me a
new felt gag like I’ve been asking for the last three months? How could a man
not be sickened when the felt in his mouth has been gnawed and drooled on by
more than a hundred men as they lay dying?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The condemned man
had laid his head down and looked quite peaceful; the soldier was busy cleaning
the machine with the condemmed man’s shirt. The officer approached the
traveler, who stepped back a pace in some vague dread, but the officer grasped
his hand and drew him aside. “I would like to speak to you confidentially,” he
said, “if I may.” “Of course,” said the traveler, and listened with his eyes
cast down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“This procedure and
execution, which you now have the opportunity to admire, no longer have any
open supporters in our colony. I am their sole advocate and, at the same time,
the sole advocate of our former commandant’s legacy. No longer can I ponder
possible developments for the system, I spend all my energy preserving what’s
left. When the old commandant was alive, the colony was full of his supporters;
I do possess some of his strength of conviction, but I have none of his power,
and consequently his supporters have drifted away; there are many of them left
but none will admit to it. If you went into the teahouse today, an execution
day, and listened to what was being said, you’d probably hear only very
ambiguous remarks. These would all be made by supporters, but considering the
present commandant and his current beliefs, they’re completely useless to me.
And now I ask you: Is a life’s work such as this”—he indicated the machine—“to
be destroyed because of the commandant and the influence his women have over
him? Should this be allowed to happen? Even by a stranger who has only come to
our island for a few days? But there’s no time to lose, plans are being made to
undermine my jurisdiction. Meetings that I am excluded from are already being
held in the commandant’s headquarters. Even your presence here today seems
significant: They are cowards and sent you ahead, you, a foreigner. Oh, how
different an execution used to be in the old days! As much as a whole day
before the event the valley would be packed with people: They lived just to see
it. The commandant appeared early in the morning with his coterie of ladies;
fanfares roused the entire camp; I reported that everything was ready; the
assembly—no high official could be absent—arranged themselves around the
machine. This stack of cane chairs is a pathetic leftover from that time. The
machine was freshly cleaned and gleaming; for almost every execution I used new
spare parts. Before hundreds of eyes—all the spectators would stand on tiptoe
to the very rims of the slopes—the commandant himself installed the condemned
man beneath the harrow. What today is left to a common soldier was performed by
me, the presiding judge, at that time, and it was a great honor for me. And
then the execution began! There were no discordant sounds to disturb the
working of the machine. Many no longer watched but lay in the sand with their
eyes closed; everyone knew: The wheels of justice were turning. In the silence
nothing but the moaning of the condemned man could be heard, though his moans
were muffled by the gag. These days the machine can induce no moan too loud for
the gag to stifle; of course back then an acid that we’re no longer allowed to
use dripped from the writing needles. Well, anyway—then came the sixth hour! It
was not possible to grant every request to watch from close-up. In his wisdom,
the commandant decreed that children should be given first priority. By virtue
of my office, of course, I was always nearby; often I was squatting there with
a small child in either arm. How we drank in the transfigured look on the
sufferer’s face, how we bathed our cheeks in the warmth of that
justice—achieved at long last and fading quickly. What times those were, my
comrade!” The officer had evidently forgotten whom he was addressing; he had
embraced the traveler and laid his head on his shoulder. The traveler was deeply
embarrassed and stared impatiently past the officer’s head. The soldier had
finished cleaning by now and was pouring rice gruel into the bowl from a can.
As soon as the condemned man, who seemed to be fully recovered, saw this, he
began to lap after the gruel with his tongue. The soldier continually pushed
him away, since it was certainly meant for another time, but it was equally
unfair of the soldier to stick his dirty hands into the basin and eat in the
condemned man’s ravenous face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The officer quickly
recovered, “I did not want to upset you,” he said. “I know it’s impossible to
make you understand what it was like then. In any event, the machine still
works and is effective in and of itself. It is effective even though it stands
alone in this valley. And in the end the corpse still slips unbelievably
smoothly into the pit, even if there aren’t, as there once were, hundreds
gathered like flies all around it. At that time, we had to erect a sturdy fence
around the pit. It was torn down long ago.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler wanted
to avert his face from the officer and looked about aimlessly. The officer
assumed that he was marking the desolation of the valley, so he seized his
hands and turned him around to meet his gaze and asked: “Can’t you just see the
shame of it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But the traveler
said nothing. The officer left him alone for a little while and stood
absolutely still, his legs apart, hands on his hips, staring at the ground,
then he smiled encouragingly at the traveler and said: “I was right beside you
yesterday when the commandant invited you. I heard him, I know the commandant,
I immediately understood what his intentions were. Although he’s powerful
enough to move against me, he doesn’t yet dare do it, but he certainly intends
to subject me to your judgment, the judgment of a respected foreigner. He has
calculated carefully: This is your second day on the island, you didn’t know
the old commandant and his ways, you’re conditioned by European mores, perhaps
on principle you object to the death penalty in general and such a mechanical
method as this one in particular; besides, you can see that executions are
pathetic and have no public support here, even the machine is badly worn—now,
taking all this into consideration (so thinks the commandant), isn’t it quite
possible that you would disapprove of my methods? And if you do disapprove (I
am still speaking as the commandant), you wouldn’t conceal this fact, for
certainly you have confidence in your own tried and true convictions. Of course
you have seen and learned to respect the peculiarities of many other peoples,
and you probably wouldn’t condemn our proceedings as forcefully as you would in
your own land. But the commandant has no need for all that. Just letting slip a
casual little remark will suffice. It may not even reflect your true opinions,
so long as it serves his purpose. He will be very clever in his interrogation,
of that I am sure, and his ladies will circle around you and prick up their
ears. You might just say: ‘Our judicial system is quite different, ’ or, ‘The
defendant is questioned before he is sentenced in our country,’ or, ‘In our
country the condemned man is informed of his sentence,’ or ‘We haven’t used
torture since the Middle Ages’—all of which are statements that are as true as
they seem self-evident to you, innocent enough remarks that don’t malign my
methods in any way. But how will the commandant take them? I can picture him,
the good commandant, hastily shoving his chair aside and rushing onto the
balcony, I can see his ladies streaming out after him, I can hear his voice—the
ladies call it a booming, thunderous voice—and so now he speaks: ‘A renowned
scholar from the West, charged with investigating the judicial systems of all
the countries in the world, has just pronounced our traditional system of
administering justice inhumane. After receiving the verdict of such a
distinguished person, I can naturally no longer tolerate this procedure.
Effective immediately I therefore ordain . . . ,’ and so on and so forth. You
would like to recant: You never said what he is asserting; you never called my
methods inhumane, on the contrary you regard them, in keeping with your deep
insight, as the most humane and worthy of humanity; you also admire this
machinery—but it’s too late; you’ll never get to the balcony, which is already
crowded with ladies; you’ll try to draw attention to yourself; you’ll want to
shout but your mouth will be covered by a lady’s hand—and both I and the work
of the old commandant will be finished.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler had to
suppress a smile; the task that he thought would be so difficult was now so
easy. He evasively said: “You overestimate my influence; the commandant has
read my letters of recommendation and knows that I am no expert in legal
matters. If I were to express an opinion, it would be the opinion of a private
individual, with no more weight than anyone else’s and in any case far less
influential than the opinion of the commandant, who, as I understand it, has
very extensive powers in this penal colony. If he is as decidedly against you
as you believe, then I fear that the end of your procedure is indeed
near—without any modest assistance on my part.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Did the officer
finally understand? No, he still didn’t understand. He shook his head firmly,
glanced at the condemned man and the soldier, who both flinched and abruptly
abandoned their rice, came right up to the traveler, and instead of looking him
in the eye, addressed some spot of his coat and said in a lower voice: “You
don’t know the commandant, you believe your position in regard to him and the
rest of us is somewhat—please pardon the expression—ineffectual, but trust me,
your influence cannot be rated too highly. I was overjoyed when I heard that
you would attend the execution alone. This decision of the commandant’s was
intended as a blow to me, but I shall now turn it to my advantage. Without the
distraction of whispered lies and scornful glances—which would have been
unavoidable with a large crowd of spectators—you have heard my explanations,
seen the machine, and are now on the verge of watching the execution. I’m sure
you’ve already formed an opinion; if you still have any niggling doubts left,
the sight of the execution will eliminate them. And now I put this request to
you: Help me defeat the commandant!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler allowed
him to speak no further. “How could I do that,” he exclaimed. “It’s absolutely
impossible. I can’t help you any more than I can hinder you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Yes, you can,”
replied the officer. With some alarm, the traveler noticed that the officer was
clenching his fists. “Yes, you can,” the officer repeated more urgently. “I
have a plan that is bound to succeed. You don’t believe you have sufficient
influence, but I know that you do. However, even granting that you’re right,
isn’t it necessary for the sake of the old system’s preservation that we try
everything, even things that are potentially ineffective? So listen to my plan.
In order for it to succeed, it is extremely important that you say as little as
possible in the colony today concerning the conclusions you’ve drawn about the
procedure. Unless asked directly you should on no account comment. What you do
say, however, must be brief and noncommittal, it should appear that you find
the matter difficult to speak about, that you’re embittered over it, that if
you were to speak freely you would almost be tempted to curse. I’m not asking
you to lie, by any means; you should just answer curtly: ‘Yes, I have seen the
execution,’ or, ‘Yes, it was all explained to me.’ Just that, nothing more.
Your bitterness, which should be made obvious, is sufficiently justified,
although not in the way the commandant imagines. He will completely
misunderstand its meaning of course and interpret it to suit his own needs. My
plan’s success hinges on this. Tomorrow there’s to be a large conference of all
the high administrative officials at the commandant’s headquarters, presided
over by the commandant himself. Naturally the commandant has turned these
meetings into public exhibitions. He has built a gallery that is always packed
with spectators. I am compelled to participate in these meetings, though they
sicken and disgust me. No matter what the case, you are sure to be invited to
this meeting; if you behave today as I have outlined, the invitation will
become an urgent request. But if you are not invited for some obscure reason,
you’ll have to ask for an invitation—that will ensure your getting one without
a doubt. So now tomorrow you’re sitting in the commandant’s box with the
ladies. He keeps looking up to make sure you are there. After discussing
various ludicrous and unimportant issues, introduced solely for the benefit of
the audience—usually it’s some harbor works, it’s always harbor works!—our
judicial procedure is brought to the agenda. If the commandant fails to
introduce it, or fails to do so soon enough, I’ll make it my business to get it
mentioned. I’ll stand up and report on today’s execution. A very brief
statement:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>only that it has
taken place. A statement of this sort is not quite standard at these meetings,
but I will make it anyhow. The commandant thanks me, as always, with a friendly
smile and then can’t restrain himself; he seizes the fortunate opportunity. ‘It
has just been reported,’ he will say, or words to that effect, ‘that there has
been an execution. I should merely like to add that this execution was
witnessed by the great scholar who as you all know has done our colony an
immense honor by his visit. His presence here today lends further importance to
this occasion. Shouldn’t we now ask the great scholar his opinion of our
traditional mode of execution and the whole process surrounding it? Of course
there’s applause and general approval all around, of which mine is the loudest.
The commandant bows to you and says: ‘Then I put the question to you in the
name of all assembled here.’ And now you step up to the balustrade—keep your
hands where everyone can see them, otherwise the ladies will press them and
play with your fingers—and now you can speak out at last. I don’t know how I’ll
be able to endure the tension while waiting for that moment. You mustn’t put
any restrictions on yourself in your speech, let the truth be heard out loud,
lean over the railing and roar, yes, roar your judgment, your immutable
judgment, down on the commandant. But perhaps that is not what you wish to do,
it’s not in keeping with your character; perhaps in your country one behaves
differently in such situations. That’s fine, that’ll work just as well. Don’t
stand up at all, just say a few words, in a whisper so that only those
officials below you can hear. That will be enough. You don’t even have to
mention the lack of public support, the screeching gear, the torn strap, the
repulsive felt; no, I’ll take care of all that and, believe me, if my speech
does not hound him from the hall, it will force him to his knees in confession:
‘Old Commandant, I bow down before you. . . . ’ That is my plan, will you help
me carry it out? But of course you will, what’s more, you must.” And the
officer seized the traveler by the arms and, breathing heavily, stared into his
face. He had shouted his last sentences so loudly that even the soldier and the
condemned man were paying attention; though they couldn’t understand a word,
they stopped eating for a moment and looked over, still chewing, at the
traveler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The answer that he
was obliged to give was absolutely clear to the traveler from the very
beginning. He had experienced far too much in his lifetime to falter here; at
heart he was honorable and without fear, all the same he did hesitate now for a
beat, in the face of the officer and the condemned man. But at last he said
what he had to: “No.” The officer blinked several times but kept his eyes
locked on the traveler’s. “Would you like an explanation?” asked the traveler.
The officer nodded dumbly. “I am opposed to this procedure,” the traveler then
continued, “even before you confided in me—and naturally under no circumstances
would I ever betray your confidence. I had already been considering whether I
would be justified in intervening and whether any such intervention on my part
would have the slightest chance of success. It was clear to me whom I had to
turn to first: the commandant, of course. You helped make this even clearer,
although you did not strengthen my resolve; on the contrary, your sincere
conviction has moved me, even though it cannot influence my judgment.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The officer
remained mute, turned and approached the machine, took hold of one of the brass
rods, and leaning back a little, gazed up at the designer as if to check that
all was in order. The soldier and the condemned man seemed to have become quite
friendly; the condemned man was gesturing to the soldier, though movement was
difficult for him due to the tightly binding straps; the soldier bent down to
him and the condemned man whispered something in his ear; the soldier nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler
followed the officer and said: “You don’t know what I plan to do yet. I’ll
certainly tell the commandant my thoughts on the procedure, but I will do so
privately, not at a public meeting. Nor will I be here long enough to attend
any such meeting; I’m sailing early tomorrow morning, or boarding my ship at
the least.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It did not look as
if the officer had been listening. “So you weren’t convinced by the procedure,”
he muttered to himself, smiling the smile of an old man listening to a child’s
nonsense while pursuing thoughts of his own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Well, then the
time has come,” he said at last, and looked at the traveler suddenly with
bright, somewhat challenging eyes, apparently appealing for some kind of
cooperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Time for what?”
the traveler inquired uneasily, but got no answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You are free,” the
officer said to the condemned man in his own language. He did not believe this
at first. “You are free now,” repeated the officer. For the first time the face
of the condemned man was truly animated. Was it true? Was it just a whim of the
officer’s that might pass? Had the foreigner obtained this reprieve? What was
it? His face seemed to be asking these questions. But not for long. Whatever
the reason might be, he wanted to be really free if he could, and he began to
thrash about as far as the harrow would allow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“You’ll tear my
straps,” barked the officer. “Be still! We’ll undo them.” He signaled to the
soldier and they both set about doing so. The condemned man laughed quietly to
himself without a word, turning his head first to the officer on his left, then
to the soldier on his right, and not forgetting the traveler either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Pull him out,”
ordered the officer. This required a certain amount of care because of the
harrow. Through his own impatience, the condemned man had already sliced up his
back a little.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But from here on
the officer paid little attention to him. He went up to the traveler, drew out
his small leather folder again, thumbed through the pages, finally finding the
one he wanted, and showed it to the traveler. “Read it,” he said. “I can’t,”
said the traveler, “I already told you that I can’t read these scripts.” “Take
a closer look,” the officer insisted, stepping around next to the traveler so
they could read it together. When that proved just as futile, he tried helping
the traveler read by tracing the script with his little finger, though he held
it far away from the paper as if that must never be touched. The traveler did
make every effort in an attempt to please the officer at least in this respect,
but it was impossible. Now the officer began to spell it out letter by letter,
and then he read it all together. “ ‘Be just!’ it says,” he explained. “Surely
you can read it now.” The traveler bent down so close to the paper that the
officer, fearing he would touch it, pulled it farther away; the traveler said
nothing more, but it was clear that he still could not decipher it. “ ‘Be
just!’ it says,” the officer repeated. “That may be,” said the traveler, “I’m
prepared to take your word for it.” “Well then,” said the officer, at least
partly satisfied, and climbed the ladder with the sheet; he inserted the sheet
into the designer with great care and seemed to completely rearrange all the
gears; it was very difficult and intricate work that involved even the smallest
gears, for the officer’s head sometimes disappeared into the designer entirely,
so precisely did he have to examine the mechanism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler
followed this activity closely from below; his neck grew stiff and his eyes
ached from the blaze of sunlight glaring across the sky. The soldier and the
condemned man were absorbed with each other. The condemned man’s shirt and
trousers, which had already been dumped in the pit, were fished out by the
soldier with the point of his bayonet. The shirt was filthy beyond belief, and
the condemned man washed it in the bucket of water. When the condemned man
donned the shirt and trousers, neither of the men could help bursting out
laughing because the garments had been slit up the back. Perhaps the condemned
man felt obliged to amuse the soldier, he twirled around again and again in his
slashed clothes while the soldier squatted on the ground, slapping his knees in
merriment. They did, however, control themselves somewhat out of consideration
for the gentlemen’s presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When at long last
the officer had finished his work up above, he surveyed each part of the entire
machine with a smile and closed the cover of the designer, which had remained
open until now. He climbed down, looked into the pit and then at the condemned
man, noting with satisfaction that he had taken back his clothes, then went
over to wash his hands in the water bucket, realizing only too late how
revoltingly dirty it was, and disheartened that he could no longer wash his
hands, he ultimately thrust them—this alternative did not please him, but he
had to accept it—into the sand. He then rose and began to unbutton his tunic.
As he did this, the two ladies’ handkerchiefs that he had tucked behind his
collar fell into his hands. “Here, take your handkerchiefs,” he said, and
tossed them over to the condemned man. And to the traveler he said by way of
explanation: “Presents from the ladies.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Despite the obvious
haste with which he removed the tunic and then the rest of his clothing, he
handled each garment with the utmost care, even running his fingers over the
tunic’s silver braid and shaking a tassel into place. But all this care was in
direct contrast with the fact that no sooner was he finished removing a garment
than he hurled it unceremoniously into the pit with an indignant jerk. The last
thing left to him was his short sword and its belt. He drew the sword out of
the scabbard and broke it, then gathered it all up, the pieces of sword, the
scabbard, the belt, and threw them into the pit so violently they clanked
against each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Now he stood there
naked. The traveler chewed his lip and said nothing. He knew without a doubt
what was going to happen, but he had no right to prevent the officer from doing
anything. If the judicial procedure that was so dear to the officer was truly
near its end—possibly due to the traveler’s intervention, to which he felt
quite committed—then the officer’s actions were proper; the traveler would have
done the same in his place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The soldier and the
condemned man understood nothing at first, they weren’t even watching. The
condemned man was delighted to have his handkerchiefs returned, but he was not
allowed to enjoy them for long, as the soldier snatched them with a sudden,
unexpected motion. Now the condemned man tried in turn to grab at the
handkerchiefs, which the soldier had tucked under his belt for safekeeping, but
the soldier was on his guard. So they half jokingly wrestled with each other.
Only when the officer was totally naked did they begin to pay attention. The
notion that some drastic reversal was about to take place seemed to have struck
the condemned man in particular. What had happened to him was now happening to
the officer. Perhaps it would be seen through to the end. The foreign traveler
had probably ordered it. This, then, was revenge. Without having suffered to
the end himself, he would be avenged to the end. A broad, silent grin now
appeared on his face and stayed there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The officer,
however, had turned to the machine. It had previously been clear enough that he
understood the machine well, but now it was almost mind-boggling to see how he
handled it and how it obeyed him. He had only to reach out a hand toward the
harrow for it to raise and lower itself several times until it found the proper
position to receive him; he merely nudged the edge of the bed and it started to
vibrate; it was plain that he was rather reluctant, when the felt gag came to
meet his mouth, to receive it, but his hesitation only lasted a moment; he
promptly submitted and received it. Everything was ready; only the straps still
hung down at the sides, but they were evidently superfluous; the officer did
not need to be strapped in. But the condemned man noticed the loose straps, and
in his opinion the execution was not complete unless the straps were fastened;
he eagerly beckoned to the soldier and they both ran over to strap the officer
down. The latter had already stretched out one foot to push the crank that
would start the designer, then he saw the two men approaching; he withdrew his
foot and allowed himself to be strapped in. But now he could no longer reach
the crank; neither the soldier nor the condemned man would be able to find it,
and the traveler was determined not to lift a finger. It wasn’t necessary;
hardly were the straps in place when the machine started to operate: The bed
shook, the needles danced over the flesh, the harrow gently bobbed up and down.
The traveler had already been staring at it for some time before remembering
that a gear in the designer should be screeching, but everything was still, not
even the slightest whirring could be heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Because the machine
was working so silently, it became virtually unnoticeable. The traveler looked
over at the soldier and the condemned man. The condemned was the livelier of
the two, every facet of the machine interested him—one moment he was bending
down, the next reaching up, his forefinger always extended to point something
out to the soldier. This made the traveler extremely uncomfortable. He was
determined to stay here till the end, but he couldn’t bear the sight of those
two for long. “Go on home,” he said. The soldier might have been willing to do
so, but the condemned man considered the order a punishment. With clasped hands
he begged to be allowed to stay, and when the traveler, shaking his head, did
not relent, he even went down on his knees. The traveler realized that giving
orders was useless and was at the point of going over to chase the pair away.
Just then he heard a noise in the designer above him. He looked up. Was it that
troublesome gear after all? But it was something else. The cover of the
designer rose slowly and then fell completely open. The teeth of a gear wheel
emerged and rose higher, soon the whole wheel could be seen. It was as if some
monumental force were compressing the designer so that there was no more room
for this wheel—the wheel spun to the edge of the designer, fell, and rolled a
little ways in the sand before it toppled onto its side. But a second wheel was
already following it, with many others rolling after it—large ones, small ones,
some so tiny they were hard to see; the same thing happened with all of them.
One kept imagining that the designer was finally empty, but then a fresh, particularly
numerous group would come into view, climb out, fall, spin in the sand, and lie
still. In the thrall of this spectacle, the condemned man completely forgot the
traveler’s order. He was fascinated by the wheels and kept trying to catch one,
urging the soldier at the same time to help him; but he always drew back his
hand in alarm, for another wheel would immediately come speeding along and
frighten him, at least when it started to roll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The traveler on the
other hand was deeply troubled—the machine was obviously falling apart—its
silent operation was an illusion. He had the feeling that it was now his duty
to take care of the officer, since he was no longer capable of looking after
himself. However, while the chaos of the gear wheels claimed all his attention,
he had failed to keep an eye on the rest of the machine; now that the last
wheel had left the designer, he went over to the harrow and had a new and even
less welcome surprise. The harrow wasn’t writing at all but just stabbing, and
the bed wasn’t rolling the body over but thrusting it up, quivering, into the
needles. The traveler wanted to do something, bring the whole machine to a stop
if possible, because this was not the exquisite torture the officer had wished
for; this was out-and-out murder. He reached out, but at that moment the harrow
rose with the body already spitted upon it and swung to the side as it usually
only did at the twelfth hour. Blood flowed in a hundred streams—not mixed with
water, the water jets had also failed to function this time—and the last
function failed to complete itself, the body did not drop from the long
needles: It hung over the pit, streaming with blood, without falling. The
harrow tried to return to its original position, but as if it also noticed that
it had not unloaded its burden, it stayed where it was, suspended over the pit.
“Come and help!” the traveler shouted to the soldier and the condemned man, and
grabbed the officer by the feet. He wanted to push against the feet from this
side while the other two took hold of the head from the other side so the
officer could gently be removed from the needles. But the others couldn’t make
up their minds to come right away; the condemned man had even turned away. The
traveler was compelled to go over to them and force them to get in position by
the officer’s head. And from this vantage point he had to look, almost against
his will, at the face of the corpse. It was as it had been in life (no sign of
the promised deliverance could be detected). What all the others had found in
the machine, the officer had not; his lips were clamped together, the eyes were
open and bore the same expression as in life, a quiet, convinced look; and
through the forehead was the point of the great iron spike.</span></p>

<![endif]></span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>As the traveler, with the soldier and the
condemned man following, reached the first houses in the colony, the soldier
pointed to one of them and said: “That’s the teahouse.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On the ground floor
of this house was a deep, low, cavernous room whose walls and ceiling were
blackened with smoke. It was open to the street along the whole of its width.
Although the teahouse differed very little from the other houses in the colony,
which, except for the palatial buildings of the commandant’s headquarters, were
all very dilapidated, it gave the traveler the impression of being a historic
landmark, and he felt the power of earlier times. Followed by his companions,
he went closer, passed between the empty tables that stood on the street in
front of the teahouse, and breathed in the damp, cool air that came from the
interior. “The old man is buried here,” said the soldier. “The priest wouldn’t
allow him in the cemetery. For a while no one knew where to bury him, they
ended up burying him here. The officer didn’t tell you about it because, naturally,
it’s what he’s most ashamed of. A few times he even tried to dig the old man up
at night, but he was always chased away.” “Where’s the grave?” asked the
traveler, finding it impossible to believe the soldier. Both the soldier and
the condemned man immediately ran in front of him, pointing with outstretched
hands to where the grave was. They led the traveler to the far wall, where
several customers were sitting at tables. They were apparently dock workers,
strong men with black, glistening, full beards. They were all in their
shirt-sleeves and their shirts were raggedy: These were poor, humble people. As
the traveler approached, some of them rose and edged back against the wall,
staring at him. “He’s a foreigner,” was whispered around him, “he wants to see
the grave.” They pushed one of the tables aside, and under it there actually
was a gravestone. It was a simple stone, low enough to be hidden beneath a
table. It bore an inscription in very small lettering; the traveler had to
kneel down in order to read it. It read: “Here lies the old commandant. His
followers, who must now remain nameless, have dug this grave and set this
stone. It has been prophesied that after a certain number of years he will rise
again and lead his followers out of this house to reclaim the colony. Have
faith and wait!” When the traveler read this, he rose to his feet. He saw the
men surrounding him smile, as if they had read the inscription with him, found
it absurd, and were inviting him to agree with them. The traveler pretended not
to notice, distributed a few coins among them, and waiting until the table was
pushed back over the grave, left the teahouse and made for the harbor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The soldier and the
condemned man were detained in the teahouse by some acquaintances. But they
must have broken away from them relatively quickly because the traveler had
only descended half the long flight of stairs that led to the boats when they
came running after him. They probably wanted to force the traveler to take them
with him at the last minute. While he was down below negotiating with a
ferryman to take him to the steamer, the two men charged down the steps in
silence, as they did not dare shout. But by the time they arrived at the foot
of the steps, the traveler was already in the boat and the ferryman was casting
off. They could still have jumped aboard, but the traveler hoisted a heavy,
knotted rope from the floor of the boat and threatened them with it, thereby
preventing them from attempting the leap.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>I WAS DISTRAUGHT: AN urgent journey awaited me; I
had to visit a gravely ill patient in a village ten miles away; a thick
blizzard filled the distance that separated us; I had a trap,<a
href="#filepos479384"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>k</span></span></a> a light one with
large wheels that was perfect for our country roads; I stood in the courtyard,
wrapped in furs, holding my bag of instruments, all ready to go, but the horse
was missing—no horse. My own horse had died the night before from the exertions
of this icy winter. My maid was now running around the village trying to
scrounge up a horse, but it was utterly hopeless. I knew it. I stood there
aimlessly, more and more covered in snow, less and less able to move. The girl
appeared at the gate, swinging the lantern, alone of course. Who would lend his
horse for such a journey and at a time like this? I paced the courtyard once
more; there was nothing I could do. Frustrated, I distractedly kicked at the
flimsy door of the long-vacant pigsty. It flew open and was flung back and
forth on its hinges. Steam and the smell of horses emerged. Inside, a dim
stable lantern was hanging from a rope, swaying. A man, crouching in the low
shed, revealed his open, blue-eyed face. “Shall I harness the horses to the
trap?” he asked, crawling out on all fours. I could think of nothing to say and
merely bent down to see what else was in the sty. The maid was standing beside
me. “You never know what you’ll find in your own house,” she said, and we both
laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Greetings brother,
greetings sister!” cried the groom, and two horses, mighty creatures with
powerful flanks, pushed themselves, one after the other, their legs close to
their bodies, their shapely heads dipped down like camels’, propelling
themselves, with the sheer force of their writhing bodies, through the doorway
they completely filled. But they promptly stood upright on their long legs,
their coast steaming thickly. “Give him a hand,” I said, and the willing girl
hurried to hand the harnesses to the groom, but she was hardly near him when
the groom threw his arms around her and shoved his face against hers. She
screamed and ran back to me for safety, two red rows of tooth marks imprinted
on her cheek. “You brute,” I yelled furiously, “I’ll give you a whipping, I
swear,” but then I immediately remember that he is a stranger, that I don’t
know where he comes from, and that he is helping me of his own free will when
all others have refused me. As if he has read my thoughts, he takes no offense
at my threat, but, still busy with the horses, only once turns around to look
at me. “Get in,” he then says, and everything is actually ready. I note to
myself that I have never ridden behind such a magnificent pair of horses, and
climb in cheerfully. “I’ll drive though, you don’t know the way,” I say. “Of
course,” he answers, “I’m not going with you at all. I’m staying here with
Rosa.” “No,” shrieks Rosa, and runs in the house with a justified presentiment
of her inescapable fate. I hear the door chain rattle into place, I hear the
lock click shut, I watch as she extinguishes the lights in the hall and in each
room as she runs through, trying to hide her whereabouts. “You’re coming with
me,” I inform the groom, “or I won’t go, urgent as my journey is. I do not
intend to hand the girl over to you in payment for my passage.” “Giddap!” he
cries, clapping his hands, and the trap is swept away like a twig in the
current. I hear my front door splinter and burst as the groom attacks it, and
then my eyes and ears are swamped with a blinding rush of the senses. But even
this lasts only a moment, for, as if my patient’s courtyard opens just outside
my gate, I am already there. The horses stand quietly; it has stopped snowing and
there’s moonlight all around; my patient’s parents hurry out of the house, his
sister behind them. I am nearly lifted out of the trap; I glean nothing from
their confused babbling. The air in the sickroom is barely breathable; smoke is
billowing out of the neglected stove. I need to open a window, but first I must
examine the patient. Gaunt but with no fever, neither warm nor cold, with
vacant eyes and no shirt, the boy hauls himself out from under the bedding,
drapes himself around my neck, and whispers into my ear: “Doctor, let me die.”
I take a swift look around the room; nobody heard him. The parents are silently
leaning forward, awaiting my diagnosis; the sister has brought a chair for my
medical bag. I open the bag and search through my instruments. The boy keeps
grabbing at me from the bed to remind me of his request. I seize a pair of
pincers, examine them in the candlelight, and throw them back. “Yes,” I think
cynically, “the gods help out in cases like these. They send the missing horse,
add a second owing to the urgency, and even supply a groom. . . .” Only now do
I remember Rosa again. What should I do, how can I save her, how can I pry her
from under that groom ten miles away when an uncontrollable team of horses is
driving my trap? These horses, who have now somehow slipped their reins, push
the windows open from the outside—how, I don’t know. Each pokes its head
through a window and, unperturbed by the family’s outcry, they stand gazing at
the patient. “I’ll drive back home at once,” I think, as if the horses were
summoning me for the return journey, and yet I allow the patient’s sister, who
imagines that I’m overcome by the heat, to remove my furs. I am handed a glass
of rum, the old man claps me on the shoulder, a familiarity justified by the
offer of this treasure. I shake my head; the narrow cast of the old man’s
thoughts would sicken me; for this reason only I refuse the drink. The mother
beckons me from the side of the bed, I come forward and, while one of the
horses neighs loudly to the ceiling, lay my head on the boy’s chest. He shivers
under my wet beard. I confirm what I already know: The boy is healthy. He has
rather poor circulation and has been saturated with coffee by his anxious
mother, but he’s healthy and would be best driven from bed with a firm shove.
But I’m not here to change the world, so I let him lie. I am employed by the
district and do my duty to the utmost, and perhaps beyond. Though miserably
paid, I’m both generous and ready to help the poor. But Rosa still has to be taken
care of, and then maybe the boy will get his wish, and I’ll want to die too.
What am I doing in this eternal winter? My horse is dead and no one in the
village will lend me his. I have to drag my team out of the pigsty; if they
didn’t happen to be horses, I would have to drive sows. That’s how it is. And I
nod to the family; they know nothing about it, and if they did know, they
wouldn’t believe it. It’s easy to write prescriptions, but it’s tougher to
really get through to people. Well, that about wraps up my visit; once again
I’ve been called out unnecessarily, but I’m used to it. The whole district
torments me with the help of my night bell; but that I had to forsake Rosa this
time, that beautiful girl who’s lived in my house for years, almost unnoticed
by me—this is too much of a sacrifice, and I shall have to try and
painstakingly arrange my thoughts with great care and subtlety so as not to
attack the family, who even with the best intentions in the world could not
restore Rosa to me. But when I shut my bag and gesture for my coat, the family
is standing around in a group, the father sniffing at the glass of rum in his
hand, the mother probably disappointed in me—why, what do people
expect?—tearfully biting her lip, the sister twisting a blood-soaked
handkerchief; I am somehow ready to concede that the boy might be sick after
all. I go to him, he smiles at me as if I were bringing him the most nourishing
broth—alas, now both horses are neighing; the heavens, I’m sure, have ordained
that this noise shall facilitate my examination—and now I discover: Yes, the
boy is sick. On his right side, by his hip, a wound as big as the palm of my
hand has opened up: various shades of rose-red, deeper red further in, paler at
the edges, finely grained but with uneven clotting, and open like a surface
mine to the daylight—so it looks from a distance. But closer inspection reveals
a further complication. Who wouldn’t let out a whistle at the sight of that?
Worms, as long and thick as my little finger, rose-red too and blood spattered,
caught in the depth of the wound wriggle toward the light with their small
white heads and hundreds of tiny legs. Poor boy, you are beyond all help. I
have unearthed your great wound; this bloom on your side is destroying you. The
family is pleased, they see me being busy; the sister tells the mother, who
tells the father, who tells some guests as they come tiptoeing in through the
moonlight in the open door, their arms stretched out from their sides for
balance. “Will you save me?” the boy whispers, sobbing, completely blinded by
the life in his wound. This is typical of the people in my district, always
asking the impossible of the doctor. They have lost their old faith; the
minister sits at home and picks apart his vestments, one by one, but the doctor
is expected to fix everything with his fine surgical hand. Well, if it pleases
them; I haven’t foisted myself on them; if they misuse me for sacred ends, I’ll
let that pass too; what more could I want, an old country doctor robbed of his maid!
And so they come, the family and the village elders, and undress me; a school
choir, led by a teacher, stands before the house and sings this verse to a very
simple tune: </span></p>

<p class=Para14 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>First undress him,
then he’ll cure us, <br>
If he doesn’t, then we’ll kill him! <br>
He’s a doctor, just a doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Then I’m naked,
calmly surveying the people, with my fingers in my beard, my head bowed. I am
quite composed and feel fairly superior to the situation and remain so, but
still it doesn’t help me, for they pick me up by the head and feet and carry me
to the bed. They lay me down next to the wall, on the side of the wound. They
all leave the room and shut the door, the singing stops, clouds obscure the
moon, the bedding lies warm all around me, the heads of the horses sway like shadows
in the open windows. “You know,” a voice says in my ear, “I don’t have much
confidence in you. You just blew in here, you didn’t even come on your own two
feet. Instead of helping me, you’re crowding my deathbed. What I’d love best is
to scratch your eyes out.” “You’re right,” I say, “it’s disgraceful. But I am a
doctor. What should I do? Believe me, it’s not easy for me either.” “Is that
excuse supposed to satisfy me? Oh, I suppose it must. I’m always supposed to be
satisfied. I came into the world with a gorgeous wound, that was my sole
endowment.” “Young friend,” I say, “your trouble is that you have no sense of
perspective. I have been in sickrooms far and wide, and I tell you this: Your
wound isn’t that bad—made at angles with two sharp blows of the ax. Many offer
up their sides and barely hear the ax in the forest, let alone that it’s coming
closer.” “Is it really so, or are you deluding me in my fever?” “It is really
so, I give you my word of honor, the word of a public health official.” He took
me at my word and lay still. But now it was time for me to think of my own
salvation. The horses were faithfully standing their ground. I quickly
collected my clothes, furs, and bag, as I didn’t want to waste time dressing.
If the horses sped back as fast as they had come, I would more or less be
jumping from this bed into mine. One of the horses obediently drew back from
the window; I flung my bundle into the trap; the fur coat, flying too far,
caught on a hook by only one sleeve. Good enough. I swung myself up onto the
horse. The reins trailed loose, one horse was barely hitched to the other, the
trap swayed wildly behind, and, last of all, the fur coat dragged in the snow.
“Giddap!” I shouted, but the horses didn’t gallop. We crawled slowly through
the wasteland of snow like old men; for a long time the sound of the children’s
new but incorrect song followed us:</span></p>

<p class=Para14 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>All you patients now
be joyful, <br>
The doctor’s laid in bed beside you!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I’ll never reach
home at this rate; my thriving practice is lost; my successor will rob me of
it, but in vain, for he cannot replace me; that foul groom is raging through my
house; Rosa is his victim; I don’t want to think of it anymore. Naked, exposed
to the frosts of this most unfortunate era, with my earthly carriage and unearthly
horses, old man that I am, I am buffeted about. My fur coat hangs from the back
of the trap, but I cannot reach it, and not one of my agile pack of patients
lifts a finger. Betrayed! Betrayed! A false ring of the night bell, once
answered—it can never be made right.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>IT WOULD SEEM THAT there is much about the
defense of our fatherland that has been neglected. We have not been overly
concerned about this until recently and have gone about our daily work, but
lately certain events have caused us concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I have a
shoemaker’s workshop in the square in front of the imperial palace. Scarcely
have I opened up shop at daybreak when I see armed men posted at the end of
every street leading into the square. These, however, are not our soldiers but
clearly nomads from the north. They have somehow, just how is inconceivable to
me, penetrated the capital, although it is really quite a long distance from
the border. In any event they are there, and every morning it seems that there
are more of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As befits their
nature, they camp out in the open because they loathe housing. They occupy
themselves by sharpening swords, whittling arrows, practicing their
horsemanship. This peaceful square, which has always been kept scrupulously
clean, has been transformed by them into a veritable sty. We do, every now and
then, dash out of our shops and clear away at least the worst of the trash, but
this happens less and less frequently, as the effort is futile; besides, in
doing this we risk being trampled by horses or lashed by whips.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos364742></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Conversation with
the nomads is impossible. They don’t speak our language and in fact barely have
one of their own. Among themselves they communicate much as jackdaws<a
href="#filepos479808"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>m</span></span></a> do; this jackdaw
squawking constantly fills our ears. They neither understand nor have any
desire to understand our way of life, our institutions, and so as a result even
our sign language is willfully incomprehensible to them. You can dislocate your
jaw and wrench your wrists out of joint and they still have not understood you,
nor will they ever understand. They often grimace, then flash the whites of
their eyes and foam at the mouth, but they don’t actually mean anything by it;
it’s not even a threat, they just do it because that’s their nature. They take
whatever it is they need. You can’t say that they employ force; when they grab
at something, you simply stand aside and leave them to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>From my own stores
they have taken quite a lot. But I can hardly complain when I see, for example,
how the butcher across the street fares. He’s barely brought in his supplies
when they’re snatched away and the nomads are all over it. Even their horses
feed on meat; a horseman and his horse frequently lie side by side, gnawing at
the same piece of meat, one at either end. The butcher is afraid and does not
dare stop his meat deliveries. We understand this, however, and we take up a
collection to support him. Who knows what the nomads would be capable of if
they didn’t get the meat—for that matter, who knows what they’re capable of
even when they do get meat every day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The other day the
butcher thought he might at least spare himself the trouble of slaughtering, so
he brought out a live ox in the morning. He must never be permitted to do this
again. For a full hour, I lay flat on the floor at the very back of my
workshop; I had covered myself with all my clothes, blankets, and pillows, just
to drown out the horrifying braying of that ox; the nomads were leaping on it
from all sides to rip off pieces of its warm flesh with their teeth. All had
been quiet for a long time before I ventured out again. Like drunks around a
wine cask, they were lying glutted around the remains of the ox.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was just then
that I thought I saw the Emperor himself in one of the palace windows;
ordinarily he never enters these outer rooms but keeps strictly to the
innermost garden; but at that moment he was standing, at least it seemed so to
me, at one of the windows, gazing down, with head bowed, at the activity before
his palace gates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>We all ask
ourselves, What will happen? How long can we endure this burden and torment?
The imperial palace has attracted the nomads, but it does not know how to drive
them away again. The gates stay shut; the sentries, who before always marched
in and out with pomp, now hide inside behind barred windows. The salvation of
our fatherland is left to us craftsmen and tradespeople, but we are not equal
to such a task, nor indeed have we ever claimed to be capable of it. This is a
misunderstanding, and it is proving the ruin of us.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>IN RECENT DECADES THERE has been a marked decline
in the public’s interest in professional fasting. It was formerly very
profitable to mount large, privately managed productions of this kind, while
today this is entirely impossible. Those were different times. There was a time
when the whole town was entranced by the hunger artist; during his fast,
enthusiasm grew from day to day, everyone wanted to see the hunger artist at
least once a day; during the latter stages people would reserve special seats
in front of the small barred cage all day long, there were even night
exhibitions by torchlight for a more extreme effect; on fine days the cage was
carried out into the open and then it was a particular treat for children to
see the hunger artist, while for the elders he was often mostly a joke in which
they participated because it was fashionable; the children stood around in
open-mouthed wonder, holding each other’s hands for security, and watching as
he sat on the spread-out straw, spurning even a chair, a pale figure in black
tricot,<a href="#filepos480296"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>o</span></span></a> his ribs
protruding hideously; sometimes he nodded politely, answering questions with a
forced smile, occasionally proffering an arm through the bars for them to feel
how skinny it was but then sinking down and retreating completely into himself,
paying attention to nothing and no one, not even the all-important striking of
the clock, which was the only piece of furniture in the cage, but staring
straight ahead through narrowed eyes and taking an occasional sip from a glass
of water to moisten his lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Aside from the
milling spectators, there were also constant teams of watchmen selected by the
public; oddly enough these were butchers more often than not, whose task it was
to watch the hunger artist night and day, three at a time, so that he did not
partake of somehow secreted nourishment. This was nothing more than a formality
instituted to reassure the masses, because as initiates very well knew, during
the period of the fast the hunger artist would under no circumstances,
including duress, swallow the tiniest morsel; the honor of his profession
forbade it. Of course, not every watchman was capable of comprehending this;
frequently there were groups of night watchmen who were very lax in their
duties and deliberately sat in a far corner absorbed in a card game with the
obvious intention of allowing the hunger artist the opportunity of a little
refreshment, which they assumed he could procure from some hidden stash.
Nothing was more hateful to the hunger artist than watchmen like these, they
made him miserable, they made his fast excruciatingly unbearable; sometimes he
was able to overcome his weakness enough to sing during their watch for as long
as he could to show these people how unjust their suspicions were. This was of
little use, however; they only wondered at his skillful ability to eat while
singing. He very much preferred the watchmen who sat right up against the bars
and who were not satisfied by the dim night-lighting in the hall and so trained
on him the beams of electric torches provided by the impresario. He was not at
all disturbed by the harsh light, as he was unable to sleep in any case and he
could always doze off a bit no matter the light or the hour, even when the hall
was packed with noisy people. He was quite prepared to pass a sleepless night
with such guards; he was happy to swap jokes with them, tell them stories from
his nomadic life and listen to their stories in turn, anything to keep them
awake and to show them again and again that there was nothing edible in his
cage and that he was fasting as not one among them could fast. He was happiest
however when morning came and a lavish breakfast was brought to them at his own
expense; they threw themselves on it with the keen appetite of healthy men
after the wearying night’s vigil. Of course there were people who even
misconstrued this breakfast as a bribe for the guards, but that was really
going too far, and when asked if they would take over the night watch without
breakfast just for the sake of the cause, they slunk away but stuck to their
insinuations nevertheless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But suspicions of
this nature are inseparable from fasting. No one was capable of spending all
his days and nights keeping watch over the hunger artist, therefore no one
person could be absolutely certain from firsthand knowledge that the fast had
truly been constant and flawless; only the hunger artist himself could know
that, and so at the same time only he could be a satisfied spectator of his own
fast. And yet for other reasons he was never satisfied; perhaps it was not just
the fasting that emaciated his body to such a point that many people
regretfully could not attend his demonstrations because they could not bear the
sight of him, perhaps he was so reduced through dissatisfaction with himself.
For he alone knew what no other initiate knew: How easy it was to fast. It was
the easiest thing in the world. Nor did he make a secret of this though no one
believed him; at best they thought him modest, but mostly they chalked it up to
publicity or thought him a fraud for whom fasting was easy because he had
figured out some scam to make it easy and then had the audacity to more or less
admit it. He was forced to endure all this and he even grew accustomed to it over
the years, but his own dissatisfaction gnawed at him inwardly, and yet never,
not after a single fasting period—one had to grant him that much—had he left
his cage voluntarily. The impresario had fixed the maximum period of fasting at
forty days, he would never allow a fast to exceed this limit even in great
cities, and for good reason. Experience had proved that public interest in any
town could be roused by steadily increased advertising for about forty days,
but the public lost interest after that and a substantial drop in attendance
was noted; naturally there were small variations in this between one town or
country and another, but as a rule forty days was the prescribed limit. So on
the fortieth day the flower-festooned cage was opened, an enthusiastic crowd of
spectators filled the hall, a military band performed, two doctors entered the
cage to take the necessary measurements of the hunger artist, announced these
results to the audience through a megaphone, and finally two young ladies came
forward, pleased to have been selected for the honor of assisting the hunger
artist from the cage and down the first few steps toward a small table laden
with a carefully prepared invalid’s meal. And at this very moment the hunger
artist always turned stubborn. He would go so far as to surrender his bony arms
to the outstretched hands of these so licitous ladies as they bent down to him,
but stand up—that he would not do. Why stop now, after just forty days? He
could have gone on longer, infinitely longer; why stop now when he was in his
best fasting form, or rather, not yet in his best form? Why should he be robbed
of the glory of fasting longer, not only for being the greatest hunger artist
of all time, which he probably was already, but for surpassing his own record
to achieve the inconceivable, because he felt his powers of fasting knew no
bounds. Why did his public, who claimed to so admire him, have so little
patience with him; if he could endure fasting longer, why couldn’t they endure
it? And besides, he was tired, he was comfortable sitting in the straw, and now
he was expected to haul himself up to his full height and proceed to a meal the
mere thought of which nauseated him to such a point that only the presence of
the ladies and enormous effort prevented him from expressing it. And he gazed
up into the eyes of the ladies, who were seemingly so friendly but in reality
so cruel, and shook his head, which felt too heavy for his enfeebled neck. But
then, what always happened, happened again. The impresario came forward
silently—the band music made speech impossible—he raised his arms over the
hunger artist as if inviting heaven to look down upon its handiwork in the
straw, this pathetic martyr, which the hunger artist certainly was but in a
completely different sense; he grasped the hunger artist around his emaciated
waist with exaggerated delicacy to accentuate the fragile condition he was in,
and committed him—not without giving him a secret shake or two so that the
hunger artist’s upper body and legs lolled and swayed about—to the care of the
ladies, who had grown quite pale. Now the hunger artist submitted to
everything, his head lay on his chest as if it had rolled there by chance and
was inexplicably stopped, his body was hollowed out, some instinct of self-preservation
squeezed his legs tight at the knees but they scraped at the ground as if it
were not the solid earth they sought, and the entire weight of his body,
however modest, was supported by one of the ladies, who looked around for help,
panting a little—this was not how she had pictured her post of honor—first she
craned her neck as far back as she could to prevent her face from touching the
hunger artist, but then, when this was not successful and her more fortunate
companion did not come to her aid but merely extended a trembling hand, which
held the small bundle of bones that was the hunger artist’s hand, she burst
into tears, much to the delight of the spectators, and had to be replaced by an
attendant who was standing in readiness. Then came the meal, a tiny bit of
which the impresario spooned into the virtually comatose hunger artist, amid
cheerful patter designed to divert the audience’s attention from the artist’s
condition; afterward a toast that the artist allegedly whispered to the impresario
was drunk to the public, the band capped everything with a grand flourish, the
crowd dispersed, and no one had any cause to be dissatisfied with the show; no
one, that is, but the hunger artist, always only him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So he lived for
many years in apparent splendor and with regular periods of rest, honored by
the world, yet despite all that, mostly in a black mood that grew all the
darker because no one took it seriously. And indeed, how could he be comforted?
What more could he wish for? And if once in a while a kind-hearted soul came
along and felt sorry for him and tried to point out that his melancholia was
probably due to his fasting, it sometimes happened, especially if the fast were
well advanced, that the hunger artist responded with a furious outburst and
began to rattle the bars of his cage alarmingly, like a beast. But the
impresario had a method of punishment that he was fond of employing for these
outbursts. He begged the assembled audience’s pardon for the artist’s behavior,
which he admitted was to be excused only as an irritable condition brought on
by the fasting, a condition incomprehensible to well-fed people, and then he
would make the transition to the hunger artist’s equally outlandish claim that
he was able to fast for much longer than he already had; he praised the high
aspirations, the goodwill, and the great deal of self-denial undoubtedly
implicit in this claim, but then he would seek to refute this claim simply
enough by producing photographs, which were simultaneously offered for sale to
the public, showing the artist on the fortieth day of a fast, lying on a bed,
near dead from exhaustion. This perversion of the truth, though familiar to the
hunger artist, always unnerved him anew and was too much for him. What was a
consequence of the premature termination of his fast was presented here as its
cause! To fight against this idiocy, this world of idiocy, was impossible. He
stood clinging to the bars of his cage listening to the impresario in good
faith time and time again but always let go as soon as the photographs appeared
and sank back down onto his straw with a moan, and the reassured public could
approach again and stare at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the witnesses
to such scenes reflected on them several years later, they often could not comprehend
their own behavior. Meanwhile the aforementioned decline of public interest had
already taken place; it seemed to happen almost overnight; there may have been
deeper reasons for it, but who wanted to dig around for them; in any event, one
day the pampered hunger artist found himself deserted by the crowds of pleasure
seekers, who streamed past him toward other, more popular exhibitions. The
impresario chased halfway across Europe with him one last time to see if the
old interest were still alive here and there, all in vain; it was as if a
secret pact had been made and everywhere there was evidence of a veritable
revulsion for professional fasting. Naturally it could not realistically have
happened so suddenly, and in retrospect a number of warning signs that were not
adequately noted or sufficiently dealt with in the intoxication of success now
came to mind, but it was too late at present to engage in any countermeasures.
Of course fasting would make a comeback someday, but that was no comfort to the
living. What was the hunger artist to do now? When he had been lauded by
thousands he could never deign to appear as a sideshow in village fairs, and as
for embarking on a different career, the hunger artist was not only too old but
above all too fanatically devoted to fasting. So he took leave of the
impresario, his partner throughout an unparalleled career, and found a position
in a large circus; in order to spare his own feelings, he avoided reading the
terms of his contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A huge circus, with
its personnel, animals, and apparatus constantly being shuffled, replaced,
recruited, and supplemented, could always find a use for anyone at any time,
even a hunger artist, provided of course that his wants were few, and in this
particular case it was not just the hunger artist that was hired but also his
long-famous name; indeed in light of the peculiar nature of his art, which was
not impaired by advancing age, it could not even be said that this was a
superannuated artist who was seeking refuge in a quiet circus job; on the
contrary, the hunger artist avowed very credibly—and there was every reason to
believe him—that he could fast as well as ever; he even claimed that if he were
allowed to do as he pleased, and this was promised him without further ado, he
would truly astound the world with the results for the first time, although
this assertion, owing to the prevailing attitude that the hunger artist, in his
zeal, was wont to forget, only provoked a smile from the experts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The hunger artist
had not however lost his sense of fundamental reality and accepted it as a
matter of course that his cage was not placed in the middle of the ring as a
star attraction but outside by the stables in a spot that was, after all, still
accessible. Large brightly painted placards framed his cage and proclaimed what
was to be seen inside. When the public came pouring out during intermissions to
see the animals, they almost inevitably passed the hunger artist’s cage and
stopped there for a moment; they might have loitered longer if the crowds
pressing them from behind in the narrow passageway, who did not understand the
delay in seeing the keenly anticipated menagerie, did not render further
contemplation unfeasible. This was also the reason why the hunger artist, who
had naturally been looking forward to these visiting hours as the culmination
of his life’s work, trembled at their prospect. At first he could hardly wait
for the intermissions; he had delighted in watching the crowds surge toward
him, until all too quickly it was firmly impressed upon him—and even the most
obstinate and half-deliberate self-deception could not obscure the fact—that
these people, judging from their actions at least, were again and again without
exception on their way to visit the stables. And that first sight of them from
a distance remained the most cherished. For as soon as they reached him he was
promptly deafened by the shouting and cursing that welled up from the two
contending factions, the ones that wanted to pause and stare at him—and the
hunger artist soon found them the more distasteful of the two—out of no true
interest but from nastiness and defiance, and the others, who only wanted to go
straight to the animals. After the first rush was over, along came the
stragglers, and although there was nothing to prevent them from stopping as
long as they liked, these folks hurried by with long strides and nary a glance
at him as they hastened to reach the stables in time. And all too rarely he had
a stroke of luck when the father of a family arrived with his children, pointed
to the hunger artist, and gave a detailed explanation of the phenomenon,
telling tales of earlier years when he had attended similar but far grander
exhibitions, and the children, since neither their lives nor their schools had
sufficiently prepared them for this, remained uncomprehending—what was hunger
to them?— but the gleam in their inquisitive eyes spoke of new and better and
more merciful times to come. The hunger artist sometimes remarked to himself
that perhaps things might look a little brighter if he were not located quite
so near the stables. That made it too easy for people to choose their
destination, not to mention how the stench of the stables, the restlessness of
the animals at night, the conveyance of raw slabs of meat for the beasts of
prey, and the roars at feeding time all continually oppressed him. But he did
not dare complain to the management; after all he had the animals to thank for
the numerous visitors who did pass his cage, among whom there always might be the
one who was there just to see him, and lord knew where they might tuck him away
if he called attention to his existence and thereby to the fact that, strictly
speaking, he was no more than an obstacle in the path to the animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A slight obstacle
to be sure, an obstacle growing slighter by the day. One has grown accustomed
in this day and age to finding it strange to call attention to a hunger artist,
and in accordance with this custom the verdict was carried against him. He
might fast as well as only he could, and indeed he did, but nothing could save
him, everyone passed him by. Just try to explain the art of fasting to someone!
Without a feeling for it, one cannot be made to understand it. The colorful
placards became dirty and illegible, they were torn down and no one thought to
replace them; the little signboard tallying the number of days fasted, which
was at first carefully altered each day, had long remained unchanged, for after
the first few weeks the staff had already tired of even this small task, and so
the hunger artist just fasted on as he had once dreamed of doing, and it was
indeed no trouble for him, as he had always predicted, but no one counted the
days, no one, not even the hunger artist himself, knew the extent of his
achievement, and his spirits sank. And once in a while when a random passerby
lingered, ridiculed the outdated number posted, and hinted at fraud, it was the
stupidest lie in a sense, born of malice and brute indifference, for the hunger
artist did not cheat; he worked with integrity, but the world cheated him of
his reward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>However, many more
days passed and that too came to an end. An overseer happened to notice the
cage one day and asked the help why this perfectly useful cage with rotten
straw in it was left unoccupied; no one knew the answer until someone, with the
help of the signboard, recalled the hunger artist. They prodded the straw with
sticks and found the hunger artist buried inside. “Are you still fasting?”
asked the overseer. “When on earth do you plan on stopping?” “Forgive me,
everyone,” rasped the hunger artist; only the overseer with his ear pressed
against the bars could understand him. “By all means,” said the overseer,
tapping his finger at the side of his forehead to indicate the hunger artist’s
condition to the others, “we forgive you.” “I always wanted you to admire my
fasting,” said the hunger artist. “And so we do admire it,” said the overseer
accommodatingly. “But you shouldn’t admire it,” said the hunger artist. “So
then we don’t admire it,” said the overseer, “but why should we not admire it?”
“Because I must fast, I cannot do otherwise,” answered the hunger artist. “What
a character you are,” said the overseer, “and why can’t you do otherwise?”
“Because,” said the hunger artist, lifting his head a little and puckering his
lips as if for a kiss, and he spoke directly into the overseer’s ear so that
nothing would be missed, “because I could never find food I liked. Had I found
it, believe me, I would never have created such a ruckus and would have stuffed
myself like you and everyone else.” These were his last words, but in his
glazing eyes there remained the firm if no longer proud conviction that he was
still fasting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>“Now clear this
out!” barked the overseer, and they buried the hunger artist together with his
straw. Then they put a young panther into the cage. It was refreshing, even to
the least sensitive, to see this wild creature leaping around the cage that had
been dreary for so long. He wanted for nothing. The guards brought him the food
he liked without hesitation; he did not appear to miss his freedom; his noble
body, full to almost bursting with all he needed, also seemed to carry freedom
with it; this freedom seemed to reside somewhere in his jaws, and the joy of
life burned so fiercely in his throat that it was not easy for the onlookers to
bear it. But they steeled themselves, surged around the cage, and wanted never
to leave it.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>OUR SINGER’S NAME IS Josephine. Anyone who has
not heard her does not know the power of song. There is not one among us who is
not swept away by her singing, and this is indeed high praise—higher still as
we are not generally a music-loving people. Peace and quiet is the music most
dear to us; we have a hard life and even on the occasions when we have tried to
shake free from the cares of our daily life we still cannot raise ourselves up
to something so lofty and remote from our routine lives as music. But we don’t
much mourn this, we never even get that far; we consider a certain pragmatic
cunning, of which we are sorely in need, to be our greatest asset, and with a
smile born of this cunning we are wont to console ourselves for all our woes
even if—but it never happens—we were once to yearn for the kind of happiness
such as music might provide. Josephine is the sole exception, she loves music
and also knows how to give voice to it; she is the only one, and with her
demise music will disappear—for who knows how long—from our lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I have often
wondered what this music of hers truly means—after all, we are entirely
unmusical, so how is it that we understand Josephine’s singing or, since
Josephine denies that, at least believe we understand it? The simplest answer
would be that the beauty of her song is so great that even the dullest ear
cannot help being touched, but this is not a satisfying answer. If this were
really so, her singing would necessarily give one the immediate and lasting
impression of something extraordinary, the feeling that something is pouring
forth from this throat that we had never heard before, something we did not
even have the capacity to hear, something that this Josephine alone and no one
else could enable us to hear. But this, in my opinion, is precisely what does
not happen; I do not feel it, nor have I observed that others feel it. Among
our circle we freely admit that Josephine’s song, as song, is nothing out of
the ordinary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Is this in fact
singing at all? Despite our lack of musicality, we do have a tradition of
singing, for our people sang in ancient times; this is spoken of in legends,
and some songs have survived, although it is also true that now no one can sing
them. So we do have some ideas about what singing is, and Josephine’s art does
not correspond to these ideas. Then is it really singing? Isn’t it perhaps
merely piping?</span><span class=7Text><span lang=EN style='font-size:9.0pt'>16</span></span><span
lang=EN> Piping is something we all know about; it is the true artistic forte
of our people or, rather than our forte, more a characteristic expression of
life. We all pipe, but of course no one dreams of presenting this as an art
form; we pay no attention to our piping or even notice it, and there are many
among us who are quite unaware that piping is one of our characteristics. So if
it were true that Josephine does not sing but only pipes and may not, as it
seems to me at least, even rise above the level of our usual piping—and may not
even have the stamina required for this usual piping, whereas a common
fieldhand can effortlessly pipe all day long while hard at work—so if it were
all true, Josephine’s supposed artistry would certainly be refuted, but that
would open up the larger riddle of the enormous influence she has.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>However, it is not
just piping that she produces. If you position yourself quite far away from her
or, better yet, put yourself through the following test—say, Josephine were
singing along with others and you tried to pick out just her voice—you will
undoubtedly identify nothing more than rather ordinary piping, distinguishing itself,
if at all, by its fragility or weakness. Yet if you are directly before her, it
is no mere piping. For a full understanding of her art it is necessary to see
her as well as hear her. Even if this were only our everyday piping, a certain
peculiarity must be considered: Here is someone creating a solemn spectacle of
the everyday. It is truly no feat to crack a nut, and therefore no one would
think to gather an audience for the purpose of entertaining them with
nutcracking. But if he should do so, and if he should succeed in his aim, then
it cannot be a matter of mere nutcracking. Or alternatively, it is a matter of
nutcracking, but as it turns out we have overlooked the art of nutcracking
because we were so proficient at it that it is this new nutcracker who is the
first to demonstrate what it actually entails, whereby it could be even more
effective if he were less expert in nutcracking than the majority of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Perhaps it is much
the same with Josephine’s singing: We admire in her what in ourselves we do not
admire in the least. In this last respect, I must say, she agrees with us
wholeheartedly. I was once present when someone, as often happens of course,
called attention to the ubiquitous folk piping; it was the most passing
reference, but it was more than enough for Josephine. I have never seen a smile
so sarcastic and so arrogant as the one she then displayed; she, who is the
very embodiment of delicacy—uncommonly so among a people rich in such feminine
ideals—seemed positively vulgar at that moment; she must have realized this at
once, owing to her great sensitivity, and controlled herself. In any event, she
denies any connection between her own art and piping. For anyone of the
opposite opinion, she has only contempt and, most likely, unacknowledged hatred.
Nor is this simple vanity; for the opposition, to which I myself partly
subscribe, certainly admires her no less than the rest of the crowd, but
Josephine does not desire mere admiration, she wants to be admired in precisely
the manner she dictates; mere admiration is of no merit to her. And seated
before her, one understands her: Opposition is only possible from a distance;
seated before her one knows: This piping of hers is not piping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since piping is one
of our unconscious habits, one might suppose that there would be some piping
from Josephine’s audience as well. We are made happy by her art, and when we
are happy we pipe. But her audience does not pipe, we are as quiet as mice, as
if we were partaking of the peace we long for, and this somewhat restrains us
from our own piping, we keep silent. Is it her singing that enchants us, or
isn’t it rather the solemn stillness that envelops that tiny frail voice? Once
while Josephine was singing, some foolish young thing also began, in all
innocence, to pipe. Now it was just the same as what we were hearing from
Josephine; out in front of us was this piping that was still tremulous despite
all the practice, and here in the audience was this unselfconscious infantile
piping. It would have been impossible to define the difference, but we at once
hissed and whistled to quiet the troublemaker, although this wasn’t really
necessary for she would surely have crept away in fear and shame; meanwhile
Josephine, quite beside herself, sounded her most triumphal piping with her
arms outflung and her neck thrown back as far as she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But she is always
like that; every little thing, every chance incident, every nuisance—a
floorboard creaking, teeth grinding, or a lamp flickering—she considers cause
to heighten the effect of her song. In her opinion her singing falls on deaf
ears anyway; there is no lack of enthusiasm and applause, but she has long
since given up hope of genuine understanding as she conceives it. In this way
every disturbance is more than welcome to her; any external influence
conflicting with the purity of her song that can be defeated easily, or
defeated without struggle but by confrontation alone, can help to raise the
awareness of the crowd and teach it, if not understanding, at least awed
respect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And if small events
serve her so well, great ones serve her even better. We lead very uneasy lives;
each day brings its surprises, anxieties, hopes, and fears; it would be
impossible for any individual to bear it all without the constant support of
his comrades. But it often becomes difficult anyway; sometimes a thousand
shoulders quake under a burden meant just for one. It is then that Josephine
believes her moment has come. There she stands, the delicate creature, racked
with frightful trembling especially beneath the breast; it is as though she has
focused all her strength in her singing; as though everything in her that does
not directly serve her song, every power, nearly every means of sustenance, has
been stripped away; as though she were laid bare, abandoned, entrusted to the
care of kind spirits; as though, while she is so absorbed and entirely given
over to her song, a single cold breath passing over her might kill her. But it
is precisely when she makes just such an appearance that we, her alleged detractors,
tend to remark: “She can’t even pipe. See how she strains herself horribly to
force out, not song—let’s not even speak about song—but a mere approximation of
our customary piping.” So it seems to us; however, as I already mentioned, this
impression is an inevitable yet fleeting one that quickly fades. Soon we too
are submerged in the feeling of the audience, which listens, body pressed
warmly to body, with reverently held breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And in order to
gather a crowd of our people around her—a people almost constantly on the move,
scurrying here and there for reasons that are frequently unclear—Josephine
mostly needs to do no more than adopt her stance: head thrown back, mouth
partially opened, and eyes turned heavenward, to indicate that she intends to sing.
She can do this where she pleases; it need not be a place visible from very far
away—any secluded corner chosen on the spur of the moment will serve just as
well. The news that she is going to sing spreads immediately, and whole
processions are soon on their way. Now sometimes obstacles do intervene.
Josephine prefers to sing in turbulent times, and then a slew of anxieties and
dangers force us to travel by devious routes, and even with the best intentions
in the world we cannot assemble as quickly as Josephine would like; she
occasionally stands there, striking her imperious pose, for quite some time
without a sufficient audience—then she flies into a rage, stamps her feet, and
swears in a most unmaidenly fashion; she actually even bites. But even this
type of behavior cannot damage her reputation. Instead of trying to moderate
her excessive demands, people go out of their way to meet them: Messengers are
dispatched to gather new listeners but she is kept ignorant of this practice;
along all the routes, sentries can be seen waving on the newcomers and urging
them to hurry. This continues until enough of an audience is gathered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>What drives the
people to exert themselves to such an extent on Josephine’s behalf? This
question is no easier to answer than the one about her singing, with which it
is closely connected. If it were possible to assert that the people are
unconditionally devoted to Josephine on account of her singing, then one could
cancel out the first question and combine it with the second. This, however, is
emphatically not the case; unconditional devotion is rarely found among us; our
people—who above all else love cunning, of a harmless nature of course, and who
childishly whisper and idly chatter over innocent gossip—are a people who
cannot buy into unconditional devotion. Josephine feels this as well, and it is
against this that she fights with all the force in her feeble throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It would certainly
be a mistake to take these broad generalizations too far, however; our people
are indeed devoted to Josephine, just not unconditionally. We would never be
capable, for example, of laughing at Josephine. It can be said that there are
many things about Josephine that invite laughter, and we are always close to
laughing for laughing’s sake. Despite the misery of our lives, a quiet laugh is
always close at hand, as it were, but we do not laugh at Josephine. I am
sometimes under the impression that our people see their relationship with
Josephine this way: that this fragile creature in need of protection and
somehow worthy of distinction (in her own opinion worthy of distinction because
of her song) is entrusted to their care and must be looked after. The reason
for this is not clear to anyone; it seems only to be an established fact. But
one does not laugh at what is entrusted to one’s care; to laugh would be a
breach of duty. The utmost spite that the most malicious of us is capable of
directing at Josephine is to occasionally say: “We stop laughing when we see
Josephine.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So the people look
after Josephine in the same way that a father assumes the care of a child whose
hand—whether in appeal or command one cannot tell—is stretched out to him. One
might not think that our people are equipped to fulfill these paternal duties,
but in reality we do perform them, at least in this case, in an exemplary
manner; no one individual could do what in this respect the people as a whole
are able to do. To be sure, the disparity in strength between the people and
any individual is so great that the charge need only be drawn into the warmth
of their presence and he will be protected enough. Certainly no one dares to
mention such things to Josephine. “I pipe at your protection,” she says then.
“Yes, you pipe, don’t you,” we think. Besides, she is not seriously refuting us
when she rebels like this—rather it is childish behavior and childish
gratitude—and it is a father’s place to pay no attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And yet something
more is going on here that is less easily explained by the relationship between
the people and Josephine; namely, Josephine is of a different opinion: It is
her belief that it is she who protects the people. When we are facing trouble,
be it political or economic, it is her song that supposedly saves us, nothing
short of that; and if it does not drive out the misfortune, it at least gives
us the strength to bear it. She does not express it in these words or in any
other words; as a matter of fact she never says much at all, she is silent amid
the chatter-boxes, but it flashes from her eyes, and from her clamped mouth
(there are not many among us who can keep their mouths closed—she can) it is
clearly decipherable. Whenever we get bad news—and many days we get hit with it
thick and fast, lies and half-truths included—she rises at once, whereas
usually she’s sunk wearily on the floor, she rises and cranes her neck to look
out over her flock like a shepherd before a storm. Of course children do make
similar claims in their wild, impulsive fashion, but Josephine’s claim is not
quite so groundless as theirs. She certainly does not save us, nor does she
give us strength; it is easy to pose as the savior of a people who are inured
to suffering, unsparing of themselves, swift in decisions, well acquainted with
death, timid in appearance only as they must dwell in an atmosphere of constant
and reckless danger, and who in any case are as prolific as they are brave; it
is easy, as I say, to hold oneself up as the savior of this people who have
somehow always saved themselves at the cost, however, of many sacrifices the
likes of which strike historians—generally we ignore historical research
completely—cold with horror. And yet it is true that during times of emergency
we cling closer to Josephine’s voice than at any other time. The threats
hanging over us make us quieter, more humble, more compliant to Josephine’s
commands; we are happy to gather together, happy to huddle close to one
another, especially because it is an occasion so far removed from the
preoccupying torment; it is as if in all haste—yes, haste is necessary, as Josephine
is all too likely to forget—we were drinking a communal cup of peace before
battle. It is not so much a song recital as a public gathering, and moreover a
gathering that is completely silent except for the faint piping up front; the
hour is too serious for us to spend it chatting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Josephine, of
course, could never be content with a relationship of this kind. Despite all
the nervous tension that overtakes her because her position has never been
clearly defined, there is much that she does not see, blinded as she is by
self-conceit, and she can be made to overlook a great deal more without much
effort; a swarm of flatterers is always hovering about her working toward this
end, in effect performing a public service—however, to be an incidental and
unnoticed singer in the corner of a public gathering (although it would be no
small thing in and of itself), for that she certainly would not sacrifice her
song.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nor is she obliged
to do this, for her art does not go unnoticed. Even though we basically concern
ourselves with quite other matters, and the silence that prevails is not due to
her singing alone (some listeners do not look up at all but bury their faces in
their neighbors’ fur, so Josephine seems to be exerting herself in vain out
there in front), something from her piping—this cannot be denied—inevitably
does come through to us. This piping, which rises up when silence is imposed on
all others, emerges almost like a message from the people to each individual;
Josephine’s thin piping amid grave decisions is almost like our meager
existence amid the tumult of a hostile world. Josephine asserts herself; this
mere nothing of a voice, this mere nothing of a performance, asserts itself and
makes its way through to us; it does us good to think of that. At such moments
we could never endure a true singer, should one ever be found among us, and we
would unanimously reject any such performance as absurd. May Josephine be
spared from perceiving that the very fact we listen to her is proof that she is
no singer. She must have some suspicion of this—why else would she so
passionately deny that we do listen to her—but she keeps singing and piping
away her suspicion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But she could draw
comfort from other things: We really do listen to her to some extent, probably
in much the same way one listens to a true singer; she manages to affect us in
ways that a true singer would strive in vain to bring about, ways that produce
their effect in us precisely because her means are so inadequate. The manner in
which we lead our lives is no doubt responsible for this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Youth does not
exist among our people, and childhood only lasts a moment. Demands are
regularly made to guarantee the children special freedom and protection, to
grant them their right to be a little carefree, to engage in a little
lighthearted foolishness, a little play, and to ensure that these rights be
acknowledged and steps taken to secure them. Such demands are made and nearly
everyone approves them; there is nothing one could approve of more, but there
is also nothing less likely to be conceded given the reality of our daily
lives; one approves of these demands and one attempts to implement them; but we
soon lapse back into the old ways. To be frank, our life is such that as soon
as a child can run around a bit and distinguish his surroundings a little, he
must likewise look after himself like an adult. The regions over which we are
dispersed and in which we are forced to live, for economic reasons, are too
vast, our enemies too numerous, the dangers facing us everywhere too
incalculable—we cannot shield the children from the struggle for existence; if
we did, it would mean a premature end for them. These depressing facts are
further reinforced by another more uplifting one: the fertility of our race.
One generation—and each is numerous—comes on the heels of the preceding one;
the children don’t have time to be children. Other peoples may raise their
children with great care; they may erect schools for their little ones and from
these schools the children, the future of the race, may come streaming out
every day; but among those peoples, it is the same children who come pouring
out like that day after day, over a long period of time. We have no schools,
but bounding forth from our people are the continuous swarms of our children
arriving at the briefest intervals, cheerfully peeping or chirping for as long
as they can’t yet pipe, rolling along or forced forward in the tumult for as
long as they can’t yet run, clumsily sweeping everything before them by their
sheer mass for as long as they can’t yet see—our children! And not the same
children as in those schools—no, always new ones, again and again, without end,
without pause. Hardly does a child appear than it is no longer a child; new
childish faces are already pressing through, so many and so fast that they are
indistinguishable, all rosy with happiness. Truthfully, however delightful this
may be and however much others may envy us for it, and rightly so, we simply
cannot give our children a proper childhood. And that has its consequences. A
certain deeply rooted and indelible childishness pervades our people; we
sometimes behave with the utmost foolishness in direct opposition to our best
quality, our infallible common sense; this brand of foolishness is the same as
that of children—a senseless, extravagant, grandiose, frivolous foolishness,
and often all for the sake of a little fun. And although our pleasure naturally
cannot be the wholehearted pleasure of a child, without a doubt there is still
something of this in it. Josephine has also profited from our people’s
childishness since the beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But our people are
not only childish, we are also in a sense prematurely old; childhood and age
come to us differently than to others. We have no youth, we are grown up all at
once and then stay grown up for too long; a certain weariness and hopelessness
marks the nature of our people, though we are fundamentally tough and
confident. Our lack of musicality is probably connected to this—we’re too old
for music; exultation does not suit our gravity, we wave it away wearily; we
content ourselves with piping, a little piping here and there, that suits us
fine. Who knows, there may be some musical talent among us; however, if there
were, the character of our people would suppress it before it could develop.
Josephine, on the other hand, can pipe to her heart’s delight or sing or
whatever she wants to call it; that doesn’t bother us, that’s fine by us, that
we can put up with; if there is anything musical contained within, it is so
reduced as to be barely traceable; a certain musical tradition is preserved but
without having to be the least burden to us.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos414201></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But our people,
given what they are, still get something more from Josephine. At her concerts,
especially in troubled times, only the very young are interested in the singer
as such, only they gaze in astonishment as she purses her lips, expels the air
between her dainty front teeth, swoons in admiration and wonder for the sounds
she herself is producing, and uses this lowered position to propel herself to
fresh peaks of achievement that are continually incredible to her. Meanwhile,
the majority of the audience—this is plain to see—has retreated into itself.
Here in these brief gaps between their troubles our people dream; it is as if
the limbs of each were loosened, as if every last uneasy individual were for
once allowed to stretch out and relax freely in the great warm bed of the
people. And into these dreams drops Josephine’s piping, bit by bit; she calls
it purled,<a href="#filepos480858"><span class=2Text><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>q</span></span></a> we call it
forced; but at any rate here it is in its rightful place, as nowhere else,
finding just the moment that awaited it, as music hardly ever does otherwise.
Something of our meager and foreshortened childhood is in it, something of a
lost and irretrievable happiness, but also something of our active everyday
life, these incomprehensible but actual moments of gaiety that cannot be
suppressed. This is all expressed not in large and imposing tones, but softly,
breathlessly, confidentially, and sometimes a little hoarsely. Of course it is
piping. How could it not be? Piping is the vernacular of our people; only many
pipe their whole lives long without knowing it, while here piping is free from
the fetters of everyday life, and so it also sets us free for a short time. We
would certainly not want to relinquish these performances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But it is a very
long way from there to Josephine’s assertion that she renews our strength
during such times and so on and so forth; at least it is for ordinary people,
even if it is not for Jose phine’s flatterers. “What other explanation could
there be,” they say with rather shameless audacity. “How else could you explain
the huge crowds, especially when there is imminent danger and when these crowds
have sometimes even hindered our taking proper precautions to avert the danger
in time.” Now this last point is unfortunately true but can hardly be counted
among Josephine’s claims to fame, particularly if one adds that when such gatherings
have been unexpectedly ambushed by the enemy and many of our people have lain
dead as a result, Josephine, who is entirely to blame and most likely attracted
the enemy by her piping, invariably occupies the safest position and is the
first to be whisked quickly and quietly away under cover of her escort.
Everyone is well aware of this, yet they come running to whatever spot
Josephine arbitrarily decides upon to strike up her singing and whenever she so
pleases. From this one might conclude that Josephine almost stands beyond the
law, that she may do whatever she likes even if it endangers the community, and
that she will be forgiven everything. If this were so, then even Josephine’s
claims would be comprehensible; yes, in the freedom allowed to her, a privilege
granted by the people to no one else and in actual contravention of our laws,
one might detect an admission of the fact that our people—just as she
alleges—do not understand Josephine, that they gape helplessly at her art, feel
unworthy of it, and try to assuage the pain they must cause her by making a
desperate sacrifice: to place her person and her wishes as far outside their
jurisdiction as her art is beyond their comprehension. Well, this is just
categorically untrue; perhaps the people individually capitulate to Josephine
too readily, but collectively they capitulate unconditionally to no one, and so
not to her either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For a long time
now, perhaps since the very start of her artistic career, Josephine has been
fighting to be excused from all work on account of her singing; she should be
relieved from the burden of earning her daily bread and anything else involved
in the struggle for existence, and the slack should, presumably, be taken up by
the people as a whole. A hasty enthusiast—and there have been some—might
conclude that this demand is inherently justified, owing to its strangeness and
the mental state needed to conceive it. But our people draw other conclusions
and quietly refuse her. Nor do they bother much to refute the arguments on which
it is based. Josephine argues, for example, that the strain of work is bad for
her voice, that the strain of work cannot, needless to say, remotely compare to
the strain of singing, but it does render it impossible to rest sufficiently
after singing and recuperate for further singing, so she must exhaust herself
entirely and within these confines never perform at her peak. The people listen
to her arguments and pay no attention. This people, so easily moved, will
sometimes not be moved at all. Their refusal is sometimes so severe that
Josephine is taken aback; she appears to comply, does her proper share of work,
and sings as well as she can, but this only lasts awhile. Then with renewed
strength—her strength for this purpose seems inexhaustible—she takes up the
fight again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Now it is clear
that what Josephine is really aiming for is not literally what she demands. She
is reasonable, she does not shy from work—shirking is quite unknown among us
anyway—and even if her petition were granted, her life would go on as before;
her work would not impede her singing, nor would her singing improve; what she
is aiming for is an unambiguous public recognition of her art that would last
forever and far surpass any known precedent. But while everything else seems to
be within her grasp, this persistently eludes her. Perhaps she should have
taken a different tack from the beginning, perhaps she understands her mistake
by now, but she cannot back down; any retreat would be tantamount to
self-betrayal; now she must stand or fall by her demand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If, as she
contends, she truly had enemies, they could be greatly amused, without having
to lift a finger, by the spectacle of this battle. But she has no enemies, and
even if she does meet with criticism here and there, no one is amused by this
battle of hers for the mere fact that in this circumstance the people exhibit a
cold, judicial manner that is rarely seen otherwise. And even if one approves
of it in this case, the mere thought that such an attitude might be adopted
toward oneself dispels any pleasure. What is important here is not the people’s
refusal of Josephine’s demand or the demand itself but the fact that the people
are capable of presenting such a stony, impenetrable front to one of their own,
and it is all the more impenetrable because this particular citizen is in every
other sense treated with fatherly—actually more than fatherly—with deferential
concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Imagine that
instead of an entire people there were one individual: One might suppose that
this man had been giving in to Josephine but at the same time desperately
wishing to put an end to all this indulgence; that he had been superhuman in
the concessions he granted, firm in the belief that there would be a natural
limit to them; yes, that he had conceded more than was necessary for the sole
purpose of hastening the process, to spoil Josephine and push her to ask for
more and more until she did reach this ultimate demand, at which point he
could, being prepared well in advance, reply with a final, curt refusal. Now this
is absolutely not how things stand, the people have no need of such guile;
besides, their admiration of Josephine is sincere and deeply rooted, and
Josephine’s demand is so outrageous that any simple child could have told her
the foreseeable outcome. However, it may be that considerations such as these
do enter into Josephine’s thinking on the matter and so add a further sting of
bitterness to the pain of refusal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But even if she
does entertain these ideas, she does not allow them to deter her from her campaign.
Recently the campaign has even been intensified; where she once fought with
words alone, she is resorting to other methods that she thinks will prove more
effective but in our opinion will be more dangerous for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Some feel that
Josephine is becoming so desperate because she feels she is growing old and her
voice is weakening, and so it seems high time to wage the final battle for
recognition. I don’t believe it. If it were true, Josephine would not be
Josephine. For her, there is no getting old, no weakness in her voice. If she
demands something, it is not due to outward forces but to an inner logic. She
reaches for the highest laurels, not because they are hanging slightly lower
for a moment but because they are the highest; if it were in her power she
would hang them higher still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This disregard of
external difficulties certainly does not prevent her from employing the most
unworthy methods. She feels her rights are beyond question, so that how she
secures them does not matter, especially in this world where, as she sees it,
it is the worthy methods that fail. Perhaps this is why she has transferred the
fight for her rights from the arena of song to another that she cares very
little about. Supporters have passed around statements of hers to the effect
that she feels thoroughly capable of singing at such a level that every strata
of the people, even the furthest reaches of the opposition, would find true
pleasure in it—a true pleasure not by popular standards, for the people
maintain they have always found pleasure in her singing, but a true pleasure by
Josephine’s standards. But, she adds, since she can neither falsify higher
standards nor pander to lower ones, her singing must stay as it is. Yet when it
comes to the fight to be freed from work, that is another matter; it is also,
of course, on behalf of her singing; however, in this case she is not using the
precious weapon of song directly, therefore any means she employs is good
enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So, for example, a
rumor spread that if her petition were not granted, Josephine intended to
shorten her trill notes. I know nothing of trill notes and have never noticed
any sign of them in her singing, but Josephine is going to shorten her trill
notes; for the time being she is not going to eliminate them, just shorten
them. She has purportedly carried out her threat, although I, for one, have
perceived no difference in her performance. The people as a whole listened as
always without commenting on the trill notes and did not budge an inch in
response to her demand. Incidentally, it is undeniable that Josephine’s
thoughts can sometimes be as pleasing as her figure; for instance, after that
performance, as if her decision with regard to the trill notes had been too
harsh and too sudden a blow to the people, she announced that the next time she
would again sing the trill notes in their complete form. But after the next
concert she changed her tune once more: there was definitely to be an end to
the elongated trills and they would not recur until a favorable decision on her
petition was reached. Well, the people let all these announcements, decisions,
and counterdecisions go in one ear and out the other, much like a preoccupied
adult with the chattering of a child: well disposed at heart but unmoved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Josephine does not
give up. She recently claimed, for example, that she injured her foot while
working, so that it was difficult to stand and sing, and since she can only
sing while standing, her songs would now have to be cut short. Although she
limps and leans on her group of supporters, no one believes she is really
injured. Even allowing for her exceptionally sensitive constitution, we are a
working people and Josephine is one of us; if we were to start limping at every
little scratch, the entire population would never stop limping. But although
she may permit herself to be led around like a cripple, although she may
display herself in this pathetic condition more often than usual, the people
still listen gratefully and appreciatively to her singing just as before and don’t
bother much about the abridgment of the songs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since she cannot
continue limping forever, she invents something else: She pleads exhaustion,
disaffection, faintness. And so now we get a theatrical performance as well as
a concert. Behind Josephine we see her supporters entreating and imploring her
to sing. She would be happy to oblige, but she cannot. They comfort her and
caress her with flattery, they practically carry her to a previously chosen
spot where she is supposed to sing. Finally, bursting inexplicably into tears,
she relents, but when she prepares to sing, clearly at the end of her tether,
drooping, her arms not outspread as usual but hanging limply at her sides,
giving the impression that they are perhaps somewhat too short—as she prepares to
strike a note, no, it’s no use after all; a reluctant shake of the head tells
us as much and she swoons before our eyes. Then she does indeed rally again and
sings, much the same as ever in my opinion; perhaps a more discerning ear might
detect a slight increase in feeling that does, however, heighten the effect.
And in the end she is actually less tired than before and departs with a firm
tread, if such a term can be used to describe her rapid, mincing steps,
refusing all assistance from her supporters, her cold eyes measuring the crowd,
who respectfully make way for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>That was just a few
days ago. But the latest news is that she has disappeared, just at a time when
she was expected to sing. It is not only her supporters who are looking for
her, many others have devoted themselves to the search, but all in vain;
Josephine has vanished, she does not wish to sing, she does not wish to be
invited to sing; she has deserted us for good this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It is curious how
seriously she miscalculates, the clever creature, so seriously that one must
believe that she did not calculate at all but is only being driven onward by
her fate, which can only be a sad one in our world. She abandons her singing of
her own accord and of her own accord destroys the power she has gained over our
hearts. How could she ever have acquired that power when she knows so little of
our hearts? She hides herself away and does not sing. In the meantime our
people—calmly, without visible disappointment, a proud, self-sufficient people,
who in all truth and despite appearances can only bestow gifts, never receive
them, even from Josephine—our people continue on their way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Josephine’s
path can go nowhere except down. Soon the time will come when her last note
sounds and fades into silence. She is a small episode in the eternal history of
our people, and the people will overcome their loss. This will not be easy for
us though; how can we gather together in utter silence? And yet, weren’t we
silent even when Josephine was present? Was her actual piping significantly
louder and more lively than the memory of it will be? Was it ever more than
simply a memory, even during her lifetime? Had not the people rather, in their
wisdom, so dearly cherished Josephine’s song precisely so that in this way it
would not be lost?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So perhaps we shall
not miss very much after all. While Josephine, delivered from earthly
torment—in her opinion the privilege of chosen spirits—will happily lose
herself in the countless number of our people’s heroes, and soon, since we are
not students of history, will be even further delivered by being forgotten like
all her brothers.</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>BEFORE THE LAW STANDS a doorkeeper. A man from
the country comes to this doorkeeper and asks to be admitted to the Law. But
the doorkeeper informs him that he cannot grant him admittance at this time.
The man ponders this and then asks whether he will be admitted at some point in
the future. “It is possible,” says the doorkeeper, “but not at present.”
Because the gate stands open—as always—and the doorkeeper steps aside, the man
stoops down to look through the gateway to the interior. On seeing this, the
doorkeeper laughs and remarks: “If it’s so enticing, then just try going in
despite my interdiction. But take note: I am powerful. And I am only the
lowliest doorkeeper. In hall after hall stand other doorkeepers, each more
powerful than the last. The mere sight of the third doorkeeper is more than
even I can endure.” The man from the country never anticipated such
difficulties. The Law, he thinks, should be accessible at all times and to
everyone, but when he now takes a closer look at the doorkeeper in his fur
coat, with his large, pointed nose and his long, skinny, black Tartar beard, he
decides that he had better wait for permission to enter after all. The
doorkeeper gives him a stool and allows him to set it to one side of the door.
There he sits for days and years. He makes many attempts to be admitted and exhausts
the doorkeeper with his pleas. The doorkeeper often conducts little interviews
with him, asking him about his home and many other things, but the questions
are put indifferently, much as highranking officials would put them, and he
always concludes by repeating that he cannot yet admit him. The man, who came
well equipped for his journey, uses everything he has, however valuable, for
the purpose of bribing the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts everything but
says as he does so: “I’m only accepting this so you won’t think there’s
something you haven’t tried.” Throughout the many years he observes the
doorkeeper fixedly with almost no interruption. He forgets the other
doorkeepers and this first one seems to him the sole obstacle between himself
and the Law. He curses his miserable fate, loudly and recklessly in the early
years, but later, as he grows old, he just grumbles to himself. He becomes
childish, and since he has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper’s fur
collar during the long years of studying him, he begs the fleas to help him and
to help win the doorkeeper over to his side. Eventually his eyesight begins to
fail, and he does not know whether his eyes deceive him or whether it is really
growing darker around him. But through the gloom he can now definitely make out
a radiance that pours unendingly from the doorway of the Law. Now he no longer
has much time to live. Before his death, all the experiences of these long
years come together in his head to form one question that he has not yet put to
the doorkeeper. He beckons to him because he can no longer raise his cramped
and stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend down to him, since the
difference in their heights has changed drastically, much to the man’s
disadvantage. “So, what is it that you still want to know?” asks the
doorkeeper. “You are insatiable.” “Surely everyone strives to reach the Law,”
says the man, “so how is it that no one but me has ever begged for admittance?”
The doorkeeper recognizes that the man is near the end and, in order to
penetrate his failing senses, shouts: “No one else could ever be granted
admission here, as this gate was just for you. Now I am going to close it.”</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Translator’s Afterword</span></p>

<p class=Para05><span lang=EN>IT WOULD BE IDEAL if each of us could read all
the world’s literature in the language in which it was originally written.
Since that is not a realistic possibility, every reader, sooner or later, comes
to rely on the interpretive skills of a translator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Being an act of
interpretation, a translation is also an act of criticism. At any given point
several options are available and critical choices must be made. These choices
will obviously reflect the translator’s understanding not only of the text but
of the author’s intentions. What the translator sees or reads into the
text—bringing to bear all of his or her knowledge and experience—invariably
influences these decisions to some degree. But one hopes that the portion of
this understanding that might be called “biases” can be kept to a minimum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By nature, a
translator must be flexible and approach each work as a separate challenge,
although there are larger principles that guide translation in general. The
foremost of these is to stay true to the text. This entails adhering to the
author’s intentions, insofar as the translator can discern them, and being able
to view the text as a distinct entity while not losing sight of the context in
which it was written. The translator must decide how best to serve the not
always compatible demands of the author, the reader, and the text. He or she
must choose what to stress and what to sacrifice; some authors are noted for
their particular use of language—Henry James and Ernest Hemingway come to mind;
some are known more for the content of their work, the historical moment that
they chronicle—Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Harriet Beecher Stowe might be
examples; and some, like Jorge Luis Borges and Franz Kafka, for creating a new
kind of story altogether—familiar yet strange, rich in its specifics yet
timeless in its reach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There is always compromise
in translation because every language affords different possibilities and
imposes unique limitations. Still other problems arise when dealing with texts
that were written long ago or in circumstances alien or unfamiliar to the
contemporary reader or translator. If one completely modernizes a text, one
risks losing the delicious essentials of time and place; if one adheres
strictly to the language and knowledge of an earlier time, one may obscure the
reader’s access to the timeless appeal of the original work. Although great
literature often outlives its author, it is written at a specific time and in a
specific place, and this must be taken into consideration when translating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The stories of
Franz Kafka largely address the human condition and are therefore timeless, but
Kafka was also a German-speaking Jew in early twentieth-century Prague. One way
that I have attempted, in this translation, to make his work accessible to the
modern reader is to update his language, particularly in the dialogue, where
modern idiom and phrasing have been employed with some regularity. On the other
hand I’ve also maintained some of the vocabulary of the time in which Kafka
lived. For example, the furniture, money, and clothing of his time and place
are very different from those of ours, as are the words used to signify them.
Using the English equivalents for the original European terms for these things,
rather than convert them into their modern, American incarnations, helps to
establish the actual historical time and setting in which the events take place
and thus allows the reader to savor the ambience of the original instead of
merely surveying its outlines. In this case it seems to me that this is an
aspect of these texts that the reader need not and ought not be excluded from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This translation
attempts to present the stories of Franz Kafka in as readable a version as
possible and in much the same way as they would be read and understood by the
German reader. The singular situations Kafka’s characters find themselves in,
the turns these situations take—at times uncanny, at times all too
frighteningly routine—the sensation of being pressed to the existential brink
without knowing how one got there (or whether one will be permitted to return)
all have far more immediate impact than his diction. His language is, in fact,
quite simple and straightforward; it is his verbal structure that is often
complex. This is due, in part, to the structure of the German language, which
builds sentences—often of astounding length—in modular units. Kafka did make
diligent and sometimes amusing—and subversive—use of this aspect of his native
tongue. But some of the older English translations have become mired in those
structural complexities. As a result, the stories have been made less available
to the reader than they might otherwise have been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In an effort to
cope with such difficulties, a proclivity has developed in contemporary
American translation for rendering the original text as it might have been
constructed if written by a contemporary American. Toward that end, modern
idioms and rhythms are introduced. Sentence lengths and even paragraphs are
restructured to embrace the American ear. Translators who employ this style
feel this is the best way to bring the original across and keep it fresh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For the most
part—except where it would interfere with the reader’s full understanding of
the text—I have maintained Kafka’s sentence length and paragraph structure in
this translation, as I feel that both are strategic elements of his writing style.
At the same time I have tried to alleviate those difficulties within his
sentence structure that arise merely because normal German and English word
order are substantially different. I didn’t find it necessary to sacrifice the
rhythm and length of Kafka’s sentences for the sake of clarity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Once the structural
dilemmas have been resolved in English, the stories speak for themselves, but
when Kafka does use a particular storytelling device I have tried to
incorporate it into the English translation. In “The Metamorphosis,” for
example, Kafka first—and almost continually thereafter—refers to Gregor’s
parents and sister as “the mother,” “the father,” and “the sister.” Other
translators have employed personal pronouns here (i.e., “his mother,” etc.),
probably because it seemed less formal and awkward in English. But it is
awkward in the German text, and meant to be. It is an intentional device,
serving to make immediately apparent Gregor’s alienation from his family. And
it soon comes to seem—under Kafka’s skillful guidance—appropriate. At one point
later in the story, however, it is “his father” who kicks Gregor into the room;
this usage is also intentional and is introduced because Gregor had previously
seen his father as pathetic—it was due to his father’s business failure that
Gregor had to work as a traveling salesman—and his own father is now the very
personal cause of his being banished from the family instead of their helping
him, something he could not feel impersonal about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Similarly, it is
the abrupt switch to the present tense that catapults the story “A Country
Doctor” forward. From the moment when the groom attacks the maid, the doctor is
uncontrollably propelled through the story in the present tense, until he
attempts to take matters into his own hands and leaves the patient’s house, at
which point the tense reverts to the past. While my first priority in this
translation has been to maintain clarity for the English reader, I felt it was
imperative not to lose sight—as many other translators of this story have—of an
author’s device that is there for the purpose of enhancing the narrative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There are also
moments when Kafka seems so caught up in the narrative drive of a story that
some of its continuity gets lost. In “The Stoker,” the maid that Karl
impregnates is later referred to as the cook. This may have been an oversight
that Kafka would have corrected in future revisions (he planned to include “The
Stoker” as the first chapter in a novel he did not complete, posthumously
published under the title <span class=0Text>Amerika</span>), but this
translation remains faithful to the text. I have not corrected these lapses or
reconciled such minor inconsistencies, as they may be of interest to the
reader. They are, however, footnoted in the text itself.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><a name=filepos443492></a><span lang=EN><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Despite the common
conception of Kafka as a spurt writer periodically driven by the white heat of
inspiration—perhaps the result of the well-known anecdote of Kafka’s writing
his breakthrough story “The Judgment” in one all-night session in 1912—it would
seem that he worked and reworked his stories and, in some cases, held a clear
picture of what he planned to write well in advance of the first draft. In 1906
he wrote a story about a man who splits into an insect and a man, the insect
self going off to work and the man staying home in bed.<a href="#filepos481352"><span
class=2Text><span style='font-size:9.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>s</span></span></a> This precursor to “The Metamorphosis” was never
published. He also wrote in a letter to his friend and publisher Kurt Wolff
that he wished to include “The Judgment,” “The Stoker,” and “The Metamorphosis”
in one volume under the title <span class=0Text>The Sons</span>. This letter is
dated April 4, 1913—well before he had written either “The Stoker” or “The
Metamorphosis.” For whatever reasons, the stories were never published together
under that title while Kafka was alive. Kafka’s wish that these three stories
be published together has in part formed the basis of this collection. All of
the stories included, of course, have become classics, but it has been a
special pleasure for me that by including “Josephine the Singer” along with
“The Judgment,” this collection contains both the last and the first stories
that Kafka saw published in his lifetime.</span></p>

(p. 7) <span class=0Text>held out to the viewer</span>: Mark Anderson points
out the similarity between Kafka’s description of this picture, Gregor’s one
treasured object, and the figure of Venus in Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s 1870
novel <span class=0Text>Venus in Furs</span> (Bloom, <span class=0Text>Franz
Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis</span>”). In that story, Venus’ slave Severin is
made to change his name to Gregor, which in Austria was a common name for a
manservant. Kafka’s Gregor comes into a more sex ualized contact with his
picture later in the story (p. 33).</span></p>

(p. 35) <span class=0Text>stood still and gathered everyone around him:</span>
This idea of vigor and vitality being obfuscated by affected frailty stems from
Kafka’s observation of his own father. In “Letter to His Father” (see <span
class=0Text>Dearest Father</span>) Kafka addresses Hermann Kafka: “Your nervous
condition . . . is a means by which you exert your domination more strongly,
since the thought of it necessarily chokes off the least opposition from
others.” The same type of attempt at intimidation occurs in “The Judgment” (p.
62).</span></p>

(p. 35) <span class=0Text>It was an apple</span>: Walter Sokel argues that “The

which can be seen as symbolizing the guilt of the original parents Adam and
Eve, not to mention Gregor’s own (Bloom, <span class=0Text>Franz Kafka’s “The
Metamorphosis</span>”). Thus the lobbed apples can represent death in both the
original and the causal senses; in this light, it is possible to see Gregor as
a Christlike figure.</span></p>

the only time Gregor is referred to as a particular species (<span class=0Text>Mistkäfer</span>),
albeit by a fairly unreliable source, the garrulous charwoman. Despite the
efforts of scholars like Nabokov, though an able lepidopterist, to pin Gregor
to a rigid realism, Kafka remains intentionally vague about Gregor’s physical
form. When “The Metamorphosis” was going to press, Kafka contacted his
publisher in Leipzig. Fearing that Ottomar Starke, the illustrator for the
first edition, would be tempted to render a metamorphosed Gregor on the title
page, Kafka wrote, “The insect itself cannot be depicted. It cannot even be
shown from a distance.”</span></p>

boarders possess the same characteristics and dispositions, how, in fact, they

doorkeepers in “Before the Law” and the mouse people in “Josephine the Singer.”</span></p>

(p. 50) <span class=0Text>three letters of excuse</span>: This kind of
frivolity never would have been tolerated in the days when Gregor was working.
Much of Gregor’s torture in the first section revolves around the prospect of
his missing work. On page 8 the text reads, “What if Gregor reported in sick?
This would be extremely painful and suspicious, as he had not once been ill
during his five-year employment.” In Gregor’s own words, his family members
have become “healthy but work-shy people.”</span></p>

(p. 62) <span class=0Text>the monstrous specter of his father</span>: This
reversal of physical strength mirrors Kafka’s own perception of himself and his
father. In “Letter to His Father” he writes: “I was, after all, weighed down by
your mere physical presence. I remember, for instance, how we often undressed
in the same bathing hut. There was I, skinny, weakly, slight; you strong, tall,
broad. Even inside the hut I felt a miserable specimen, and what’s more, not
only in your eyes but in the eyes of the whole world, for you were for me the

of Kafka’s “The Burrow” hears a piping or a sort of whistling in his burrow,
which he initially attributes to the “smaller fry,” among them “field mice.”
This sound grows louder, and eventually the narrator convinces himself that his
burrow will be invaded by something possibly larger—more powerful and

<p class=Para11><span lang=EN>In his struggle to escape the sweeping stretch of
his father’s domain, Franz Kafka cast his own inescapable shadow across the map
of literature. He has had an impact on the minds of writers as diverse as
Martin Buber, S. Y. Agnon, Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir
Nabokov, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, Albert Camus, Anatole Broyard, Paul
Celan, Philip Roth, and Paul Auster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Many writers have
engaged in an active dialogue with Kafka, adapting his writings and ideas to
suit their own perspectives. Bruno Schulz, a Polish Jew who was personally
acquainted with Kafka, shared many of the cultural experiences that shaped
Kafka’s life and worldview; he translated <span class=0Text>The Trial</span>
into Polish in 1936. Schulz’s own writing was greatly influenced by Kafka; in
his story “Father’s Last Escape” (1937), the narrator’s father is dead—in fact,
he has died a number of times. His “features” have dispersed, animating at
times the wallpaper, a fur coat, and ultimately the form of a crab. The father
scuttles around the apartment, not unlike Gregor Samsa in the latter’s vermin
form, terrorizing his surviving family members until the mother boils him and
serves him for dinner. Though jellified, the father manages to escape, never to
be seen again.</span></p>

<p class=Para20 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>South African novelist
and short-story writer Nadine Gordi mer, who in 1991 won the Nobel Prize for
literature, wrote a response to Kafka’s “Letter to His Father,” with her story
“Letter from His Father” (1984). The letter is written to Franz, now dead, by
his likewise deceased father. The tone is what one might expect from Hermann
Kafka—defiant, vigorous, belittling. Herr Kafka, penning his response from an
afterworld of some kind, closes with “I’ve outlived you here, same as in
Prague.”</span></p>

<p class=Para20 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Marc Estrin’s novel <span
class=0Text>Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa</span> (2002)
continues the tribulations of Gregor as if he had survived the end of “The
Metamorphosis.” In Estrin’s book, written with rollicking humor and a deft
juggling of historical accounts, the charwoman and the “three ex-boarders chez
Gregor” take the crate containing the man-sized beetle to the circus. As part
of the freak show, Gregor traces a path among the major cultural events of the
early twentieth century and acquaintances that include Austrian novelist Robert
Musil, best known for his unfinished work <span class=0Text>The Man without
Qualities</span> (3 vols., 1930-1943); Austrian philospher Ludwig Wittgenstein;
suffragist Alice Paul; U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife,
Eleanor; physicists Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein; and American
composer Charles Ives. In Estrin’s telling, Gregor is increasingly disenchanted
with the trajectory of history, and he becomes a Christlike figure hopelessly
dedicated to saving humanity from itself.</span></p>

<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>“Kafkaesque”</span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-style:normal'> </span></span></p>

<p class=Para11><span lang=EN>So ubiquitous is Kafka’s legacy that the word
“Kafkaesque” has been introduced into the English language. The adjective
refers to anything suggestive of Kafka, especially his nightmarish type of
narration, in which characters lack a clear course of action, the ability to
see beyond immediate events, and the possibility of escape. The term’s meaning
has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations
that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.</span></p>

<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>Film</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN
style='font-style:normal'> </span></span></p>

<p class=Para11><span lang=EN>The flavor of Kafka’s unending guilt has made its
way into the work of many movie directors. Alfred Hitchcock claimed that all
his films revolved around the innocent man wrongly accused. Both Woody Allen’s
famous insecurity and his complicated view toward his Jewishness echo Kafka’s
identity. Martin Scorsese’s <span class=0Text>After Hours</span> (1985)
explores a modern-day <span class=0Text>Trial</span> set in an absurdly comic
New York City. David Cronenberg gives a nod to “The Metamorphosis” in two of
his films: <span class=0Text>The Fly</span> (1986), his remake of the 1958
classic horror flick, and <span class=0Text>Naked Lunch</span> (1991), his
adaptation of William S. Burroughs’s 1959 novel. Steven Soder bergh’s <span
class=0Text>Kafka</span> (1991) centers around Kafka’s biography while
combining elements of <span class=0Text>The Trial</span>, <span class=0Text>The
Castle</span>, <span class=0Text>Amerika</span>, “The Metamorphosis,” “Wedding
Preparations in the Country,” and “Letter to His Father.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It is <span
class=0Text>The Trial</span> that has been translated into cinema most often.
In Orson Welles’s version (1963) the antihero, Joseph K., played by an
eccentric and jumpy Anthony Perkins, floats from situation to situation, each
more surrealistic than the last. Once the police invade his home, where he is
arrested but not charged, K. wanders a bleak, unreal landscape. Much of the
nightmarish quality derives from the film’s being shot with seamless continuity
in several countries. Particularly memorable is K.’s office, where rows of
desks, with workers clacking furiously at typewriters, sprawl into an endless
distance. Welles not only wrote the screenplay and directed but also played the
role of the Advocate to whom K. pleads for help. Because Kafka’s novel was left
unfinished and the intended order of its chapters is uncertain, Welles, with
characteristic ambition, rearranged the story when he wrote the screenplay. The
film’s experimental style—long shots, labyrinthine and claustrophobic settings,
stark angles, swinging light-bulbs, and hammering sounds, along with Welles’s
trademark, the deep-focus technique—makes for a difficult, intense watch, a factor
in its critical and financial failure.</span></p>

<p class=Para20 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In 1993 British
director David Jones attempted a faithful adaptation of the novel based on the
manuscript as edited by Max Brod, Kafka’s friend and literary executor. Harold
Pinter wrote the screenplay, which often quotes directly from the book. Shot in
Prague, Jones’s version of <span class=0Text>The Trial</span> stars Kyle
MacLachlan as Joseph K., supported by Anthony Hopkins and Jason Robards. In a
terror-inspiring exchange between K. and the priest, well portrayed by Hopkins,
K.’s guilt is confirmed and accentuated. However, while Jones strives to be
literal in his rendering of Kafka’s work, something is lost in the translation.
In Welles’s film the overbearing architecture, the constant snickering in the
next room, and Anthony Perkins’s unpredictable nervous tics combine to convey
paranoia. Jones’s film lacks such clues and so fails to convey much of the
anxiety evoked by the novel. Instead, Jones’s <span class=0Text>The Trial</span>
focuses on the indignation aroused by the actions of an invasive, all-controlling
state.</span></p>

<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>Opera</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN
style='font-style:normal'> </span></span></p>

<p class=Para11><span lang=EN>Kafka’s work has also been adapted into opera.
Austrian composer Gottfried von Einem’s <span class=0Text>Der Prozess</span> is
again based on <span class=0Text>The Trial</span>. First performed in 1953, <span
class=0Text>Der Prozess</span> features a libretto by Boris Blacher and Heinz
von Cramer. In the course of two acts and nine scenes it follows Joseph K.
through his arrest, return to work, and desperate search for help. Von Einem
was gifted in his sense of melody but wrote music for <span class=0Text>Der
Prozess</span> that, to emphasize K.’s frustration in an unknowable situation,
is dissonant and oppressive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In 2000 Philip
Glass premiered <span class=0Text>In the Penal Colony</span>, his operatic
adaptation of Kafka’s short story centering on a world traveler, an officer,
and the “apparatus.” <span class=0Text>In the Penal Colony</span>, which
features a libretto by Rudolph Wurlitzer, is scored for a tenor and a baritone
(the traveler and the officer, respectively). Glass’s music, typically
minimalistic and repetitive, played by the unamplified string quintet the score
requires, is appropriately bizarre. The production was directed by Glass’s
former wife and frequent collaborator JoAnne Akalaitis, who fashioned the
“apparatus” out of tricks of beautiful light and torquing gears. Kafka sits in
the foreground, where he scribbles notes and occasionally interrupts the action
by reading from his diaries and letters. The author’s presence onstage makes
him a primary player in such a way that the action between the traveler and the
officer can be interpreted as a direct product of, and allegory for, Kafka’s
imagination.</span></p>

particularly clear. Thus, for example, we friends of his laughed quite
immoderately when he first let us hear the first chapter of <span class=0Text>The
Trial</span>. And he himself laughed so much that there were moments when he
couldn’t read any further. Astonishing enough, when you think of the fearful
earnestness of this chapter. But that is how it was.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>My writing was all about you.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>—from “Letter to His Father” (1919)</span></p>

<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>Questions</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN
style='font-style:normal'> </span></span></p>

<p class=Para31 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>1. In considering
Kafka’s two diary entries, it becomes evident that the author feels
interruptions in the process of composition are detrimental to a writer’s work.
Given Kafka’s dissatisfaction with the end of “The Metamorphosis,” and the fact
that he failed to complete any of his three novels, what can be said about his
notion of resolution? Is a satisfying ending impossible in his fiction? How do
you read the ending of “The Metamorphosis”? Does it strike you as particularly
superior or inferior to the rest of the tale?</span></p>

<p class=Para15 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>2. Thomas Mann finds
Kafka’s literature “full of a reasoned mortality.” Is this consciousness of
death what drives Kafka to have Gregor Samsa regress into an insect, the
officer in the Penal Colony condemned to a botched and sloppy death, and Georg
Bendemann, in “The Judgment,” drown himself on orders from his parents, instead
of allowing his characters to overcome their circumstances? Is death itself
transcendent in Kafka’s work?</span></p>

<p class=Para15 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>3. Max Brod’s anecdote
about Kafka reading aloud reveals not only the latter’s sensibilities, but his
intentions. How is Kafka funny? Is Kafka’s sense of humor so peculiar that it
is inaccessible?</span></p>

<p class=Para15 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>4. Kafka and his
critics always talk about his failures. Some of us think that he succeeded
brilliantly. What do you think?</span></p>

<p class=Para15 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>5. Teachers often tell
students to apply literature to life. “Literature is equipment for living,”
said American philosopher Ken neth Burke. How would you apply Kafka’s fiction
to life? Is there any way that reading him might help you to persevere through
difficult times?</span></p>

<p class=Para15 style='margin-left:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>6. One of Kafka’s
methods is to make the subjective objective. Instead of giving us the interior
life of a character whose circumstances make him feel like an insect, he gives
us a character that has literally turned into one. Does this way of reading
“The Metamorphosis” account for all the details?</span></p>
