Inequalities (of wealth and rank) certainly exist, and have [probably] existed in most pastoralist societies, || but except in periods (of military conquest), || they are normally too slight to generate the stable, hereditary

Many ecologists now think | that the relative long-term stability (of climax communities) comes [not from diversity]

In the multiplicity (of small-scale local egalitarian) or quasi-egalitarian organizations (for fellowship), worship and production (that flourished in this laissez-faire environment) individuals could interact with one another [within a community (of harmony and ideological equality)], following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves [by shared consensus] || while minimizing distinctions (of wealth and power).
