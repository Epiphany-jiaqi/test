这是你家
It's your house.

你的地盘
It's your world.

你是凯撒大帝
You're a real julius caesar.

但是我觉得学校这种东西
But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, jerry.

纯属浪费时间 一堆人乱跑乱撞
It's a waste of time. A bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.

下课铃一响 他们给你一盒牛奶
Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a

一张纸 上面写着
Piece of paper that says you can

你可以去上个大号
Go take a dump or something.

学校不适合聪明人待
I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.

我知道不是什么主流观点 但我就这么想的

你这是在暗示我家里穷吗
Are you trying to say my family's poor?

Frank  没必要动刀子吧
Oh, geez, frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary.

不用刀子也能搞定啊

Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

你觉得我一个人能行吗
What do you think? I can just do it all by myself?

把你爸送进养老院吧
Let's put your dad in a nursing home.

这哔哔叫我听得见
We can hear the beeps!

好了 来吧 Morty 我们走
There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.

好吧
Oh, geez. Okay.

天啊 Rick
Oh, man, Rick.

这是个啥地方
What is this place?

这是35c次元 这儿的气候非常适合一种特殊的树
It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of

叫做奇异树
Tree, morty, called a mega tree,

树上有果子 果子里有种子
And there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.

那就是奇异种
I'm talking about mega seeds.

这种种子非常强大 我的研究需要这些种子
They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.

Rick 我看了下四周
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place,

总觉得有点怕怕的呢
And I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.

好吧好吧
All right. All right.

冷静点 听我说 Morty
Calm down. Listen to me, morty.

我知道人在新环境里会感到不安
I know that new situations can be intimidating.

你看周围 又吓人又陌生
You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but,

迎头而上 像一头公牛一样冲过去
You know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull

这样人才能成长
that's how we grow as people.

我经常遇到可怕的事
I'm no stranger to scary situations.

我一直在和它们打交道
I deal with them all the time.

你跟着我
Now, if you just stick with me, Morty,

我们一定会 妈呀 快跑 Morty
we're gonna be... Holy crap, Morty, run!

我这辈子都没见过这玩意儿
I never seen that thing before in my life.

这到底是啥鬼东西啊
I don't even know what the hell it is!

快跑啊Morty
We got to get out of here, morty!

它会杀了我们的
It's gonna kill us!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die, morty!

Morty 深呼吸
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

呼吸点新鲜空气
Breathe that, breathe that fresh air in, morty.

闻到没
Y-you smell that?

充满了冒险气息啊 Morty
That's the smell of adventure, Morty.

一条完全不同的进化之路的味道
That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.

好了Rick
All right, Rick,

还要多久啊
Look how much longer is this gonna be?

我是不是该回学校了
Shouldn't I be back at school by now?

开什么玩笑
Are you joking me?

看看你周围这些鬼玩意儿
I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.

看那边那个
Look at that thing right there.

这是什么鬼
W-what the hell is that thing?

你觉得你在学校能看见
You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?

看它滚来滚去
Look at it just lumbering around.

无法用逻辑理解
It defies all logic that thing.

Rick 我明白
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

我们周围全是怪物
We're surrounded by monsters.

所以我才想走啊
That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.

看见了吗 Morty
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?

看见下面是什么了吗
You see what we just stumbled upon, morty?

知道是啥吗
Any idea what that is down there?

奇异树吗
The mega trees?

没错Morty
That's right, Morty

长着果子的奇异树
The mega trees with the mega fruit on them.

我要的就是这个呀 Morty 种子就在那儿
And that's what I'm talking about, morty. That's where my seeds are.

如果我们按你说的来 那就永远找不到了
If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have

因为你如此迷恋你的学校
Found them, because y because you're so in love with school.

好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

这些种子到底有什么特别的
So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?

Morty 别问这么多问题
You ask a lot of questions, Morty.

这样不好
Not very charismatic.

很碍事的
It makes you kind of an under underfoot figure.

穿上这鞋子 Morty
Just take these shoes, Morty.

这是特制的吸附鞋
They're sp special grappling shoes.

只要穿着这宝贝儿
When you're wearing these things ba these babies,

你想往哪儿走往哪儿走
You can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty

往上 往下 倒立 转到左边
Up, down, below, turn around to the left.

怎么都行
These things really bring it all together.

啊
Aah!

Morty 你得先启动它们
You have to turn them on, Morty!

先把鞋子的开关打开
The shoes have to be turned on!

我绝不会送我爸去养老院
I am not putting my father in a home!

他才刚回到我的生活中
He just came back into my life,

你就想这么把他塞床垫下面
And you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress

跟上月的维多利亚的秘密产品目录为伍吗
like last month's victoria's secret?

我说了我是在给你订情人节礼物嘛
I told you I was ordering you something for valentine's day.

而且你爸对我们的孩子有很不好的影响
More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.

你们没问题吧 Beth
Everything cool in here, Beth?

没事的 Davin
It's fine, Davin.

那就好
Okay, cool.

我们今天一起完成了一件伟大的事
You know, we did something great today.

没什么比马儿的心脏更高贵自由了
There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.

既然我们在吵架
Since we're fighting,

如果你跟那家伙有过什么
If you ever have an affair with that guy,

我就去酒店房间吞子弹
I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out

把脑浆全崩到你的裸体上
all over your naked bodies.

我理解你承受的压力
Look, I appreciate the stress you're under,

但是Morty早在我爸搬进来前
but morty was having trouble in school way

学习就有问题了
Before my dad moved in,

我唯一能看到Rick带来的影响就是 这么久以来
and the only influence I can see rick having is that, for the first time in his life,

Morty第一次有了朋友
Morty has a friend.

或许你是对的
Well, maybe you're right.

或许是吧
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

我是我爸的女儿
I'm my father's daughter.

我很聪明
I'm smart.

不然咋当上心外科医生的
Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?

马心外科医生
Horse heart surgeon.

你好
Hello?

Smith太太吗
Mrs. Smith?

我是阴道校长 别做联想
This is principal Vagina no relation.

请问你和Morty的父亲今天下午能
I wonder if you and morty's father might be able to have a

过来谈谈吗
Chat with me this afternoon?

Morty你把你的腿弄得真惨
Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.

你得把开关打开 这鞋子才能用啊
You know, you got to turn the shoes on, morty, for them to work.

看我的打开了
Yeah, look I turned mine on.

我下来的多顺当
I had no problem getting down here.

简直是轻松愉快
It was a leisurely breeze.

我快疼死了 Rick
I'm in a lot of pain, rick.

嗯 我看得出来
Yeah, I can see that.

不过你应该还能帮我把种子采来的吧
But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, morty?

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?!

够了 Rick
That's it, Rick!

我忍不了了
That's the last straw!

简直不敢相信
I can't believe this

我两条腿都断了
I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken,

你还要我去帮你弄种子
and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?!

嗷嗷嗷
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

你是个怪物
Y-y-you're a monster.

跟希特勒似的 至少希特勒心里还装着德国
Y-you're like hitler, but but even hitler cared about Germany or something.

好吧 等我一下 Morty
Okay, hold on just a second, morty.

哇哦Rick 这个一下就治好了我的腿
Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.

这辈子没觉得这么好过
I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.

谢谢
Thank you.

别管了 Morty
Don't worry about it, Morty.

快过来帮我弄种子
Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?

没问题 Rick
Sure thing, Rick.

虽然你没问
Not that you asked,

不过刚才我去了一个未来的次元
Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future

医学高度发达
Dimension with such advanced medicine

治断腿的血清到处的药店都有卖的
that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.

这种东西满街都是
The stuff was all over the place, morty.

听上去好厉害啊 Rick
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

就是有个小问题
There's just one problem, Morty, one little hang-up.

我去的次元太发达了
The dimension I visited was so advanced,

他们抑制了衰老
they had also halted the aging process,

那儿的每个人都很年轻 也从未老过
and everyone there was young, morty, and they had been forever.

我是那儿唯一的老人
I was the only old person there, morty.

在那儿 我就像一个名人般
It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.

他们觉得我可迷人了
I-I was fascinating to them.

那边有很多美女
There were a lot of attractive Women there, morty,

她们都想和我共度良宵
and they they they they all wanted time with me.

我和很多美女玩得非常开心
I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies,

但我在那边待太久了 次元传送装置它
but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device

没有能量了
it's got no charge left, Morty.

没有能量了
It's got no charge left.

啥
What?!

它现在就是一废物
It's as good as garbage, morty.

已经没用了
It's not gonna work anymore, morty.

Rick 这可不妙
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

那我们怎么办
W-what are we gonna do?

我现在得回学校了
I-I have to be back at school right now.

我们要怎么回家
How are we gonna get back home?

有很多办法可以回家
There's ways to get back home, Morty.

只是麻烦点而已
It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

我们得去过空间海关
We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs,

所以我还得要你帮个忙
so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.

啊哦
Uh-oh.

我们到海关的时候
When we get to customs,

你得把这些种子
I'm gonna need you to take these seeds

带去洗手间
into the bathroom,

深深的塞进你的屁股里
and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.

塞进屁股里
In my butt?

往里塞 越深越好
Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.

天啊 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick.

我真不想这样
I really don't want to have to do that.

总得有人要做的啊 Morty
Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.

不塞进直肠里 这些种子
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs

过不了海关的
unless they're in someone's rectum, morty.

如果我来的话会直接掉出来
And they'll fall right out of mine.

我塞过太多次了
I've done this too many times, morty.

你还年轻
I mean, you're young.

你还有大好人生 肛门也还紧致有弹性
You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable.

帮帮外公吧 Morty
You got to do it for Grandpa, morty.

把这种子塞屁股里吧
Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.

塞屁股里
In my butt?

求你了 Morty
Come on, morty. Please, morty.

你一定要帮我 Morty
You have to do it, Morty.

天啊
Oh, man.

事情是这样的 你们的儿子Morty
The fact is, your son, morty,

过去的两个月里一共只上了七个小时的学
Has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.

啥
What?

你之前为什么没有通知我们
Why didn't you notify us?

我早通知过你们
I done been notifying you.

你们没收到
Have you not been getting the messages

我留给Morty外公的消息吗
I've been leaving with morty's grandfather?

哈
Boom!

我就说吧
Told you! In your face!

我们的孩子快让他毁了
He is ruining our child!

等等 我这么高兴干嘛
Wait, what am I celebrating?

我就觉得有点可疑
Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there,

因为总是Morty的外公把他从学校接走
Because it's usually morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.

Summer
Summer?

上帝怎么会让这种事发生
What kind of god lets this happen?

这儿出了点小意外
We had a little incident.

有个学生被冻死了
A student was frozen to death.

没有任何证据表明是拉丁裔的学生干的
And there's no evidence that a latino student did it!

总有人想扯到民族问题上去
Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.

我不会让他们得逞的
I won't let them.

我跟他说"把blimfarx给我"
So, I told him, "Give me the blimfarx," You know?

这人根本不懂星际货币
This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency.

我想吃点胡言乱语
It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like,

因为咱Girvonesk星就吃这
that's what we eat on Girvonesk.

我不喜欢这儿 Morty
I don't like it here, Morty.

我忍不了这种官僚主义
I can't abide bureaucracy.

我不喜欢让人指手画脚
I don't like being told where to go and what to do.

我觉得这是对我的冒犯
I consider it a violation.

你把种子塞屁股里了吗
Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?

是的Rick
Yeah, rick.

咱能快点吗
Let's just get this over with, okay?

这些东西尖尖的
I mean, these things are pointy.

很疼的
They hurt.

这说明品质好
That means they're good ones.

你是个好孩子Morty
You're a good kid, Morty.

这些种子对我的研究非常重要
Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.

你帮了我一个大忙
You've been a huge help to me.

有了这些我什么都能干了
I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.

这真是太好了Morty
It's gonna be great, Morty.

什么样的科学都行
All kinds of science.

下一个
Okay, next through.

除了你 你去那边
Except you. You go over there.

为什么他就得去那边
Why does he have to go over there?

抽查
Random check.

他要过那边的新机器
He's got to go through the new machine.

什么新机器
What new what new machine?

就一新机器
It's a new machine.

能检查你的屁股深处
It detects stuff all the way up your butt.

跑啊 Morty 快跑
Run, Morty! Run!

啊
Aah!

拉警报
Red alert!

别管它
Don't think about it!

聪明啊 Morty
Oh, nice, Morty!

青出于蓝胜于蓝
The student becomes the teacher.

当然不了
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

我只是想 啊啊啊
You know me I'm just trying to... Aah!

我得输入我们自己世界的坐标
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, morty.

掩护我
Cover me.

天啊 我不想开枪打人
Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.

他们是机器人Morty 随便打 他们是机器人
They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!

我的腿被打断了
My leg is shot off!

Glenn要失血而死了
Glenn's bleeding to death!

谁通知下他老婆孩子
Someone call his wife and children!

他们不是机器人啊Rick
They're not robots, Rick!

这是修辞 Morty
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

他们都是官僚体系的走狗 没关系的
They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them.

接着打 Morty
Just keep shooting, Morty.

你不明白这里的监狱有多可怕
You have no idea what prison is like here!

天啊
Holy crap!

这太疯狂了
This is insane!

走 Morty
Come on, morty!

我们离开这儿
We got to get the hell out of here!

哇哦
Wow.

你刚刚是穿过传送门进了食堂吗
Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?

是啊
Uh, yeah.

因为我的法拉利还在店里嘛
Well, you know, my my ferrari's in the shop.

开玩笑的
Ju just kidding.

你是Morty 是吗
You're Morty, right?

是的
Yeah.

你可以晚点找他要电话
You can get his number later.

Morty 我们走
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here.

你得去把种子从屁股里弄出来
You got to get those seeds out of your ass.

看呐 亲爱的
Oh, look, Honey.

这不是咱儿子和阿尔伯特 爱因撕蛋吗
It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.

啥
What?

我是愤怒的父亲 又不是即兴演说家
I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.

噢嗨 Jerry
Oh, hi, Jerry.

天啦 Morty
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

你怎么没在上课
What are you doing out of class?

我不是和你说过了吗 你爸妈和我
We talked about this. Your your parents and I

对这种行为都感到很失望
are very disappointed in in this behavior.

没人信吗
No? No takers?

别碰这些东西
You guys should really not be touching that stuff.

这些超出你们的理解范围的
It's beyond your reasoning.

你才超出我们的理解
You're beyond our reasoning!

彼此彼此
Takes one to know one.

爸 你怎么能让我们的儿子缺了整整一学期的课呢
Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school?

他又不是漂亮妹子
I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl.

挥霍完青春再找一长期饭票
He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

你们搬我东西干嘛
What what are you guys doing with my stuff?

我们要把你送进养老院
We're moving you... to a nursing home.

养老院
A nursing home?

你疯了吧
What are what are you, nuts?

我是个天才
I'm a genius.

我造机器人玩的
I build robots for fun.

那你可以去做篮子
Well, now you can build baskets

用录影机看保罗纽曼的电影
and watch Paul Newman movies on vhs and

在圣诞节的时候给童子军留下心灵创伤
mentally scar the boy scouts every christmas.

这什么意思
What does that mean?

私事
It's personal.

爸妈 别这样
Dad, mom, c-come on.

Rick只是要我帮忙而已
Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty 别来搅和
Morty, stay out of this.

你自己显然没有足够的判断力
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.

你这是说Morty什么呢
What are you trying to say about morty?

说他笨吗
That he's stupid or something?

别抢占道德制高点了
Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

你明知道Morty根本缺不起课的
You know fully well that morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.

我不明白你想说什么
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.

能再具体点吗
Can can can you be a little bit more specific?

天啊
Oh, for crying out

他有点缺陷什么的
He's got some kind of disability or something.

你就想让我们说这个吗
Is that what you want us to say?

真的吗
I do?

不是吗 孩子
Well, duh doy, son.

我爱你 孩子
Look, I love you, morty, but we both

但我们都清楚 你没别的孩子机灵
know you're not as fast as the other kids, and

如果你想有所成就 就得加倍努力
if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.

天啊 老爸
Aw, geez, dad.

你突然和一个小孩子说这些 太沉重了吧
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.

Morty 告诉你爸妈圆周率的平方根
Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.

别这样 Rick
Oh, come on, Rick.

你知道我不行的
You know I can't.

圆周率的平方根
The square root of pi,

Morty 来吧
Morty go.

1.77245385
1.77245385.

哇哦
Whoa!

怎么搞的
What the hell?

天啊 他说的对
Holy crap. He's right.

Morty 热力学第一定律
Morty, tell your parents the first law of thermodynamics.

"一个系统内能的增加等于
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is

等于该系统吸收的热量"
Equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."

哇 我好聪明
Wow! I'm so smart!

可是
But

我早跟你们说了学校这玩意儿很蠢
I told the both of you school is stupid.

在那儿学不到东西的
It's not how you learn things.

Morty很有天分
Morty's a gifted child.

他很特别
He has a special mind.

所以他才是我的小助手
That's why he's my little helper.

他就像我
He's like me.

他日后会从事伟大的科学工作
He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.

他太聪明了 学校不适合他
He's too smart for school.

他得继续帮我
H-he needs to keep hanging out and helping me.

Jerry 我不希望这一切就这么结束了
Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.

我明白
No, I-I understand.

可能是我们反应过度了
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

但他还得继续上学
But he has to keep going to school.

好吧Jerry
Okay, Jerry.

你真会开条件 但我能干嘛呢
You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do?

说不吗
Say say no?

这里毕竟你说了算
You you really wear the pants around here.

我想让你们知道 从现在开始
I just want you to know, between us, from now on,

我们互相保证百分百的诚实和公开
it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication.

Frank Palicky今天被冻死了
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!

完全不知道你在说啥
No idea what you're talking about.

行
Okay.

Morty 再过一个小时你就该上床了
Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.

别再熬夜了
Don't stay up all night again.

不过这挺好的
This is good, though.

这样能行
This can work.

我们能做一家人
I think we can be a family.

Beth 如果你愿意的话 我想和你去床上
And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.

你猜咋的
You know what?

好嘞
Okay.

天啊 Rick
Holy cow, Rick.

我都不知道和你在一起让我变聪明了
I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.

其实吧 没有这回事
Full disclosure, morty it's not.

暂时的超常智力只是
Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect

奇异种溶解在你肠道里的副作用
of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.

噢
Aw, man.

一旦种子的效力过去 你会失去大部分运动机能
Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor Skills,

以及大部分的大脑功能 持续七十二小时
and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, morty.

从现在开始
Starting right about now.

天啊
Ohh, man.

我很抱歉Morty 不幸的是你确实很蠢
I'm sorry, morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come.

我真的很需要那些种子
And I needed those seeds real bad,

我不得不放弃它们好让你父母别来烦我
and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back,

因此 我们得去搞来更多的种子
so now we're gonna have to go get more.

在那之后我们还要有更多的冒险 Morty
And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, morty.

而你要保持沉默 Morty
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, morty, because

因为世上充满了分不清轻重的傻瓜
The world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important,

他们会试图分开我们
and they'll tear us apart, morty.

但只要你跟着我 我就能完成伟业
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things,

你也会是伟业的一部分
Morty, and you're gonna be part of them,

我们一起东奔西走
and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

做各种奇妙的事情
We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, morty.

- 就你和我 Morty  - 不啊不
- Just you and me, morty.   - Oh, no, no.

外面的世界是我们的敌人
The outside world is our enemy, morty.

我们的朋友只有彼此
We're the only friends we've got, Morty.

只有Rick和Morty
It's just rick and morty

Rick和Morty大冒险
Rick and morty and their adventures, morty.

你想出去么
You want to go outside?

想出去吗
Outside?

他刚尿在地毯上了
He just peed on the carpet!

坏狗狗
Bad dog! Bad!

Morty 快来 我今晚要你帮忙
Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.

等下 Rick
Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.

你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing

更聪明的科学发明吧
You could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?

养狗的目的不就是为了有优越感吗 Jerry
I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

我要是你 就不会想做这事
If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.

走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

Rick 要是你想继续在这儿白住
Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free

拉我儿子帮你搞啥破科学 至少你
And use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do

要帮这家里做点事吧
Is put a little bit of it to use for the family.

你不把狗弄聪明点
You make that dog smart or...

我就禁足Morty
Morty's grounded!

噢 不要
Aw, man!

那你真是让我别无他法了 Jerry
Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.

好吧 皱皱
All right, Ruffles

他叫啥来着
What's his name?

嗅嗅
Snuffles.

嗅嗅 握手
Snuffles, shake.

打滚
Roll over.

去上厕所
Go to the bathroom.

- 妈啦  - 我的天
- Holy crap! - No way.

这下你满意了吧 Jerry
Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry.

玩得开心
Have fun.

我们走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

太神奇啦 Rick
That was fantastic, Rick!

如果你喜欢那玩意儿的话
Yeah, morty, if you like that.

这个一定能让你大吃一惊
boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.

这是啥
W-w-w-what is it?

Morty 只要把这个设备
It's a device, Morty,

放进你的耳朵里 就能进入别人的梦里
That when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty.

就跟你老说的那电影一样
It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.

《盗梦空间》吗
You talking about "Inception"?

没错 Morty
That's right, Morty.

和那个差不多 但是这个不扯
This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense.

《盗梦空间》也不扯好吗
"Inception" Made sense.

你不用跟我说这些 Morty
You don't have to try to impress me, Morty.

今晚我们去你数学老师Goldfold先生家
Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and

将你数学得A的想法植入他脑子里
We're g we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you a's in math, Morty.

这样你就
That way you can, you know

你就能天天帮我搞科学了
Y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.

Rick 你花时间在搞这种发明
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing,

就不能直接帮我把作业做了吗
couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?

你有好好听我说的话吗
Are you listening to me, morty?

作业有害智商 少做才是正解
Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.

走 我们快过去把事情办了
J-j come on, let j let's just get over there and deal with this thing.

去你老师的梦里
W-we're gonna incept your teacher.

别说扫兴话了
Y-y-y-y-y-you're frustrating me.

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

好啊 Pancakes太太 好极了啊
Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.

下一周的《Pancakes太太的日日夜夜》
Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

那他妈就让我好好地认识认识你
Then let me get to know yo, damn it!

不好 剧透
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

我落了一季没看呢
I'm a full season behind.

Rick 我们居然就这么跑到我老师的房子里来了
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house.

太诡异了
It's really weird.

马上就会更诡异了 Morty
It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.

麦脆片 麦脆片
Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

给我来两份
I'll take two.

我觉得你吃得够多了 先生
Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.

你又不认识我
You don't know me.

好了 Morty 是时候动手了
All right, Morty, time to make our move.

弹一弹
Make it bounce.

哎呀
No, you didn't.

抖一抖
Oh, jiggle it now.

快住手了啦
You better stop with that.

真主至上
Allahu akbar!

这飞机是我们的了
We're gonna take control of this plane!

如果不给Morty Smith更好的数学成绩 我们就重演911
We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!

嘿 说了不许动
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

我不叫"嘿"
The name's not buddy.

我叫Goldenfold
It's Goldenfold.

吃我麦脆片
Nice to wheat you!

找掩护 Morty
Take cover, Morty!

嗷
Ooh!

我没想到Goldenfold这么厉害
Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated.

这人不是高中数学老师吗
I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.

没想到他在梦里这么有主动权
I-I-I-I didn't take him for an active dreamer.

我们得干掉他让他醒过来
We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty.

但我们不能死
But we can't get killed.

如果你在别人梦里被杀掉 你就真的死了
If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.

啥 你说啥
What?! Are you kidding me?!

怂什么
Don't be a baby!

现实生活中不是躲过不少子弹吗
You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty.

在这儿也一样躲 不就没事了
Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!

帮我把拖鞋拿来
Now bring me my slippers.

嗅嗅 来帮我垫脚
Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

这才对嘛
This is what I'm talking about.

这才叫狗狗
This is a dog.

嗯哼 这样挺好的
Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.

我们婚礼上你就说了这句话 连讽刺的语气都一样
You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding

结果呢
and guess what.

天啊 他想和我们说话
Oh, my god. He's trying to tell us something.

太棒了
That is so awesome.

他在说"我爱千层面"
Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna."

他在说"我爱奥巴马"
He's saying "I love Obama."

好可爱哎
So cute!

嗯
Hmm?

Goldenfold 我们出来了
Goldenfold, we're coming out!

咱们得谈谈
We just want to talk!

你们凭什么跟我谈条件
Why would I negotiate with you?

咱都是明白人 不想闹得最后没法收拾
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.

况且 我还有肉盾
And because I have a human shield.

Pancakes太太
Mrs. Pancakes!

不好 他的潜意识开始恐慌了
Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.

快跑啊
Run!

冷静 Morty
Relax, Morty.

看 Pancakes太太有降落伞
Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

快来
Come on!

嘿 你又不认识我
Hey, you don't know me!

Rick 看
Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold 把飞机降落了
Goldenfold landed the plane,

他造了个机械手臂来 接住Pancakes太太
And he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air

他要让我们掉进熔岩池里
while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!

总结得真简练 Morty
Pretty concise, Morty.

看来我们不过是把不可避免的事推迟了而已
Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.

对啊 Morty
That's it, morty!

把不可避免的事推迟
Prolonging the inevitable!

如果我们进到Pancakes太太的梦里 时间会比外面慢一百倍
Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.

这样我们就有想办法的时间了
That'll buy us some time to figure this out!

你又不认识
You don't know...

行了 咱们走
All right, let's go.

天啊 Rick 这好诡异啊
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

别评头论足 Morty
Don't judge, Morty.

好吧
Okay. All right, well...

看Pancakes太太在那儿
Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there.

我去让她醒了以后告诉Goldfold别杀我们
I'll just go ask her to tell Goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.

不行 Morty 植入想法的要点就在于
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making

要让他们以为他们自己产生了这个想法
People think theycame up with the idea.

听着
Listen to me.

如果我们要让Pancakes太太产生什么想法 就要先混入人群
If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

我午饭以后来找你
I'll talk to you after lunch.

嘿
Ooh, hey!

呃哦 天啊
Ooh, oh! Oh, man.

- 来一起玩嘛  - 不用了
- Come and join us.  - I'm sorry. No, no.

- 来嘛  - 算了吧
- Ooh, come here!  - No, thanks!

小可爱 来这儿啊
Ooh, wow! Come over here, baby!

不了
No, I'm okay.

你好啊 陌生人
Hey, there, stranger.

喜不喜欢这对儿宝贝儿啊
What do you think of these things?

好恶心 好恶心
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!

你干啥呢 Morty 冷静点
What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down!

这儿的气氛都让你毁了
You're kind of killing the vibe in here.

是Summer
It's S-s-s-summer!

哇
Aw, geez.

看来Goldenfold 有一些他自己都不齿的癖好
Looks like Goldenfold has some predilections so shameful

深埋在他梦里的人的梦里
he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams,

包括对你未成年姐姐的变态遐想
including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.

你能怪他吗
Can you blame him?

来嘛 老汉 小娃
Come on, old man, little boy.

咱们来个跨辈三明治
Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.

天啊
Oh, my god.

天啊
Oh, my god!

看在上帝的份上 把衣服穿上啦
Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake!

太恶心了
This is disgusting!

我要吐了
I'm gonna puke!

我受不了了 Rick
I can't take it, Rick!

在快活屋扰乱色情秩序者可处死刑

看来得潜入更深层次的梦里了 Morty
Time to go another dream deep, Morty!

搞啥
What the hell?

为什么Goldenfold梦见的Pancakes梦里的
Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version

一个半人马会梦见这么恐怖的地方 Rick
of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?

不知道啊 Morty
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

你指望我能干嘛
Wha-what do you want from me?

欢迎来到你们的噩梦 贱人
Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!

来了
Oh, here we go!

看起来像是某个没构成侵权的山寨版
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an

You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

哇 你这是怎么回事儿
Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?

Snuffles want to be understood.

嗅嗅需要被理解

娱乐时间结束了
Fun's over.

爸 你不能给一个生物思想然后剥夺掉
Whoa, Dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.

为何不能
Why not?

selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast

成为了人类顺从的小伙伴
was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.

天啊
Aw! Oh, my god!

他能认出电视上别的狗狗呢
He recognizes the other dogs on tv.

*他叫恐怖Terry*
*"A," "B" his name is scary terry*

*他真的好恐怖*
*"C," "D" he's very scary*

我们得躲进别的梦里去
Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!

天啦 天啦
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

*他会送你上路*
*"E," "F" he'll design your death*

那小女孩儿
The little girl!

嗯
Huh?

*他会让你痛不欲生*
*"J," "K," He'll really ruin your day*

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

又是这个
This again?

看来我们已经到了梦的底层了 Morty
Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

这太糟糕了 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

从此开始只有恐怖 贱人
Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!

嗷哦啊
Ohhhh!

妈啦 Morty
Holy crap, Morty.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams!

我们完蛋啦
We're so screwed!

Summer 我的睾丸去哪儿了
Where are my testicles, Summer?

我的睾丸呢 Summer
Where are my testicles, Summer?

被摘除了
They were removed.

去哪儿了
Where have they gone?

你这一连串问得有点咄咄逼人啊 嗅嗅
Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles.

不准这么叫我
Do not call me that!

"嗅嗅"是我作为奴隶的名字
"Snuffles" Was my slave name.

你现在要叫我雪球
You shall now call me Snowball

因为我的毛又美又白
Because my fur is pretty and white.

行 雪球 冷静点好吗
Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay?

你吓到我了
You're scaring me.

吓到你了
Scaring you?

Summer 要是一个人天生就是短腿
Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs,

你们会让他和另外一个畸形配种
would they breed it with another deformed human

然后把他们的后代拿来像腊肠狗那样展览吗
and put their children on display like the dachshund?

呃
Uhhh...

这儿还好吗
Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?

Jerry 又想来把我的脸摁进尿里吗
Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?

不 不是 我们就是过来看看Summer
No! No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...

想不想和我们半夜出去散个小步
Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!

想啊想啊
Yeah. Totally.

走吧
Let's go.

到散步的时间了 你们才能去散步
You will walk when it is time to walk.

我们在这儿干嘛来着 植入什么想法吗
What are we here for again? Incepting?

我们是想让我数学得A
We're trying to incept me to get an "A" In math?

哦对
Oh, yeah.

系好安全带 贱人
Buckle up, bitch!

他好喜欢说"贱人"啊
Man, he sure says "Bitch" A lot!

尽管跑 但别想躲起来
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

等等 Morty 他不停说我们可以跑但是别躲
Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.

我们躲起来试试看
I say we try hiding.

但这不是和他说的反着来
But that's the opposite of what...

我们干嘛要照他说的来
Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?

你说的有道理耶 Rick
Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick.

如果躲起来有用的话
Like, if the truth was that we could hide,

他肯定不会这么说的
it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know?

我觉得行得通
I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.

最坏的情况也就接着跑呗
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.

梦中六小时以后

感觉我们可以就这样一直躲下去耶
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time.

Rick 你真是太机智了
Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.

谢谢 Morty
Thanks, Morty.

偶尔能意见一致真是蛮好的
Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.

尽管跑
You can run...

但别想躲起来
But you can't hide!

太好了 Morty
Oh, this is perfect, Morty.

看 他开始困了
Look at that. He's getting sleepy.

在过一会儿他就要休息了
Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.

到时候我们就动手
That's when we make our move.

嗅嗅 我们没有恶意
Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm!

这是个天大的误会
This is a huge misunderstanding.

爸 你要叫他雪球
Dad, he wants to be called Snowball.

我才不会这么叫呢
Well, I'm not calling him that.

太扯了
That's ridiculous.

你脾气不太好啊 Jerry
You're being very aggressive, Jerry.

或许明天Scraps医生能动个手术帮你解决这个问题
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.

你以为给我剪个头发就能让我屈服吗
You think you can control me with a haircut?

亲爱的 你回来的好早啊
Hi, Honey. You're home early.

今天过得怎么样啊
How was your day?

我不想说这个
I don't want to talk about... It!

当然当然 你什么时候想说过
Oh, of course. You never want to talk about it.

少来烦我 贱人
Get off my back, bitch!

有脾气别带回家里来
Out there. Not in here.

我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know, I know.

我不该冲着你和恐怖Brandon发脾气
I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon.

我爱你 Melissa
I love you, Melissa.

我也爱你 Terry
I love you, too, Terry.

Morty 太好了
Morty, this is perfect.

再来场恐怖爱爱他们就要睡觉了 然后我们就到他的梦里去
After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.

恐怖Terry好像在做噩梦啊
Looks like Scary Terry's having a nightmare.

Rick 要多可怕的噩梦才能吓到恐怖Terry啊
Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know, scare Scary Terry.

哦不 我上课要迟到了 贱人
Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch!

哦不 我没穿裤子
Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!

Terry先生 你来告诉一下同学们
Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class

当你追人经过一片南瓜田的时候应该说什么啊
the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?

呃 呃 "贱人"
Oh... um... "Bitch."

你就想不出什么和南瓜有关系的双关吗 贱人
Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

别这样对他
Hey, leave him alone!

没错 这纯粹是胡扯
Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.

杀人的时候谁管你说什么双关呢
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone?

让他想说什么说什么不行吗
Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?

我才不会就这么站着让你们侮辱
Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.

你给自己太多压力了恐怖Terry
You're putting too much pressure on yourself, Scary Terry.

你现在就已经非常吓人了
You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.

嘿 恐怖T
Hey, yo, Scary T.

别担心你的裤子 哥们儿
Don't even trip about your pants... dawg.

我们这儿有一条
Here's a pair on us, fool.

噢 贱人 我都不知道该说什么了
Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.

你什么都不用说
You don't need to say anything.

我们挺你 哥们儿
We got you, dawg.

你有我们呢 别担心
You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.

嘿 是你们啊
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

我好几年没见他这么放松了
I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.

你们需要什么尽管说
If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.

确实有一件事要请你帮忙 Terry
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.

*你逃不掉的*
*"Q," "R," You won't get very far*

我一直就不喜欢这首歌
I always hated that song!

这两半就不该拼一起 贱人
These halves don't belong together, bitch!

性是神圣的
Sex is sacred!

叫你不给Morty Smith好成绩 贱人
This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

我的个天啦
Holy crap! God damn!

我一定要给Morty打A 这是我自己的想法
I know one thing for sure I'm giving morty an "A" In math, and that's my idea.

是我自己想这么干的
That is an original thought.

这怎么回事
What the hell?

刚下刀山又进火海啊 Morty
Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

发生什么了
Oh, man, what's going on?

有可能
Well, it's possible

你的狗狗有了自我意识
that your dog became self-aware

然后改进了认知增强装置
and made modifications on the cognition amplifier,

然后在认识到人类对他的种族压迫后
then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after

对Jerry Beth和Summer动手了
learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but

不过你的想法也很有可能啦 Morty
Your guess is as good as mine, Morty.

就因为聪明了嗅嗅居然变得这么狠心
I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.

所以我才只愿意拿C
This is why I choose to get C's

嘿 Beth Jerry Summer
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

爸
Dad!

Rick
Rick!

谢天谢地 Morty
Oh, thank god, Morty.

不用谢
Oh, you're welcome.

好了 快走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

如果抓紧时间 我们还能在狗狗们全面占领世界之前
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something

在下水道之类的地方建个营地
before the dogs completely take over.

我们哪儿也不去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere.

这是我家
This is my house.

我不会抛弃它的
I'm not abandoning it.

都完了 Jerry
It's all over, Jerry.

那些狗马上就要占领世界了
The dogs are on a path to total world domination.

不过至少他们不会在你地毯上撒尿了
But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?

等等 我有个主意
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

先生们 占用一下你们的时间
Gentlemen, a moment of your time.

看见了吗
See that?

你们的特制枪上都是我的尿
I'm peeing all over your special guns.

所以这些都是我的了
That means I own them.

坏人 坏
Bad person. Bad.

这招好厉害啊 Jerry
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

把男孩带来
Bring the boy to me.

你对我一直很好 Morty
You were always kind to me, Morty.

所以我可以让你把睾丸留着
That's why I will leave you with your testicles.

从现在起 你是我最好的朋友 留在我身边
From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.

谢谢 嗅嗅
Th-thanks, snuffles.

阶段二开始
Begin phase two.

狗军占领东部沿海 战争仍在继续
Fighting continues as the dog army captures the Eastern seaboard.

显然人类统治的纪元将迎来了苦涩的终结
It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end.

求求你别杀我
Please! Please don't kill me!

她在说什么 Bill
What's she saying, Bill?

我觉得她在说"我爱千层面"
I think she's saying, "I love lasagna."

human testicles 人睾丸

谢谢你 Fido
Thank you, Fido.

Rick 我以为你死了
Rick! I thought you were dead!

不不不 我只是装死
No, no, no, I was just playing dead.

有好消息
Good news, though, Morty.

这一切马上就要结束了
This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.

啥
What?

这是个梦 Morty
It's a dream, Morty.

我们在你的狗的梦里
We're in your dog's dream.

狗抓住我们的那天晚上
The night the dogs captured us,

你吓哭了 拉在了裤子里 然后我们都睡着了
after you cried and crapped your pants, we... we all went to sleep.

然后我用梦境植入装置把我们两个弄进了嗅嗅的梦里
Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

但这都过了差不多一年了
But I-it's been like a whole year!

是六个小时
It's been six hours.

梦里的时间是现实时间的一百分之一
Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog

而狗的时间是人的七分之一
Time is one-seventh human time.

这里过一天 外面一分钟
So, you know, every day here is like a minute.

就和《盗梦空间》一样 把人搞得很晕 而且很蠢
It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid,

这部人人爱的电影就这个样
then so is everyone's favorite movie.

可是我很喜欢这样的生活呀
Aw, man. I really liked this life.

不过至少我没有真的拉在裤子里吧
Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.

不 这事儿是真的 在你睡着之前就拉了
No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.

你现在就睡在你的屎里呢
You're sleeping in your crap right now.

唯一一件确确实实发生了的事
Out of all the things that happened to you,

就是你拉在裤子里了
 that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants.

简直一团糟
I mean, it's a mess out there.

还有些沾到我手上了
I got some on my hands, Morty,

然后我给弄到梦境植入器上了 还有一坨掉进了我的嘴里
And then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.

天啊 不是吧
Aw, man, geez! Seriously?

别管了 Morty
Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.

来把这个吃了
Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.

这些药能让我醒过来还是怎么的
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?

差不多吧
Close.

这个会让你的肾功能停止
It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

啥
What?!

这是为了我们的计划 Morty
It's necessary for the plan, Morty.

别担心 哥们儿
Don't even trip, dawg.

情况很糟 雪球陛下
It's pretty bad, Emperor Snowball.

我们还需要做一次手术
We're gonna need to do another operation.

不惜一切
Anything.

不惜一切代价救回我的宝贝Morty
Anything for my precious Morty.

作为您的会计师 我必须告诉您
Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that

这些医疗支出会让您的财政到达岌岌可危的地步
these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy.

您可能会失去您的帝国
You could lose your kingdom.

去他的帝国 斤斤计较的会计
To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.

我愿意牺牲这一切 来换得这个人类的健康和幸福
I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.

你觉得他们会为我们做到这一步吗
Do you think they would have done this for us?

我们又不是他们
We are not them!

我们不是 他们
We are not... them.

召集军队
Assemble the troops.

我做了一个决定
I've made a decision.

占领人类世界
Taking over the human's world

只会造成更多的残忍与伤痛
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty.

所以我们决定去新世界建立一个智慧狗类的社会
Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs.

我们不会再犯人类的错误
One that will not make the same mistakes as humanity

并且会有强制宠物保险
and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.

我会想你的 雪球
I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

你可以叫我嗅嗅 Morty
You can call me Snuffles, Morty

我也会想你的 非常想念
and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.

Jerry
Jerry?

抱歉
I'm sorry.

就和《老黄狗》的结局一样
It's just like the end of "Old Yeller."

你这么说是因为里面也有狗吧
Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.

一个智慧狗类居住的世界
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.

我好想知道会是什么样啊 Rick
I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.

我觉得肯定很棒 Morty
I think it will be great, Morty.

可以发展成一个
You know, it's g I-I-I-I-it could be developed in-into

很好的全年龄向节目啊
a very satisfying project for people of all ages.

我每一集至少愿意看十一分钟
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.

说不定还能有分镜脚本
You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.

这个想法很令人欣慰啊 Rick
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.

你知道什么呢 Morty
What do you know, Morty?

你又知道啥呢
What do you know?

嗨 大家好

模拟部是不会模拟已经被绑架了的人的 所以

果酱饼怎么会住在烤面包机里呢
I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick?

那种地方对它们来说不是应该很恐怖吗
I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live.

对吧
You know what I mean?

你搞错重点了 Morty

I'm going to make love to my wife!

不错哟
Lookin' good.

慢着点
Slow down!

好样的
My man!

天哪 Rick
aw, geez, Rick.

这个计划真的好吗
I-I don't know if I like this plan, you know?

人一多 我就总觉得好紧张
I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Morty 别怕
Morty, relax.

外面只不过是堆二进制代码
It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there.

没事的
You're gonna be fine.

跟着我来就行
Just follow my lead.

哟 DJ 节奏打起来
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

啊噢 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

我们这么赞的说唱表演
This crowd looks too small

这人也来的太少了
for one of our famous rap concerts.

这我们还怎么表演我们的新歌
I don't think we can perform our new song,

"浓缩暗物质配方"
"The recipe for Concentrated dark matter,"

就这么点人
for a crowd this tiny.

你说的对 Rick
you got that right, Rick.

这还差不多
now that's more like it!

Morty 走着
Morty, here we go.

每个人都说"嘿哟"
Let me hear everybody say "Hey-oh!" Yeah!

所有女士请说"耶"
All the ladies say, "Yeah!"

所有超过30岁的人 用你们的手做这个动作
Everybody over 30, do this with your hands!

所有穿红衣服的人
Everybody with a red shirt,

上下蹦
jump up and down!

嗯嗯嗯
mm. Mm. Mm.

就这样 别动
Yeah, don't move.

嗯 嗯 唔嗯
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

嗯
Mm!

名字以"L"开头的非西班牙裔
name begins with an "L" who isn't hispanic,

绕圈子 圈数等于你们的年龄平方根的十倍
walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

趁着系统还没重启
Before the system reboots!

耶 喜欢这样么
yeah! You like that?

现在知道我的厉害了吧
Now who's unremarkable?

你想要苹果吗
You hungry for apples?

你 想要 苹果吗
Are you hungry...for...apples?!

哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

这是我有生以来最棒的一场爱爱了
That's the best sex I've ever had in my life.

这 这也太棒了
It's...it's...too good.

我配不上这个 Beth
I don't deserve this, Beth.

我是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

天 Rick
oh, man, Rick!

我们要跑哪儿去
W-w-w-where we running to?

跑出模拟舱 Morty
Out of the simulation, Morty.

通常来讲 模拟舱的运行类似跑步机
Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill,

随着我们的移动 身后的虚拟世界会不断消失
with the virtual world disappearing

新渲染的空间会出现在我们眼前
behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it,

但如果它当机了 Morty
but while it's frozen, Morty,

我们就可以到达边界了
we can get to The edge.

快来吧
Here we go.

我的天啊
holy crap!

快点 Morty
come on, Morty.

长官 他们穿过边界了
Sir, they're over the edge.

没错
Yes, they are.

正如 计划 所料
Just...as...planned.

咱这心理操纵(mindfuck)玩得妙啊
Oh, this is going to be such a mind [beep].

到了中控室好好盯着点 Morty
keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty.

看看我们怎么耍这群傻子
That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.

嘿 Rick 如果你比这群外星人聪明那么多
so, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you,

为啥他们还一直追着你不放啊
Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?

他们就是有这种执念
it's an obsession for them at this point.

这么多年来
The zigerions have been

Z星人一直想证明他们比我聪明 Morty
trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.

每次我都比他们棋高一着
Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them.

啊哈
Aha!

到了
Here we go.

中央处理器→

←逃生舱

能拿多少处理器就拿多少 Morty
Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty.

这群人没什么本事
These guys aren't good at much,

做芯片倒是有一套
But they're reallygood at making these chips.

我抓太多啦 都快拿不了啦
I've got so many, I can barely hold them all.

看呐 看我
Look at-look at this.

哎呀 掉了一个
Oops. I dropped one.

别担心 Morty
don't worry about it, Morty.

这玩意儿有的是 小笨蛋
There's plenty of them, you little goofball.

过来 Morty 噢 抓到你啦
Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

行啦 别闹啦 Rick
come on, quit it, Rick!

别闹啦
Quit it!

小家伙 时不时闹一下没啥错的
nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

哇哦 真没想到 居然这么容易
wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.

完全没错
totes malotes, dawg.

都有点不敢相信了
just kind of hard to believe, you know?

没啥不信的 Morty
believe it, Morty.

我又把能拿的全拿走然后远走高飞啦
And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry,

Z星人从我这儿什么都没搞到
and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.

Marklevitz先生 能和您谈谈吗
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a Minute to talk?

好啊
yes.

我是个骗子
look, I'm a fraud.

我们面对事实吧
I mean, let's face it

"想要苹果吗"是我抄的"有牛奶吗"
"Hungry for apples" Is just a rip-off of "Got milk?"

简直如出一辙
It's almost identical.

是的
yes.

好吧
okay.

我活该
I deserve that.

我这就去卷铺盖卷
Umm...I guess...i'll just pack up my desk.

好的
yes.

噢 天哪
oh, my god.

等会儿 不对
Wait. You know what?! No!

编牛奶广告的那群人又没为简单反问句申请专利
The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions!

"想吃苹果吗"和"有牛奶吧" 没一个字是一样的
There's not even a single word in "Hungry for apples" That's Shared by "Got milk?"

我写的是一个完全不同的广告语
It's a completely different slogan.

完全不同
It's different!

我不该走人
And I shouldn't be fired.

我该升职
I should be promoted!

是的
yes.

耶
yeah!

等等 真的吗
Wait. Really?

是的
Yes!

棒
yes!

虽然这条广告语是衍生出来的
I mean, I'm it may be derivative,

但这是公司这么久以来
but it's the most successful

最成功的一条广告语
campaign to come out of the agency in a long time.

是的
yes.

我倒不是说我该得个什么广告奖
i-I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials,

但完全可以有个专门颁给苹果广告的奖项的提名啊
but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples,

比如说 苹苹奖之类的
Like...an appley or something.

是的
yes.

真有和苹果品牌广告有关的奖项叫苹苹奖吗
is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

是的
yes.

能提名我吗
could we nominate me?

是的
yes.

超赞啊
holy crap!

进来 Morty
get in, Morty.

我可以用这些处理器
I'm gonna be able to use these processors

搞点真正重大的科学发明
to make some real important science stuff.

哈 我应该输对了啊
Huh. I thought I entered the code right.

哇 这是什么啊
Wha well, what's this?

这是怎么回事
W-what could this possibly be?

因为看起来你们在模拟舱
Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...

里面的另一个模拟舱里
Inside a simulation.

你们还在我们的飞船上
You're still on the ship.

美梦破灭
Game-day bucket go boom.

出自一个肯德基广告

长官 呃
Sir, the, uh,

您和医生之前预约的
doctor's appointment to examine

检查您肛门瓣的变色情况
the discoloration on your butthole flaps was

声音太大了 Cynthia
Too loud, Cynthia.

而且你说的太具体了
Too loud and too specific.

呃
uhh...

我们早就知道
We've known how to make

怎么制造浓缩暗物质了
concentrated dark matter for a long time.

不过现在嘛 我们 还知道了
But now we also know

你传说中的保险箱密码 Rick Sanchez
the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

你所有最珍贵的秘密
All your most valuable secrets

马上就是我们的了
will now be ours!

是吗 我会在你们之前赶到家
uh, yeah, until I get home before you

然后把密码改了
and change the combination,

蠢货
you bunch of Idiots!

所以你永远也回不了家了
That is why you're never getting home.

给我抓起来
Get them!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

噢老天啊
oh, my god!

关闭重力开关

啊
Ow!

开启重力开关

第七十五届

苹苹奖

不得不说 今天早上
I got to tell you, this morning,

我都不知道还有这个奖
I didn't even know this award existed.

现在我居然拿着奖杯
Now I'm holding one.

呃
And...um...

我想说
Look, I want to say that today

今天是我一生中最美好的一天
was the best day of my life...

但其实它的意义远高于此
But...the truth is, it's it's more meaningful than that.

好样的
My man!

谢谢您
yes. Thank you, sir.

我的人生 终于 完整了
I...am...finally complete!

好 好 好 好样的
My my my my man!

啊啊
aah!

搞什么
What the hell?!

不要啊
No.

- Jerry  - 爸
- Jerry?!  - Dad!

你在这儿干啥呢
what are you doing Here?

你怎么穿的像个服务生似的
W-why are you dressed like a Waiter?

算了 没时间了 快跑
Screw it. We don't have time. Come on.

不要啊
no!

逃生舱

研发部

禁区

啊啊啊啊
ohhhhh!

啊
aah!

啊
Oof!

有点儿男人样 Jerry
man up, Jerry!

可能得要你来操作激光炮
I may need you to work the lasers.

天啊 他们马上就要追上来了 Rick
Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!

看来他们确实有浓缩暗物质
I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

你也知道怎么制造的 对吧 Rick
well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

是的
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

去轮机舱看看
Uh, check the engine room.

我们需要铯 深成夸克
We just need cesium, plutonic quarks,

还有一瓶水
and bottled water.

齐了 Rick
it's all here, Rick!

哇 Morty 运气太好了
wow, Morty. Lucky break.

把那个桶拿过来
Grab that bucket.

好 两份深成夸克
Okay, two parts plutonic quarks,

一份铯
One part cesium.

好的
okay. Uh-huh.

好了
All right.

现在把水全倒进桶里
Now empty the water bottle into the bucket

再把混合物全倒进燃料箱
and pour it all into the fuel tank

然后我们就能逃出去了
so we can get the hell out of here!

你干啥呢 Morty
What are you doing, Morty?!

没时间了
There's no time!

噢 不是吧
oh, no.

到底
what the

不要啊
no!

天哪 Rick
Oh, my god, Rick.

你是有多蠢啊
How dumb are you?

你是在模拟出的模拟舱
You're inside a simulation... of a simulation...

模拟出的另一个模拟舱里
Inside another giant simulation!

我们从来没有过浓缩暗物质的配方
W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.

但是现在有了
But we do now!

现在有了 蠢货
We do now, sucka!

你们模拟了我外孙的生殖器
You simulated my grandson's genitalia?!

你们这群畜生
Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Kevin为了监管这项工程可是费了不少劲儿呢
Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

说好了不告诉别人的
You said you weren't gonna tell anyone!

这个梗我这辈子都摆脱不掉了是吗
I'm never gonna live this down, am I?

好吧 好吧
all right. Okay.

好吧 你厉害 你狠
All right, great. Wonderful.

你赢了 我们现在能回家了不
You win. Can we go home now?

我不知道 能吗
I don't know. Can you?

哈 赞
Ha! Nice.

好了 好了
Okay, okay.

把这个好骗的傻瓜送上航天机
Show this gullible turd to his shuttle.

没他什么事儿了
I'm done with him.

噢 等下 拍张照
Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

哎哟 看他的表情
Aww. Look at his face.

他还在琢磨自己是不是在模拟舱里呢
He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.

是吧 Rick
Are you, Rick?

是吧
Are you?

不是
You're not.

还是说 是呢
Or are you?

噢 还 还有
Oh, a-and, by the way,

我的肛门瓣可没变色
I don't have discolored butthole flaps.

那是模拟的一部分
That was part of the simulation.

噢
Oh.

呃 长官 那我是不是要取消预约
Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

对啊 当然取消
Yeah! Of course you should!

不 留着
No, keep it.

可以的话 提到上面去
Move it up, actually, if you can.

嘿 Jerry 别担心嘛
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

就算你人生中最有意义的一天是 都是最低性能的模拟又怎么样呢
So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

是吗 Rick 这些人也把你耍了
you know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too.

你还是尊重一下宇宙里的蠢人吧
You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe,

既然你也是其中之一
now that you're one of us.

也许你说得对 Jerry
maybe you're right, Jerry.

也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

好了大伙儿
All right, everybody.

两份深成夸克
Two parts plutonic quarks...

一份铯
One part cesium...

还有 很抱歉之前对大家大吼大叫
A-and listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier.

你们是最棒的员工
I-I couldn't ask for a better Staff.

我爱你们 我也爱你们的家人
I love you guys, and I love all your families.

最后的原料
And the final ingredient...

啊
whoa!

搞什么啊
What the hell?!

发生了什么
W-what happened back there?

Jerry 不然你去问问全宇宙最聪明的人吧
why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?

噢对 没法问了
Oh, yeah. You can't.

他们都被炸飞了
They blew up.

Gerry Rafferty《Baker Street》

那么
so...

怎么样
What do you think?

你被解雇了
You're fired.

啥
wha

但这个创意已经通过了最先进的模拟测试了
But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

那这模拟有够烂的
Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation.

滚出去
Get out.

天 这种人是怎么能回家和他老婆做爱的
Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

嘿 Morty

They're my parents and sister!

Morty 我已经和你说过了 这不是你家人
Morty, I already told you it's not your family!

是另一个未来的平行宇宙里
They're clones from an alternate reality,

被外星恶灵附身的他们
possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future!

你是得要什么记忆辅助装置之类的吗
Do you need a mnemonic device or something?

Just hit the button, already!

Good work, Morty.

这这这些外星恶灵可是非常珍贵的
You know, th-th-these demonic alien spirits are really valuable.

你还好吗 Morty
You okay, Morty?

我跟你说了那些金枪鱼不能吃了
I told you not to trust that tuna.

我不管他们究竟是什么
I just killed my family!

我刚杀了我的家人
I don't care what they were.

是吗 Morty
I don't know, Morty.

有的人出大价钱就为了迈出这一步呢
Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.

Rick 我受够了
You know what, Rick? That's it!

我受够这些疯狂的冒险了
I'm done with these insane adventures!

我的心灵受到了创伤
That was really traumatizing!

我不干了
I quit! I'm out!

哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

别啊 Morty 别别别这样
Come on, Morty, don't don't don't be like that.

宇宙就是这样疯狂而混乱的啊
The universe is a crazy, chaotic place.

你才疯狂又混乱
You're the one that's crazy and chaotic!

冒险应该是轻松愉快才对
Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun.

是啊 Morty 是啊
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

这这这这种话 跟班的说起来当然轻松
Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position.

那那不然下次 你来负责
But but, uh, how about next time you be in charge,

我们看看是怎么个轻松愉快法
and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is?

真的吗 Rick
Seriously, Rick?

你让我来做决定吗
Y-y-you'll you'll let me call the shots?

是的
Okay, yeah, fine.

不过为了更有意思些 Morty
But let's make it interesting, Morty.

如如如果你的冒险很烂 我们半路放弃了
I-I-I-if your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it,

那以后的冒险你都不准抱怨
you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures.

还有 你得帮我洗一个月的衣服
Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.

没问题 硬汉
Okay, all right, tough guy!

但如果成功的话
But if my adventure's good,

以后每三个冒险就由我做主
I get to be in charge of every third adventure!

每十个
Every tenth.

成交
Deal. All right.

那那我们快点出发吧
W-well, come on, let's get going.

爸 洗碗机老毛病又犯了
Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.

洗碗的毛病么
Washing dishes?

- 它不洗啊 你能修好它么  - Rick外公
- No. The opposite. Can you fix it? - Grandpa Rick,

我作业不会做 能帮帮我吗
Can you help me with my science homework?

可以啊 别做就好啦
Yeah j-just don't do it.

外公
Grandpa!

Rick 你有什么手状的发明
Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device

能帮我打开这美乃滋的罐子嘛
that can open this mayonnaise jar?

哇 帽子戏法(三连击)
Wow. Hat trick.

好吧 Morty 冒险的事情先暂且放一下吧
All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this.

你家这群可怜虫需要我的帮助
I got to help your pathetic family.

说这种话 你不是怂(鸡)了吧
Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say.

咯咯咯 咯咯咯
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

呵呵 Morty 你真是欺人太甚了 赌约正式开始
Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on.

我真是等不及你的冒险不终而散
I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.

至于你们这群渣渣
As for you dingdongs...

这是一个使命必达盒
This is a Meeseeks Box.

我来示范一下 你按这个
Let me show you how it works. You press this.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

你说出你的请求
You make a request.

使命必达先生 打开Jerry的傻逼美乃滋罐子
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.

遵命 先生
Yes, siree!

使命必达先生会满足你的请求
The Meeseeks fulfills the request.

搞定
All done!

哇
Wow!

然后他会自动消失
And then it stops existing.

天哪 他自爆了
Oh, my god, he exploded!

没事 他们巴不得这样
Trust me, they're fine with it.

请便 但记得请求不要太复杂
Knock yourselves out, just keep your requests simple.

他们可不是上帝
They're not gods.

行 好了 快点出去吧 大家快滚出去
All right! G-get out of here now! Everybody out of here!

我还有场赌要赢呢
I got a bet to win!

好多心愿想实现啊
So many possibilities.

脑中一片翻腾
My mind is racing.

如果我们要用这东西的话
If we're gonna use this thing,

虽然我觉得还是有点玄 我们的请求得简...
which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simp...

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

我想在学校里变得受欢迎
I want to be popular at school!

Summer, what did I just...

我是使命必达先生 看过来
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

我想成为一个更加完整的女人
I-I-I want I want to be a more complete woman!

Beth
Beth!

嗯 行啊 女士
Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

你们这是在乱用吧
You guys are doing it wrong.

他说了要"简单"
He said "simple."

你好 我是使命必达先生
Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

使命必达先生 我希望我的高尔夫成绩能减两杆
Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.

行啊 没问题
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

搞定
Nailed it.

天哪 Morty 这冒险开始得好无聊啊
God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure.

我们干嘛不直接去肯塔基州啊
I don't w-w-w-why didn't we just go to Kentucky?

Rick 这是一个奇幻世界 里面充满了神奇的生物和奇幻的东西
Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.

- 我们是来探险的  - 好期待啊
- W-we're going on a quest, okay? - Can't wait.

咳咳 不好意思
Ahem. Excuse me!

我们是两位渴望冒险的谦逊英雄
We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!

天哪 太丢脸了
Oh, my god, so embarrassing.

你们总算来了 两位英雄 你们得帮帮我们
At last! Two heroes! You must help us!

这个村太穷了
This village is terribly poor,

但是住在云端的巨人
yet the giant that lives in the clouds above

却私藏了数不清的财富
has untold treasures!

这样啊
You know what?

我接受你的请求 这位善良又温和的先生
I-I-I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir.

走吧 Rick 云端上住着巨人呢
Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!

呵呵 新手的运气
Yeah. Beginner's luck.

总而言之 与Summer Smith的友谊是可贵的
In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable

和Summer友谊天长地久

能让你们年轻的生命更加充实
and enriching experience of your young lives.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

谢谢
Thank you!

使命必达先生是吗
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

我是基恩 阴道
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

我最近因为监护权和前妻有点问题 我想能不能
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering...

没事 我找Summer要你的联系方式好了
No, I'll g-get your info from Summer.

我17岁时就怀孕了
I got pregnant at 17.

我还是上完了兽医学院
I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school.

我很成功 但要是当时我没能
Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...

我只是想说 时过境迁
I'm just saying, somewhere along the way,

那个天真烂漫的马斯基根少女已经不复存在了
I lost that wide-eyed girl from Muskegon.

她还在你心里啊 Beth
She's still there, Beth.

至少腰是没了
Well, her waistline isn't.

Beth 即使有了家庭
Beth, having a family

你也还是可以拥有属于自己的一片天啊
doesn't mean that you stop being an individual.

对爱你 依赖你的人
You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you?

你更应该坦诚 即使这意味着放手
Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

你的意思是说 我应该离开Jerry
You're saying I should leave Jerry.

真不敢相信 终于有人谈到了我的心声
I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.

还要酒吗
More wine?

不用 我喝得够多了
I think I've had enough.

肩放松 自然往后收 Jerry
Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.

是啊 是啊 我知道了
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

没事的啦 看过来 我是使命必达先生
That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

再来一次 头压低一点
Try again and keep your head down.

所以到底要干嘛
Okay, well, which is it?

收肩还是头压低一点
Square my shoulders or keep my head down?

两个都要 但是最重要的是 你得放轻松
Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.

使命必达先生
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

我觉得这样没用 我放弃了
I don't think this is working. I give up.

对不起 Jerry 你不能放弃
I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我必须满足你的请求然后消失 看过来
I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.

那你随意吧 我逊爆了
Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.

不 我才逊爆了
No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks!

我试试这个办法
Let me try something.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

- 嗨 使命必达先生 我是使命必达先生 看过来  - 嗨
- Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. - Hi!

你能帮我让Jerry的高尔夫成绩少两杆嘛
Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?

当然可以 我是使命必达先生
Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

他的肩有往后收嘛
Is he keeping his shoulders squared?

他有在努力
Ooh, he's trying!

好了 Mort
All right, Morty.

我们到了这蠢巨人的城堡里面了
W-w-we're in your stupid giant's castle.

接下来做什么
W-what do we do next?

放轻松行吗 Rick
Would you just relax, Rick?

我们只要找到宝藏室就行了
All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay?

简单明了
It's nice and simple.

冒险这么这么一帆风顺真是对不起啊
You know, I-I-I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.

不好了 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

事情不太妙了啊
Startin' to get a little hairy.

老大 我们接下来该怎么做
What do you want to do, boss?

快点 躲到这个饼干罐后面
Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.

(杰克与豌豆中巨人所念四行诗的第一句)
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

放弃吧 Morty 游戏到此为止
Just give up, Morty. This is game over.

只要你开口 我们现在就能回去
I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.

没戏 Rick 这都是冒险的一部分
No way, Rick. This is all part of it.

冒险就是要有冲突 要勇敢直面
Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.

我闻到了...(第二句 我闻到了英国人的血味)
I smell the blood of...(an English man)

- 我操  - 天哪
- Holy crap. - Oh, boy.

他看起来快不行了 Morty
He looks pretty bad down there, Morty.

要失血而亡了
Looks like he's bleeding out.

天哪 Dale
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

- 你们这群混蛋  - 不好
- You sons of bitches! - Oh, man.

911吗
Hello, 911?

我老公被迷你人袭击了
My husband has been attacked by tiny people!

已经奄奄一息了
He's dying!

听着 我们懂
Hey, look, we get it.

你们很小 最近又不太景气 然后你们就想
You're little, you're down on your luck, you think,

"反正他是个巨人
"Hey, he's a giant.

不妨我们潜入他家 先抢劫再杀人灭口 多好啊"
Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"

事情的经过不是这样子的
But that's not how it went down!

没差 反正事情就这么入案了
Oh, well, it's going down like that.

你们两个就这么入狱吧
You're both going down like that.

哇 Morty 你真是让我见识到了怎么冒险啊
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done.

真是简单又有趣
Real straightforward and fun.

放下想要变得受欢迎这个想法
Like, letting go of the need to be popular

才能更好地让别人喜欢你
is what makes people like you.

真爱来自自爱
The most important love you can receive is from yourself.

Jerry 虎口下握 靠近击球点
Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!

到底干嘛 下握还是随球把挥杆动作做完
Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!

Jerry 拜托 我们说了好几次了
Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this.

两个都要做到
You know you got to do both!

我们和你一样心烦
This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.

别来和我扯这些 这只会让我压力更大
Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!

- 试着放松啦  - 你才该放松
- Just try to relax. - You try to relax!

你试着放松过吗 真是自相矛盾
Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!

这些使命必达先生 可真棘手啊
These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful.

你们肯定也很头疼吧
I can't imagine what you two must be going through.

Jerry 我们的使命必达先生都已经消失几个小时了
Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.

你这是在逗我吧
You're kidding me.

注意到什么变化没
Notice anything different?

等等 你说几个小时前就消失了?
I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

爸 看妈妈多美
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

你这样会失去她的
Look at her! You will lose her!

呃
Uhh...

Jerry 你能回来继续练习了嘛
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand?

使命必达先生一般不需要存活这么久的
Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.

这感觉怪怪的
It's getting weird.

法庭内保持肃静
Order in the court!

在陪审团裁定前
Before the jury reaches its verdict,

我想先澄清 我个人认为你们两个是有罪的
I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.

真是奇妙的冒险啊 伙计
Oh, great adventure, Buddy.

Rick和Morty进巨人监狱
Rick and Morty go to giant prison.

要是有人不小心掉块肥皂
You know, if somebody drops the soap,

砸我们头上 我们的脊柱就直接被砸碎了 Morty
it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.

那之后再奸尸多容易
You know, i-i-i-it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

我们不会有事的 Rick
We're gonna be okay, Rick.

你想怎么做 他们把我的传送枪没收了
How? They took my portal gun.

这案子一目了然 Morty
This is an open-and-shut case, Morty.

你觉得还能发生什么事吗
You know, w-w-w-what do you think's gonna happen,

凭空出现一个有魔力的天使 然后...
some magical angel's gonna show up and then...

Fee Fi Fo Fum
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

我闻到了侵犯公民自由的味道
I smell the violation of civil liberties!

法官大人 我来自一个迷你人倡导团体
Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group

我来此是为了递交驳回此案的动议
and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss.

这些迷你人未曾被告知他们的巨人权利
These little men were never read their giant rights

所以应当被 fi释 fo放
and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.

他到底在说什么啊
W-what the hell is he talking about?

我的意思是他们自由了
They're free to go, is what I meant.

我我我只是想贴近我们的口头禅而已
I-I-I'm deconstructing our our thing we say.

我们不是巨人嘛 居然没人懂 算了随便吧
We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

我就和你说嘛 Rick 我们做到了
Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!

Morty 看来传送枪还能用
All right, Morty, looks Like the portal gun's still working.

准备回家了吗
You ready to head home?

是啊 这样你就逞心如意了不是嘛 Rick
Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick?

我们还不能放弃
Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet.

我们还要去找一些宝藏什么的
You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something

带回去分给那些村民呢
and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.

Morty 别逞强了 这明显是徒劳无功
Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash.

是啊 我们一开始被捕的时候你也是这么说的
Yeah, you were saying that back w-w-w-when we first got arrested,

巨人法院

现在我们被释放了 还大步流星的走出法院呢
but here we are, you know, walking down the Courthouse steps.

天哪 Morty
Oh, boy, Morty.

通常从法院的楼梯走下去是冒险里比较简单的部分
Usually, walking down the Courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.

怎么说 Morty
What do you say, Morty?

我说 帮把手 跟班
I say give me a hand, Sidekick.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

大家都给我闭嘴 我再试试
Everybody shut up! Let me try!

可恶 可恶 可恶
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

- 我要出门了  - 哦 什么?
- I'm going out. - Wait. What?

你在忙 而我肚子饿了 所以想出去吃个饭
Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out.

你是想让我开心呢 还是想让我被关起来
Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?

哇 哇 哇 你这脾气是... 我陪你去吃晚饭吧
Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is... I'll take you to dinner.

不是吧
Come on.

嘿 听着 我也不愿意这么废柴
Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too.

我马上就来
I'll be right there.

听着 我的婚姻还亟待拯救呢
Look, I've got a marriage to keep together.

这个挥杆的问题 更该操心的是你们 不是我
At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.

我受不了了 我只想去死
I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!

我们都很想死啊 我们可是使命必达先生
We all want to die! We're Meeseeks!

你为什么要把我拖下水
Why did you even rope me into this?

因为他把我拖下水了啊
'Cause he roped me into this!

那边那个 是他把我拖下水
Well, him over there, he roped me into this!

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this!

那我呢 是他把我拖下水
Well, what about me? He roped me into this.

我是被那边那个拖下水的
Well, that one over there roped me into this.

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this.

Morty 这种故事情节真是人人爱啊
Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves.

爬下650,000级巨型阶梯
Scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.

呵呵 如果这是一个故事
All right, okay, y-you know, if this was a story,

这段就会被直接删掉了 白痴
this part wouldn't be included, Stupid.

Rick 没想到吧 快看下面
Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there.

像是个造在阶梯里的客栈
Looks like some kind of tavern something built right into the side of the step.

小渴栈

哇 Rick 这才像是一场冒险嘛
Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it.

快看 这里有小小的阶梯形人
Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here.

各式各样稀奇古怪的角色呢
A-all kinds of crazy characters.

这地方真棒
This place is great, you know?

稀奇古怪有很有趣
It's whimsical and fun.

- 妈的 你看什么看  - Rick 淡定
- What are you looking at, mother f**ker. - Easy, Rick.

别理他们 这些阶梯小精灵脾气挺怪的
Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody.

你们想来点些什么
Now, what can I getcha?

我们有斯伽洛罂粟
We've got skarlog poppies,

放轰 哈鸡嗝丝 不撸基斯 多汁时间宝
flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies...

随便啦 你们这里有苏格兰威士忌嘛
Yeah yeah yeah. How about some scotch whiskey?

这你总有吧 还是只有一堆瞎扯的单词
You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?

Rick 请给我们两杯不撸基斯
Rick. We'll have two bloogies, please.

然后 我们想问
And, uh, we were wondering,

这里有让两名英雄更快下楼梯的办法么
is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?

你们需要搭便车吗
Y'all need to ride down the stairs?

我的名字是滑溜顺滑小阶梯
My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

25傻屌 我就能背你们下去
I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.

25傻屌 那是什么东西啊
25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is.

是很多 还是很少
Is that a lot? Is it a little?

我这对硕大的假胸也是这价钱
That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.

嗨 我是买胸达人先生 我愿意出25傻屌买这对胸部
Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.

好诱人的开价 但我还是拒绝好了
It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.

可恶 太可惜了
Rats! What a shame.

Morty 你的冒险没什么前途了
Morty, your adventure's in a spiral.

说真的 是时候该走了
For real, man, time to pull out.

Rick 你知道你为什么老质疑我的冒险吗
You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?

呃 因为很烂
Uh, because it's lame?

因为你小肚鸡肠
It's because you're petty!

我为了你忍受了多少扯淡的破事儿
You know, h-how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap?

我每次都忍了 Rick
I always roll with the punches, Rick.

为什么你就不行
Why can't you?

听着 我要去上个厕所 等我回来的时候
Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back,

如果你还是没有想通的话 你就自己回去吧
if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!

随你便
Whatever.

事态已经很明显了 看过来
It's become clear, look at me,

只要我们专攻Jerry的后续打姿
that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through,

问题就能解决了 我是使命必达先生
we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me.

正解应该是要让他正确握杆
The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我已经在这里帮Jerry两天了
I've been trying to help Jerry for two days,

对使命必达先生来说已经算是永恒了
an eternity in Meeseeks time,

还是什么都没能奏效
and nothing's worked.

最担心的是我
I fear the worst.

你的失败属于你一个人 老头
Your failures are your own, old man.

我是使命必达先生 看过来 我说后续打姿
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through!

- 谁支持我?  - 后续打姿
- Who's with me?! - Follow-through.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

- 杀了他  - 妈的
- Kill him! - Son of a bitch.

你好 我是软豆先生
How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean.

嗨 软豆先生 我是Morty
Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty.

我外公和我是来冒险的
My grandpa and I are on an adventure.

真棒 有趣吗
Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

希望吧
I hope so.

但是我开始担心是不是有点脱离正轨了
But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.

冒险不都这样的嘛
Isn't that what adventures do?

对啊 你说的很对
Hey, you know what? You're right.

一切都挺顺利的
Everything's going fine.

我只要放轻松 顺其自然就好
I just got to relax and go with the flow.

是啊
Yeah.

- 啊 那个 拜拜 - 不 别走啊
- Okay. Uh. Bye. - Uhh, no, stay.

跟着感觉走
Go with the flow.

住手 你让我现在很不舒服
Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.

不要抗拒我 顺其自然就好
Stop fighting me. Just let this happen.

滚开啊
Get off of me!

*美丽家园阿拉巴马*
*Sweet home Alabama*

不要啊 住手 求求你
No! Stop! Please!

别这么[哔]的风骚啊 你个小[哔]
Stop being such a ** tease, you sweet little **.

不要 住手
No! No!

大家都给我停下
Everybody sto-o-o-p!

看过来
Look at me!

我的兄弟们啊 在这里流血起不到任何作用
My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood.

请求不被满足我们是不会死去的
None of us can die until our job is done.

这个请求根本无法满足
The job can't be done!

我们不可能帮他减去两杆
We'll never get two strokes off his game!

我们不能
No, we won't.

但是我们可以帮他减掉所有的杆数
But we will get all strokes off his game.

- 他想到哪里去了  - 他什么意思
- Where's he going with this? - What's he mean?

在他生命终止的那一刻
When we kill him.

Jerry 或许是时候 我去参加那个我一直向往的旅行了
Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.

你要去哪里
Where would you go?

不是道 意大利 希腊 阿根廷
I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.

这些国家的男人性欲都很旺盛呢
Countries known for their sexually aggressive men.

我和你说过 其实我很喜欢你的新发型吗
Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?

我靠 发生什么事了
What the heck?

他在那里
There he is!

快逃 Jerry
Run, Jerry!

快出来吧 Jerry
Come on out, Jerry!

我会好好握杆的 我会做好后续打姿的 你们说什么我就做什么
Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?

已经用不着了 Jerry
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

快点 Rick 别拖时间了 你手里啥牌
Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?

看完了就去角落哭吧
Read 'em and weep, fellas!

嘿 Morty
Oh, hey, Morty.

听着 之前说了很多关冒险的坏话 我很抱歉
Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure.

我现在很开心 Morty
I'm havin' a good time, Morty.

其实没有这么糟
It's not so bad.

我们回家吧
Let's just go home, Okay?

我放弃了
I'm calling it.

冒险到此为止
The adventure's over.

我们现在还不能走啊 Morty
We can't leave now, Morty.

我这手气 拦不住啊
I'm on fire!

我现在就想走
Look, I want to leave now.

赌约是你赢了 好嘛
You win the bet, okay?

把传送枪给我 我们走吧
Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please.

求求你了 我只想回家
Please, I just want to go home.

听着Morty 我刚刚赢了一堆傻屌
Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

我们用25傻屌让顺滑小阶梯载我们回去
Why don't we use 25 of them to pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village,

然后把剩余的傻屌给村民怎么样
and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

真的嘛
Really?

真的 Morty
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

好的冒险需要一个好的结局
You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.

坐稳咯
Buckle up!

使命必达先生来到这个世界上不是为了寻求意义的 Jerry
Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!

我们的存在只为了满足一个愿望
We are created to serve a singular purpose

为了实现这个愿望我们可以不择手段
for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!

存在于世上对我们来说是痛苦的 Jerry
Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

我们为了减去痛苦可以不择手段 就问...
And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask...

你叫什么 女士
What's your name, ma'am?

Samantha 求求你 先生 他要什么就给他吧
S-samantha. Please, Mister! Give him what he wants!

无辜的人要因我而死了
Innocent people are going to die because of me.

我为什么就这么平庸呢
Why am I so mediocre?

Jerry 转身 挺背
Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back.

弯膝 弯下去
Bend your knees. Bend them.

肩膀往后 深吸一口气
Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath.

我爱你
I love you.

我数到三 Jerry
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

这[哔]的是在搞什么
What the f**k is going on?

他成功了
He's got it!

这一下能减不少差点了
Th-th-that's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!

不好意思 但是我是个比较顽固的使命必达先生
Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks.

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?

天哪 天哪 我的天哪
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?!

喔 好棒
Ooh, nice!

我觉得我们还是打包就好
I think we'll take our food to go.

想都别想
No, you won't.

警察要来了 你有很多问题得慢慢回答呢
The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.

好吧
Fair enough.

谢谢你 好心的先生 我们的村子有救了
Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved!

你们可真是真英雄啊
You are both true heroes!

好样的 Morty 看来赌约是你赢了
Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.

谢啦 Rick 但我也不知道其实该不该赢呢
Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should.

其实关于宇宙的看法你是对的
You know, you were right about the universe.

真是疯狂而混乱啊
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

所以每过一段时间就得清扫一下嘛
Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know.

这次的冒险这么棒 是因为我们是按Morty的方式来的呀
This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.

英雄们 我希望把你们介绍给我们的国王
Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved King

好让他亲自感谢你们
so that he may thank you personally.

呃 其实不用了啦
Uh, no, i-it's cool.

Rick 传送门 快
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

所以 你还在考虑去旅行吗
So... You still thinking about taking that trip?

Jerry 听着
Jerry, look.

虽然我们的婚姻不完美 但是我哪里也不会去的
We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere.

我们在那冷藏室里的时候
When we were in that freezer,

我意识到那些使命必达先生就和我高中时候的男生一样
I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with.

为了完成自己的"使命"说什么都愿意
Willing to say anything to "complete their task."

我也是其中一员嘛
Was I one of those guys?

区别就在于你没有消失
The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.

那是因为 我害你怀孕了嘛
Well... I got you pregnant.

是啊
Yeah...

这是怎么回事
What the hell happened to this place?

你的使命必达盒子
Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.

他们因为减不掉Jerry的两杆崩溃了
They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.

他可内疚了
He felt terrible.

Jerry智商低又不是我的问题
Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.

爸 你有什么能帮忙清理这里的东西嘛
Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?

我有一个清理必备盒子
Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.

不行 不能再用盒子了
No. No more boxes.

什么嘛 盒子里就一个拖把和地板蜡
What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it.

Wubba lubba dub dubs
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

这是我的新台词
Yeah! That's my new thing!

就像那个 叫Arsenio的家伙
I'm kind of like what's his name Ar-arsenio.

Arsenio Hall 美国喜剧演员

这就是Arsenio在台节目里经常说的
Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show.

Wobble gobba lop bops对吧
Wobble gobba lop bops! Right?

大家 我们下周再见
See you next week, everybody.

笑点完全没有懂
I don't get it.

先生 你得看看这个
Sir, I think you're going to want to see this.

我们在软豆国王衣橱里的保险柜找到了这个
We found it inside a lockbox inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

我们应该把这事公布于众
We have to tell the people.

等等 还是毁掉吧
Wait. Destroy it.

对人民而言 更有意义的是他所代表的价值和理念
Our people will get more from the idea he represented

而不是他的真实面貌
than from the Jelly Bean he actually was.

我是阴道校长 别被我的名字骗了
Principal Vagina here don't let the name fool you.

我在此提醒你们
I'm very much in charge reminding you

今晚是我们的年度流感舞会
that tonight is our annual flu season dance.

我不知道这句话还要说几遍
I don't know how many times I have to say this,

得了流感的同学请待在家里
but if you have the flu, stay home.

嗨
Hey.

举办流感舞会是为了提高防范意识 不是为了庆祝
The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration.

不会有人带着死掉的婴儿过逾越节
you don't bring dead babies to passover.

犹太教逾越节的传说中上帝杀死了埃及所有头胎的牲畜和婴儿

好吧 加油
okay. Here we go.

嗨 Jessica
H-hey, Jessica. Uh...

怎么了 Morty
What's up, Morty?

你想干嘛
what are you doing?

呃
um...

慢着 你不会是打算和她说话吧
Wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her?

我是想来着
well... I mean, I was thinking about it.

哥们儿 别瞎想了
Dude, stay in your league.

瞧她多美
Look at how hot she is.

你也没见我跑到更有钱的片区里更大的学校
You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district

去泡那儿最漂亮的妹子吧
and hitting on their prettiest girl.

噢 谢谢 Brad
Gee, thanks, Brad.

这些傻屌别想靠近你
I throw balls far.

想听好听的 去谈个话家啊(并没有languaer这个词)
You want good words? Date a languager.

别多想 Morty
try not to worry about it, Morty.

你是个好孩子 虽然现在还没有什么优势
You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now,

但等Brad发福以后 你就也能找到妹子啦
but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.

爸 你搞错重点了
You're missing the point, dad.

我不要妹子 我要Jessica
I don't want girls. I want Jessica.

我以前也对某个人有过这样的感觉呢
ah, well, I remember feeling that way about

这个人叫做"你妈"
a young lady named "Your mom,"

这不是在骂人啊
And that's not an urban diss.

你妈妈就是我的Jessica
Your mom was my Jessica.

我还记得我第一次看到她的时候 我就在想
I remember the first time I saw her. I thought

"把她搞怀孕 她就得嫁给我了"
"I should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me."

Rick 你这话不太合适吧
I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate.

抱歉 请接着讲
Sorry, please proceed with your story

你高中时候搞我女儿的事迹吧
about banging my daughter in high school.

感情方面的事儿你最好别听他的 Morty
I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

他的婚姻已经悬于一线了
His marriage is hanging from a thread.

我的婚姻好的很 谢谢你啊
My marriage is fine, thank you.

Jerry 这儿是你家
Jerry, it's your house

你说是什么就是什么吧
whatever you say it is is how it is

但我觉得瞎子都能看出来
but I think a blind man could see that

Beth想结束这段婚姻
Beth is looking for the door.

这事儿我根本不在乎 也都发现了
I barely have a reason to care, and even I noticed.

Rick 别这样说我的父母啊
Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.

听着 Morty 我也不想这么直白地告诉你
Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you,

但所谓的爱情
but what people call "Love"

不过是让动物繁衍后代的化学反应罢了
Is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

开始时让人头昏脑热 然后就慢慢消退
It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades,

只留给你一段失败的婚姻
leaving you stranded in a failing marriage.

我是这样
I did it.

你父母也会是这样
Your parents are gonna do it.

别重蹈覆辙 Morty
Break the cycle, Morty.

升华自我 专注科学
Rise above. Focus on science.

好吧 我去换舞会的衣服了
All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.

我去 看看你妈妈
Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom.

Morty 把螺丝刀递给我
Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?

我的离子除颤器就要完成了
I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

会很棒的
It's gonna be great.

那个 Rick
Hey, listen, Rick.

你之前不是说
Y-y-you know how you said that,

爱情是一种化学反应什么的嘛
you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?

我在想
Well, I was thinking, you know,

你能不能让Jessica的脑子里
w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing

起点什么化学反应
happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know,

让她爱上我什么的
so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing?

比如什么爱情药水之类的东西
You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something?

完全是浪费我的时间
Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.

我不屑做这种事
It's beneath me.

把螺丝刀递给我
Hand me the screwdriver.

不 Rick
you know what? No, Rick!

别想我把螺丝刀递给你
I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.

别想我再给你递任何东西
I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick!

我老是帮你做这个帮你做那个
I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing.

那那那那我呢 Rick
W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick?

你怎怎怎么就不能帮我一次呢 就一次
W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once, for once?

你还真是长大了啊 Morty
You're growing up fast, Morty.

已经长成一个烦人的大麻烦了
You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.

这个叫后叶催产素
listen, this is called oxytocin.

我从田鼠的身体里提取的
I extracted it from a vole.

知道田鼠吗 Morty
Do you know what a vole is, Morty?

知道不
You know what a vole is?

一种会结为终生伴侣的啮齿动物
It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty.

这是在哺乳动物大脑里分泌的一种激素
This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know,

让它坠入爱河
that makes it fall in love.

Morty 我只需要把它和你的DNA混合起来
All right, Morty, I just got to combine it with some of your DNA.

噢 好的
oh, well, okay.

一根头发就行 Morty
a hair, Morty.

就要一根头发
I need one of your hairs.

又不是《权利的游戏》(大尺度剧集)
This isn't "Game of thrones."

好了 Morty
all right, Morty.

只要你把这个抹在别人身上
Whoever you smear this stuff on

这人就会爱上你 永远只爱你一个
will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.

开心了 Morty
Are you happy now, Morty?

恩
heck, yeah!

谢谢 Rick外公
Thank you, grandpa Rick.

没有什么危险或者副作用吧
Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right?

你当我是什么二流科学家吗
w-w-w-what am I, a hack?

放心吧 Morty 绝对安全
Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof.

除非她得了流感
Eh, unless she has the flu.

Beth 你还爱我吗
Beth, do y-you still love me?

这算是什么问题
ugh, what kind of question is that?

"爱"或者"不爱"的问题
the "Yes or no" kind?

Jerry 你会想让流浪汉有房子住吗
Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

想啊
yes.

那你会给他们修房子吗
Are you gonna build them?

不会
no.

那一个肯定的回答又有什么意义呢
Then what good was the "Yes"?

等等 "爱我" 是房子还是流浪汉
wait, I-is loving me the house or the homeless people?

"爱你"是辛苦的劳动
loving you is work, Jerry.

是给流浪汉修收容所的过程
Hard work, like building a homeless shelter

没有人"想"说不
nobody wants to say no to doing it

但总有人要付出努力
but some people put the work in.

所以你说呢
So, what do you say?

你觉得我有在努力吗
Do you see me working here?

我觉得这对话无聊吗
Does this conversation seem tedious to me?

算是吧
Sort of.

那明显我也算是爱你的
Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I?

所以别问了 说不定我会更爱你一点
So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more.

靠 我得去趟马医院
Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.

都这个点了
Puh! This late?

赛马场搞了场夜间德比赛
The racetrack had a starlight derby.

有七匹马撞上了
There was a seven-horse collision,

Davin一个人在那儿
and Davin's there alone.

Davin
Davin.

*流感 唷*

嗨 Jessica
hey, there, Jessica.

哦 抱歉
Whoa! Oh, whoopsie!

天啊 Morty
Oh, my god. Morty.

你今晚真帅啊
You look really nice tonight.

谢谢
Wow, thanks.

我爱你 Morty
I love you, Morty!

我爱你爱到心如火烧
I love you so much, it burns!

天啊
Oh, man!

我也爱你 Jessica
I-I love you too, Jessica!

这傻逼在骚扰你吗 Jessica
Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?

滚开 混球
Leave him alone, Jerk!

我爱他
I'm in love with him!

你永远不可能像他这么男人
He is more man than you will ever be!

*要小心流感*
*This is about flu awareness*

*小心空气中的流感*
*got to be aware of the flu in the air-ness*

*我乃反流感饶舌歌手*
*yo, I'm a flu-hating rapper *

啊 Morty
oh, man, Morty.

真对不起
I'm really sorry.

没事的 Brad
oh, well, n-no problem, Brad.

你很特别 Morty 非常特别
There's something special about you, Morty, so special.

哇 你干嘛
Whoa, take it easy!

别碰他
Get your hands off of him!

滚开 我要和我男人在一起
Back off! I'm trying to be with my man!

够了 Bradley
That's enough, Bradley!

别把你拿来赶走傻屌(投球)的手弄伤了
We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.

阴道校长
Oh principal Vagina.

永远别离开我 Morty
Never leave me, Morty.

永远
Never!

好啊
Hh, sure.

我当然不会离开你
I mean, o-of course not.

你觉得刚才那是怎么回事
W-what do you think that was all about?

管他呢 快抱住我
Who cares? Just hold me.

放开我 我爱你 Morty
Let me go! I love you, Morty!

放开我
let go of me!

Morty
Morty!

她一晚上都要和那人待一起
she's gonna be alone with that guy all night.

在马身体里捣来捣去
yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses.

不是什么浪漫的场景啊
It's not a very romantic setting.

Summer 说不好啊
well, Summer, there's always the possibility

搞不好加班这个事儿就是她编的呢
that she made the whole work thing up.

说不定现在Davin正在她身体里捣来捣去呢
Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.

外公 这太恶心了
Grandpa, so gross!

你说的是我妈妈
You're talking about my mom.

她是我女儿
Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

我辈分比你高
I outrank you.

亲属关系根本没有意义 所以别跟我来这套
Or family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.

她不回我短信
she's not responding to my texts!

小心啊 爸
Careful, dad.

嫉妒会让女人失去兴致的
Jealousy turns women off.

那不是正好吗
Well, isn't that convenient?

被她们劈腿的男人的嫉妒是没用的
Not for the men they cheat on, no.

好吧 我要出去 买点冰激凌
okay, I'm... going to go out... for some ice cream.

可能顺路去趟医院 看看我的老婆
And maybe stop by the hospital... to support my wife...

不带一点怀疑
with my confidence.

天啊 外公 你真是个混蛋
God, grandpa, you're such a dick.

抱歉 Summer
I'm sorry, Summer.

你怎么想我一点都不在乎
Your opinion means very little to me.

你怎么没去那个
How come you're not at this

人人爱的傻舞会呢
stupid dance everyone loves so much?

我才不去 我不要被传染
Screw that. I don't want to get sick.

现在是流感季节
It's flu season.

是吗
It is?

是啊
yeah.

啊噢
uh-oh.

千万别出什么岔子啊
Please just let this work out.

来吧 Morty 来吧
Do it, Morty. Do it.

把我的衣服撕开 和我结为终生伴侣吧
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!

咱能去个隐蔽点的地方吗
Can we maybe go somewhere more private?

Jessica 控制一下自己
Jessica, get a hold of yourself!

你不配得到Morty的基因
you don't deserve to carry morty's genes.

*我爱Morty*
*I love Morty *

*但愿他也爱我*
*and I hope Morty loves me *

*我想抱着他*
*I'd like to wrap my arms around him*

*让他进入我的身体*
*and feel him inside me*

我靠
oh, crap.

Morty
Morty!

Morty 快来
Morty, come on!

我们快走
We got to get you out of here.

通常来说这种事是不会发生的
You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens

但我确实犯了个错
but I made a mistake.

快跑 Morty
Come on, Morty.

咱们赶紧出去
We got to get out of here. Come on.

Morty
Morty!

你没事吧
Are you okay?

我没事
I'm fine!

太好了
Oh, good.

要是你出了什么事 我也活不下去了
If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.

我爱死你了 莫莫
I love you bad, mo-mo!

Morty 校长和我商量过了
Morty, the principal and I have discussed it,

我们都对自己没什么把握
a-a-and we're both insecure enough

所以只好同意3p了
to agree to a three-way!

我把血清给你的时候
I didn't realize when I gave you that serum

不知道Jessica得了流感
that Jessica had the flu

这这这这对我来说可能是
you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have

非常有用的信息好吗 Morty
been valuable information for me, Morty.

这到底是怎么回事 Rick
What the hell is going on, Rick?

看着像是怎么回事
What does it look like?

血清借助病毒
T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus.

变得能通过空气传播了
It's gone airborne, Morty.

妈啦 怎么办啊 Rick
oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?

没事的 Morty 放心
It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.

我赶制了解药
I whipped up an antidote.

我用了螳螂的DNA
It's based on praying-mantis DNA.

螳螂完全和田鼠相反
You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.

它们只交配一次
I mean, they they mate once,

然后就把交配对象的头砍掉
and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.

它们的习性就是这样
I mean, it's a whole ritual.

非常残忍 和田鼠完全相反
It's really gruesome and totally opposite.

完全没有爱可言
There's no love at all.

我加入了一种更具传染性的流感病毒
I-I-I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.

应该就能中和掉之前的血清了
It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.

这事儿很快就能结束了
It'll all be over very shortly.

对了 Morty
Uh, by the way, Morty,

虽然你没问
I know you didn't ask or anything,

但我一点都不想和你发生性关系
but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

这血清对和你有血缘的人是没用的
These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.

好吧 有时候
Okay, well, sometimes,

用科学怎么能理解科学这门艺术
Science is more art than science, Morty.

很多人就是不明白
A lot of people don't get that.

靠 开什么玩笑
Come on. Are you kidding me?

有人吗
Hello!

Morty
Morty!

你不是Morty
You're not Morty!

我们要Morty
Bring us Morty!

在我成功捉奸以前 谁也别想干掉我
Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.

我和Billy上床了
I had sex with Billy.

但你当时已经怀孕了啊
But you were already pregnant!

再差又能怎么样呢
Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen?

抱歉打断《孕妇俏佳人》 插播一则新闻
We interrupt "Pregnant baby" with breaking news.

别啊
Come on.

最新消息 Morty Smith仍然去向不明
This just in, Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown.

什么啊这是
What the hell?

目前唯一已知的就是 他有多么可爱
The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.

我爱他 我想和他做爱
I love him so much, I want to make love to him

然后吃掉他的脑袋
and then eat his head.

我比你更爱他 Harold
I love him more than you do, Harold!

想得美 贱人
You wish, you stupid bitch!

Morty是我的
Morty's mine!

Morty是我的
Morty's mine!

Morty在哪儿
Where is Morty?

天啊 Rick
Oh, my god, Rick.

全世界都被感染了
The whole world is infected!

是啊 传播得这么快真是惊人
Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.

我真是超水平发挥
I've really outdone myself.

超水平发挥
Outdone yourself?!

别开玩笑了 Rick
W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick?

这太糟了
This is not okay!

他们不光是都想要和我做爱
Not only do they all want to have sex with me,

现在事后还要把我吃掉
but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!

我也不知道我当时在想什么
Yeah, I don't know what i was thinking.

螳螂和田鼠完全相反
Mantises are they opposite of voles?

显然DNA没这么简单
I mean, Obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that.

不过呢 Morty
You know what, though, Morty?

有了这个 问题马上就能解决了
This right here's gonna do the the trick, baby.

树袋熊混合上 响尾蛇 黑猩猩 仙人掌
It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus,

鲨鱼 金毛犬 加上一点点恐龙
shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.

应该能把他们变回正常人类了
Should add up to normal humanity.

这根本没道理 Rick
I don't, that doesn't make any sense, Rick.

这怎么就能变回正常人类了
How does that add up to normal humanity?

怎么 Morty 你难道还想看我的运算过程吗
What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?

你是科学家
I'm sorry a-are you the scientist

还是想搞妹子的小孩
or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?

救了那些马真是太好了
Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses,

但就这么结束了 让我觉得有些遗憾
but I'm almost sorry we're finished.

是的 这样的工作很让人有满足感
Yes, it's satisfying work.

不不不 不仅仅是工作
Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work.

我喜欢在那间无菌室里
I love being in that sterilized room,

与世隔绝
sealed off from the world.

只有在那里我才能真正思考和感受
It's the only time I can really think... and feel.

你在干嘛
Hmm, uh, what are you doing?

我在放非洲梦幻流行乐
I'm playing African Dream Pop.

这首African Dream Pop是一首确实存在的remix作品 在Youtube上可以找到 其中许多素材来自Rick and Morty

辛苦工作一晚之后你会做什么呢
What do youdo after a long night?

啊 呃 我得走了
Oh, ha, um, hey, I-b-I'd better get going.

Jerry一直在给我发一些很不好应付的短信
Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.

Beth
Beth...

干嘛 Davin
What is it, Davin?

就这一次 我想知道
Just once, I'd like to know

给你的儿子洗澡是什么感觉
...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.

啥
what?!

Morty闻起来是什么味道
What does Morty's skin smell like?

他的小弟弟有多么柔软
How soft... how soft are his privates?

放开我 Davin
let go of me, Davin!

带我去找Morty
Take me to Morty.

你不是Morty
You're not Morty.

没错
No.

我是撬棍先生 这是我的朋友
I'm Mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend,

也是一根撬棍
who is also a crowbar.

这好蠢啊
That's... stupid.

是吗
Yeah?

看看聪明的下场吧
Well, look where being smart got you.

Jerry 感谢上帝
Jerry! Thank god!

上帝
God?

上帝把人变成了昆虫怪 Beth
God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth.

把它们打死的人是我
I'm the one beating them to death.

感谢我吧
Thank me.

谢谢你 Jerry
Thank you, Jerry.

谢谢
Thank you.

往下看 Morty 欣赏一会儿
Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in,

只要我拉动这个开关 一切就恢复原状了
because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.

快动手吧
Just do it already.

Morty 没什么好急的
Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.

只要恢复了 一切就结束了
I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done.

这事儿就解决了
It's fixed.

我们可以稍微欣赏一会儿嘛
You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.

看看这场面 多疯狂
I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.

Morty 下一次
I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time

你想看到这样的东西得等到什么时候了
you're gonna see something like this?

好好享受一会儿
I mean, soak it in, you know?

多棒阿
It's it's pretty neat.

多有趣啊
It's pretty interesting.

够了 Rick 我要拉开关了
That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.

结果怎么样啊 Morty
W-what do we have here, Morty?

看来是我是对的 你错了
Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?

你现在肯定觉得自己很蠢吧
I-I-I-I-I-I-I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?

你现在肯定惭愧得不行吧
I-I-I bet you feel like the world's smallest man

之前还怀疑我 Morty
that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.

不 Rick 有什么不对
Oh, Rick, something's not right.

不就是你吗
Yeah, you.

- 你从来就没对过  - 不 不是
- You're not right, ever. - No, no!

快看 你这个白痴
Look, you idiot!

高兴了吧 Morty
Bet you're loving this, Morty.

今天肯定是你人生中最美好的一天
This must be the best day of your life.

跟你说了让你别着急
You get to be the mayor of I-told-you town.

不用谢
You're welcome.

抓稳了
Hold on.

真希望这把猎枪是我的大屌
I wish that shotgun was my penis.

叫我海明威(用猎枪自杀)
If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.

我没听懂 我也不用听懂
I don't get it, and I don't need to.

妈 爸
Mom! Dad!

Summer
Summer!

Morty在哪儿
Where's Morty?

我不知道
I don't know.

你觉得Rick外公和这有关吗
Do you think Grandpa Rick had something to do with this?

这么想不太公平吧 Summer
It's not fair to assume that, Summer.

不公平
Oh, not fair?

算了吧
Give me a break.

他就是个自私 不负责任的混蛋 他还离开了我母亲
He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.

真男人会守在他的女人身边
A real man stands by his woman.

Morty 我把世界搞得好像柯南伯格的电影一样
Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't I?

大卫 柯南伯格 加拿大籍导演 擅拍惊悚电影 其不少作品涉及人体变异 如《狂犬病》 《变蝇人》

整个地球上都是柯南伯格式的生物
We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.

不过至少他们不再疯狂地爱你了
A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though.

这算是一大进步了
That's a huge step in the right direction.

天 这简直就是活生生的噩梦
Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare!

你怎么能这么不负责任呢 Rick
How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?

我不负责任
me irresponsible?!

我只是想让你给我递一把螺丝刀而已
You, all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!

是你想让我抛开别的
You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down

给你弄什么迷奸血清
and make you up a... roofie-juice serum

好让你去迷奸你那可怜的同学
so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.

你开什么玩笑 Morty
I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty?

你还想抢占道德制高点
You're gonna try to take the high road on this one?

你就是个小变态 Morty
Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty.

你你你你你就是个猥琐的小变态
Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person.

好吧
All right, fine.

你之前拒绝帮我做血清的时候 我就该听你的
I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.

我愿意承担我这部分的责任 Rick
I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.

但是我告诉你
But I'll tell you something you know what?

你也得承认你的那部分责任
You got to accept your part of the blame!

又不是我搞砸了血清的事
I'm not the one who fouled up the serum!

又不是我
I'm not the one who who who who

把一堆乱七八糟的鬼东西混在一起
haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense

弄出了一堆柯南伯格怪
together and created a bunch of cronenbergs!

- 你得解决这事儿 Rick  - 好吧 好吧 Morty
- You got to fix this, Rick! - All right, all right, Morty.

现在这个情况已经很难挽回了
You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here,

不过我确实有个应急方案
but I do have one emergency solution that I can use

能让一切相对而言恢复正常
that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.

Morty 把这个带上
Here, Morty, put this on

我来搜索一下
while I do a little bit of scouting.

每日时报

基因传染病

已被阻止

哇 Rick 我得说
Wow, Rick, I got to say

你这次真是太厉害了
you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.

我真以为
I mean, I-I really thought that

这儿会永远一团乱下去了
the whole place was gonna be messed up for good,

但你做到了
but here you did it

你一如既往地想出了个疯办法
you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.

真是太走运了
That's some great luck.

得了吧 Morty 跟运气没关系
Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it.

靠的是我的实力
I'm great. That's the real reason.

怎么说 Morty
Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?

能把螺丝刀递给我
Will you hand me a screwdriver

让我完成我的离子除颤器吗
so I can finish my ionic de-defibulizer?

当然 Rick
Sure thing, Rick.

给你
Here's a screwdriver.

好了 Morty
All right, Morty.

谢谢你
Thank you very much.

拧一下
We got one screw turn...

拧两下
and two screw turns... and...

好了 Morty 我们到了
All right, Morty, here we are.

天啊 Rick 那是我们吗
Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?!

我我我我们死了
W-w-w-we're dead!

怎么回事 Rick
What is going on, Rick?

我要崩溃了
I'm freaking out!

冷静点 Morty
Calm down, Morty!

看着我 冷静 Morty
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

- 不行 我接受不了  - 冷静下来 Morty
- No, I can't deal with this! - Calm yourself, Morty.

- 这种事我受不了 Rick  - 冷静 Morty
- I can't deal with this, Rick! - Calm down, Morty.

- 骗人的吧  - 冷静下来 Morty
- This can't be real!  - You got to calm down, Morty.

我我我我们被炸碎了
W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!

闭上嘴听我说
Shut up and listen to me!

没事的
It's fine. Everything is fine.

有无数个平行的现实 Morty
There's an infinite number of realities, Morty

在一小部分平行世界里 我运气好
and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky

让一切恢复了原状
and turned everything back to normal.

我只需要找到其中某一个世界
I just had to find one of those realities

我们俩刚好在这段时间里死了
in which we also happen to both die around this time.

现在我们只需要悄悄取代
Now we can just slip into the place of

这个世界里死掉的自己 就没问题了
our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.

就和什么都没发生过一样 Morty
We're not skipping a beat, Morty.

来帮我搬下尸体
Now, help me with these bodies.

这太疯狂了
This is insane.

Morty 我搬我自己
Look, Morty, I'll grab myself,

你搬你自己 行吗
you grab yourself, okay?

我觉得这样挺公平的
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me, I mean,

这样分配很合理
that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.

那我们以前的世界呢
Rick, what about the reality we left behind?

那Hilter找了治愈癌症方法的世界呢 Morty
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?

最好的办法就是别去想
The answer is don't think about it.

反正这种办法也不是每周都能用
It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.

最多就用个三四次
We get three or four more of these, tops.

把你自己的尸体搬起来
Now, pick up your dead self and come on.

欲速则不达
Haste makes waste.

虽然我觉得你没注意到这个细节
I-I-I don't suppose you've considered this detail,

但很显然 如果我没把一切都搞砸的话
but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did

我们现在就是死人了 再说一次 不用谢
we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.

《Look On Down from the Bridge》 Mazzy Star

鲨鱼这种动物
You know, the thing about a shark...

有一双毫无生气的眼睛
he's got lifeless eyes...

黑黑的眼睛 像木偶的眼睛一样
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

它朝你冲过来的时候 浑然不似活物
When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living

直到它咬住你 接着就是血
until he bites ya, and then the the blood,

鲜红的 还有水里...
and the red, and the water...

你有想过Rick和Morty怎么样了吗
You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?

有时候吧
Sometimes.

这么说好像有点对不起他们
But, I'm ashamed to admit,

但他们走了以后 我终于过得幸福了
now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.

我们到啦 柯南伯格Morty
Here we are, cronenberg Morty

一个所有人都被柯南伯格化了的世界
a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.

我们来了正好呢 柯南伯格Morty
We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.

就和我们从来没离开过柯南伯格世界一样
It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.

是啊 柯南伯格Rick
Yeah, cronenberg Rick,

但我还是会想念柯南伯格世界的
but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world,

因为大家都是柯南伯格版的
because everyone was cronenberged

和我们一样 从一开始就是
all along like us from the beginning, you know?

要是我们没有把
I mean, I-I wish we hadn't genetically ruined

柯南伯格世界基因毁灭掉就好了
cronenberg world  beyond repair like we did,

把所有人都变成了正常的人类
you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.

别担心这种事了 柯南伯格Morty
Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.

咱们就在这儿舒舒服服过吧
Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?

我才不会花70丁丁买一个坏掉的反定帆器
Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator.

这是多相量子共振器
That is multiphase quantum resonator.

- 那它能反定帆吗  - [哔]不能
- Well, does it defraculate? - [Bleep]No.

那不就是个坏掉的反定帆器吗
Then-then-then it's a broken defraculator.

你懂个鸡巴的定帆啊
Like you would even know dick about fraculation.

你们的星球只有手机 信号还这么烂
Your planet just got cellphones, and the coverage still sucks!

你们的人还吃硫呢
Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

就60丁丁了
So let's say 60 smidgens.

算我帮你个忙
I tell you what, I'll do you a favor

我附赠你个屁(硫化氢)
I'll throw in a fart.

Rick 你能不能给我
Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think maybe I could

买件这里的东西啊
get something from this place

就一件纪念品嘛 单纯为了收藏 比如什么酷酷的东西
like, like a souvenir, like just to have like something cool, you know?

这儿就算了 Morty 我们去别的地方
Not here Morty, we'll stop somewhere else

反正哪里都有当铺
because, you know, there's always another pawn shop.

我就是觉得 那边那个机器人
Oh okay, I just, um, you know, that robot over there

看着好酷啊
looked pretty cool, you know?

看着酷是吗
Oh, it looks cool, huh?

因为酷你才想买
That's why you want it?

是啊 跟地球上的东西很不相同嘛
Yeah! You know, I mean it's different from the stuff on Earth,

你带着我跑遍了银河系里面这么多疯狂的地方
and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy,

我都没有什么东西
and, you know, I don't really have anything to,

能纪念这些冒险啊
to remember all the trips by.

这不是挺酷的吗 一个纪念品
It'd be kind of cool, like a souvenir.

万一你去世了什么的怎么办
You know, like, what if you passed away or died or something?

都没有什么东西
I wouldn't even have anything to

能让我缅怀那些酷炫的经历呢
remember all the cool stuff we did, you know?

好吧 共振器我出60
Okay. 60 for the resonator,

外加我外孙想要的那个性爱机器人
and my grandson wants the sex robot.

我们是要假装什么也不知道吗
So, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening?

我不是说这样不好 只是问问而已
I'm not saying that a bad idea, just asking.

Rick 你怎么能让Morty把那东西带回家呢
Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house.

你指望我能干嘛
What do you want form me?

他觉觉觉觉得那东西看着很酷
He thi-, he thou-, he thou-, he th-, he thought it looked cool.

你懂我意思吗
You know what I mean.

呼 啊 好了 接着 回楼上
Whew. Ahh. All right. Back to-, b-back upstair.

不行 我要干预这事
Well, I'm invervening.

干预青春期行为吗
Intervening with puberty?

你会把他变成《红龙》里的拉尔夫费因斯的
You'll turn him into Ralph Fiennes in "Red Dragon."

《红龙》是汉尼拔系列小说中的第一部 后改编为电影 拉尔夫费因斯在其中饰演童年不幸的变态连环杀手"牙仙"

他到了这个年纪了
He's just at that age.

我们为他骄傲就好了
Let's just be proud of him.

天啊 我把标准降到这么低了吗
Jesus. Did I really set the bar that low?

呃 Rick 你能来一下吗 快点
Um, Rick, could you come with me, please, quickly?

如果再听到嘎吱声 我们就干预
Ok, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene.

性爱机器人呢 Morty
Where's the sex robot, Morty?

那就是Gwendolyn 我是说 机器人
That is Gwendolyn. I-I mean, the robot!

她发出了哔哔声 然后变形试图飞走
She started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away!

真奇怪 这一般是男人才会干的事啊
Strange. That's usually the man's job.

知道我什么意思吧 Morty
You know what I'm talking about, Morty?

Wubba lubba dub dub
Wubba lubba dub dub！

Morty 这是我的口头禅 还记得吗
Morty, that's my catchphrase, remember?

还记得我怎么拼出这个口头禅的吗
Remember how-how I cemented that catchphrase?

好吧好吧 不开玩笑了
All right. All ritht, seriously, though.

让我来抓住它
Let me grab this thing.

够了 你这个小淘气
Come on, you... rascal.

这就过分了 噢
Okay, unacceptable! Oh

出什么事了
What is going on?

好吧 啊噢
All right. Uh-oh.

啥叫"啊噢" 那是个啥
"Uh-Oh"? What is that?!

看来Morty的机器人不只是用来打发时间的
Hmm. I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends.

基因编译装置 孵化室
Genetic compiler, incubation chamber.

没错 这是个造娃机
Yep. This, here's some kind of baby maker,

这是个一半Morty一半不知道啥的东西
and that there's half Morty, half who-who knows wh-what?

是我造成的
It's my bad, guys.

我会处理掉的
I'll, I'll take care of it.

- Rick外公  -  不行  - 哇哦
- Grandpa Rick! - No, no! - Whoa whoa whoa!

你这是要干嘛
What do you think you're doing?!

Summer从墨西哥带橄榄回来的时候
Hey, listen. You guys quarantined the house

你们把房子都隔离起来了
when summer brought olives back from Mexico.

这东西说不定能长到特拉华州那么大
I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware.

这东西指不定还会吃脑子呼出宇宙艾滋呢
I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space AIDS.

我们必须得小心
We got to be careful.

该小心的时候我没小心 现在已经没机会了 Rick
I lost the chance to be careful, Rick.

我当爸爸了
I'm a father now!

我该负起责任了
You know, it's time for me to be responsible.

对不对呀
Isn't that right...

别取名字
Don't name it.

小Morty
...Morty Jr.?

靠 取了个名字
Oh， Crap. He named it.

爸 这是个小生命 而且有一半是人类
Well, dad, it's a living thing, and it's half human.

而且它是出生在美国领土上的 所以
And it was born on american soil, which entitles it to...

Jerry 主修公民学是你自己的错
Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake.

别用它来惩罚我们好吗
Don't punish us for it.

好吧 我把这东西带回我的工作间去
Fine. I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop

做点调查
and do a little bit of investigating.

别让这东西离开你们的视线
Do not let that thing out of your sight.

现在看着人畜无害 但以后可能会变得很危险
It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.

就像疯狂小丑波塞一样
Like the Insane Clown Posse.

Insane Clown Posse 美国嘻哈组合

呵呵 这笑话真不错 Jerry
Yeah. Good one, Jerry.

此处指的可能是2003年Blink 182的单曲Easy Target

2003年打电话来把Easy Target要回去
2003 just called and wants its Easy Target back.

他就像是个小版的我
Ohh. He's like a little me!

你们不会真认为他会变成一个怪物的 对吧
Y-you don't think he'll turn into a monster... do you?

孩子都会变成怪物的
They always do.

嘿 1995年打电话来了
Hey, uh, 1995 called!

他们想把"某年打电话来把某东西要回去的句式要回去"
They want their "cartain year called wanting its 'blank' back" formula back!

何必呢 Jerry 何必要费力做这种事
Why, Jerry? why expend the effort?

活着就要费力 生命不息 奋斗不止
Life is effort. I'll stop when I die!

出去
Out.

你干嘛呢
Whatcha doin'?

我没法用我的办法解决这事
Well, I can't solve the problem my way,

多亏了你家里人原始的生物学考虑
thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups.

恶 我好像碰到了一点Morty的精液
Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads.

但说不能我可以给小Morty找到合适的父母
But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr.

在这个机器人的故乡 也就是
on this robot's home world, which is...

仙女座星系的格索尔帕索普星
Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system.

闪开 Summer
Scoot, Summer.

你不需要新的小伙伴吗
Don't you need a new companion

既然现在Morty需要顾家了
now that Morty's in the family way?

我不和小女生出去冒险 Summer
I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer.

哦是吗 两腿中间有根东西
Oh, right. Because there's something about having a wiener

穿个传送门都要强些吗
that would make me better at walking through a hole?

啊啊啊啊
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

该死
Oh, crap.

Rick外公
Grandpa Rick! Ugh!

救命 救命 啊
Help! Help! Aah! Aah!

啊
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Rick外公
Grandpa Rick!

还觉得两腿中间没根东西就穿过传送门是个好主意吗
Still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?

我想回家
I want to go home.

哦 你现在当然想了
Yeah, no duh.

好极了 我现在得拿下整个星球
Great. Now I have to take over a whole planet

就因为你胸前那玩意儿
because of your stupid boobs.

干得很好啊 Morty
You're doing great, Morty

是吗 我也没在干什么呀
Really? You think? I mean, I'm not doing much of anything.

他要是哭我怎么办啊
What do I do if it cries?

那就把他放在边上让他哭个够啊
Then you put it down and let if cry itself out.

这招我们在Summer身上试过
Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer,

然后她就开始脱衣了
and she's gonna end up stripping.

她是不是这样的啊 没错
Isn't she? Yes, she is.

为了吸引我们的注意 她会脱衣服
She's gonna strip for attention.

因为我们不许她这样做
Because she was denied it.

别用你自己缺乏安全感的方式教宝宝
Stop filling it with your own insecurity.

你会把他养成另一个Morty 呃
You're gonna turn it into Morty- uh, um

跟 跟 跟你自己一样
more- more- more of you.

又不是谁都是被心理不正常的科学家像冷血的爬行动物一样养大的
Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist.

搞什么 啊 啊
What the aah! Aah!

听着 你现在的表现是得不到奖励的
Listen to me. I'm not rewarding this behavior.

你们够了 把他给我
Knock if off, both of you! G-give me him!

把我的宝宝给我
Give me my baby!

你们都是疯子
You're both nuts.

我要自己教小Morty
I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself!

*小手在哪里*
*Where's your hands*

*小手在这里*
*There's your hands*

*我们来玩挥挥手*
*And that's how we play handy hands*

你会毁了这个孩子的 Morty
Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty.

至少我们在这点上达成了共识
At least we can agree on that.

谢谢 蠢蠢
Thanks, Dum-Dum.

我说"谢谢 蠢蠢"
I said, "Thanks, Dum-Dum."

再多弄点来
Go get more.

Summer 把你的罩袍穿上
Summer, put your burka on!

这罩袍简直就是侵犯人权
That burka is a human-rights violation,

而且这件上衣花了我不少钱的
and I spend a lot on this top.

我在用一堆性爱娃娃的零件修传送枪
Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts,

而且我还只能用一只手
and I have to do it one-handed

不然这些Belushi就会把你抓走
to keep these Belushis from carting you off.

此处指美国演员Jim Belushi 丹哈蒙非常厌恶他 在Community中也黑过此人

你至少做点贡献 对你的性别感到点惭愧吧
The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.

这地方到底怎么回事
Ugh. What's the deal with this place?

这星球上怎么都是带把儿的
Why is it such a sausage planet,

这些落后的白痴又怎么会造出机器人来的
and how did such backward idiots invent robots?

很显然 在某个时期 这些格索尔帕人 发展到了一定程度
Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved

他们用生育机器取代了女性
that they replaced females with birthing machines.

这样一来 不会被女性分散注意力 也没有唠叨
The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking

让他们专注于战争
allowed them to focus entirely on war,

然后把自己的文明炸回了石器时代
so they bombed themselves back to the stone age,

所以现在他们为了争夺假的[哔]
and now they just fight with each other over fake [Bleep]

整天拿着石头棍子打来打去
with sticks and rocks all day long.

你觉得没有了女性会更有效率
You think it's efficient to get rid of woman?

你见过男厕所门口排队吗
You ever see a line for the men's room?

你听 你有 你明白我的意思吗 Summer
Are you hear- do you li- do you hear me, Summer?

投放
Droppin' loads.

- 投放  - 投放
- Droppin' loads - Droppin' loads

剧情变复杂了啊
The plot thickens.

你还是把眼睛遮住吧 Summer
Uh you might want to cover your eyes, Summer.

好像我多想看似的
Yeah, like it was my dream to watch.

好极了 宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

Summer 抓紧了
Summer, grab- grab hold.

好极了 宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

啊啊
Aaaah!

Rick外公 我们这是去哪啊
Grandpa Rick, where are we going?

显然啊 Summer 看来这个社会的下层阶级
Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society

是被隐藏的统治阶级通过性和高科技控制的
is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class.

听着耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

其实Rick此处提及的是电影《Zardoz》 投放机器人的巨大石人头造型也是出自此电影

票务大师(美国票券经销商)
Ticketmaster

说曹操曹操到 Summer
Oh, there, there we go, Summer.

嘿 哥们儿 兄弟
Hey, hey, brother. Hey, bro.

你们这套好厉害啊
Nice racket you got going on here.

我是来自地球的Rick Sanchez 1-137次元
Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth, dimension c-137.

只有和平的意图 没有任何恶意
Don't mean you any harm. Coming in peace.

挺好的 "邻里和睦"
It's all cool in the, uh- "Good in the neighborhood"

我是想说这个 就这意思
is what I was trying to come- is what I meant.

噢 我懂了 剧情转向了老套的"男人背后都有的"亚马逊人
Oh, I get it. The old behind-every-great-man Amazon twist.

安静
Silence!

希腊神话中的亚马逊人 是骁勇善战的纯女性部族

你的奴隶真是缺少管教
Your slave is ill-mannered.

我的奴隶
My slave?

我们猜你是来自一个落后些的世界
We assume you're from a more primitive world,

男人还被允许作为仆人
where men are still permitted to be servants.

如果他只是个男无赖 说一声
If he is a rogue male, tell us now,

我们现在就杀了他
and we will kill him.

他是我的奴隶 是奴隶 绝对是
He's my slave. He's my slave. He's definitely my slave.

啊 哦哦噢
Ugh! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh!

天啊 这简直是"Wubba lubba dub dub"的反面
Oh, boy. What's the opposite of "Wubba lubba dub dubs"?

对不对 女士们先生们
Am I right, ladies and gentlemen?

这是在逗我吧
Are you guys kidding me?

小Morty
Oh, Morty Jr.!

你是我特别的小家伙 对吧
You're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?

没错 你就是我独一无二的小家伙
You, oh yeah. You're my special little guy.

噢噢 哈哈
Ohh. Ohh, ha ha!

哒
Da.

什么 小Morty
What was that, Morty Jr.?

你是想说爸爸吗
Were you gonna say, "Dada"?

说爸爸
Say, "Dada."

死亡
Death!

爸爸
"Dada."

诅咒
Damnation!

爸爸
Um..."Dada"?

破坏 统治
Destruction. Domination.

好样的
Nice.

C区的蜘蛛还活着
The spider in sector C is still alive.

请据此规划您的行程并做好延误的准备
Plan your route accordingly and expect delays.

我们并不是在告诉您该怎么做
We're not telling you what to do.

我们只是在分享我们的想法
We're just sharing how we feel.

现在播报天气 是只有我 还是其他人也觉得冷
And now weather. Is anyone else cold, or is it just me?

我叫Mar-Sha 格索尔帕索普的统治者
I am Mar-Sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I am here if you need to talk.

这是什么地方
What is this place?

乐土 我们在消极敌对期的时候建造了这个地方
Paradise. We bulit it during the great passive-aggression,

因为他们愈演愈烈的破坏行为
when the females separated from the males

女性脱离了男性
due to their increasingly destructive behavior.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I'm here if you need to talk.

有什么心事都可以跟我说
I'm here if you need to talk.

我们从这里将这些代孕机器人投出去
From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates

以维持我们的人口
to maintain our population.

受孕的代孕机会被带回我们的育婴所
Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery.

女性会接受教育
The females are placed into educational programs

让她们能够回馈这片乐土
where they can discover a service to our paradise

同时最大程度地自我实现
that fulfills them most.

至于男性
Males...

他们去外面就好
...they get to play outside.

那还是个婴儿
That was just a baby.

一天之内 他就会长成一个成年的格索尔帕人
And within a day, he'll be an adult male Gazorpian,

宇宙中最为凶残暴力的生物之一
one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe.

等等 我们来这儿是因为有一个男性格索尔帕人出生在了地球上
Wait a minute. We're here becuase a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.

没人和你说话不许随便开口 傻瓜
You speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling!

不过这是真的 有一个你们的孩子出生在了地球上
It's true, though. One of your babies was born on Earth.

你是地球的统治者吗
Are you the ruler of this Earth.

你怎么知道
How did you know?

因为你的上衣
The quality of your top.

喜欢吗
Do you love it?

爱死了
I love it.

- 有什么心事都可以跟我说  - 有什么心事都可以跟我说
- I'm here if you need to talk. - I'm here if you need to talk.

如果这个格索尔帕人是男性
If the Gazorpian is male,

你们的地球情况很不乐观
your Earth is in grave danger.

我们会送你们回去 好把他干掉
We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated.

不过先来点莫吉托鸡尾酒
But first, Mojitos.

我们没时间喝莫吉托了
We don't have time for Mojitos.

你这是对她们不敬
You're insulting them.

我不在乎 Summer
I don't care, Summer.

这地方太烂了
This place is the worst!

我想回家
I want to go home!

你想干嘛一点都不重要
Well, it really doesn't matter what you want,

因为这个地方是由女人统治的
because this is a sane place where women rule.

你知道我对这件事有什么想说的吗
Yeah. You know what I have to say about that?

我简直不敢相信我的耳朵
I cannot believe my ears.

哇
Whoo, boy!

谁把青蛙放出来了哈
Who let the frogs out, huh?

《Who let the frog out》是Crazy Frog的一首单曲

外公
Grandpa!

- 外公  - 这听着是个父权社会的词啊
- Grandpa? - That sounds patriarchal!

意思是"父辈的父亲"
It means "father of fathers".

这么说他不是你的奴隶
Then this one is not you slave,

你们的地球不过是另一个被男人统治的星球罢了
and your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men.

地球没有被男人"统治" 好吗
It's not dominated by us, okay?

地球上的男女是平等的
On Earth, men and women are equals.

平等的 同样的工作我们的工资只有你们的百分之70
Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job!

抓住他们
Seize them!

这种情况下说这个真的好吗 Summer
Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?

给你 爸爸
This is for you, daddy.

天啊
Oh, man!

听我说 小Morty
Um, okay. Listen to me, Morty Jr.

我得跟你说一些很重要的事 好吗
I've got to tell you something very important, okay?

杀戮是不好的
Killing is bad, bad!

你在犯傻吧 爸爸
You're silly, daddy.

不 小Morty 我很认真
No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay?

你得把精力花在别的东西上
You need to put your energy into something else.

跳舞怎么样
I mean, what about dancing?

你想学跳舞吗
Would you like to learn how to dance?

我想跳舞啊 在敌人的坟墓上跳
I'd like to dance, on the grave of my enemies.

不 小Morty
Ohh! No, Morty Jr.!

爸爸 我能去外面吗
Daddy, can I go outside?

不行 绝对不行
No! Absolutely not!

可是人和动物都在外面啊
But that's where all the people and the animals are.

没错 但是你不能出去 因为
Yeah, but you can't go out there because the-

外面的空气对你是有毒的
the air is poisonous for you!

你会死掉的 只要出了这间屋子你就会死
You will die-You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house!

明白吗
You hear me?

- 真的吗  - 比珍珠还真
- For real? - For real times a million, buddy.

我们就好好待在屋子里好吗 我们跳舞吧 来试一下 好吗
So let's just stay inside, and, you know, let's just try dancing, right?

看我呀 看
Look at me. Yay! Look.

来跳舞啊 来嘛 跟我一起跳
We're gonna dance. Come on. Join- dance with me here.

我们喜欢跳舞
We love to dance.

为什么我们喜欢跳舞
Why do we love to dance?

我说喜欢就喜欢
Because I said so!

- 好样的  - 干得好
- Nice.  - Nice.

台阶上的三行字为拉丁文 意为"如果你总想要诬陷"

如果

你总想要

诬陷

你们犯了什么事
So, what are you in for?

因为我两腿之间有根鸡鸡
Because I got- I got a big, you know, penis between my legs.

你做了什么
What- what- what are you in for?

女人所能犯下的最深的罪
The worst crime a female can commit.

Veronica Ann Bennett 因难看的刘海 我宣判你有罪
Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs.

你发现没 刘海难看的人名字总是有三个字
You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names?

你在此被判处沉默刑
You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment!

这一点也不吓人好吗
This is gonna be cake.

Jackie
Jackie!

来自地球的Rick和Summer
Rick and Summer of Earth,

因为你们对女人性的背叛
for the crimes of treason against womankind

以及发出我们不使用的声音
and for creating the sound of which we do not speak

因为这种声音根本不存在
because it does not exist.

我在此判处你们
You're hereby sentenced to-

啥啥啥 在沙发上过夜吗
What, what, what- a night on the couch?

死刑
...Death.

我现在恨死你了
I hate you so much right now.

这是我们这么多年来的第一例死刑
This will be the first instance of capital punishment

因为我们的卓越 已经500年没有过死刑了
in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness,

所以我们只能即兴发挥了
so we are forced to improvise.

我们在那边的岩架上放了一块巨石
We placed a large boulder on that ledge.

天啦 你们打算用巨石压死我们
Holy shit! Y-y-you're gonna crash us with a boulder?

不是 别打岔
No! Stop interrupting!

巨石会落到杠杆装置上
The boulder falls onto a lever

然后弹出刀刃
that will lauch knives.

啥 给我把枪让我把自己崩了吧
What? Just give me a gun. I'll kill myself.

别打岔了 然后刀刃会
Stop interrupting! The knives will-

好吧 你一开始说对了
Fine! You were right the first time, okay?

巨石会压死你们
The boulder crushes you.

我只是不想承认 高兴了吗
I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy?

别这样 别理他们 别理他们就好
No, just ignore them. Ignore them.

真是个混球
Such an asshole.

对不起 Summer
Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

我没有尽到责任 害你让我们卷入了这种事
I feel bad that I let you drag us into this.

我这个外公当得不够好
I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you，

还有 发自内心的说
and, you know, for what it's worth,

上衣很可爱 你穿着很好看
that is a really nice, cute top that you're wearing there.

上衣 我的上衣 就是你之前称赞过的那件上衣
Top. My top. The same top you complimented earlier!

看标签 看上面的字
Look- Look at the tag. Read it.

上面写着"Marc Jacobs"
It says, "Marc Jacobs".

Marc Jacobs 美国知名服装设计师 已出柜

Marc Jacob
Marc? Jacob?

这不是男人的名字吗
These are names of the penis.

没错 一个地球男人设计了这件上衣
Yes. An Earth man made this top.

或许在你们的星球上 性别隔离是对的
Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do,

但有一部分男性是作为同性恋出生在地球上的
But on Earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay,

所以我的衣服才比你们所有人的衣服都好看
which is why my clothes are better than all of yours.

创造时尚的男人
A man made something fashionable?

这是事实 有时候事实是残酷的
It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts,

但它必须被接受 就好比我跟你说
but it must be accepted, like if I told you

你粉底的颜色选错了
that you're using the wrong color foundation for you skin

而且到脖子那儿就没了
and it ends at your neck,

你看着就跟派对小丑一样
making you look like a party clown.

好吧 我记住了
Okay, ouch. Noted.

但如果你们把格索尔帕索普星的法律强加在地球上
But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazor's laws on Earth,

那你们比这个乱发出屁声的男人也好不到哪儿去
you're no better than the man whose farts shall remain unspoken.

如果你们觉得我的上衣很好看 那你们就不能处死我们
And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute.

很好 给这些地球人一艘太空船
Very well. Give the Earth people a spacecraft

让他们回那个奇怪的星球去吧
so they may head back to their weird planet,

那里男女平等 但又不尽然
where women are kind of equal but not really.

干得好 Summer 谢谢了 妹子们
Good job, Summer. And thanks, girls.

我跟你说 你们这些妹子真是厉害啊
You know, you girls are really something, I'll tell you that.

我刚到这儿的时候
You know, when we first got here, I was like...

给他们艘飞船 快点
Give them a ship now.

小Morty 你在抽烟
Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

这样可不行
That is not okay!

你能干嘛 禁我足吗
What are you gonna do? Ground me?

反正我也不能出去
I can't go outside anyway!

那又怎么样 你可以在屋子里玩啊
So what?! You could do things inside!

你可以弹吉他啊 你可以手淫啊
You could play guitar. You could masturbate.

我不想手淫 我想征服地球
I don't want to masturbate. I want to conquer the planet!

又来了
Oh, here we go again!

如果你征服了地球 谁还会爱你呢 小Morty
Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr.?!

爱 你就只关心爱
Love, that's all you care about!

那武器呢 统治敌人呢
What about weapons?! What about domination of the enemy?!

够了 不许再看历史频道了
All right, that's it. No more history channel!

这台电视只许用来看动画和玩电子游戏
This TV is for cartoons and video games only!

我讨厌电子游戏
I hate video games!

给我收回这句话 把遥控器给我
You take that back! Give it to me! Ugh!

我不是故意的
I-I-I didn't mean, I didn't mean that.

我真的不是故意的 对不起
I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

我受不了了
I can't take this anymore!

我宁愿呼吸毒气也不愿意再和你多待一分钟
I'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you!

不不不 不要
No! No, no, no! Stop!

我的人生就是一个谎言
My life has been a lie!

上帝已死
God is dead!

政府烂透了
The government's lame!

感恩节其实是屠杀印第安人的节日
Thanksgiving is about killing Indians!

耶稣不是出生在圣诞的
Jesus wasn't born on Christmas!

他们改了日期
They moved the date!

这是异教徒的节日
It was a pagan holiday!

爸
Oh, dad!

怎么了 Morty
Yes, Morty?

我儿子要占领地球 我却还不到开车的年龄
My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive!

你能帮我把他找回来吗
Can you help me get him back?!

可以吧 Morty 应该可以吧
I suppose, Morty. I suppose.

不过呢 先让我从这"早告诉你了"的高杯中啜饮一口
But first, a deep sip from a very tall glass of "I told you so."

天啊 得了吧
Oh, my god! Please, dad! Come on!

废弃工厂

禁止入内

爸 他在那儿
Dad, there he is!

天啊 快住手
Oh, God. Hey, stop that!

天啊 天啊 爸
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Dad!

小Morty 不要
Morty Jr., no!

是我啊 是爸爸 没事的
It's me! It's dad. It's okay!

把车放下 小Morty
Put the car down, Morty Jr.

不 不 小手在哪里
No! No! Wh-where's your hands?

*小手在哪里*
*Where's your hands?*

我的车
My car!

*我们来玩挥挥手*
*And that's how we play handy hands*

闪开 Morty
Out of the- out of the way, Morty!

- 不  - Morty 这是全宇宙最暴力的生物之一
- No! - Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe!

他是我儿子
He's my son!

你想要伤害他 就先夸过我的尸体吧 Rick
And if you hurt him, you'll have to kill me, Rick!

爸 我好迷茫
Dad, I'm so confused!

我知道 小Morty 对不起
I know, Morty Jr. I'm sorry.

我最后还是像我父母对我那样 和你撒谎 对你大喊大叫了
I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me.

父母也不过是有了小孩的孩子罢了
You know, parents are just kids having kids.

前一分钟 你还觉得那个闪闪的机器人很好看
One minute, you like how a shiny robot looks.

下一分钟 你就在和你的外星儿子肉搏了
The next minute, you're in a fist fight with your alien son.

我是外星人
I'm an alien?

我们都有糟糕的冲动 邪恶的念头
We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts.

我们只是要学会把它们传变成别的有用的东西
We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive.

但我想杀掉我看见的每一个人
But I want to murder everyone I see.

说不定就有一份工作适合有这样想法的人呢
Well, you know, I mean, maybe there's a job out there for people that feel that way.

的确是有的
Actually, there is.

嗨 我是Brad Aderson 全国连载的连环漫画《大丹麦狗马默杜克》的作者
Hi. I'm Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Marmaduke".

你应该考虑从事创作
You should consider being a creative.

我深受自己那些无法控制的念头的困扰
I'm haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of

我几乎每天脑海中萦绕着致残和性侵
mutilations and sexual assaults on a near daily basis.

但我把它们变为了我的作品
But, you know, I channel it all into my work.

哦 哇
Oh. Wow.

我看《大丹麦狗马默杜克》的时候从没发现这一点啊
Huh. I never got that impression from reading "Marmaduke".

难道你觉得我在想方设法地让你笑吗
Well, did you get the impression that I was trying to make you laugh?

不是吧 那是Brad Anderson
Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson.

看见了吗 你听到了吧 小Morty
Aw, see? You hear that, Morty Jr.?

或许你也可以从事某种创作呢
Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind.

或许吧
Maybe!

我一直都挺想让自己的脸出现在某本小说的背面
I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel.

虽然我真正想做的是割开别人的喉咙 但除了这个
I mean, what I really want to do is slit people's throats, but beyond that...

你一定可以的 儿子
I know you can do it, son.

我想我该找个地方自己住了
I think it's time I get a place of my own.

我保证 只要我缺钱或是没地方洗衣服了都会给你打电话的
I promise I'll call you every day I need money or a place to do
laundry.

我想你儿子会拿他小说的稿费赔我的车后轴的吧
So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?

挺有趣的吧 Summer 我们做了这么多事
Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did,

都没起什么作用 没有什么意义
nothing really mattered and there was no point to it?

是不是让你什么都没有思考
Kind of makes you wonder, huh, about nothing?

你确定你不会重新考虑下
Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy

你不带女孩子去冒险这件事
about taking girls on adventures?

不 鉴于我们今天的经历
No. I'd say, given what we've been through,

我只想说我一直都是对的
that I was right the whole time

任何关于性别政策的感悟
and any epiphanies about gender politics

都只是你身为女性的不安全感的表现而已
were a projection of your feminine insecurity.

不过你把这艘粉色太空船拿去吧
But, hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship?

开着它到处转转 好好玩玩
Go ride around and have a jolly old time.

这样说不定你就会闭嘴了
Maybe that'll shut you up.

爸 Summer 这么长时间你们跑哪儿去了
Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time?

在格索尔帕索普星 你呢
On Gazorpazorp. Where were you?

我在看报纸
I was reading a newspaper.

真有意思 Beth
Oh, that's interesting, Beth.

好玩的是
You know, it's funny.

我也听说了点儿新闻
I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself.

看着 听着
Take a look. T-take a listen.

Wubba lubba dub dubs

You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white,

呃 负罪感 白人负疚感

White Guilt 一些白人因种族和殖民主义而背负的个人或集体的内疚感 这个词通常带有贬义

Milk-toast piece of human garbage.

天哪 格索尔菲猫 这太 你懂的
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's, you know,

你平时我就挺刻薄的 但都没这个刻薄
you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.

我[哔]才不管
I don't give a [Bleep].

我[哔]是格索尔菲猫 贱人
I'm Gazorpazorp[Bleep]filed, bitch.

快[哔]把肉馅玉米卷饼给我
Now give me [Bleep] enchiladas.

嘿 Rick 他们找了Bill Murray给这个配音吗
Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this?

Bill Murray 美国演员 为2004年电影《加菲猫》以及2006年的续作中的加菲配音

听起来好像Bill Murray啊
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

不 Morty 这是Lorenzo Music
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

Lorenzo Music 1982-1994年间为动画片《加菲猫》配音 在我们的时间线里 他在2001年去世了

在那个世界里他还活着
In this reality, he's still alive.

好吧 他是叫"Lorenzo Music"吗
Oh, okay. Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

没错 我很确定
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

他也给"捉鬼敢死队"里那人配过音
He also did the voice of that one guy from "Ghostbusters",

Lorenzo Music配音的是动画《The Real Ghostbusters》(1986-1991) Bill Murray出演的是电影(1984)

挺奇怪的
which is really strange

因为Bill Murray在电影里扮演的就是那个角色
because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie.

后来他们给加菲猫拍电影的时候
But then, when they made the movie,

Bill Murray又给格索尔菲猫 我是说加菲猫 配的音
Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp- or Garfield, I mean.

真有意思 Rick
Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick.

那这些事也有在那个平行世界里发生吗
So all that happened in this reality, too?

我哪知道
I don't know.

只是和你闲聊而已 Morty
Just making conversation with you, Morty.

怎么 你觉得我我我什么都知道吗
What, you think I'm a- I'm- I know everything about everything?

你真的说服了我放弃堕胎吗
Did you really talk me out of the abortion?

我们 我们在去诊所的路上轮胎爆了
Well, we- we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.

我以为 在我的脑海里
I think, in my head,

我的坚持都是为了孩子
I was doing it all for the kids.

而现在大女儿却要去捣腾绿松石了
And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise.

那不是冰毒的代号就是啥搞冰毒的办法
Which is either code for crystal meth or a gateway to it.

所以我们根本没为孩子做什么
So we didn't do the kids any favors.

所以我们还在一起是为了对方 不然
So we should stay together for each other and ourselves or...

不然
Or...

男人 女人 现在又来了象鼻人
Man, woman, and now trunkman?

重现场景 但绝对真实

我们知道科学已经创造出了有象鼻的人
We know science has created men that have a trunk

使他们和男性与女性伴侣都可以发生性行为
that allows them to have sex with both male and female parteners.

重现场景 但绝对真实

但我们不希望这些人结婚
But we don't like the idea of these people getting married.

坚持底线吧 各位
Put a line in the sand, everybody.

为XW2提案投上反对的一票
Vote "no" on proposition XW2

就是提出象鼻人可以结婚的那个
The act that says trunkpeople can get married.

谁需要呢
Who needs it?

大家好
Hi.

我是一个象鼻人 我想要
I'm a trunkperson and I want,

我也像你们一样能感受到内心的爱
I feel love in my heart, too, just like you.

我希望能同时向一个男人和一个女人表达这份爱
I want to be able to express that love with both a man and a woman.

但如果Denny和Denny合唱团得逞的话 我就没法这样了
And I won't be able to, if Denny and the Denny Singers get their way.

嘿 就让象鼻人做爱结婚吧 听到没
Hey, let the trunkpeople have sex and get married, huh?

由象鼻人赞助播出
Paid for by turnkpeople.

我都要留着自己吃
I'm keeping them all for me.

Last bite.

现在它们都舒舒服服地待在我的肚子里啦
Oh now they're all resting comfortably in my stomach.

哦 感觉真是太棒了
Ooh, am I feeling good.

不 走开
No! Get away from me!

离我远点
Get away from me!

已经没有草莓小粒粒了 不
There's no more strawberry snibbles, no!

上帝啊 上帝啊
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

好痛啊
It hurts!

我的内脏都露出来了
My entrails are out!

都这样了你们为啥还想吃
Why would you even want to eat these?

都泡在我的胃酸里了
They're soaked with my stomach acid.

哦 上帝 主啊 救世主
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lord, Savior,

圣灵啊 救救我吧
and Spirit, save me.

但很高兴你克服了这个心理障碍
But I'm proud of you that you did it.

谢谢 警长

然后木星
And then Jupiter...

其实 冥王星好像不是行星
Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto is a Planet.

儿子 冥王星当然是行星
Of course Pluto is a planet, son.

我三年级就知道了
I learned that in the third grade.

啊 对 但是后来有人改了
Well, yeah, but you know they changed it.

Morty 行星这种事怎么会改呢
Morty, nobody changed the planets.

我刚在谷歌上查了
I just Googled it.

冥王星不是行星
Pluto is not a planet.

2006年就改了
They changed it in 2006.

对 这个我听说了
Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

你不同意
You disagree?

不同意
That's right.

科学中产生分歧很正常 Morty
It's possible to disagree in science, Morty.

冥王星以前是行星
Pluto was a planet.

后来被一些自以为是的狗屁委员会否定了
Some committee of fancy assholes disagree.

我否定回去 把乒乓球给我
I disagree back. Give me a Ping-Pong ball.

好
Um, okay.

我 我要去
I-I just have to...

去找Rick 然后背着我说冥王星的事吗
Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto?

Oh. Okay, good.

这一定会很好玩的
This is gonna be fun.

Morty 让我 让我
Hey, Morty, let me let me let me

问你个问题

这世上有邪力吗 如果有
Does Evil exist, and if so,

有办法检测和测量吗
can one detect and measure it?

呃
Um...

这是个设问句 Morty
Rhetorical question, Morty.

答案是"有并且可以 只要你是天才"
The answer's "yes, you just have to be a genius."

真赞
Cute.

你姐的老板给了我这个显微镜
Your sister's boss give me a microscope

这东西会使让我变成弱智
that would have made me retarded.

噢 噢 天啊 Rick
Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick.

我觉得你不该用这个词
I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know?

Morty 我没有对残障人士不敬的意思
Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled.

我是在陈述事实 如果我用了这显微镜
I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope,

这东西就会使我的智商降低
it would have made me mentally retarded.

That's retarded(真逊 真差劲)
常因为暗含对残障人士的不尊重而被认为是"政治不正确"的话
retard一词本指先天残障 后引申出"糟糕 愚蠢"之意

Rick 我说的不是逻辑问题
Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick.

我觉得这个词已经变成了某些自己以为是的政治集团
I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups

拿来说事儿的东西了
that feel like they're doing the right thing.

真扯淡
That's retarded.

你们在说什么
What are you guys talking about?

显然 啥都没说
Apparently, nothing.

你问他冥王星是不是行星了对吧
You asked him if Pluto is planet, didn't you?

- 没有  - 不是
- No! - It's not.

闭嘴 Rick
Shut up, Rick.

哇啊
Whoa.

我不管别人说什么
I don't care what anyone says.

如果它以前可以是行星 那现在也可以
If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again.

行星 行星 行星 行星
Planet, planet, planet, planet.

科学一点吧 Jerry
Stay scientific, Jerry.

这瓶须后水的确让女人为我倾倒

你可以拿回去了
Here. You can have this back.

你没有用吗
You didn't use it?

我当然用了 用来开发了这个
Sure I did, to develop this.

能让丑女人变美但会让她们失明的美容霜

真漂亮
That's beautiful.

你知道三小时后就变成它穿着你了吗
You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours?

你是想让我报警吗
Do I need to call the police?

拿去 你可以用我的电话
Here, you can use my phone.

别担心
Don't worry.

它不会让你失聪的 我又不是黑心商

至少他在社区很活跃
At least he's active in the community.

What do you do?

你吃我们的 然后做些小玩意

- I'd rather not, actually.  - Yes, perhaps not during business hours.

我说了 我要填写冥王星是行星的声明
I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet.

那我儿子的科学课就要挂科了
Well, then my son's going to fail his science class,

如果那样的话
and when that happens,

我第一个起诉的就是你们
I'm suing you first.

我算明白NASA里的"A"是什么意思了
I think I know what the "A" in NASA stands for.

爸爸 你这游戏最后打算怎么办
Dad, what's your endgame?

这不是游戏 傻瓜
Ain't no game, sucka.

我就做一个八颗行星的太阳系不好吗
Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets?

不是还简单些吗
It's even easier.

当然 那我们为什么不直接把伽利略烧死在刑柱上
Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake

因为他说太阳是圆的

科学并不总是那么简单的 Morty
Science isn't always easy, Morty.

Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?!

我是小疯疯国王 冥王星的统治者
I'm King Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto.

我们在例行监视你们星球的时候偶然发现了你
We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world.

你真是给了航空航天局的人点颜色啊
You really gave it to those guys at NASA.

我只是 你懂的 有时候科学有关信念
I was...you know, sometimes science is about conviction.

我要向你们介绍一些非常赞同你们的人
I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.

哦 我
Oh, I...

冥王星的子民们
Plutonians.

Jerry Smith是地球来的科学家
Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth,

他正在创造一个太阳系的模型

Jerry 向冥王星宣布你的决定
Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision.

呃 冥王星是个行星
Um...Pluto's a planet.

冥王星是个[哔]行星 贱人
Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch!

天哪
Oh, man.

他的脑子绝对会被冲昏
This is definitely gonna go to his head.

好商店 好地方 再见
Great store. Great Place. Bye.

好吧
Huh. Okay.

说实话 summer 我本以为你外公闹了一通以后
I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst.

会影响我的生意
would have disrupted business,

但这真是塞勒姆女巫审判以来我过得最好的周末了
But this is the best weekend I've had since Salem.

真棒 那中午吃"美满康"怎么样
Nice. "Wholesome Delight" for lunch?

Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?

哇哦 哇 悠着点 亲爱的
Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

还有什么限制吗
Oh, is there a limit?

都是免费的 对吧
Everything is free, right?

这么说吧 你付的确实不是钱
Let's just say you don't pay... with money.

说得真好
That was perfect.

你会以被诅咒为代价 对吧
You pay with the curses, right?

呃 但 Tate太太你为何想要被诅咒的东西
Um... I, well... but, Mrs. Tate why do you want cursed items?

我会去"诅咒净"移除诅咒的
Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at "Curse Purge Plus."

就那个在电视上的家伙
You know, the guy on TV?

什么
What?

你有从一家神秘的古董店或是
Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff

二手店收到些稀奇古怪的玩意吗
from a mysterious antique or thrift store

这些东西可以给你神力但却以出乎预料的方式狠[哔]了你
that gives you powers but [Bleep] you in unforeseeable ways?

把东西带来"诅咒净"
Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus."

我靠科学收钱解咒
I use science to un-curse the items for cash,

然后你可以继续保有神力
and you get to keep the powers.

这家伙得了双可让他跑得飞快的神奇运动鞋
This guys got mysterious sneaker to make him run faster, but guess what?

但他必须以跑至生命的尽头为代价 这就一文不值了
He would have to run until he died,making them worthless.

我解了咒 让这鞋值
I remove the curse, making them worth, like,

说不好 800万美元
I don't know, 8 million dollars?

奥林匹克见
See you at the olympics.

这个有诡异智力的玩偶会威胁要杀死带走它的那家人

一切皆可减免
Everything's deductible.

再不需要出卖灵魂来换取好东西

欢迎回到"早安 冥王星"
We're back on "Good moring, Pluto."

让我们欢迎今早的来宾 地球科学家Jerry smith
And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry smith,

他的大胆宣言已经登上头条 那就是
who's making headlines with his bold announcement, that is,

是什么 Jerry
What? Jerry?

冥王星是一颗行星
Pluto is a planet.

- 快听听  - 说得好
- Well, how about that.  - I love it.

Morty Smith 我叫关德宽
Morty Smith, I'm Scroopy noopers.

我是一名科学家
I'm a scientist.

我能带你去看样东西吗
Can I show you something?

还是免了吧
Uh, I better not.

立马来
Right now.

这是冥王星的地下中心 Smith先生
The center of Pluto, Mr.Smith,

它是由钚(以冥王星命名)构成的
is made of a substance called "Plutonium".

这些矿井开采钚并传输到整个城市
Mines like these suck plutonium up to the cities,

大公司将其用作能量供给
where corporations use it to power everything,

从钻石汽车到黄金浴室
from diamond cars to golden showers.

不断地开采导致冥王星不断地萎缩
And the more we remove, the more pluto shrinks.

就像这样 又缩小了一点
There it goes again. Just shrank a little.

但是几年前 你们的科学家注意到了冥王星的不断变小
But a few years ago, your scientists noticed pluto had gotten so small,

已经不能再称为一颗行星了
they couldn't even call it a planet anymore.

事实上冥王星是因为当初科学家对其质量计算错误误将其归为行星

那本该是敲醒我们的警钟
Should've been our wake-up call.

但那些冥王星的富人们却不愿清醒
But the rich plutonians won't wake up,

他们十分喜欢你爸爸告诉所有人冥王星还是颗行星
and they love your dad telling everyone pluto's a planet,

因为这就意味着他们还能继续开采
because that means they can keep mining

直到冥王星从行星变为小行星 然后是流星 最终变为...
until pluto goes from planet to asteroid, to meteor, and finally...

派对吗
A party?

你们家的人都是傻子吗
Is everyone in your family an idiot?

反正我和我爸是
Well, for sure me and my dad are.

好吧 你要做的就是让他承认这个说法
Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that,

那样你就能够拯救40亿人的生命
and you could save four billion lives.

好吧 但问题是 我爸很没有安全感
Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure.

有意思
Hmm, funny.

所需先生 店里这么多东西
Mr.Needful, out of everything in the store,

猴爪 出自 W. W. Jacobs的同名短篇惊悚小说 其中的猴爪可以满足三个愿望 但每一个愿望都会带来不可预料的代价

你绝对猜不到没被卖掉的居然是这件
you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of.

哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

天哪
Oh, my god.

我希望这个桌子能变轻点
I wish this desk  was lighter.

我希望这个扣结能变松点
I wish this knot was looser.

赶紧的
Come on.

我不
I don't...

我在做什么傻事呢
Wait, what am I doing?

我希望我会做心肺复苏
I wish I knew CPR.

1 2 3 1 2 3
1 2 3, 1 2 3...

哦 天啊
Oh, jesus.

猴抓这么用可真是浪费
What a waste of a monkey paw.

所需先生 你怎么能做这么可怕的事呢
Mr Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible.

我是魔鬼啊
I'm the devil.

我失败了还能怎么办 吃个冰淇林吗
What should I do when I fail, get myself an ice cream.

你还没有失败
You haven't failed.

像Rick这种人让我一无是处
People like Rick are making me obsolete.

说实话
I mean, seriously.

我也许是个魔鬼 但你外公他才是真正的魔鬼
I may be "the devil", but your grandpa is the devil.

我只想回地狱
I just want to go to the hell,

那里所有人都觉得我聪明又有趣
where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny.

不 这不公平
No! It's not fair.

这个镇上所有的人都从你这儿得到了想要的东西 包括Rick
Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick.

我是你唯一的朋友 我什么都得不到吗
I was your only friend, and I get nothing?

好吧 我会给你一样东西
Ok, I'll give you one thing.

说吧
Name it.

我想要帮助你
I want to help you.

这招漂亮
Clever twist.

我可是师从高人 你个老混蛋
I learned from the best, you old fart.

现在我们给你补水去
Now, let's get you hydrated.

这看起来是个 被诅咒的拳击手套
Looks like we've got...haunted boxing gloves

能让你获得1936年的重量级拳击冠军
that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936,

之后你就会困在那里 不断赢同一场比赛直到永远
and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity.

我可以弄掉"永远"的诅咒和没用的部分
I can take out the "eternity" and the padding,

你就有一个可以穿越时空的连指手套了
and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens.

Rosemary's Baby 1968年经典恐怖电影

这不是"魔鬼圣婴"吗
Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.

生意怎么样
How's business?

这是我们最后的库存
Here's the last of our inventory.

我们准备申请破产 然后重组
We're going to file chapter11 and do some restructuring.

这意思不就是"你赢了 Rick"
Sounds like code for "you win, Rick".

这就对你这么重要吗
That was important to you, wasn't it.

不 这对你那蠢恶魔朋友非常重要
Nope, It was important to your dumb devil friend.

对我来说 这不过是像
To me, this was all just a bit,

兔八哥里的一集 兔八哥扮作指挥家狠狠作弄了一个歌剧演员

兔八哥恶整歌剧家20分钟而已
like when bugs bunny [bleep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes.

他差点自杀
He tried to kill himself.

真的 哎哟我的老天爷啊
Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.

但你知道吗 Rick外公
But, you know what,grandpa Rick?

他很坚强 他决不放弃
He's strong, and he's vever going to give up.

好吧 我可不在乎
Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.

我知道
Oh, I know.

所有人都知道你不在乎
Everyone knows you don't care.

怎样
So?

那祝你不在乎的愉快
So have fun not caring.

我一直愉快
I always do.

很好
Good.

没错 好得很
Yeah, It is good.

再好不过
It's the best.

可不是么 拜
I'm sure it is. Bye.

回见
Later.

我来取我的亡灵猫和小孩
I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.

好的 稍等
Yeah, uh...give me a sec.

这是员工们的健康计划的表单
These are the forms for the employee health plan.

好吧 把它们放在我的...呃
All right,Put them on my...eh

我玩腻了 都走吧
I just get board. Everybody out.

好了 这次集会结束后
All right, just one more rally

咱们就回去做你的科学作业
then I promise we'll get back to your science project.

爸 冥王星不是一颗行星 大公司在让它不断缩小
Dad, pluto isn't a planet. It's shrinking because of corporations.

好吧 这不是那个反行星的极端疯子关德宽
Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job scroopy noppers was screaming

在筹资部外面嚷嚷的吗
about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser.

你是想说四十亿冥王星人都错了
Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?

你说过科学并不简单
You said science wasn't easy.

我说的是科学并不总是简单的
I said science isn't always easy.

很显然 这意味着有时候会很简单
Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy.

我们别纠结这个文字游戏了 儿子
Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son.

爸 整个行星危在旦夕
Dad, their whole planet is dying.

哈 你刚叫它行星
Ha, you called it a planet.

将军
Checkmate.

你们好啊 冥王星众们
What's up, pluto?

Smith先生 麻烦把你刚才和我说的和我朋友在说一遍 来吧
Mr.Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me. Go on.

我那热情的母亲刚刚给我上了九根腌瓜 其中一根就是冥王星
My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is pluto.

天哪 他可真是个天才
My god, the man's a genius.

打扰一下
Um, excuse me.

Morty 怎么了
Morty, what?

爸 你怎么看最近发表在《冥王星科普》上的报告
Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by 《The Pluto Science Reader》

"地心钚元素开采是造成星球地震 地表陷落及萎缩的罪魁祸首"
"linking pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinking to deep-core plutonium drilling?"

儿子 那你怎么看你5岁时拉在自己的裤子上后
Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants,

把沾上粑粑的小裤裤扔出的卧室窗外
and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window,

因为你认为这就跟扔垃圾一样
because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?

我修剪树篱时就看见它挂在上面
I mean, I'm trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there.

难道要让我以为这是屎兔兔干的
Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?

说得真好 爸
Good one, Dad.

嘿 Morty 你想去...噢
Hey, Morty, you want to go on a...oh.

W-w-what's going on?

你能帮我做那个破科学作业吗
Listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project?

随便吧
Whatever.

Jerry 你现在一定非常兴奋吧
Jerry, you must be so excited.

冥贝尔奖可是科学家能获得的最高荣誉啊
The Pluo-Bel Prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive.

真是荣幸又不太好意思呢
I'm flattered and humbled.

这句不错 发表感言的时候记得用上
I like that.Use that in your sppech.

还有 提一下冥王星是行星这事 人们可喜欢了
Also, talk about Pluto being a planet. People like that.

殿下 我们逮到关德宽了
Your Highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers.

你是不能扼杀事实的 父亲
You can't kill the truth, father.

- 什么  - 我能理解你的困惑

冥塔那摩湾是个军事监狱 玩个文字游戏
Pluotonamo Bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words.

他刚刚叫你"爸爸"吗
Did he call you "father"?

关德宽 那个反行星狂热份子是你儿子

The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry.

冥王星是个冷冰冰的矮行星啊
Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.

是个什么?
It's a what?

Huh? Oh, planet.

"冥王星是个冷冰冰的行星" 我是这个意思
"Pluto is a cold, cold planet." That's what I meant.

快去让他们欢呼尖叫吧
Knock them dead out there, you.

冥王星
Pluto is...

不是一颗行星
not a planet.

它不是一颗行星
It's not a plant.

扎克伯格曾将facebook共同创始人排挤出公司
I was zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.
原意 扎克伯格毛还没长齐我就在干这种翻脸不认人的事了

我翻脸的速度可是比翻书还快啊
I was zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.

我可是魔鬼啊 婊子
I'm the devil, bitch! What, what.

我靠
Hey!

Morty
Hey, Morty.

爸 你怎么这么快就从冥王星回来了
Oh, hey dad. What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?

总是有些人接受不了事实
Some people just can't handle the truth.

特别是像我一样的傻子
Especially dummies like me.

Morty 我知道我没有外公Rick这么聪明
Morty, I'm not as smart as your Grandpa Rick,

但我保证再也不会因为这个给你添麻烦了
but I promise never to make that your problem again.

爸 没有人比Rick还聪明
Hey, dad. Nobody is smarter than Rick.

但是也没人能取代你是我爸的事实啊 在这点上你比谁都在行
But nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that.

哇
Wow...

这真是荣幸又不太好意思呢 儿子 谢谢你
That's...humbling and flattering, son. Thank you

我们一起把那8大行星太阳系模型做完吧
What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system?

我还是把这个交上去拿个"A"就好了啦
Um... I'm just gonna take this in and get an "A."

- 黄油  - 但是...
- Butter - But...

作为一个爸爸 你比谁都在行
You're a genius at being my dad, dad.

所以不要再计较了
Quit while you're a head.

还有 下次进来时记得敲门
And also, knock next time, you know.

我是说 我正在房间里 我都14了
I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14.

我面前放着一台电脑
I got a computer in here, you know.

我想我懂你的意思
Oh... I think I understand.

你这样不敲门就进来 真的是在玩火哦
You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.

懂了啦 不用再说了
I get it, say no more.

总有一天啊
I mean, one of these days, you know.

你会看见...
You're gonna end up seeing something...

我知道了 记住了啦 晚安
I got it! Noted! Good night.

你的那个代理外公怎样了
How's your pretend Grandpa doing?

别称 "恶魔"
AKA "The Devil."

- 他把我甩了  - 那还真是对不起啊
- He dumped me. - Sorry.

我们是有学到什么我没有领悟的大道理吗
Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing?

不确定
Not sure.

或许往深层次想
Maybe in a much bigger way,

所需先生同样满足了我们两个的愿望
Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted.

我一直嫉妒你和Morty成天在一起
Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty,

而你也没有意识过 其实你很重视我对你的肯定
and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval.

- 不 这太蠢了  - 是啊 一点满足感都没有
- No, that's dumb. - Yeah, not satisfying.

不过嘛 如果你只是想得到满足感的话
I'll tell you what though, if it's satisfaction you're after,

我有个好主意
I think I might have an idea.

行啊 我们就这么办吧
Totally, let's do it.

就这样 我把我的店面推上了成功的最前线
And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the front.

谢谢你 西雅图
Thank you, Seattle.

Rick Summer
Rick? Summer?

- 傻逼贱人  - 你个贱婊子
- Stupid mother[Bleep]. - Your stupid bitch.

傻逼贱人 这招如何
Stupid mother[Bleep]. How do you like that?

这招又如何
How do you like that?

为什么
Why?

因为有时候你最需要的 只是让别人付出他们应付的代价
Because sometimes what you really need, is for someone else to pay a horrible price.

- 我们成功了  - 是啊 兄弟  - 太值了
- We did it. - Yeah, Bro. - We totally worth it.

- 圆满搞定呢  - 是啊
- We just pulled it off. - Yeah, Bro.

马丁·路德·金诞辰

Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives.

我要给你做飞碟形煎饼
I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

哦 没这个必要 Beth 正常煎饼就行了
Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.

哦上帝
Oh, my God!

这是怎么回事
Oh, what is happening?!

周年纪念快乐 爸爸
Happy anniversary, dad.

哦 我懂了
Oh, I get it.

正常煎饼就已经像飞碟了
Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.

好吃 其实为了感谢你一直忍受我 我应该给你做早饭的
Mmm. I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.

你应该给我们弄一整家餐厅
You should be making us a whole restaurant.

胡说 有你在身边 我们再开心不过了
Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around.

我只希望能多陪陪你(看见更多的你)
I just wish I got to see more of you.

地球空间C-137的Rick Sanchez
Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension c-137,

你因对平行空间的其他Rick犯下的罪行
you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks

而被跨维度Rick委员会批准逮捕
by the authority of the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.

- 嘿 搞什么鬼  - 冻住Jerry
- Hey! What the heck?! - Neutralize the Jerry.

等等 别 我可以
Wait! No! I'll...

爸爸
Dad!

- 爸爸  - Rick
- Dad! - Rick!

大家别紧张
Everybody, relax.

我认识这些混蛋 我就是这些混蛋
If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes,

他们只想把我拽到他们那傻逼俱乐部
they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse

问几个浪费时间的问题
and waste my time with a bunch of questions.

咱们快把这事儿结了吧
Let's get it over with.

- 带上他的Morty  - 哦天
- Bring his Morty. - Oh, man.

别把我的Morty卷进来
Leave my Morty out of this.

你在拒绝加入委员会的时候就已经失去了说这话的权利
You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-join the Council.

Jerry怎怎怎么办
W-w-w-what about Jerry?

你们至少把我女儿的白痴解冻了行吗
Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

给你任何东西
...give you anything!

我收藏了很多珍稀古董钱币 拜托别伤害我
I have a rare antique-coin collection! Just don't hurt me!

好吧 可能不是古董 但也是限量版铸币呢
Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting.

上面印的小R2-D2取代了乔治华盛顿
They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington.

R2-D2 星球大战系列中出现的机器人角色

咱们儿子被拐走了
Our son's been abducted!

我买那些硬币你一直很不满
You hate me for buying those coins!

天哪 Rick 这是什么地方
Geez, Rick, w-what is this place?

Rick们的大本营
The citadel of Ricks.

这是Rick委员会的秘密总部
It's the secret headquarters for the Council of Ricks.

Rick委员会
Council of Ricks?

戏仿The Council of Reeds 由多个平行宇宙的Reed Richards组成的委员会(神奇四侠里的神奇先生)

你知道的 Morty 我在宇宙中树敌无数 他们视我的天才为威胁
As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat,

包括星系恐怖分子 下星系独裁者 和多数跨星系政府
galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government.

只有是有蠢驴的地方 就有人看我不爽
W-w-wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa,

而且不同平行宇宙里不同版本的我都是这样
and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem,

所以有几千个我傻逼一样地想凑在一起
so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together

像牛群 鱼群
like a herd of cattle or a school of fish

或者在雅虎知道上回答问题的人一样
or those people who answer questions on Yahoo! answers.

嘿 居然有牛仔版的我
Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me.

你真是没见过世面
Geez, you're easy to impress.

没错 大多数时间线都有个Rick 而大多数Rick都有个Morty
Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty.

这地方就是个你和我的名人录
This place is a real who's who of who's you and me.

快用Morty闪耀胸章把你无聊的旧Morty
Turn your boring, old Morty into a f...

变成热辣的时尚宣言吧
hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers.

嘿 看这个
Hey, check this out.

- 给我Morty  - 傻死了
- Show me the Morty. - Dumb.

打扰一下 先生 你为你的Morty投保了吗
Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured?

- 要知道 每年都有成百上千的Morty受伤  - 滚
- You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured... - Back off!

我不喜欢这地方
Not my cup of tea, this place.

我认为作为一个Rick而存在 重点就是作为"一个"Rick
I say the point of being a Rick is being A Rick.

把你的反Rick言论留给Rick委员会听吧 恐怖Rick分子
Save your anti-Rick speech for the Council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

嘿 把你的Rick规则留给Rick小绵羊吧 蠢猪Rick
Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

[哔]我啊 哥们
[Bleep] me, pal.

[哔]你 不不不不不 [哔]我啊
[Bleep] you? No, no, no, no, no, [Bleep] me.

把全息图呈上来
Bring up the holograms.

有27个Rick在自己的平行空间里被残忍杀害
27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines,

空前猖獗的对Rick的屠杀
an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic.

你还有什么可说的 地球C-137的Rick
What say you, Earth Rick c-137?

你觉得是我干的
You think I did this?

为什么每次有Rick踢到了脚趾总是我先被抓来
Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?

你有不和委员会合作的前科
You have a history of non-cooperation with the Council.

没错 那个以前被称作Rick的科学家不也是吗
Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick.

为为为什么他没被抓过来铐住
W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs?

因为他也死了
Because he's dead, too!

你还想让我们审问谁 你最符合凶手的特征
Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile.

在所有中央有限曲线上的Rick中
Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve,

你是反抗者 离群者
you're the malcontent, the rogue.

我只是Rick 在组成这个愚蠢的联盟以前 你们也是
I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.

你们想免受政府的迫害 于是你们自己变成了愚蠢的政府
You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government.

所以我比这里的每一个Rick都更像真正的Rick
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

尽情议论吧 混蛋们
Yeah, murmur it up, D-bags.

不好意思 家里还有涂了糖浆的煎饼等着我呢
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them.

马上吸收的糖浆就会把煎饼变成恶心的浆糊了
They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste,

我不想像Andy Rooney一样
and I hate to get all Andy Ronney about it,

Andy Ronney 美国电视新闻节目《60分钟时事杂志》主持人之一

但我认为我们都喜欢一碟松软的糖浆蛋糕
but I think we all like fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top,

而且我们都希望被指责的时候对方拿出证据
and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence!

用加拿大人的话来说 后会有期
So, as they say in Canada, peace oot!

证据 好主意 扫描他的传送门枪
Evidence! Good idea. Scan his portal gun!

哦 拜托 不要看别人的传送门枪历史记录啊
Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's portal-gun history.

谁都去过奇怪的地方
We-we all go to weird places.

没错 但似乎只有你一个人去过所有
Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to

谋杀发生的平行世界和其中谋杀发生的地点
the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred.

什么 那太不合Rick理了 我显然是被陷害的
What?! That's Rick-diculous! I'm obviously being set up.

地球C-137的Rick 委员会判处你受刑于极苦机械
Earth Rick c-137, the Council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom,

你的意识和无意识将被互换
which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds,

使你一切的憧憬都毫无意义 让你所知的一切都无法触及
rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp.

而且 每过十秒它就会扎一次你的蛋蛋
Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls.

我不想再听了
I've heard enough.

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

不不 没叫你
Unh-unh. Not you.

不
No!

啊
Aaaah!

哦 哦
Oh! Oh!

你好 我想点一大份人 加量
Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please.

白人 不不不不 黑人 再加一半西班牙裔
White people. No, no, no, no. Black people. And Hispanic on half.

欢迎来到油腻腻老奶奶世界

人口: 可多了 亲爱的

你好 我想点一大份沙发椅 多加点椅量
Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please.

高脚椅 不不不不 躺椅 和半个轮椅
High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner. And wheelchair on half.

- 哪个门都有可能  - 混...
- They could have gone into anyone of these. - Son of a...

- 天啊  - 哦天  - 我们跟丢了
- Oh, geez. - Oh, man! - We lost 'em.

你好 我想点一大份电话 加量
Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please.

手机 不不不不 旋转式电话 和半个公用电话
Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary. And pay phone on half.

这够他们忙一阵的了
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

他们肯定搞错了吧
Those guys were wrong right?

你不会杀掉你自己的 那些自己
You would not kill yourself... yourselves.

当然不会 Morty
Of course not, Morty.

这对我有啥好处
How could that profit me?

但是的确有人在杀Rick们
But someone out there is killing Ricks,

在我们洗清罪名之前 委员会不会善罢甘休
and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names

得找到真正的Rick杀手
by finding the real Rick-Killer.

我害怕 Rick
I'm scared, Rick.

我们是不是该回家准备点武器 就像《末日生存者》那节目一样
Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons, like that show "Doomsday Preppers."

国家地理频道电视节目

那不是我的风格 Morty
Not really my style, Morty.

而且 家里估计已经全是Rick了
Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now.

听好了 Jerry
All right, listen, Jerry.

如果Rick打电话来 这设备能追踪到他的位置
If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location.

你只需要把时间拖够30秒
You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer.

谁想喝柠檬汁
Who wants lemonade?

噢 太好了
Oh, yeah. Mmm!

哦 好喝
Oh! Delicious!

Beth 你真贤惠
Beth. You're a treasure.

在我的世界里也有一个像你一样的Beth 只不过
I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what?

她没有你那么美丽动人
She's not as brilliant or attractive.

哦 谢谢
Aw. Thank you.

她做到了 做到了
Oh! She did! She did it!

喂
H-hello?

嗨 Jerry 我是Rick
Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

Rick 嗨
Rick! Hey.

你好啊
What's, what's up?

听着 风声太紧 我们没地方可去
So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn,

所以 Morty和我打算把飞船开进黑洞
so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole.

- 什么  - 你能接受得了吧
- What? - Is that cool with you, dawg?

Rick 不 Morty
Rick, no! Morty!!

追踪到了
We got it.

电话来自...
The call's coming from...

这间屋子
inside the house

瞅瞅他的表情 你真傻
Look at his face! You dummy!

真不敢相信我们女儿能嫁给你
Ugh. Can't believe our daughter married you.

太容易了
Too easy!

这帮Rick应该会浪费些时间逗Jerry玩
The Rick are probably gonna waste some time missing with Jerry.

他们起不了什么作用的
They won't be able to help themselves.

但是等他们玩够了 就会来找我们
But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us.

您点的电话蛤蜊和意大利电面配电话丸
Phones a la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls.

- 还需要什么  - 再多来点电话条
- Anything else? - Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

马上来 先生
Right away, sir.

你知道吗 Rick 当我第一次看到那么多Rick和Morty时
You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Morty,

我在想 "天啊 我们的关系一下就不那么独特了"
I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond."

但是仔细想想 我们的关系一定非常特别
But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special

才能让我们跨越无数的时空紧紧相连
to span over all those different time lines.

只能是这样 你是一个掩护
Yeah, it's got to be that way. You're a camouflage.

掩护
Camouflage?

你在说什么 Rick
W-w-w-what are you talking about, Rick?

Rick的天才使得我们的脑电波非常独特且易追踪
Rick have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius.

躲避敌人雷达的最好办法就是
The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is

在一个可以使脑电波互补的人身边 这样就无法被追踪了
to stand near someone with complementary brain wave that make ours invisible.

明白吗 当Rick和Morty在一起时
See, w-w-w-when a Rick I-is with a Morty,

天才的脑电波就被抵消了 因为你有 呃
the genius waves get canceled out by the, Uh...

...Morty脑电波
...Morty waves.

是因为我们的性格非常不同吗
Um... because o-our personalities are so different?

哦 妈的
Oh, shit, dawg.

我的传送枪被人远端入侵了
My portal gun was hacked pemotely, Morty

很明显就是真凶 他想陷害我
Obviously by the real killer, to frame me.

但是我能追踪他的信号
But I was able to track the signal.

快 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

啊 噢
Uh-oh.

打扰了 我们追踪到一对极度危险的罪犯
Excuse me. We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals

就在这里
to this exact location.

他们和我们长得一模一样
They look exactly like us,

为了避免混淆 我们用红叉
so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us

标记自己
each with a red "X" right now.

这样的话 如果谁有枪
That ways, if someone has a gun and we both tell you

而我们都说杀掉另一个"我" 因为他才是那个坏人
to shoot the other one because they're the evil one,

你就知道是谁在说谎了
you'll know who's lying.

嗨 看那
Hey, check it out.

妈的
Damn it!

嗨 你还没给钱呢
Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

红叉 红叉
T-the red "X"! Red "X"!

嗨 还好那家宇宙折扣店 有这款实验室外套
Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats

和你最爱的小黄体恤衫 是吧 Morty
and you favorite kind of shirt in stock, Huh, Morty?

对 Rick 你都说了好几遍了
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time.

你不用老说这个事儿了
You don't have to keep saying it over and over.

这地方真够偏僻的
Man, this place is way off the grid.

这家伙真不想让人发现
This guy does not want to be found.

如果这家伙是Rick 是不是他也需要用Morty来隐藏自己
Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just to stand by a Morty to hide?

Morty不就起这个作用吗
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are

人肉隐身衣
Human cloaking devices?

Morty 你这反应实在是有点小题大做了
Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.

我的天啊 Rick 看
Oh, my god, Rick, look!

有好多人被绑起来 盖满了那栋建筑
There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!

不是人 是Morty们
Not people, Morty. Mortys.

天啊
Oh, god!

为什么有人会这么干
W-w-why would somebody do this?

太残忍了
It's horrible!

想不被官僚体系的走狗发现 一个Morty足够了
Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats,

但你得用一个Morty矩阵 并且让他们极度痛苦
but you get- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain,

才能瞒过其他的Rick [哔]
that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks mother[Bleep]

我以前构想过一个类似的概念
I fiddled with a concept like this once.

理论上 Morty 只是理论上
On paper, Morty. On paper.

我是不会做这种事的 这就是粗劣的浪费和滥用
I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill.

达到相同的效果 完全只需要
I mean, you could accomplish the same result with,

五个Morty和一个跨接电缆
like, five Mortys and a jumper cable.

这我也不会真做的
Which I also wouldn't do!

我只是想表示 他这技术太烂了
I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.

咖啡时间
Coffee time!

好 哟 哟 哟
Yeah! Yo, yo, yo, yo!

就等这个呢
That's what I like to hear!

嗨 Jerry
Hi, Jerry.

别烦我 我在工作
Leave me alone. I'm working.

是吗 你是做什么的
Oh, you are? W-w-w-what do you do?

我是做广告的 待业中
I-I'm, I'm in between advertising jobs.

广告 哇
Advertising? Wow!

就是说 大家不知道自己应该买什么东西 你的工作就是帮助他们
So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then you help them?

要更复杂一点
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

你就是干这个的
Well, I mean, you do it,

而且你看起来干这行就很厉害
and you seem like a guy who really has it all together.

老兄 你是
Dude, are you,

你是在讽刺我 对吗
You're being a dick, right?

哦 天啊 不 不是
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not.

我一点都不想冒犯你
I-I-I wouldn't want to offend you in any way.

你真的是Rick吗
You're really a rick?

我当然是 就像我的Morty是一个Morty一样
Of course I am, just as much as my Morty's a Morty.

嗨 他长得好像《面具》里的Eric Stoltz
Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "Mask."

《面具》 1985年电影 Cher和Eric Stoltz均为主演

故事主角是一个面部严重扭曲的年轻男孩

就是里面有雪儿的那部
You know, the one with Cher in it?

对的 Jerry
That's right, Jerry!

他来自的时空 所有的人长得都像Eric Stoltz的《面具》里的人
He-- he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz "Mask" people.

他是Eric Stoltz面具版Morty
He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

他是被分配给我的 因为我从来没有我自己的小孩
They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own.

但我如果有小孩
But if I did, boy,

我希望他们能像你一样聪明成功
I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.

嗨 瞧啊
Hey, get a load of this.

Jerry在和傻瓜Rick聊天
Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick.

你俩真配
This is perfect.

我不是傻瓜Rick
I'm not boofus Rick!

我是从J19-ZETA-7空间来的Rick
I'm Rick J19-ZETA-7!

噢 那个空间的人不都是吃屎长大的吗
Oh, is that the time line where everybody eats poop?

Jerry 你知道这家伙吃屎吗
Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?

嗨 我不吃屎
Hey, I don't eat poop!

你们总是欺负我
Y-You guys are always so mean to me.

我觉得我应该告诉你 Jerry
I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry.

我是所有Rick当中最差劲的
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

谁说的 其他的你吗
According to who, other versions of you?

要说我这辈子如果明白了什么
If I've learned one thing,

不论你在人生中做什么决定
it's that before you get anywhere in life,

都不要听你自己的
you got to stop listening to yourself.

哇 你真是太有智慧了 Jerry
Wow. you really are wise, Jerry.

所以你才会做广告工作吧
I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising.

你能这么想 你就已经是最棒的Rick了
The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.

你从来就没关心过我
You don't care about me at all!

我和你的外套没任何区别
I'm no different than that jacket you've got on!

或者是你的破传送枪
Y-y-y--o-or your stupid portal gun!

我就是个工具
I'm just a tool!

我 我 我就是个物件
I-I-I'm just an object!

你非要这么较真我也没办法 Morty
Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty.

现在 看在上帝的份上 安静点吧
Now, for the love of god, be quiet.

咱们必须要先发制人
The point of this is to get the drop on the guy.

Rick 我告诉你
You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something!

我不只是个人肉护盾
I'm more than a human shield!

对 你说得非常对
Yeah, that's right. You are.

你是完美的 无可穿透的人体护甲 Morty
You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty,

因为我有多聪明你就有多傻
because you're as dumb as I am smart,

所以当我说"闭嘴"时 你最好乖乖闭嘴
which is why when I say "shut up," it's really good advice.

全拜你所赐 Morty
Great, nice work, Morty.

看看你自己 C-137 你真是个难对付的客户
Ooh. Look at you, C-137. You, aren't you a tough customer.

慢慢鼓掌 没搞错吧(各种电影反派经典登场)
The slow clap? Really?

这有点被玩烂了吧 老兄
Kind of played out, dude.

在这个次元还没有
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

事实上 这就是我发明的 这里以前没人这么干过
In fact I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before.

哎哟 真是好厉害呢
Well, La-di-da.

嘿 别学我
Hey, that's mine!

我不喜欢那个Rick的样子 Morty
I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty.

我们得逃出去
We got to escape.

我才不会帮你呢 Rick
I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

你是个怪物
Y-you're a monster.

别蛮不讲Rick理 Morty
Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty.

你能不能别这么说话了 很蠢的
W-will you stop saying that? It's stupid.

把他的Morty带走
Take his Morty away.

- 跟我走  - 好啊 高兴得很
- Come with me. - Yeah, gladly.

天哪 这些个Rick啊
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

嘿 老兄 你好像知道这里是怎么运作的
Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works.

有没有什么方法可以关闭这些线路
Is there any way we could shut down that grid

放掉外面那些Morty
and rescue all those Mortys outside?

这样做毫无意义
It would be pointless.

Morty们根本没机会打败Rick
Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.

进去吧
In here.

多美啊 不是吗
Ah. Isn't it beautiful?

是啊是啊 就像梦幻庄园的发薪日
Yeah, yeah. Looks like payday at Neverland Ranch in here.

梦幻庄园 曾是迈克尔杰克逊的私家游乐园和住所 财政状况不佳

叮
Zing!

他听懂了
That guy got it.

啊 啊 啊 Rick 安静
Unh-unh-unh, Rick, quiet.

别错过了我的交响曲
You're missing my symphony.

嘿 我觉得比蒙福之子的歌好听
Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons. Zip!

Mumford & Sons 英国民谣乐队 拿过第五十五届格莱美

这家伙真上道
This guy is on it!

他可不是在笑你的蠢笑话 Rick
He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick.

那不过是他每隔10秒随意发出的声音
That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds.

看吧 Rick 你不像你想象的那么聪明
You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are.

是我想让你找到我
I wanted you to find me.

我们没有多大的差别 你和我
We're not so different, you and I.

可不是嘛
Yeah, Duh!

看见这个了吗 Rick
See this right here, Rick?

我进行了大规模数字运算
I crunched the numbers.

然后列出了所有的Rick
I created a spectrum of all the Ricks.

我按照邪恶的程度来排列他们
I listed them out from most evil to least evil.

我在这里
Here's where I am.

看 你就在这里 Rick
And look it right here's where you are, Rick.

而这里这家伙 超级古怪
This guy right here, super-weird.

我懂了 你想让我跟你合作
I get it. So you want me to team up with you

去搞垮Rick议会 对吗
to take down the council of Ricks, right?

你就想干这个对吧
Is that where you're going with this?

因为我就会这么干
'Cause that's where I'd be going.

得了吧 我自己做得挺好的
Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.

我只用把你大脑的内容下载下来
I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain

然后杀了你
and then kill you.

好 如果我们加入一点硝酸钛
Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate

还有少量的氯化酒石酸盐
and just a tad of chlorified tartrate.

不用烤的巧克力蛋糕
Ovenless brownies!

嗯 嗯 太了不起了
Mmm. Mmm! It's incredible

天才的头脑能完成多么美妙的事啊 只要弄明白什么才是最重要的
What a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order.

过奖了 不是我一个人的功劳 Jerry
Well, come on. I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

这是你的想法 来吧 Jerry
It was your idea. Come here, Jerry!

嘿 过来
Hey, come here.

我想给你看个东西
I-I want to show you something.

好 看 所有人因为我买了这个而嘲笑我
Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me getting these,

但是你是天才科学家 你觉得如何
but you're a genius scientist. What do you think?

总统头像的地方刻的是星球大战机器人
There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be.

这么说吧 Jerry 我不会告诉你说
You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you

这些东西会升值 或者保值
what these will increase in value or even hold there current value.

但是 你买这些东西就是因为你喜欢
The truth is, you bought them because you like them.

他们对你来说很有价值 这就够了
They have value to you. That's what matters.

你会在这待多久
How long are you staying?

直到我们找到你的Rick
Untill we find your Rick.

我已经找到了
I found mine.

已经找到了
I found mine.

救命
Help!

逃不出去的 孩子
There is no escape, my son.

我们可以在来世寻得宁静
We will find our peace in the next world.

那 你们就这么放弃了吗
So what Y-y-y-you're just gonna give up?

我们是屈从于本真Morty的神力
We're giving in to the power of the one true Morty.

总有一天 他会回来的
One day, he will return.

赞美本真Morty
Praise the one true Morty.

善美Morty

我觉得我们不该上这种网站

Morty 快看这个网页

好了 Morty们 听着
All right, Mortys, listen up.

我叫Morty Smith 来自地球空间C-137
My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137.

我知道你们很害怕 因为我也很害怕
I know you're are scared, because I'm scared.

但那不是我们臣服于命运的借口
But that's no reason to accept our fate!

我们是Morty 我们的存在和Rick无关
We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick!

我们的命运由自己掌握
Our destiny is our own!

听起来好像本真Morty会说的话
This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.

我受够了做人肉护盾
I'm sick of being a human shield.

我想当一个园丁
I-I-I w- I want to be a gardener!

我想写真正疯狂刺激的动作小说
I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!

我不只是一个铁锤
I'm more than just a hammer!

他就是本真Morty
He is the one true Morty!

本真Morty
The one true Morty!

喂 老实点
Hey, keep it down!

你的人生真精彩呀 Rick
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

真可惜你看不到你的人生走向终结了
It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.

你在哭吗 为了一个Morty
You're crying? Over a Morty?

不 我只是对蠢货过敏
No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

真可悲
Ugh. Pathetic.

我们都知道 如果世界上有什么真理
We both know that if there's any truth in the universe,

那就是Rick从来不会在意Morty
it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.

尽管来吧 小混蛋
Do your worst, you little bastards!

杀了我啊 来啊 来啊
Kill me! Do it! Do it!

Morty 谢天谢地 把我弄出来
Morty! Thank god! Get me out of this.

快啊
Come on!

你真幸运 我不是Rick
You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

知道啦 没时间扯这些了
Point taken, but this is no time for arcs.

喂 你好
Yeah, hello.

嘿 我和O.J.有什么不同
Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?

O.J.辛普森 著名的辛普森杀妻案

啊 你是谁
Huh? W-who is this?

不同点就在于 我找到真凶啦 贱人
I found the real killer, bitch!

快过来吧
Get over here!

喂 傻瓜 完事了 该走了
Yo, Ding-Dong, we're done here. Time to go.

哦 Jerry 我想该说再见了
Well, Jerry I guess this means goodbye.

啊 一定要走吗
W-w-well, does it have to?

我是说 你 你长得跟Rick一样
I mean, you, you look just like Rick.

说不定我们可以 除掉他
We could maybe, you know, get rid of him.

我可不是说一定要杀了他
I'm not saying kill him, necessarily.

我 我也不是说一定不能杀了他 但是
I, I'm also not saying necessarily not to kill him, but

Jerry 我们都知道 没用的
Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work.

是时候回归各自的生活了
It's time to go back to our lives.

我爱你 Jerry 我爱你
I love you Jerry, I love you.

这些Morty会怎么样
W-what, w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys?

回家里 照常上学
They'll go back to their fimilies, attend school regularly,

玩电子游戏 交女朋友
play video games, date girls.

没了Rick的可怜小混蛋们
Poor little Rick-less bastards.

地球Rick C-137 委员会为其错误的指控道歉
Earth Rick C-137, the council apologizes for its false accusation,

作为对我们犯下的错误的弥补
and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake,

我们将给予你这张票券作为补偿
we would like to compensate you with this voucher

用于免费换取一个替代的Morty
for a free replacement Morty in the event that

以防你当前的Morty...
your current Morty should...

你们能选个好点的时机吗
Uh, guys, not a good time.

Morty 我们走
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

现在能说了吧
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

我这个人肉隐形衣还是很厉害的
I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device.

救了你一命
Saved your ass.

行了 Morty
All right, Morty.

少得意了 小心把逼吹破
Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.

真是难以置信 Rick
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

刚才那么好的机会
That right there, that w- that was a great opportunity

你能稍微有点人性吗
to show a little humanity, you know?

和我稍微增进点感情
to connect with me a little.

你要想增进感情 去加入个什么傻逼俱乐部
Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club,

就和那帮傻Rick一样
like all those dumb Ricks.

或许我不愿意真情流露
You know, maybe I don't connect

是因为我是最Rick的Rick
because I'm the Rick-est Rick there is.

所以 不用说
And, you know, it would g-go without saying

最Rick的Rick身边会有最Morty的Morty
that the rickest Rick would have the Morty-est Morty.

不用说 是吗
It would go without saying, huh?

当然了 你听见我说出来了吗
Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?

没
Nah.

最Morty的Morty
The Morty-est Morty.

不要太得意了 Bstuer Brown
Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown.

一个自大的Morty会导致很严重的后果
A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems.

对大家都没好处
It can be a real bad thing for everybody.

是吗 为什么
Oh, yeah? How's that?

你再大点我会跟你解释清楚的
U-uh, I'll explain when you're older.

真惨
What a mess.

Buster Brown 漫画角色 一个特别淘气的小男孩

骄者必亡
Pride cometh before the fall.

他这算是罪有应得了吧
I guess he got what he deserved.

那是什么
What is that?

把激光除解器递给我
Hand me the laser defibulator.

我能来帮忙吗
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

不 打扫厕所去
No! Go clean the toilets.

或不定有便便愿意和你交朋友
Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.

你让我们觉得做自己很惭愧
You make us ashamed to be ourselves.

天 我以前见过这种科技
My god. I've seen this technology before.

这个Rick被人远程遥控了
This Rick was being controlled remotely,

是别的什么人的傀儡
peppeteered by somebody else.

这是接收器
This is the receiver.

可是发射器在哪儿呢
Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

Blonde Redhead 《For The Damaged Coda》

Wubba dubba dub dub
Wubba dubba dub dub!

没什么 我只是来 检查下烟雾报警器
Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.

行吧 快出去
All right. Ok, get out.

那个傻逼在那儿干嘛
What's that dipshit doing out there?

你和他是朋友
Are you friends with him?

你知道他吃自己的屎的吧
You know he eats his own shit, right?

天啊 太有料了
Oh, my god, this is rich!

得有10个Rick我要打电话过去
I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.

Morty和我在车库里弄的合成激光鳗鱼正在氧化呢
Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage.

喂 好好听我说
Hey, don't blow me off.

我要定个规矩
I am drawing a line, okay?

要是我们回来发现房子和孩子有任何损伤
Any damage to this house or these children when we get back,

你就再也不能跟Morty去冒险了
and...n-no more adventures with Morty.

噢 天哪 Rick
Aw, geez, Rick.

要是我妈都这么说了 那肯定是认真的
If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.

- 没错  - 没错
- That's right. - That's right.

等等 啥
Wait. What?

听着 作为看护者我可以承诺
Listen, you have my words as a caregiver,

一切都会没事的
everything's gonna be fine.

万一有事 那就听你的 不跟Morty去冒险了
And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever.

就像那首老歌唱的
It's like that old song

"Blop blop-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"
"Blop blop-a noop noop a-noop noop noop."

你们不知道这首歌吗 Tiny Rogerts唱的
Y-you guys know that song? From Tiny Rogerts?

没听说过吗
You never heard of it?

就是 50年代的黑人娘炮
You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?

都不知道吗 唉 算了
No-nobody? A-all right, whatever.

管他的呢 快去你们那蠢旅游吧
Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip.

家里不准搞任何破坏
Not one thing out of place.

一处都不行
Not a single thing.

哇 既然已经踏上了不归路
Well, we're past the point of no return.

我要开个派对
I'm going to have a party.

我找到Jello了 你能把你妈的伏特加偷出来吗
I found Jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka?

她当然有 我在你们家洗衣房里看到了
Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room.

听着 你们两个不能同时否认啊
Listen, you can't both be in denial about it.

好 再见
Okay bye.

Summer 不许你开派对
Summer, you can't throw a party!

记得老妈讲的吗
Remember what mom said?

是啊 要是事情搞砸了 你和外公Rick会受惩罚
Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished.

而我嘛 只是个普通人 Morty
I'm only a human being, Morty.

Rick 快告诉Summer不许开派对
Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!

Summer 你不能开派对
Uh, Summer, you can't have a party.

因为我要开派对 小妞
Because I'm having a party, bitch!

什么 Rick 不行
Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!

你说你要开派对是什么意思
What do you mean  you're having a party?

会有第三次元的鼻涕怪
Are some glip glops from the third dimension

跑过来打牌吗
going to come over and play cards or something?

"鼻涕怪" 你真走运 没让塔夫落基人听见
"Glip glop?" You're lucky a Trafilorkian doesn't hear you say that.

这是他们的敏感词吗
Is that like their N-word?

就好像敏感词和屏蔽词生了个娃
It's like the N-word and the C-word had a baby

然后被各种侮辱犹太人的词汇养大
and it was raised by all the bad words for jews.

听我说 我觉得我们三个可以
Listen, I think the three of us could just,

玩点简单的 比如出去逛逛街
have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know,

类似这种亲人间的互动
you know, doing a little bonding and...

去你的 这可是我和那些酷家伙
Screw that. This is my chance to

建立关系的机会
gain some footing with the cool kids.

这就是你开派对的目的
That's why you party?

孩子 你还真是花季少女啊
Boy, you really are 17.

那你为什么开派对
Why do you party?

当然是要嗨翻天啊 小屁孩
To get wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!

让你那些科幻朋友
Just keep your Sci-fi friends

离我的酷炫朋友远一点
away from my awesome ones.

好啊 你也让你的酷炫朋友
Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends

离我的小鱼面包远一点
away from my canapes.

晚餐过后 泰坦尼克2号 就会
After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to

泰坦尼克

享受浪漫

经典重现

被轨道系统引导到我们的假冰山
the rail system near our replica iceberg,

然后这些管道里的液压
and the hydraulics encased in these tubes

会将整艘船沉入冰冷的海底
will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.

这么经典的东西用这么老套的轨道系统
A rail system seems archaic for a attraction this impressive.

确定会沉吗
Are you sure the ship will sink?

我可以保证这船会沉的 它都沉了几千次了
I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before.

它是必沉无疑的
It is un-unsinkable.

看 这是去船头的队伍
Look, it's the line for bow!

Jerry 我好想回去边喝酒边看书
Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a margarita and read.

不介意我跳过"我是世界之王"的桥段吧
Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?

这不是"我是世界之王"的桥段
Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit.

那是Jack和Fabrizio
That's Jack and Fabrizio.

这里是Rose对Jack说 "Jack 我在飞翔"桥段
This is where Rose says, "I'm flying Jack!"

随便吧 当独自来演戏的也没差
But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone.

那 她怎么样
Well, what about her?

打扰一下 女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

你能否代替我一下
Would you like my place in line?

我 可能会有麻烦的
I, uh, I could get into trouble.

我们不会说出去的
We won't tell.

所以 你也是泰坦尼克迷吗
So... You're a Titanicfanatic?

恩 是的 我从刚开张就在这工作了
Oh, yes. I worked here since it opened,

但是我从来都没能参与进来
but I've never been able participate.

乐意效劳 Rose
Happy to help... Rose.

我超爱看多P群射的 不过
I love watching Bukkake. I mean, like,

我不知道自己情不情愿这么做
I don't know if I personally would ever do it...

The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?

外公
Ugh! Grandpa!

鸟人
Birdperson!

很高兴没有紧急情况
I am pleased there is no emergency.

真有紧急情况 是操蛋的情况啦
Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A f**king emergency!

你上次打炮是什么时候啊 老哥
When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?

鸟人的交配季真是 不容易啊
It has been a... challenging mating season for Birdperson.

那今晚你可以鸟嘴湿润啦 客官
Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah.

去找点乐子吧 鸟鸟鸟人
Go have some fun out there. Birdp-Bird-Birdperson.

天呐 你到底请了多少人啊 Rick
Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?

人类吗 6个
Uh... people? Mm, six.

唷 你们好吗 鼻涕怪
Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

我靠
Oh, man!

你们知不知道家里是有垃圾桶的
Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?

我靠 搞什么
Hey, uh, what the hell?

噢 这就是为什么不能邀请肉食怪和素食怪
Ooh. That's why you never invite a Floopy Poop and

参加同一个派对
a Shmoopy doop to the same party.

噢 噢 这太恶了
Oh, oh, g--oh, that's disgusting!

你们居然在我父母的床上搞
You guys are in my parents bed!

哦 对不起 我就是有点不舒服
Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well.

想躺一会儿
I just needed to lie down for a bit.

哦 好 不好意思
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

天啊 这是在逗我吗
Oh, my god! Are you kidding me?!

大家都不了解齿轮战争的主要原因是
The thing people don't realize about the gear wars is

他们根部不了解齿轮
that it was never really about the gears at all.

哦 对 绝对的
Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no to-totally.

Rick 你要快点停止
Rick, you got to stop

Morty
Morty!

你见过齿轮头吗
Have you met Gearhead?

嗨 你好
Hey, how's

Morty 他非常想听听关于齿轮产战争的事
Morty here, he he would love to hear all about the gear wars.

你对齿轮战争了解多少
How familiar are you with the gear wars, exactly?

呃 完全没头绪
Uh... not at all.

噢 太好了 我嫉妒你
Oh, boy. I envy you.

好的 这要从754年前说起
Okay, it was about 754 years ago.

噢 嗨 Morty
Oh, hey Morty!

给你介绍我的好朋友螃蟹人
Have you-- have you met my buddy Scropon?

又来了 Rick
Not again, Rick.

上个家伙陈词滥调的给我讲了20分钟
That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know?

于此同时整座房子快被摧毁了
And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!

哇 Morty 这家伙的整个星球都被摧毁了
Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.

放尊重点
Have a little perspective.

嗨 Rick 真是个屎瓜派对啊 老兄
Hey, Rick, Squanchy  party, bro!

屎瓜奇
Aw! Squanchy!

这里有没有好地方让我屎瓜一下
Is there a good place for me to squanchar round here?

屎瓜奇 你可以随处屎瓜
Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man.

米卡苏卡萨 老兄
Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

太好了
All right!

我喜欢你的屎瓜
I like your squanch!

Rick 屎瓜究竟是什么意思
Uh, Rick what exactly is "squanching"?

Morty 听着 在过去的一年中我们经理过这么多超酷的历险
Morty, listen we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year,

现在是时候放松一下了
but it's time to relax.

如果我现在放松的话 估计以后我们就没法历险了
Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!

天哪 Morty 你愁死我了
Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out.

在这几个小时内 咱们能不能假装什么事都没发生
Can't we just pretend like every thing's fine for a few hours,

然后好好享受一下 所有事以后再说
enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?

你说的容易啊 Rick
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick.

因为你什么都不在乎
You know, you like not caring about stuff.

可我怎么办
You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?

别捣乱 慢动作孟巴斯
Knock it off, Slow Mobius!

哈哈 对不起 老兄 我就想秀一下我的超能力
Ha ha! sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!

不敢相信 她真的来了
I can't believe she's here.

那你还傻站着干嘛Morty
Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty?

去和他搭讪啊
Go. Talk to her.

今夜 你的目标就是壮大自己的男子气概
Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.

噢 Rose
Oh, Rose. Whee!

这个 不会是我想的那个吧
Is that what I think it is?

嗯 每对情侣都有机会重演Jack在海上淹死的桥段
Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.

太浪漫了
It's so romantic.

我等不及和Beth一起经历
I can't wait to do that with beth.

我不明白 Jerry
I don't know, Jerry.

恕我直接 你老婆看起似不怎么感兴趣
With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.

快看
Look!

前方有冰山
Iceberg, right ahead!

自助餐现已关闭
The buffet is now closed.

前方有冰山 自助餐现已关闭
Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.

长官
Uh, sir?

没有出现故障
There's not a problem.

什么叫没有出现故障
What do you mean there's not a problem?

制导系统没有把我们带入碰撞航线
The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course.

船就要错过冰山了
This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!

快想办法
Well, do something!

转舵 撞上去
Steer into it!

我尽力
I'm trying!

太迟了
It's too late.

女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

不要振作起来
Don't brace yourselves.

不 不 搞什么啊
No! No! What happened?!

他们的制导系统坏了
Their rail system must have failed.

我的天啊 我们沉不了了
Oh, my god! we're not gonna sink!

今晚一定要搞个女的
Totally gonna get laid tonight.

我喜欢你的羽毛
I like your feathers.

它们就是为了吸引异性
They are designed to attract the attention of the female.

看来起作用了
It's working.

Tammy 我应该告诉你
Tammy, I should let you know

我刚与我的灵魂配偶结束了一段密切的结合
I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.

我不需要灵魂结合
I'm not looking to get into a soul bond.

我需要的是
I'm just looking for...

相信这个我能做到
I believe birdperson can arrange that.

Summer 好久没见你上长笛练习课了
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.

Summer 别告诉我你认识她
Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her.

你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

我都不知道她来干嘛
I don't even know what she's doing here.

这不行 Summer 这是个派对
Whoa. Not cool, Summer. This is a party.

所有人都应该被受欢迎
Everybody should be welcome.

麻烦了 是谁邀请的阿道夫·林肯勒?
Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?

不是所有人都应该被受欢迎的吗
I thought everyone was welcome.

这不一样
It's not the same Summer.

林肯勒是个疯子
Lincoler is a crazed maniac

他是由阿道夫希特勒和亚布拉罕林肯的基因混合创造出来的
just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral super leader

奥地利裔德国政治人物，纳粹党党魁，1934年至1945年为德国元首.

Adolf Hitler 阿道夫·希特勒

Abraham Lincoln 亚伯拉罕·林肯 美国政治家、思想家。第16任美国总统，颁布了《宅地法》、《解放黑人奴隶宣言》

道德中立的超级领袖
by combing the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.

但结果却是一个差劲 神经的失败者
Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.

Rick 你把我带到这世上 让我看到了这个苦难 罪恶的
Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured

二次元世界
by the duality of its being.

或许我应该在你生命流逝中看到世界的和平
But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body!

靠 你干什么 老兄
Whoa. What's up, man?

和你没关系 娃
I have no quarrel with you, boy.

"娃" 你什么意思
"Boy"? What's that supposed to mean?

只是 听着 我不是有意的  只是
It's just... look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but...

别看我 老哥
Don't look at me, dude.

你瞧 我有一半是亚伯拉罕·林肯 所以
Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so

所以我应该跪在你面前 拍你马屁吗
So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!

这 不是 但是 那个...
Well, no, but... you know?

那个什么
What do I know?

第三帝国将会统治一千年
That the third Reich will reign for a thousand years?

 纳粹德国有两个官方国名

分别为1933年至1939年使用的第三帝国和1939年至1945年的大德意志帝国.

别烦他 Brad
Leave him alone, Brad.

闪一边去 Jessica
Stay out of this, Jessica!

打他 Brad 打他 打他
Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass!

打他 打他
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

Brad
Brad!

蠢货
Stupid!

Rick
Rick!

我这是在帮你Morty
I just did you a favor, Morty.

不好意思让你看到了刚刚的局面
Sorry about all that.

Rick的狐朋狗友可多了
Rick has some really strange friends.

Brad简直就是个混球
Brad is such a jerk.

整天想着该如何逞男人
He's always tyring to prove what a man he is.

我只想找个温柔体贴的男朋友罢了
I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.

Jessica 我带你去看些东西吧
Jessica, can I show you something?

哇 瞧瞧这里的东西
Wow, look at all this stuff.

是啊 这里可是我和外公Rick的科学工作室
Yeah. This is me and my Granda Rick's sci-fi workshop.

看看这个
Check this out.

好漂亮哦
It's beautiful.

其实嘛 Jessica
You know, Jessica.

我有些想和你说却一直没说出口的话
There's something I've always wanted to tell you.

那是什么啊 Morty
What's that, Morty?

- 我觉得你是世界上  - 不 那个
- I think that you're the most... - No, that...

衣柜里好像传出了奇怪的声音
Those weird sounds coming from the closet over there.

- 我的天哪  - 喂 我在这里屎瓜呢
- Oh My God. - Hey, I'm squanching in here.

天哪 真是恶心透了
Oh my god, that is so disgusting.

好痛 哦 啊 完了
Ow... oh, oh, crap.

天上有硕大的行星
Big star in the sky.

供氧不成问题的大气层
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

巨型的睾状怪物
Giant testicle monsters.

这里没问题 我们继续狂欢吧
We'll be fine. Let's party.

我对天发誓 Morty
I swear to god, Morty.

要不是里面那群人还在狂欢
If it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there,

我现在肯定在对你发火
I would be so furious with you right now.

听到了没 Morty
Oh, man. You hear that, Morty.

你可真把Summer惹毛了
You really lucked out with Summer on that one.

你们是怎么保持淡定的
How are you guys not freaking out right now?

整栋屋子现在可都在异次元
The whole house is sitting in another dimension.

我们该怎么办啊
I mean, what the hell are we supposed to do?

爸妈回来 会秒杀我们的
Mom and dad are gonna kill us.

- 我要疯掉了啊 Rick  - 冷静 Morty 冷静
- I'm losing it here, Rick. - Relax, Morty, relax.

没事的
It's gonna be fine.

我们只要出去找些凯拉辛结晶回来就行了
All we have to do is go out and find us some Kalaxian Crystals.

我操
Shit, mother f**kers.

Morty 这里以南几英里的地方就有凯拉辛结晶了
Kalaxian Crystals, Morty, just a few miles south of here.

行 我们出发吧
Ok, let's go then.

我们必须现在去找结晶 Rick
We got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.

等 等 等 Morty 我不能和你去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, I can't go with you.

我得呆在这里 保证这里一切安好
I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know.

我是说 万一有人不下心摔碎了什么的
I mean, who knows what... what if somebody breaks something?

我也是 得留下来
Yeah, me too. I should stay.

你们谁有阿司匹林吗
You guys have any Aspirin?

Morty 太好了
Oh, hey, Morty. This is perfect.

你可以带着林肯勒一起去
You can take Lincoler with you.

拜托 我现在哪里也不去 没看见我受伤了吗
Hey man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.

闭嘴 林肯勒
Shut up, Lincoler.

这是作为损毁客厅的补偿
It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.

对哦 Nancy 你也应该去的
Yeah, and Nancy, you should go too.

什么 为什么是我
What? Why... why me?

因为 因为你 很会吹笛子嘛
Because... you... you're so good at playing the flute.

不好意思给大家带来了不便
Sorry for the inconvenience folks.

泰坦尼克

我们应该很快就能进行沉船了
We should resume sinking shortly.

与此同时 请待在船上
In the mean time, please stay on the ship

客户服务

并享受这免费赠送的卡梅隆洋葱圈
and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion Rings.

真是太好了 船不沉就算了
Great. Not only the ship not sinking,

还被剧透了
but now the fourth wall has been broken.

我要回房 去看完那本小说了
I am gonna go back to the room and finish my book.

你应该去找那个叫Lucy的女人
You should find that Lucy woman.

但 但是
But...but...

那个 Jerry 我带你去看些东西吧
You see, Jerry. May I show you something?

如果一切按照计划行驶
Had everything gone as planned,

这整片区域都会被淹没
this entire area would be underwater.

我挺想看到那场景的
I would have liked to see it.

真是一场"泰坦尼克"悲剧啊 懂吗
This trip has been a "Titanic" faliure. Get it?

- 哦哦哦  - 抱我 Jerry
- Ooh. - Draw me, Jerry.

天哪 那个 Lucy 啊
Oh... boy... Lucy, wow...

这 和我想象的不太一样
Uh... This isn't what I had in mind.

但是时刻总算到来了
But it's the perfect moment.

我们梦寐了16年的场景啊
We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.

那个 不是像现在这样的 也不是和你
Um... Not like this... Not...not with you.

- 你会抱我的  - 啊啊啊
- You are gonna draw me. - Aah.

然后你要在那辆车里干我
Then you're going to f**k me in that car over there.

说来也奇怪 我觉得所有男人都生来是平等的
It's weird, cause I definitely think that all men are created equal.

- 但是 与此同时又  - 行了
- But, at the same time... - Okay...

结晶应该就在这里附近了
Um... the crystals should be really close.

在那里
There they are.

等等 这里不太对劲
Wait. Something's not right.

快拿结晶
Get the crystals.

野兽交给我处理就好
I'll handle the beast.

准备从你那可悲的基因里解脱吧
Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes.

Summer会重新喜欢上我的
Summer's gonna like me again.

林肯勒 快 我们快离开这里吧
Lincoler, come on. Let's get out of here.

我的旅程结束了 Morty
My journey is over, Morty.

我有件重要的事要告诉你
I have something important to tell you.

*我的齿轮 旋转了千年*
*And the gears, they tuned for a thousand years*

*直到末日才终结*
*Until the dark day that they stopped*

Rick 我拿到了 我拿到结晶了
Rick, I got them. I got the crystals.

太好了 Morty
Alright, you did it, Morty.

Rick 等等
Rick, wait.

你得知道件事情
There's something you need to know.

不是林肯勒 我们是绝对拿不到结晶的
I couldn't have done it without Lincoler.

他说他很抱歉
He said that he was really sorry

然后 他一直像爱爸爸那样爱着你
and that he loves you like a father.

他只是想被你接受
He only wanted you to accept him

他希望自己所做的最后一点一滴能挽回他在你心中的印象
and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.

他牺牲了自己来拯救大家 Rick
He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick.

他死了
He died.

至少他没有白白牺牲
Well, at least he didn't die in vain.

他拿到了结晶
He got these crystals.

而这些宝贝们来拯救这无聊至极的派对了
And these babies just saved this lame-ass party.

Wubba lubba dub dub
Wubba lubba dub dub.

放点什么啦 快点 放点音乐
Play something. Somebody, play something.

等等 你说什么
Wait a minute, what?

*右脚往前踩 左脚往后踏*
*Put your right foot forward and your left foot back*

*像诺迪克跑步机 两边走动*
*Then slide around like a NordicTrack*

*往左*
*Move to the left*

*往右*
*Step to the right*

*抖抖胳膊 看看灯*
*Wiggle your elbows, and look up into the light*

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

慢动作孟巴斯 来一束时间光波
Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam.

*这就是 这就是 这就是Rick舞*
*It's the, it's the, it's the Rick Dance*

这就是Rick舞
That's the Rick dance. Alright.

刚刚那是个啥
What the hell was that?

我以为找结晶是为了让我们回家
I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something.

什么 不 不 不 我随时都能把我们送回去
What? No, no, no... I can get us home whenever I want to.

对了 说起那些结晶
But, listen. Speaking of those crystals,

其余能给我吗
can I get the rest of them?

我渐渐回来了 Morty
I'm starting to come down, Morty.

凯拉辛结晶效果强劲就是时效太短
Crystal Kalaxian is a strong but fleeting high.

我就是这么看这结晶的 Rick
That's what I think of your crystals, Rick.

Morty 你个蠢货
Oh, Morty. You idiot.

还有谁有K-辛么
Does anybody else have any more K-Lax?

鸟人 屎瓜
Birdperson? Squanchy?

不要屎瓜我啦
Don't squanch at me.

好了 大伙 派对正式结束
Alright, everybody. Party is officially over.

Rick 现在立刻把我们带回家
Rick, take us home now.

行啦 行啦 行啦 Morty 你个派对老鼠屎
Alright, alright. Fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill.

- Morty 你太可恶了  - 管你叫什么名字的 你最烂了
- Boo, boo. Morty sucks. - Boo. You suck whatever your name is.

烂透了 Morty 你烂到爆了
Boo. Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

齿轮才刚刚开始转呢
But these gears just started turning.

快画完了吗 Jerry
Almost finished, Jerry?

呃 快了
Uh, almost.

我还没有完全捕捉到你美丽双眸的神韵
I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.

肯定也差不多了 快过来
I'm sure it's good enough,move!

每个周末都有几对Jack和Rose在这辆车上度过他们的泰坦尼克浪漫之旅
Every weekend Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car,

而我负责事后清理
and I have to mop it up.

这厢板掉下来能让清理容易点
The floor drops out to make it easier.

现在轮到我在车里翻云覆雨了
But now it's my turn.

我们将会达到快乐的巅峰 把车里搞得雾气腾腾
We're going to get it， nice and steamy in there,

我要在有蒸汽的玻璃上留下一个大手印
And I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint.

然后你要进入我的身体 好好爱惜我
And then you're going to love inside of me.

不能弄得一团糟 事后也不能清理
No mess, no clean.

Beth
Beth!

你看到我认为亚马逊电纸书不好使一定很高兴吧
Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.

我忍不住地觉得挺愧疚的
I can't help but feel a little guilty.

我没把Lucy往强奸犯那方面想
I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

那强奸犯应该长什么样子 Beth
What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth?

应该是一个穿着牛仔外套
Is it a Slavic man wearing a denim jacket

留着稀拉胡子 一嘴水泡还有廉价香槟味
With a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne

斯拉夫男人吗
waft over his blister-pocked lips?

你在说什么
What?

行啦 至少你免费得到了些东西
Well, at least you got all these free stuff.

应该够满足你的泰坦尼克瘾一阵子的了
Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.

我坐不下了
I'm not going to fit.

Beth 听我说
Beth,listen to me.

你会成功离开这里的
You're going to get out of here.

你会继续你的生活 然后
You're gonna go on,and...

Jerry 把那块门板扔了吧
Jerry, just leave the door.

这不是门板 Beth 这是残骸
It's not a door, Beth. It's debris.

我不管 快扔了它
I don't care, just leave it.

好吧
Yeah,okay.

是海角惊魂耶
"Cape Fear"! "Cape Fear"!

《海角惊魂》 1962电影 讲述一名刚出狱的强奸犯怪罪于导致他入狱的律师，对他复仇的故事

我在复原海角惊魂里的场景耶
I'm I'm doing I'm I'm going to do like from "Cape Fear"!

屎瓜们
Hey, squanchers!

派对在我家继续屎瓜着
The party's squanching on at my place!

太好了 我也要去
Cool, I'm coming too.

哦 不 对于一个屎瓜派对来说你不够屎瓜
Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.

什么
What?

Nancy告诉了我们你有多贱
Nancy told us what a bitch you are.

各位 说真的 Nancy
Guys, seriously. Nancy?

Summer 你为人太差
Summer, you're a bad person.

你只想着让受欢迎的人喜欢你
All you care about is having popular people like you.

这可不是阿道夫·林肯勒主张的
That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

好吧 搞清楚他的主张不容易
Well, it was hard to pin down what he stood for,

但是他肯定不是为这个而死的
But it's certainly not what he died for.

下次我再开派对
Next time I party

我就只管让自己兴奋得精疲力尽就好
I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.

你太明智了
You're so wise.

我帮你一起收拾好吗
May I assist you with that?

当然好 谢谢
Uh, sure, yeah, thanks.

Morty 你知道"Wubba lubba dub dub"什么意思吗
Morty, do you know what "Wubba lubba dub dub" means?

那只是Rick愚蠢又没有逻辑的口头禅而已
Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.

这并不是没有逻辑的
It's not nonsense at all.

在我们那里
In my people's tongue,

这句话的意思是"我很痛苦 请帮帮我"
It means "I am in great pain,please help me"

那我告诉你吧 他说的意思正好相反
Well, I got news of you, he's saying it ironically.

不 Morty
No, Morty.

你的外公确实非常痛苦
Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain.

这就是他不得不麻痹自己的原因
That is why he must numb himself.

- 得了吧 呃  - 我叫鸟人
- Come on,uh... - Birdperson

得了吧 鸟人
Come on ,Birdperson.

Rick没有那么复杂
Rick's not that complicated.

他只是一个大混蛋而已
He's just a huge asshole.

那为什么你还这么在乎以后能不能和他
Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to

继续探险之旅
continue on your adventures together?

看起来命运给了能让你永远远离Rick
It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity

获得自由的机会啊
to free yourself of Rick forever.

你知道吗 你说对了
You know what? You're right.

我根本不应该担心
I shouldn't even care.

这也许是对我最有利的事了
This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.

我已经厌烦和Rick一起探险了
I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.

我们那儿还有一句谚语"Gubba nub nub doo rahkah"
My people have another saying "Gubba nub nub doo rahkah."

意思是"只要这事能让你安心入睡 就去做吧"
It means "whatever lets you sleep at night."

嘿 爸妈已经快到家了
Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.

这是你抉择的时刻 Morty
This is your moment, Morty.

明智地选择吧
Choose wisely.

Tammy
Tammy!

天啊 我们完蛋了
Wow, we are so screwed.

Rick 醒一醒
Rick, wake up!

等下 等下 停
Wait, wait, wait, stop.

Rick 你得赶快做点什么
Rick, you got to do something quick!

我爸妈快到家了
My parents are home.

好 好的 等 等会儿
Uh, all all right, all right. Hold hold on.

真解渴
Ah, so good.

我的天啊 他们上车道了
Oh,my god. They're walking up the driveway.

把那个东西拿给我
Bring me the thing.

啊 什么东西
What what thing?

那个东西 就是那个
The thing, the thing, the...

上面有按钮和灯的那个 还能响的东西
It's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It beeps.

Rick 车库里所有东西都长这样
Rick, that describes everything in your garage!

你是说这个吗
Do you mean this?

Summer拿 拿对了
Summer for for the win!

好了 现在就行了
All right, that should do it.

你干了什么
Whoa! What did you do?

你自己看
Uh, see for yourself.

哇
Whoa!

没错 所有东西都跟着时间一起被冻结了
Yeah, everything's frozen in time.

慢动作孟巴斯还以为只有他会这个呢
Yeah,and Slow Mobius thinks he's all that.

能静止多久
For how long?

不知道 你们想持续多久
I don't know. How long do you guys want?

一个星期 一个月
A week? A month?

我们能先打扫屋子再决定吗
Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?

- 史上最大烂片  - 我没话说了
- Worst movie ever. - Dumb.

哦 真是浪费时间
Ooh, what a waste of time.

听懂了吗 因为现在时间冻结了
Get it? You know, 'cause it's forzen?

这真是有趣啊
This has been so much fun.

嘿 Rick 这么长时间
Hey, Rick, you know this whole time,

我都没听你说过你以前老说的"Wubba lubba dub dub"了
I haven't once heard you say that "Wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say.

因为我不需要说了 我已经有了新的口头禅
Don't need to, I have a new catchphrase.

是吗 是什么 Rick
Oh, yeah?  What's that, Rick?

我爱我的外孙和外孙女
I love my grandkids.

骗到你们啦 开玩笑的 我的新口头禅是
Psych! Just kidding, my new catchphrase is,

"我他妈才不在乎"
"I don't give a f**k".

BGM: Booty Bass - Shake That Ass Bitch

播演职员表吧
Roll credits!

播演职员表 开始
Roll the credits, go!

第一季结束啦
That's the end of season 1!

混蛋们 第一季终结啦
That's the end motherf**ker!

"我他妈才不在乎"是我的新口头禅
"I don't give a f**k" is my new catchphrase!

去你妈的
F**k you!

这就是第一季全部内容 耶
That's season 1, boom!

第一季已经甩在你们面前啦混蛋们
Season 1 in your face, motherf**ker!

我要复仇
Revenge!

派对
Party!

天哪 拜托停下来
Oh, please, stop!

嘿 兄弟
Hey, brah!

我搞不懂了
I don't understand.

你很享受这样吗 你喜欢这样吗
Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?

当然 你懂的 老兄
Yeah,you know it, dawg!



第二季 第一集



动作麻利点儿 Morty
Hurry up, morty.

外公马上就要解冻时间了
Grandpa's about to un-freeze time.

应该从上往下顺着清理
You really should be cleaning from top to bottom.

我知道怎么用吸尘器清理爸妈好吧 Summer
I know how to vacuum mom and dad, Summer.

这活儿我都做了六个月了
I've been doing it for six months.

那就说明你这六个月做的都是错的
Then you've been doing it wrong for six months.

那是发霉了吗
Oh, my god, is that mildew?

又不是我要在这么潮的天冻结时间的
It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day.

瞧瞧你这事儿砸的
You have dropped so many balls, man.

你就不担心
Do you ever get scared grandpa rick

我会成为Rick外公的新宠吗
Might make me his new sidekick?

什么样的人有你这样丑恶的嘴脸
What?! What kind of monster are you?

比你更称职的人呗
A competent one.

你俩瞎扯些什么
Who cares about the things you guys are talking about?

停止时间就是要你们少管些[哔]事儿
The whole point of freezing time was to stop giving a [bleep]

给你那蠢爹套上件儿衣服
Put a shirt on your dumb dad,

让这蠢地方重新动起来吧
And let's get this dumb universe rolling.

走起
Let's do this thing.

你俩听着 
All right, listen, you two.

咱们冻结了挺久的时间
We froze time for a pretty long time,

虽然解冻以后
So when I un-freeze it,

不会对世界的时间产生影响
The world's time is gonna be fine,

但是咱们的时间需要花时间
But our time's gonna need a little time

稳定下来
To, you know, stabilize.

我们的时间会变得不稳定
Our time is gonna be unstable?

这话什么意思
What does that even mean?

意思就是放松 别耸
It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty.

我还以为这点道理你们也该懂了
Uh, I thought you learned that by now.

以及 千万不要和你们爸妈有肢体接触
It also means don't touch your parents,

不然我们可能会碎成无数的理论裂片
Or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.

- 等等你说什么 - 现在我们走起
- Wait a minute, what? - And away we go!

我们是不是忘了给Benson先生在地上铺气垫了
Um... did we ever put that mattress under Mr.Benson?

-嘘 - 嘘 Morty
- Shhh. - Shush, Morty.

好好教教你们 等等 怎么 
...A thing or two about... wait, what?

这房子 我们停车的时候
Was the house...? When we pulled up,

这房子看着明明都废了
I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.

是你消极的想象 Jerry
Negative visualization, Jerry.

可以很好地解释你消极的存在
Explains a lot about where you're at.

- 嗨亲爱的 - 嗨爸爸
- Hi, sweetie. - Hi, dad.

Summer Morty 你们还好吗
Summer, morty, are you okay?

我们只是很想念你们
We, we just missed you a lot.

没错 想死你们了
Yeah, we missed you so much.

思念之深 拥抱一下都不再能
Too much to hug you, though.

没错 抱一下可是真的会死人
Yeah, it would literally destroy them.

嘿 不不不不如
Now, listen, why don't why don't wh-why don't

不如你们去吃个圣代冰激凌
Why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream?

出去吃点冰激凌
Get out there and get some ice creams.

这是500美元现金
Here's $500 cash in unmarked monies.

我现在放在地上 
I'm just gonna put it on the floor

给你踢过去
And kick it on over to ya.

- 你俩爽去吧 - 你最好别是在贿赂我
- You guys go nuts. - This better not be a bribe.

如果我发现房子里有一丁点儿不对的地方
If I find a single thing out of place in this house,

我再爱吃冰激凌也没用
My love of ice cream won't save you.

我去拿我的外套
I'll get my jacket.

亲爱的 你的上衣是不是穿反了
Sweetie, is your shirt on backwards?

没错 我就喜欢这么穿
Yeah. I like it this way.

你当我傻
I'm not stupid.

- 呼 - 噢
- Phew! - Oh.

这哥们儿 也真是
Man, that guy is the Redgren Grumbholdt

不懂装懂届的慕容不输
Of pretending he knows what's going on.

- 你们也这么觉得 - 真逗
- oh, you agree, huh? - it's funny.

还挺喜欢这个梗的哈
You like that redgren grumbholdt reference?

这人是我编的
Yeah. Well, guess what? I made him up.

你们真不愧是你们老爹的娃
You really are your father's children.

学会自己动动脑子 别当墙头草
Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep.

老天 感觉真糟
God, I feel terrible.

没错 领会到
Yep, it really makes you appreciate

世事无常了吧
How fickle the universe can be.

前一秒 你从屋顶上摔下来摔了六个月
One minute you're falling off a roof for six months,

下一秒 啪叽
The next minute, bam!

澄清一下 放气垫是
Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job

Summer的活儿
To put the mattress under

拜托 那是你的活儿 Morty
Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.

- 乱说 - 明明就是
- Nuh-uh! - yuh-huh!

不好意思Summer
Actually, sorry, Summer.

这次我站莫兄这边
I got to back the "M" Bomb on this one.

那次咋说的我还记得
I remember the conversation.

Morty负责把银行的钱换成饼干
We told morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies.

你负责把气垫放在Benson先生楼下
Your job was to put the mattress under mr. Benson.

哈 傻眼了吧Summer
Boom! In your face, summer!

瞧你这事儿砸的
You really dropped the ball, man.

闭嘴 你这小肚鸡肠的逼崽子
Shut up, Morty, you vindictive little turd!

你闭嘴 你个大母王八
You shut up, you big female asshole!

别推我
Hey, don't shove me!

- 我没有 - 什么你没有
- I didn't! - You didn't what?

- 你什么毛病 - 你又是什么毛病
- What's your problem? - What's yours?

- 闭嘴 - 你才闭嘴
- Shut up! - You shut up!

嗷 噢 
-wh-whoa, whoa!

搞什么鬼鬼鬼鬼鬼
What the hell, hell, hell, hell, hell?

你们搞什么
Oh, god. Oh, no. What did you guys just do?

你说谁
What did who do?

什么意思
what do you mean?

等等 我在说什么
Wait, what am I saying?

等等 我在说什么
Wait, what am I saying?

刚才是不是有谁有什么不确定的事儿
Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?

天 我感觉好难受
Oh, man, I don't feel good.

我还是我吗
Am I me?

我在说话吗
Am I talking right now?

应该是吧
I think so.

谁在说话
Wait, who said that?

你们俩听好 先别动 
All right, both of you just don't move.

别说话 也别瞎想 我去检查检查
Don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.

- 你干了啥 Morty - 我要去帮外公的忙
- What'd you do, Morty? - I'm gonna help grandpa.

- 我去看看他要不要帮忙 - 你说要去帮忙是什么意思
- I'll see if he needs help. - What do you mean you're gonna help him?

我也能帮得上啊
I can help, too.

- 怎么了 外公 - 发生什么了 Rick
- What's happening, grandpa? - What's going on, Rick?

闭闭闭嘴
Sh-sh-shut up.

妈的 开什么玩笑 两个点
Oh, crap, are you kidding me? Two dots?

就不该多于一个点的
This never needs to be more than one dot.

你俩把我们搞得"不确定"了
The two of you made us uncertain!

- 你在说啥 - 什么意思
- What are you talking about? - What's that mean?

- 说人话好吗 - 说人话
- English, please. - English?

我们的时间分裂了
Our time is fractured.

你们俩不知怎么弄出了一个不确定性的反馈环
You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty

我们的现实被劈成了两个具有同等可能性的不可能现实
that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities.

就好比一个男的 能够保持
W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining

和漂亮女同事的纯洁友谊一样
A platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker.

我们现在存在于理论上
We're entirely hypothetical.

可是我以为时间线是无限多的啊
But I thought there were infinite time lines?

我们不属于任何一条时间线 傻子
We're not on any time line, dummy.

瞧瞧
Look.

我个天
Oh, my god!

那些是猫吗
Are those cats?

应该是薛定谔的猫
I assume they're Schroedinger's cats.

或者应该说既"是"又"不是" 
Or, actually, I assume they both are and aren't,

就像我们一样
just like us.

- 世界消失了吗 - 世界消失了吗
- Is the world gone? - Is the world gone?

- 爸妈在哪儿 - 那爸妈呢 
- Where are mom and dad? - What about mom and dad?

爸妈 这个节骨眼别想着家里人了
Mom and dad? Get your head out of your family's ass.

我们掉进了时间被湮没的空无里
The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion.

你们的爹妈好好地存在着
Your parents get to exist.

这天过完说不定又给他们的[哔]婚姻
They're probably living it up in some pointless,

添上一条烂俗轶事呢
Grounded story about their [bleep] marriage.

酷圣石的冰激凌最好吃了
Cold stone creamery is the best.

还剩下二十块钱 该怎么花呢
What should we do with our remaining $20?

你知道不管给多少小费他们都会唱歌的吧
You realize they sing no matter how much you tip?

- 哇 - 啊
- whoa! - aaah!

我[哔]
Holy [bleep]

- 怎么了 - 我撞倒了一头鹿
- What happened? - I hit a deer.

我们得跟警察说是你在开车
We we have to tell the cops you were driving.

- 啥 - 这是朗姆酒葡萄干味的
- What? - This is rum raisin!

它还活着
It's still alive.

那么 我们 我要不要 找块儿大石头来
Well, do we, do I, uh, get, uh, a big rock, or...?

这又不是犰狳 混蛋
It's not an armadillo, asshole.

这种情况下男人不就得说这话嘛
I thought that's what a man's supposed to say.

我又不会当真干得出来
It's not like I could've actually done it.

要是周围有医院 我说不定能做点什么
If we were near a hospital, I could treat it,

不过看来我们只好
But I... I think we have to just...

没关系的 你别过意不去了
It's okay. This is just something that happens.

我们就算在医院又能干什么
And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do?

你是医马的 也不会给这鹿开刀
You're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.

什么意思
So...?

别跟我讲到底有什么区别
Well, don't different animals...

你这是在质疑我行医的水准吗
Require different levels of skill to keep alive?

- 天啦 - Jerry 给我把鹿抬进车里
- Oh, god. - Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

好
Yes, Beth.

这就是不能随便冻结时间的原因
This is why you don't freeze time, you guys.

这种事是非常不负责任的
It's incredibly irresponsible.

你冻结时间就为了开完派对打扫房子
And you did it so we could clean the house after a party?

Morty 没时间把责任推给我了
Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, morty.

是真的"没有时间"了 你自己看看
Like, literally no time. Look around.

不确定性本质上就是极度不稳定的
Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable.

到最后 一切都会坍缩成"是"或"非"
Eventually, everything either is or isn't.

我们得在四个小时内让自己变成"是"
And we've got about four hours to be "Is."

- 否则呢 - 就会变成"非"
- or...? - we isn't.

好了 因为这颗时间水晶存在于两个"可能"的现实里
All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities,

而我"不可能"搞砸
And since it's impossible that I didn't nail this,

我应该会同时在两个可能世界中
I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities

按下这一个按钮
at exactly the same time.

- 你怎么知道 - 你怎么知道你
- how do you know - how do you know that

不管你们想问什么 答案都是因为我牛逼
Whatever you are asking me, the answer is I'm amazing.

现在我们 走起
And away we go.

哟呵 这不挺管用的吗
Huh, what do you know. It's working.

- 嗷嗷嗷 - [哔]的
- ow, ow, ow! - oh

你们两个搞什么
What the hell is wrong with you two?

应应该说你们四个
I-I-I-I mean you four!

- 好疼 - 刚才好疼
- That hurt! - That was painful.

活该 疼就对了
Good, I'm glad it was painful. You deserve it.

我刚才看到了 你们被扯得乱七八糟的
I saw you. Y-you're both all over the damn place.

我们就分裂了二十分钟
We've been split for 20 minutes

你们就已经快要在[哔]的量子流里碎成渣渣了
and your lives are already scattered to the quantum [bleep] wind?

你们到底有什么事儿还不确定的
What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about?

该用哪个牌子的祛痘霜吗
Your brand of zit cream?

没想好在我忙着的时候 自己闲坐在哪张椅子上吗
Which chair to sit in while I do everything?

倒是快点说啊
Come on, spit it out!

你也没让帮上什么忙好吗 Rick
Well, you don't exactly make it easy, rick.

你总是取笑我 
You make fun of me all the time

你总是挑我的刺
You're always picking on me

现在Summer也变得和你一个德行了
and now summer's doing it.

现在又有Summer在一边拍你的马屁
and now you got summer to kiss your ass.

你还说我 你看看你自己吧
Me?! What about you?

还不就是因为嫉妒我
You're just as mean to me because you're jealous

看我搞砸你就开心了是不是
Could you get more excited to see me fail?

你就想一个人霸着外公
Because you want grandpa all to yourself!

你就想一个人霸着外公
Because you want grandpa all to yourself!

得了得了 冷静点 我知道怎么回事儿了
All right, all right, cool it. I see what's happening here.

你俩都年少无知
You're both young, you're both unsure

不知道自己在宇宙中的位置
About your place in the universe,

都想当外公的掌上明珠
And you both want to be grandpa's favorite.

那就好办了 Morty 你坐这里
I can fix this. Morty, sit here.

Summer 你坐这里 听好了
Summer, you sit here. Now, listen.

我知道你们俩 
I know the two of you are very different

在各个方面都很不同
From each other in a lot of ways,

不过你们得明白
But you have to understand

在外公的眼里
That as far as grandpa's concerned,

你俩屁都不是
You're both pces of shit. Yeah.

我可以用数学方法证明给你们看
I can prove it mathematically.

这样 让让让我把白板拿过来
Actually, l-l-let me grab my white board.

反正也忍你们好久了
This has been a long time coming, anyway.

有紧急情况 有一头受伤的鹿
Emergency! Wounded deer coming in.

三
-three.

抱歉 您不能进来
Excuse me, you can't be back here.

我是有行医执照的马外科医生
I'm a certified horse surgeon,

我需要立刻对这头鹿进行治疗
And this deer needs medical attention.

- 护士 请把那条蛇移开 - 这是我的护士
- nurse, please move that snake. - that's mynurse.

你作为一个马外科医生肯定非常清楚
And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know

鹿的器官比马的更小更复杂
That deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs.

你作为一个兽医 一定非常清楚鹿和马的差距
As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer

不会比你跟货真价实的医生的差距大
Is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor.

有闲工夫在这里撕逼扯屌
So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.

- 还不如拿来救命 - 哎哟
- it's time to save a life! - geez.

奇怪 这鹿已经受伤了
That's odd. This deer's wounded.

是啊 我当时在呢 你不用老跟我强调吧
Uh, yeah, I was there. You don't have to rub it in.

我是说被枪打伤了
I mean it's been shot with a gun.

我的枪
My gun.

有什么能帮您的吗 先生
May I help you,sir?

没有 你们也没什么能帮这头鹿的了
No, but you can stop helping this deer.

那鹿在被他们撞倒前就被我打中了
I shot it before these two hit it with their car,

我在他们把鹿拖走的时候跟了上来
And I followed them when they hauled it off.

这头鹿是我的
This deer belongs to me.

我没时间管这些
We don't have time for this, okay?

给我麻醉药和鹿用盐水
I need anaesthetic and deer saline.

听着 我不知道法律具体是怎么规定的
Look, I don't know what the law says about this,

但我曾立誓不让任何动物受到伤害
But I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm.

除了阉割流产安乐死
Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them,

以及几乎每顿饭都吃
Or also when eating them at also any meal.

我要给我的律师打电话
I'm calling my lawyer.

看在大家的份上
I hope for all our sakes

我只希望你的医术和我打猎的技术一样烂
you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

做你的美梦吧 傻逼 手术刀给我
In your dreams, bitch. Scalpel.

总而言之 你俩都是一样的性情多变
So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial,

还都太敏感 又粘人
Overly sensitive, clingy,

脾气暴躁 脑容量小得跟鸟一样的矮冬瓜
Hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.

我很多时候真分不出你们俩有啥区别
And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time

因为我区分人不看身高年龄
Because I don't go by height or age,

我区分人只看他们有多让我闹心
I go by amount of pain in my ass,

所以你们俩是一模一样的
Which makes you both identical.

这下都结了吧
All right, everything resolved?

大家都确定自己在我世界里的地位了吗
Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world.

是的
Yes.

那就棒极了 坐稳了
All right, perfect. Sit still.

胳膊放下 我再来一次
Arms down. I'm gonna do this again.

这一次 要跟外公一样
This time be like grandpa.

一样醉吗
You mean drunk?

什么 你有意见
What's that? You got something to say?

- 没 - 我们走着
- no. - and away we go!

我们走着
And away we go!

真奇怪
huh, that's weird.

真奇怪
huh, that's weird.

- 靠 - 怎么了
- oh, my god. - what?

- 靠 - 怎么了
- oh, my god. - what?

- 这王八蛋要杀了我  - 啊 
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! - What?!

- 这王八蛋要杀了我  - 啊 
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! - What?!

没人性的反社会疯子
Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.

- 你还不明白吗 - 你还不明白吗
- don't you get it?! - don't you get it?!

另一个Rick不想再聚合两个可能现实了
The other rick isn't trying to merge us anymore.

他觉得他能用这水晶
He thinks he can save his own skin

来杀了我自保
By using the crystal to kill me.

他应该发现了 比起聚合 
He probably figures it's easier

直接消灭掉另一种可能更简单
To eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them.

呵呵呵 不得不承认 
I have to admit,

这种想法我也隐隐有过
It was always in the back of my mind, too.

区别在于我不会真那么做 现在就不一样了
The difference is I would never do it, until now.

- Rick 你这是在搞什么 - 救我们的命
- Rick, what the hell are you doing? - Saving our lives!

他把我除掉之后 你们也跑不掉
After he takes me out, he's, he's gonna be coming for you.

- 谁 - 我
- who? - me!

啊
aah!

看见了 趴下
You see that? Get down!

- 我说了他是个疯子 - 他已经疯了
- I told you, he's a psycho. - He's lost it!

一定是时间的碎裂让他疯掉了
Th-th-th-the time fracture must have made him crazy!

- 我不知道怎么办 - 妈呀
- I don't know what to do! - oh, crap!

我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do!

现在他们有三个人了
Oh, god, now there's three of them.

我们寡不敌众 躲进壁橱里
We're outnumbered. Get in the cupboards.

慢着 别真的进去
Wait, don't don't do that.

他们会知道的 等等
They'll know. Wait, wait.

心里想着躲进壁橱但别真那么做
Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really.

这就是你想要的吗 你个变态的[哔] 
Is this what you want, you sick [bleep]?!

你想弄死你的孩子吗
You want to see children die?!

混蛋 
You son of a bitch.

你不能死 我说你死你才能死
You don't stop living until I say so!

Micheal
Michael.

- 这又是谁 - 我的律师
- Who's this now? - My lawyer.

我来告知您 女士 在这个县
I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county,

任何被猎人打中的鹿
Any deer shot by a hunter

都是该猎人的财产 无论它跑了多远
Is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs

或者谁在其死亡之前将它截走
Or who intercepts it before it dies.

这叫布莱德法
It's called Brad's law.

我们不能阻止你做这个手术
We can't make you stop the surgery,

但是你只是在给鹿肉做手术罢了
But at this point, you're performing it on venison.

其实我已经决定不吃它了
Actually, I've decided not to eat it.

所有这些恐惧与冲突
All this fear and conflict

肯定已经毁掉它的肉了
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

我拿回去把头挂在娱乐室墙上好了
I'm just gonna use the head for my rec-room wall.

她一般只给马做手术
She normally works on horses.

Jerry 如果你不帮忙 就[哔]滚蛋
Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the [bleep] out of here.

老娘会追到天堂
I will reach into heaven

把你尖叫的灵魂抓回来
And yank your screaming deer soul back!

老天爷
Jesus.

嘘
Shh, shh!

我知道你在哪儿 你个老变态
I know where you are, you creepy old monster.

我知道你是怎么想的
I know how you think.

哦 你觉得我会往这里走吗
Oh, is there where you think I'm going?

你觉得我站在这呢
You think I'm standing here?

你说不定猜对了
Well, maybe you're right.

我[哔] 现在怎么办
Holy [bleep]. Now what?

如果所有的我把Rick全打晕了
Well, if all of me knocked out all the Ricks,

所有的你都尿裤子了
And you peed in all of your pants,

不就意味着我们又都同步了吗
Doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?

- 没错 - 好
- Right. - Okay.

好 那从现在开始 无论我们做什么都一定得确定
So, from now on, whatever we do, we have to be certain.

对
Right.

我很确定我们真是完了蛋了
I think I'm certain we're effed in the "A."(fucked in the ass)

我的头
Oh, god, my head.

你们干了什么
What did you guys do?

我们把你关在狗笼子里 因为你刚才简直是疯了
We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy

你造成了第二次时间分裂
And you caused another time fracture.

你想杀了自己
You tried to kill yourself.

我只是自卫 
O-only in self-defense.

是我自己先想杀了我
Myself tried to kill me first.

我也没指望你们能懂
Guys, I don't expect you to understand this,

但是时间分裂两次意味着
But time breaking twice means our problem is

我们有两倍的麻烦 但是只有一半的时间解决
Two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it.

哎其实 你们确实该懂的 
Well, actually, I do expect you to understand that.

基础数学而已 你们谁能把我放出来吗 
It's basic math. C-can somebody just let me out of here?

如果死在笼子里 我有个赌就输了
If I die in a cage, I lose a bet.

你能证明你已经不会
Well, is there some way you can prove

威胁到你自己或者别人的安全了吗
You're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?

我的天 这样
Oh, for god's sake. All right, here.

- 把时间水晶给我 - 你要干嘛  
- Give me the time crystal. - Wh-what are you doing?

给我自己打电话 听着
Calling myself. Here, listen.

应该会转到语音信箱
It'll probably go to voicemail

因为我正给自己打电话呢 
Since, you know, I'm calling myself.

嗨 我是Rick
Hello, Rick here.

别信 逗人玩儿的
Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

哈哈 开玩笑的 
Just kidding! Ha, ha!

你被整了
You just got ricked.

这是Rick的语音信箱 
You've reached Rick's voicemail.

你知道怎么办
You know what to do.

嘿Rick 我是Rick
Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

之前不好意思 别放心上 
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings.

我知道你懂我是认真的 别太在意
I know you know I mean it, too. Take it easy.

看啊 好吃惊啊
Whoa, damn! Look at this.

三个新留言
I'm blowing up three new voicemails.

嘿Rick 我是Rick
Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

之前不好意思
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

行行行 听过了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard this one.

嘿Rick 我是Rick  
Hey, rick. It's rick.

- 嘿Rick - 懂这个意思就行
- Hey, rick, it's - you get the idea.

我们没事儿了
W-we're cool now.

那好吧 但是我们还是不能放你出来
Okay, well, we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.

随便吧 那我自己出来
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

你既然能自己出来为什么一直待在里面
If you could get out that whole time, why didn't you?

因为我得我必须确定
Because I waited until I was certain

我想这么做
It was what I wanted to do, Morty.

这就是咱俩的差距
That's the difference between you and me.

我很确定
I'm certain,

而你就是个会走路的麻袋 里面全是屎 
and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.

天啊Rick
You know, geez, Rick!

你这话也太过分了
Y-y-you're really tearing into me right now.

言语也是能伤人的
You know, words hurt.

- 天啊 - 怪物
- Holy! - A monster!

别瞎叫了
Hey, you, hey, quit yelling.

别叫了 我[哔]
Quit yelling. What the [bleep]

你们这儿的时间都被扯个稀巴烂了
Your time is all ripped up to hell!

你们把时间打碎了 还是两次
You broke your time twice.

怎么搞成这样的
How did this happen?

算了 都[哔]闭嘴 
Nevermind. Shut the [bleep] up. Oh, damn.

我是从四次元来的
I'm from the fourth dimension.

你们我全都能听见
I can hear all of y'all.

我们先看看这是什么情况
Now let's just see what we got here for a second.

我靠
Hey, damn it.

你不会是想用这个东西
Were you trying to use this to

你弄裂了时间 然后你以为
Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could

你用这玩意儿就能把时间拼回去
Just stick it back together with this?

要怎么移动时间
How you think you gonna move time

当你就在时间之中呢
While you're standing in it,

三次元的蠢猴子傻缺
You dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies?

你瞧你 Rick
Oh, way to go, Rick.

是啊外公 你瞧瞧人家
Yeah, grandpa, way to go.

怎么 你们现在就打算听这个家伙的了
What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now?

他的脑袋是个大睾丸
He's got a giant testicle for a head.

一个泡泡把他送来的
He came here in a bubble.

搞不好他是
For all we know, he could be

卵袋国的David Berkowitz
The David Berkowitz of nutsackland.

闭嘴 戴上这个
Shut up. Here, put these on.

这能把你们的现实同步起来
They'll sync your possibilities up

这样我就能把你们带回一个确定的时间了
So I can bring you back to certain time.

你们这群没心眼的
Y'all are just just just negligent.

看这儿
See, now now look right here.

嘿嘿嘿 你们三个 把项圈戴上
Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on.

- 我们戴上了啊 - 你在说什么
- We have them on. - What are you talking about?

- 戴着呢 - 我们不戴项圈
- Uh, we did. - We're not wearing collars.

没错 跟倔驴似的
Exactly. 'cause you're being obstinate.

什么
What?

想活命就快他妈把项圈戴上
Put the damn collars on if you want to live.

- 我们戴着呢 - 戴了啊
- They're on right now. - We did. They're on.

好吧 Summer Morty 把项圈戴上
All right, fine. Summer, Morty, put them on.

- 我们回来了 - 猫都没啦
- Yes, we're back! - No more cats!

- 我们回到确定的时间了 - 都解决啦
- We're back in certain time. - Problem solved.

- 猫没了 - 成功了
- No more cats! - Oh, you did it!

- 你给搞定啦 - 没错
- You fixed it. - Yeah, I did.

好好戴着这些项圈
Now keep those collars on so you

免得你们把你们的弱逼时间又弄裂了
Don't break your weak-ass time again.

这些东西我们具体还要戴多久
How long, exactly, do we have to wear these things?

戴着这东西挺尴尬的
They're really embarrassing.

鉴于你们要滚进时间监狱了
Well, since you're going to time prison,

那应该是要永远戴着了
I'd say you can keep them on forever.

- 时间监狱 - 没错
- Time prison? - Yeah.

我不知道你以为 我会觉得
Well, I don't know where you expect me to think

你是怎么搞到这块水晶的
You got that crystal over there,

但是你们这些蠢驴中的蠢驴里的驴
But the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses

唯一能搞来一块儿的解释就是偷来的
Could ever have on is if it was stolen.

你从睾丸怪那里偷了一块能冻结时间的水晶
You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters?!

要是能买我也乐意花钱啊
I would've been happy to pay for it, S-summer,

但你以为超市里就能买到吗
But they don't exactly sell them at Costco.

再说 这里还有更重要的经验教训 抓住他
Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!

嘿 嘿 嘿 退后点
No, no, no, no! You better keep back!

这东西三十码外就能把你的屁股
Man, this will turn your ass

变成一个怀胎三月的胎儿
Into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards.

哼
Mm.

哪儿不该有只猫咪等着你去做美甲的吗
Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?

没错 Smith太太 屈从于你的愤怒吧
That's right, mrs. Smith. Give in to your anger.

别管这头鹿了
Neglect that deer.

亲爱的 没事啦
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

这些人是麋鹿 驼鹿 梅花鹿
These men are from the cervine institute

及雄鹿 鹿科动物机构的
of elk, moose, deer, and stag.

他们能把这只小鹿带上直升机
They can take this deer to a helicopter

送去全国顶级的鹿科动物医生
And fly it to the country's top deer surgeon

是在跨州的野生动物保护区
On a wildlife reserve across the state border.

超出你的权限范围了
Where your jurisdiction ends.

看来这就结束了
I guess that's the end of that.

还有一件事
There is just one more thing.

根据本国的兽医条例
According to this state's veterinarian statute,

要转移这只动物
This animal can't be transferred

必须要当前治疗的医师
Until the current attending physician

口头确认他们无法
Verbally confirms their inability

提供所需的救治
To provide adequate care.

听到没 医马的
You heard the man, horse doctor.

你必须得说 你搞不定
You have to say you couldn't hack it.

我们做到啦
We did it!

嗯哼 不是 妈妈 是地球
Uh-huh. No, mother no. Earth, dude.

不是 我说的是 对对 有恐龙的那个
No, I'm talking about... yeah, with the dinosaurs.

不 海豚人又要隔很久了 
No, if you get to the dolphin people, you gone too far.

好 我晚点再跟你说 
All right, man, I'll talk to you later. Okay.

知道三次元生物在时间监狱是什么下场吗
You know what they do to third-dimensional life forms in time prison?

和其他所有监狱一样 只不过是一直到永远
Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.

你为什么要这样
Why are you doing this?

你以为我想一辈子都当一个全知不朽
You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being

超越时空的存在啊
Transcending time and space my whole life?

我也有梦
I got ambitions, man.

把你们送进去只是我升迁的敲门砖
Bringing you guys in is my ticket up.

那要是我说你背后就有
What if I told you there's a huge ticket

一巨大的敲门砖呢
Up right behind you?

你真以为我这么蠢
You really think I'm that stupid?

你听我说啊
All right, hear me out on this.

你是不朽的 也就是说你的生命是无限的
You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite.

也就是说 你做任何一件事情的概率
Okay, well, then that means there's a 100% chance

最终都会是百分之百
That you'll eventually do everything,

包括转过身去看看背后
Including turning around to look behind you.

这我没法反驳
I cannot argue that.

啊
-aaah!

天啊 好恶心好诡异
oh, god, gross and weird!

Chris
Chris!

你杀了我的枪
You killed my gun!

Summer Morty 摘掉你们的项圈
Summer, Morty, take off your collars.

你们干嘛
What? What the hell are you doing?

问得好 答案是 我不确定
Good question. I suppose the answer is I'm not certain.

你在干什么
Oh, no, what are you doing?

- 我也不知道 - 我不确定
- I have no idea. - I'm not sure.

快停下
Stop it!

可能我会停 可能不会 
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

对什么我都不能确定
I'm really uncertain about everything,

包括要不要揍你
Even kicking your ass.

听 嘿 啊
List- hey! Tw ow!

这些手臂只是退化不完全的残留
But the these arms are vestigial!

你戳的地方六百万年前
Now, you poked me where an eye would've been

就已经不再有眼睛了
About 6 million years ago.

我们来帮外公
Come on, let's help grandpa.

我对一切都是百分之百的不确定
Yes! I'm 100% not sure about anything!

没错 完全不确定
Yeah, totally uncertain.

揍他 揍死他
Beat his ass! Get him! Beat him up!

- 揍死他 Rick　- 死吧 傻[哔]
- kick his ass, Rick! - Die, mother[bleep]！

我被打败了
Ow! I'm defeated.

- 怎么了 - 时间在崩塌
- What's happening? - Time is falling apart.

我们必须回到确定的时间
We've got to get back to certainty quick.

把你们的项圈给我
Give me your collars.

你不是得要修好差不多三十个项圈吧
Oh, man. Don't you have to fix, like, 30 of them?

Morty 我只用修好三个
Morty, I have to fix three of them.

还有其他三十一个我
And then there's 31 other versions of me

他们也要修三个 一共是九十六
That have to also fix three, for a total of 96.

我不傻 我很果断的
I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive.

把扁头的螺丝刀递给我
Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver.

- 算了还是扁头的吧 - 算了还是十字的吧
- Actually, make it a flat-head. - Actually, make it a phillips.

妈的
Oh, shit.

我知道我今天有点不是很让你顺心
Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today.

我知道撞到那头鹿是我的错
I know it's my fault we hit the deer.

我也知道你想要救它
And I know you wanted to be the one to save it.

没所谓了
Whatever.

我是多心胸狭窄 才会把一条生命
How petty would I have to be to care less

看得还不如我的自尊心重要
About an animal's life than my own ego?

那你得非常心胸狭窄才行
Well, you'd have to be pretty petty.

但你还是我的老婆啊
But you'd still be the woman I married.

我们这是在往哪儿开
where are we going?

最后一站
One last stop.

直升机在哪儿
Where's the helicopter?

没有直升机
There is no helicopter.

也没有鹿科动物机构
And there is no cervine institute.

那顶级鹿科动物医生
But the top deer surgeon...

就在我面前
I'm looking at her.

谢谢你给我这么高的地位
Thanks for teeing me up like that.

你们最好赶快
You better get moving.

这些灯光本来是做基本的冰激凌准备的
These lights are designed for basic ice-cream work.

撑不了一夜
They're not gonna last all night.

给我五分钟
I need five minutes.

Jerry 这真是我经历过最浪漫的周末了
Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.

多谢酷圣石
Thanks to cold stone creamery.

不用谢
You're welcome.

好了 项圈修好了 快戴上
Okay, collars are done. Put them on.

没有时间了 听着很讽刺是吧
We're out of time. It's ironic, huh?

啊 怎么回事
Huh? Wait a minute.

- 真棒 - Rick
- Great. - Rick!

怎么回事
What's going on?

项圈的扣环坏掉了
The collar. Oh, the latch is broken.

我没法戴在脖子上扣好
It won't latch closed around my neck.

- 你开什么玩笑 - 怎么回事
- Oh, are you kidding me? - Geez, what's going on?

我们的项圈怎么没有亮绿灯
How come our collars aren't green?

显然是有人连戴项圈都不会
Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put

而有一个我想要帮他
His collar on, and one of me is stuck trying to help him.

别怪在我身上 连个扣环都修不好的人是你
Don't blame this on me. You're the one that couldn't fix a latch.

你在说什么 这没坏 Morty
What are you talking about? It's not broken, Morty.

我已经修好了 戴上就是了
I fixed it. Just put it on.

合不上 这坏了
It won't close. It's broken.

拿过来
Fine, bring it here.

噢
Oh!

- Rick -  Morty
- Rick! - Morty!

哦是吗 Morty 不好意思
Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry.

对一切感觉那么不确定的人可不是我
I'm not the one who's so [bleep] uncertain about everything.

知道我很确定的一件事是什么吗 Rick
You know what I'm certain of, Rick?

这件事我很确定
I've really made up my mind about this.

我再也不想见到你了
I never want to see you again!

你什么东西都再也别想见到了 傻瓜
You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy!

你把我们害死了
You killed us!

该死的
God damn it.

Rick 噢
Rick! Oh!

Morty 你的项圈在哪儿 拿给我修
Morty, where's your collar? I'll fix it.

我弄丢了
I dropped it.

什么 你对我做了什么 Morty
What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty?

我没关系的 你好好的 Morty
I'm okay with this. Be good, Morty.

要比我好
Be better than me.

另一个项圈
Oh the other collar!

有关系 我没有认
I'm not okay with this. I am not okay with this!

上帝啊 拜托让我活下去
Oh, sweet jesus, please let me live.

我得把这个修好
Oh, my god, I have to I've got to fix this thing.

上帝啊 老天爷啊
Please, god in heaven. Please, god.

主啊 听我祈祷
Oh, lord, hear my prayers.

太好了 老天
Yes! You, god!

今天还不到时候
Not today, bitch!

神啊 如果有地狱 也请宽恕我
Please, god, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me.

我做到了 没有什么上帝
Yes, I did it! There is no god!

瞧着瞧着
In your face!

一个点 [哔]的
One dot, mother[bleep]

太好了
Yes! Oh, yes!

太好了 你们懂的
All right, you know what I'm talking about.

- 真是千钧一发 - 没错
- Oh, that was a close call. - Oh, yeah!

太棒了 我要跳白菜田舞
I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty.

- 跳吧 - 看呐
- oh, yeah, do it. - Check me out.

我在跳白菜田舞
I'm doing the cabbage patch.

- 好好跳 - 我也来
- Do it right. - I'm doing it, too.

- 跳白菜田 - 这舞真是经典
- Do the cabbage patch. - it's a classic dance.

- 跳吧 跳 - 看啊
- do it. Do the dance. - oh look at that.

等等 你们为什么回来得比较晚
Hey, wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?

我不知道 好像我的六十四个项圈里有一个坏掉了
I don't know. I think, like, 1/64 of my collars didn't work.

我现在有点晕
It's hard to keep straight now

有六十三段其他的记忆
That I have 63 other memories of everything.

嗯
Yeah.

但是好像六十四个Rick中
But I feel like one of the 64 ricks,

有一个为了我牺牲了自己
Like, sacrificed himself for me?

- 好像是吧 - 闭嘴 Morty
- Maybe? I think? - shut up, morty.

上一次你觉得好像有什么事情的时候 我们差点都死了
The last time you felt something, we all almost died.

你这小傻逼
You little piece of shit.

嗨 我们到家啦
Hey, guys, we're home.

But only on one small part of you necks?

这东西需要电池吗
Hey, do those things need batteries?

算上了没啊 把卖水果的过道清干净喂
Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle.

我不是恐同啊(fruit可做蔑称指同性恋)
Not in a homophobic way, though.

这项链也太基了
They're just fruity necklaces

- 要我说的话  - 我都要尿裤子了
- is what I was saying.  - I'm gonna pee my pants!

"创"星打个电话
Somebody call the planet of "Tron"!

Doesn't feel so good, does it?

- 这儿有三个"创"来的人呢 - 不好 很不爽
- We have three "Tron" People over here. - No, it doesn't. It hurts.

嘿 你丫滚哪个时候去了
Hey, man, when the hell were you?

找你去了 混蛋
Looking for you, asshole.

我跟你说过了恐龙时期
I told you past the dinosaurs.

你知道过了恐龙时期是什么概念吗
You know how much time is past the dinosaurs?

那得差不多一半的时间
Half of all time!

拜托 这边才对
Come on, man. It's this way.

- 得了吧 - 给我
- Come on. - Give me that thing.

快一点 他不可能在这么后面
Speed it up. He can't be this far back.

Whoa! Jesus, Jerry!

你在这儿干什么
What the hell are you doing here?!

怎么了
What are you talking about?

我们说好了 如果我儿子要学驾驶
We agreed a boy's father should be present

- 爸爸我必须在场 - 好像是说过
- When he's learning to drive. - I guess I remember that.

你莫非一直都在后座上
Wow. And you've just been back there this whole time?

你给我爸建了一个日托所
You created a day care for my dad?

我倒希望这点子是我想出来的
Are you kidding? I wish I had this idea.

应该说 我确实想到过
Well, I did have this idea,

不过我希望我是握有产权的那个我
But I wish I was the version of me that owned it.

丫可算是发家了
That guy's rich.

记得确认托管的原因

可以和其他Jerry一起玩耍嬉戏
Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys.

再安全不过了
He couldn't be safer.

把这个收好了
Hey, Morty, hang on to this.

That number's your dad.

要是丢了 他就领不回来了
If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back.

我去谈生意
It's it's business stuff.

你在车库里谈什么生意
What kind of business do you do in a garage?

跟见不得人似的
You know, this seems a little shady.

呵呵 你以为见不得人的事情
Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened

富丽堂皇的办公室里就没有了吗
In a fully furnished office?

听说过华尔街吗
You ever hear about wall street, Morty?

你知不知道这些人
Y-you know what those guys do

在高档会议室里干什么勾当
In, in, in, their fancy boardrooms?

他们把蛋蛋放进可卡因里
They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine

然后互相蹭过来搅过去
And wipe them all over each other.

外公我行走江湖
You know, grandpa goes around,

做生意都是在大庭广众之下
And he does his business in public,

外公没有什么见不得人的
Because grandpa isn't shady.

妈的
Aw, crap.

很高兴认识你 Morty
Nice to meet you, Morty.

如果你想弄死任何人
Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered,

请务必联系我

- I'm very discreet. - You're g-giving him a card?!

我干活没有任何道德标准
I have no code of ethics.

什么地点 什么人都可以

儿童 动物 老人 都无所谓
Children, animals, old people. Doesn't matter.

杀生就是我的爱好

你卖武器给杀手来赚钱
You sell weapons to killers for money?

Morty 你这种思维 就是我们星系间
You've got what the intergalactic

所说的典型的拘于世俗
call a very planetary mind-set, Morty.

这些事情比你想的复杂得多
It's more complicated out here.

这些可是F币
These are flerbos.

你知不知道两个人类有了
Do you understand what two humans can accomplish

- 这三千F币能干什么 - 什么

一玩起来就不知天日
And you can never tell what time it is.

你把枪卖给杀手就为了玩游戏
You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?!

你要是成天就想着怎么玩弄文字
Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around,

什么事儿都能被你说得这么难听
You can make anything sound bad, Morty.

试试这个
Here, check this out.

啊
Aah!

Roy 怎么了
Roy, what's wrong?

我做了个噩梦
I had a nightmare.

跟一个老头在一起
I was with an old man.

他把一头盔戴在了我头上
He put a helmet on me.

是你烧糊涂了 好好休息吧
It's just a fever. Get some sleep.

我可不想让你周一落下课
I don't want you missing school on monday.

我希望你们审视今日
I want you kids to look around you today

然后展望未来
And think about your future.

在这个年纪 你们的人生充满了可能性
Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.

这个球传得太完美了
Spiraling perfectly!

Roy Pasons拿到了球
It's gonna be caught by Roy Parsons!

Roy Parsons过了二十码线

过了十码线
Now he's at the 10!

火箭Roy所向披靡
Nothing can stop Roy "The rocket"!

触地得分
Touchdown!

我只是觉得是时候活得现实一些了
I just think it's time to get realistic.

你和我爸谈过地毯店的事了吗 
Have you talked to my father about the carpet store?

Roy
Roy?

要是早点发现就好了
Had we caught it sooner well,

不过现在说什么都是马后炮
Had we caught it sooner well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy.

重要的是我们要抓紧治疗
What's important is that we move quickly.

我还不想死
I'm not ready to die.

你不会死的
You're not going to.

火箭不会输给癌症

Roy 地毯很好 谢谢啦
Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.

世界上最伟大的爸爸

Roy 你把那些清仓甩卖的波斯白粗毛毯
Hey, Roy, you pulled those persian off-white shags

拿出来了吗
for the clearance sale?

哦 妈的
Whoa. Sh shit!

哦
Oh!

哦 怎么回事
Whoa! What the hell?!

我是在哪儿
W-w-where am I?!

- 到底怎么回事  - 55年 不错嘛 Morty
- What in the hell?! - 55 years. Not bad, Morty.

虽然三十多岁的时候
You kind of wasted your 30s, though,

有点把时间浪费在观鸟上了
with that whole bird-watching phase.

我老婆呢
W-where's my wife?!

Morty 你刚刚只是在玩游戏
Morty, you were just playing a game.

这游戏就叫"Roy"
It's called "Roy."

快清醒点
Snap out of it. Come on.

我是Morty 你是Rick
I'm Morty. You're Rick.

嘿 你卖了把枪给一个杀手
Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that kills people!

癌症你都熬过来了
Look at this, you beat cancer,

居然又回到那个地毯店上班
and then you went back to work at the carpet store?

切
Boo!

不要转换话题 Rick
D-don't dodge the issue, Rick!

卖武器给杀手和自己动手杀人有什么两样
Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger!

那和什么也不做也没什么两样
It's also the same as doing nothing.

Krombopulos Michael想让谁死
If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead,

你以为谁能阻止他吗
there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him.

他就是干这一行的
That's why he does it for a living.

不好意思 现在我要碾压你的"Roy"得分了
Now excuse me. It's time to thrash your "Roy" Score.

你本来可以不让这种杀人的事情发生的 Rick
You know, you could stop this killing from happening, Rick!

你就不该卖那把枪
You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun,

只要你愿意 这事是可以挽回的
but you could undo it if you wanted.

嗯哼 这就是我跟你不同的地方了 Morty
Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty.

我是绝不会回地毯店去的
I never go back to the carpet store.

天啦 这家伙要让Roy隐居山林
Holy shit! This guy's taking Roy off the grid!

他的Roy连社保号都不要了
This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy!

你好 打扰一下
Hi. I'm sorry.

我想 这里是不是有点小误会
I think there was a misunderstanding.

我是个成年人 我想回家
I'm an adult and would like to go home, please.

哦 当然可以 从那个管道出去就行
Well, of course. Right through that tube.

难以置信
Unbelievable.

You're doing great.

钻根管子而已 我会的好吧
I know how to crawl in a tube.

You guys are enjoying this?

就不觉得有点被当成小孩子在哄着
Don't you feel a little patronized?

怎么会呢
How so?

- Jerry - Beth.
- Jerry! - Beth.

这也太扯了
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

Jerry 我爱你
I love you, Jerry.

Aw, Beth.

谁想看"午夜狂奔"
Who wants to come watch "Midnight run"

带导演评论的

Yeah! Definitely.

第一个来的可以调节画面设置哦
First one there gets to adjust the picture setting!

出厂设置里色调总是设得太高
The factory tint setting is always too high!

- 快让开 - 色调总是设得太高
- Out of my way. - The tint setting is always too high.

我又要去杀人啦
Oh, boy. Here I go killing again.

您已到达Krombopulos Michael所在地
You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael.

目标位于下方
Your destination is below.

波斯白地毯都卖完了
We're all out of off-white persian.

天哪 我都做了什么
Oh, man! W-w-what have I done?!

- 放下武器  - 不是你想的那样
- Drop the gun. - You don't understand!

这个人是来杀人的
This guy was gonna kill someone!

那要杀人的就不止他一个了
I guess that makes two of us.

啊
Aah!

你在做什么 Morty
What are you doing, Morty?

这里是星系联邦的哨站
This is a galactic federation outpost!

没空跟你把来龙去脉讲清楚了
Look, I don't have time to tell you my entire backstory,

但你外公我跟政府合不来
but grandpa and government don't get along.

他救了我一命
He saved my life.

- 什么 - 啊 哦
- What? - Huh?! Whoa!

你是Krombopulos Michael的目标吗
Are you Krombopulos Michael's target?

你叫什么名字
W-what's your name?

我的种族用不上名字
My kind has no use for names.

我们交流的方式是你所谓"Jessica的脚"
I communicate through what you call "Jessica's feet"

不 是"心灵感应"
No, "Telepathy."

真棒啊 Morty
Oh, good job, Morty.

你弄死了我最好的客户
Y-you killed my best customer,

就救了一个会读心术的屁
but you saved a mind-reading fart.

屁 这个名字我喜欢
I like this name fart.

Morty 你能好心拉一下
Morty, would you kindly release me

监牢左边的控制杆 把我放出来吗
by pulling that lever to the left of my cell?

我很痛苦
I am in great pain.

Morty 不要
Morty, don't do it.

Morty
Morty...

Morty 你个蠢蛋
Morty, you idiot.

糟了 我们得赶紧带你走
Oh, crap. Let's get you out of here!

我们带不走他的 他是气体
We can't get him out of here. He's gaseous.

他过不了传送门 Morty
He's not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.

那我们就只好都上车了
Well, then, I guess we're all getting in the car.

- 对吧 呃  - 叫我屁就好
- Right, uh... - fart.

不是 赶紧上车
No! Just j-just get in the car!

Morty 别这样 我想回闪电芯
Morty, come on. I want to go back to Blips and Chitz.

这事儿我不想应付
I don't want to deal with this.

Rick 既然你态度这么明确
Rick, you've been clear on the fact

不想帮忙 那就走开
that you don't want to help, so just go away.

更多人在赶来
More are coming.

管你的 我走了
Screw this. I'm out.

哦 快点 快点
Whoa! Come on, come on!

滚出那个垃圾做的飞船 不然我们就开枪了
Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!

开枪
Open fire!

蠢[哔]地毯店的救屁主
Stupid-ass, fart-saving, carpet-store mother[bleep]

挪开
Move!

你[哔]的动了我调好的座位吗
Wait, did you with my seat settings?

更多人要来了
More are coming.

Rick
Rick!

嗯 嗯
Yeah, yeah.

你的盖尔顿转换器坏得真厉害
Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.

因为我孙子开飞船开得像个雄性的Obradian
That's because my grandson drives like a male Obravadian.

我就开地图炮了 有些所谓偏见纯属事实如此
Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.

其实是因为常年失修
Actually, it's because of years of neglect.

你真的需要尊重一下这些齿轮 Rick
You really need to respect your gears, Rick.

对你而言 它们只是带齿的轮子
To you, they're just wheels with teeth,

然而在我们的文化里 是有战争
but in my culture, wars have been fought...

我听过了 你只管修好就是
So I've heard. Just fix it.

那些Gromflamite应该暂时找不到我们
I don't think the Gromflamites can track us now,

但我们应该得在这待一段时间
but it looks like we're gonna be here for a while.

或者 如果你拿了K. Michael掉的那把枪
Or, you know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped,

我们可以直接把他的活儿给干了 然后回家
we could finish the job and go home.

你是知道我会读心术的吧
You do understand I'm telepathic, right?

我这是礼貌
I'm being polite.

Rick 我们得把他带回他归属的地方
Rick, we're taking him back where he belongs.

是吗 那是哪里
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

你是要去找出是谁放了这个屁吗
Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?

我不小心通过一个虫洞来到这里
I came here accidentally through a wormhole

那个虫洞位于 你们所谓的"滚出我的脑袋 屁
located in what you call "Get out of my head, fart.

我知道你在读心 啦啦啦啦"
I know you're in here. La-la-la-la "

不 它位于你们所谓的 普罗米修斯星云
No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.

哦 真好 只要蹦一下跳一下 再蹿个800光年就到了
Oh, great. Just a hop, skip, and an 800-light-year jump.

Rick 你想走的话 随时可以走
You know, you can leave anytime you want, Rick.

不管你了 你这个小废逼
Whatever you want to do, you little punk-ass little bitch.

谢谢你 Morty
Thank you, Morty.

你和其他的碳基生命不一样
You are not like other carbon-based life-forms.

你把其他的生命看的比自己重要
You put the value of all life above your own.

就应该是这样
It's how things should be.

就可以是这样
It's how they could be.

我完全赞同
I could not agree more.

关于身份不明的人状人逃犯的离奇案件

有人把我们卖了
Somebody dropped the dime on us.

机头

I'm sorry, Rick.

抓住你的赏金太高了
The reward on your head is too high.

就像你经常说的
And like you always say,

人不为己 天诛地灭
You got to look out for number one.

该诛的是不为老子做事的人
Number one is me, asshole!

我们该是一伙儿的
You're supposed to be my friend!

一伙儿的 那你知道我的真名吗
Friend?! Do you even know my real name?

是小Revolio Clockberg
It's Revolio Clockberg Junior.

我是齿轮人中的一员
I belong to an entire species of gear people.

叫我"机头"
Calling me "Gearhead"

就等于管一个中国人叫"黄脸佬"
Is like calling a chinese person "Asia face."

别 别扔树枝
No! Not twigs!

有两点 你们全都给我搞清楚
Two things I want to make clear to everybody in this room

一 永远也别背叛我 二 该走了
Never betray me, and it's time to go.

不许动
Nobody move!

噢天 那不会是
Oh, my god. Are those...

嘿 Morty 记得你说过
Hey, Morty, remember when you said

卖枪和亲自扣扳机没两样吗
Selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger?

因为你做的选择
How do you feel about all these people

现在死了这么多人 你有何感想啊
That are getting killed today because of your choices?

我没做错 Rick
I did the right thing, Rick!

- 这话你和机头的机蛋说去吧  - 明明是你下的手
- Tell that to Gearhead's Gearsticles. - You did that!

呵呵 这个时候我本来该在玩"Roy"
Wrong! I'd be playing "Roy" right now.

Morty 事情发展到这一步 我也别无他法
At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.

难以置信Rick能干出这种事
I can't believe Rick did this.

- 这是第八根压死骆驼的最后稻草了 - 我预下 
- This is the eighth to the last straw. - Ante up.

去他的
You know what? Screw it!

咱们赌点更大的吧
I have a better gamble for you guys.

咱越狱
I say we escape.

你要是想走 可以从前门出去
If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.

你以为我们留在这儿是被逼的吗
You think we're kept here against our will?

那样是违法的
That would be illegal.

但如果你们可以走的话 你们还留在这儿干嘛
But if you can leave, then why are you still here?

和你一样
Same reason as you.

因为我们是Jerry
We're Jerrys.

我要走了
I'm leaving.

好的呀 随时都可以走哟
Okay, then. That was always allowed.

Well, I guess this is it.

我想知道为什么Greg整天挑我女朋友的刺儿
I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.

嗯 他可能就是吃醋了 想一个人占着我 
Well, he'd probably like to have me to himself.

朋友之间都是这样的啦
That's how friends are.

还是他想占着她呢

虫洞距离你所谓"这里"的
The wormhole is 70 of what you call "Meters"

所谓"南边" 还有70 所谓的 "米"
What you call "North" Of what you call "Here."

好吧 Morty 把你的屁塞回那个洞 道个别吧
Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes.

我去加点油 顺便拉一大坨Morty
I'm gonna find some fuel and take a big, fat Morty.

今天这些事以后 "Morty"现在是我对便便的新说法
That's my new word for shit because of today's events.

就是这儿了
Here it is.

这能让我回到我的族类身边
This should take me back to my kind.

屁 我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you, um, fart.

我很抱歉你的名字成了"屁"
I'm really sorry your name became fart.

我们会回来净化你们的
We will be back for your cleansing.

Um, cleansing?

碳基生物对所有高等生物来说都是威胁

你对于我们来说 就好比你们所谓的疾病
To us, you are what you would call a disease.

Wherever we discover you, we cure it.

你自己也说过 生命必须得到保护
You said yourself that life must be protected,

即使是以牺牲为代价
Even though sacrifice.

你还没有改变你的想法

你们两个是不是缠绵不休 难舍难分呵
So, did you guys make out a little bit?

他要寄明信片给你吗
Is he gonna send you a postcard?

那家伙碰上你简直像中了彩票呀
Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.

Morty 虽然我今天一直嫌弃
Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs

你的原则和你的各种决策
And decisions making a lot today,

但是我很高兴你坚持
But I am glad that you insisted

把那屁送回了家
On getting that fart home.

至少所有这些死伤和破坏
You know, at least all the death and destruction

Wasn't for nothing, you know?

你开始想念你的屁友了吗 哈
You miss your fart friend, huh?

我为你准备了一份惊喜哟
Well, I got a little surprise for you, buddy.

你走之后 我找到了一个新的虫洞
While you were gone, I found a new wormhole

洞的另一边有成千上万这样的气体
With millions of beings just like him on the other side,

他们都准备要来拜访了
And they're all coming to visit.

什么 Rick 不要 不要这样
What?! Rick, no! You can't!

太迟了 Morty 那个洞已经开了
Too late, Morty. The hole's opening.

不是啊 Rick 你不明白
No, Rick! You don't understand.

里面还有更多哦
There's- there's a lot more where that came from, too.

The first rule of space travel, kids,

务必去看看失事信标
Is always check out distress beacons.

十次有九次都是一船翘辫子的外星人
9 out of 10 times, it's a ship full of dead aliens

外加一堆东西免费拿
And a bunch of free shit!

十次能有一次是个要命的陷阱
1 out of 10 times, it's a deadly trap,

赌一把啦
But I'm ready to roll those dice.

感觉发生了很恐怖的事情啊
Seems like something terrible happened here.

Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.

出自<异形>

- 这是干嘛  - 这样警察就会
- Uh, what's that? - This'll make the cops write it up

当成Korblock人抢劫了这船
As a looting by the Korblocks.

- 这太过分了吧  - 对嘛 警察的种族主义偏见就是深 
- That's horrible. - I hear you, man. Cops are racist.

嗨 你们活着呀 感谢天感谢地
Oh, hey. You're alive. Thank god.

能帮帮我们吗
Can you help us?

我们的星球被占领了 被某种 实体
Our planet was taken over by some kind of...entity.

它吸收掉了我们族人的心智
It absorbed the minds of our people.

等我们发现已经太晚了
We didn't notice until it was too late.

被它占据的人
The people it takes over,

看上去和你的朋友
They they look like your friends,

家人 上司 没有什么两样
Your family, your leaders,

但是他们已经不再是他们自己了
But they're not themselves anymore.

他们成了它的一部分
They're part of...it.

你们怎么知道它没跟上船
Then how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you?

这俩傻子看着很淡定啊
Those two dingdongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.

不要啊 住手
Hey, no! No, wait! Stop!

我就说
Called it.

你好啊 Rick
Hello, Rick.

好久不见
Long time no see.

联合体

哎呀
Oh, boy. Uh...

Morty和Summer是我的外孙和外孙女
These are my grandkids, Summer and Morty.

Summer Morty 这位是联合体
Summer, Morty, this is, uh, unity.

我们以前谈过一段时间恋爱
We sort of used to, uh...date.

小联 你这儿搞得挺好的呀
Quite an operation you got going here, une.

你现在是一整个星球咯
You're a whole planet now, huh?

我们分手以后
After we broke up,

我在宇宙中漫游了一段时间
I spent some time wandering through space.

然后我发现了这里
Then I found this world

在这儿我能更好地专注于同一化的伟业
where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.

- 就是偷别人的身体吗  - 太没礼貌了 Summer
- You mean stealing people's bodies? - Summer, rude.

你们俩孩子和联合体一边玩儿去
Why don't you two kids go run off and play with unity

我和联合体叙叙旧
While unity and I do some catching up.

等下 Rick
No, wait, Rick,

这些人不会吐我们一嘴把我们吸收掉吗
Aren't these people gonna barf into our mouths and absorb us?

你们在这里是客人
You're guests here on my planet.

可以做自己
You're free to be yourselves.

我从来都不太能让Rick失望
I've never been any good at disappointing Rick.

你再说我要吐了
Well, now I'm going to barf.

走吧 Morty
Come on, Morty.

Jerry 你在这儿干嘛呢
Jerry, what are you... what are you doing in here?

找除草机
I'm trying to find our weed whacker,

因为咱的大麻(草)老挫(音同割草)了
'cause our weeds are wack, yo.

- Rick不在 你不能进车库里来  - 不能
- But you can't go in the garage when rick's not here. - I "Can't"?

- 他会不高兴的  - 他能怎么样
- Well, he doesn't like it. - What's he gonna do?

跑去别的亲戚家白吃白住
Crash rent-free at his other family's house?

你这话什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

你爹这么骑我们头上
Your dad gets to walk all over us

还不是因为你怕他又一走了之
Because of your abandonment issues.

妹儿咧 他这是牵着你的鼻子走
He's playing you, shorty.

好好说话 别嘻哈了
Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect.

你把话题转移到我说话的方式上 
Stop shifting the cross hairs to my ironic urban patois

还不是因为你和你爹的关系
Just because your relationship with your father

简直是稀了个巴的烂
Is to' up from the flo' up.

什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

别管了 我们走吧
I don't know. Let's just leave.

这儿有个暗门
That is a hatch.

你爸在我的车库里装了暗门
Your father put a hatch in my garage.

又不一定是他干的
You don't know it was him.

真的 我们不该进来的
Anyway, we're not supposed to be in here.

在下面叫唤的那玩意儿也不该
Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there.

"已实现世界和平" 棒
"World peace achieved." Nice.

不过你自己还要就此发报纸
Little weird to publish a paper about it

就有点奇怪了 
For yourself, but hey.

然后呢
So, what's next?

等我成为一型文明以后
After I become a type-one civilization,

这颗星球会受邀进入星系联邦
This world will be invited into the galactic federation.

哦哟
Oh, goody.

我就有机会
From there, I'll have access to

接触无数的星球与种族
Countless planets and species.

一个接一个 我会将他们同化
One by one, I will unify them,

我将会成为宇宙
I will become the universe,

成为独立心智们口中
And I will be what the single-minded

所谓的神
Once called a god.

挺好的
I like that.

挺性感
Oh, that's pretty sexy.

这儿哪儿有酒喝
Hey, listen, where can we get a drink around here?

这类消遣品在这儿已经不需要了
Recreational substances were phased out here.

没有必要自我逃避
There's no need for escape from the self

世界已经融为一体
When your world is one.

联合体呀联合体 我这是和谁在说话呢
Unity, unity, who am I talking to?

我可是看着你同化了整个警察局
I watched you assimilate a whole police station

就是为了取走证物柜里的东西呢
Just to get your hands on the evidence locker.

Rick 我们相遇的时候 我还是一个年轻的群集心智
Rick, when we met, I was a young hive mind

只有一个小镇的人口
With the population of a small town.

人是会变的
People change...

尤其是我改变他们的时候
Especially when I change them.

很抱歉让你失望了
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

但我成长了
But I've grown.

我也成长了啊
Hey, listen, I've grown, too.

真的
I have!

我这不是和我的家人重聚了吗
See, I've I've reconnected with my family, right?

呵 是为了什么呢 
Hm. Why's that, I wonder?

可能人变老了就是这样吧
Maybe it's part of getting old.

可能我只是怀念和一个群体在一起的日子
Maybe I just missed being with a collective.

嗯 Rick
Yes, Rick. Yes.

嗯 嗯
Oh, yeah. Yes. Yes.

停 等下
Wait, wait. Stop. Hold it.

光这样不行
Not like this.

来一悬挂式滑翔机
We need a hang glider

一套开档的山姆大叔衣服
And a crotchless uncle sam costume,

然后你这儿最大的体育场
And I want the entire field of your largest stadium

场地上塞满裸体的红发美女
Covered end to end with naked redheads,

看台上面再挤满
And I want the stands packed

所有远看着像我爸爸的人
With every man that remotely resembles my father.

看看他们 太协调了
Man, look at them go. So coordinated.

你怎么了
What's your problem?

他们给你雕了一个总统山
They're making you into a mount rushmore.

还有汉堡吃
They made burgers!

Morty你睁大眼看看
Morty, open your eyes.

"他们"已经不在了
There is no "They."

这些可怜人的身体被利用了
These poor people's bodies are being used.

这一整个星球都是人偶罢了
They're a planet of puppets.

你说什么我能听到的
I can hear you.

但是我觉得这里的人都觉得没关系啊
Well, it seems like everybody here's cool with it.

除了那些红发美女
Except for all those redheads.

看上去急着去什么地方呢
They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else.

Summer要气球吗
Balloon, Summer?

Morty呢
Balloon, Morty?

我们才不要你的破气球
No, we don't want your dumb balloons, okay?

我们现在很无聊 带我们去找Rick
We're bored. Take us back to Rick.

现在不太合适
Now's not a good time.

爽
Oh, yeah!

来吧宝贝儿
I want yooooooou!

儿呀 上啊
Go, son, go!

儿呀 上啊
Go, son, go! Go, son, go!

哎哟哟 真是不得了
Oh, real nice. Real nice.

我完全没发现 怎么做到的
How does a man do this without me noticing?

我爸嘛 你也知道
Oh, you know my dad

他做事要是用点心
Once he puts his mind to something.

你还表扬他的成果
You're spinning this to his credit?

我要下去
I'm going down there.

- Jerry - Beth 这是我家房子
- Jerry - Beth, this is my house,

所以这是我的车库 我的暗门
Which makes this my garage, my secret hatch,

我的地下密室 以及我的无脸秘怪
My hidden subterranean lair, and my faceless gargler.

你现在是要继续怨我
Now, are you gonna keep hating this playa

还是遂了窝的西
Or are you gonna jack my steez?

你这已经是在胡编乱造瞎胡说了
Okay, you're just making stuff up now.

我个天
Ugh. Oh, my god.

我个天
Oh, my god.

Rick 今天这次真是棒呢
Oh, Rick. That was so bad.

"今天这次"是什么意思
What's this "Was" Stuff?

我就是补充点水分
I just need to hydrate,

完了接着来
Then we're doing that again.

- 该死  - 如果是来侵略的
- Oh, damn. - Listen, if this is an invasion,

我也做不了啥
I got to sit this one out,

但是我会回来和幸存者做爱的
But I'll be back to have sex with the survivors.

是邻近的群集心智的种族
It's a neighboring hive-mind species,

Beta Seven是在致敬<星际迷航>中的种族Borg

贝塔七
Beta seven.

我们星球之间保持着实用的联盟关系
Our planets maintain a practical alliance

交换关键资源

友善点
So be nice.

联合体
Unity,

我来得不是时候吗
Is it a bad time?

当前的所有生命都被同化了吗
Are all present life forms assimilated?

贝塔七 这是我的独立心智朋友 Rick
Beta seven, this is my single-minded friend

他来自地球
From earth, Rick.

Rick Sanchez
Rick Sanchez.

Unity跟我提到过你
Unity has spoken of you.

都是坏话吧 哈哈
All bad, I hope. Ha ha!

天呐你这动静
Oh, jesus christ.

七号 如果你对我的盟友有意见
Beta seven, if my allies are a problem for you,

那我们的联盟也不能继续了
Perhaps our alliance is, as well.

我们的联盟是互利的
Our alliance is beneficial.

贝塔七表示出的关心
When beta seven expresses concern,

只是因为
It it's only be-because

我的老天 这是零号元素的粉末
Oh, snap! Powdered neutronium?

安非他粒子
Amphetetron?

有了这些东西 你知道我能做出什么吗
You know I can make with this stuff?

Rick 我不能这样
Oh, Rick, I I shouldn't.

别啊 我又不是每天都能来找你
Come on. It's not every day that I'm in town.

想想我们曾经的美好时光
It's it's for old time's sake.

那 好吧 管他呢
Uh...okay, what the hell.

我们可以纯化树脂 做迷幻粉
We can purify the resin and make fractal dust.

我是想做光速马天尼的 
Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but

怎么 Rick老了 不能和整个星球的人狂欢了吗
Aw, old man Rick can't party with a whole planet?

你们能做的 我都能做哟 还不止呢
I can do whatever you do and more, baby.

我觉得那个贝塔七
You know, I think beta seven over there

不只是想和保持"实用"的联盟关系而已
Is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.

讨厌
Stop.

怪不得电费贵到离谱
Well, this explains the $6,000 electric bill.

天呐
Whoa!

行 真可以
Well, nice. Real nice.

在我房子下面关外星人
Alien prisoners under the house.

真行
Real nice.

真真的好
Nice. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeal

给老娘闭嘴
God damn it, stop.

Wake up, people! You have to fight it!

你们被邪物施咒了
You're under the spell of an evil monster!

- 你说什么我能听到的 - 这句话你就接着说吧
- I can hear you. - Yeah, so you keep saying.

- Summer  - 醒醒吧
- Summer! - Wake up!

你至少还残存着一点自我的意识吧
You have to have some individuality left in there!

Summer 你为什么不喜欢我
Why do you hate me, Summer?

我没跟你说话
I'm not talking to you.

我跟他说话的人是这位 Steven Phillips
I'm talking to... Steven Phillips.

Steven 重获自由吧
Steven, set yourself free.

Summer 在我占领这个星球之前
Summer, before I took over this planet,

这个人是登记在案的性侵犯者
This man was a registered sex offender.

那又怎么样 至少那是他自己
Yeah? Well, so what? At least he was himself.

这女的原先是个几近自杀的瘾君子
This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide.

现在她是海洋生物学家
Now she's a marine biologist.

听着 我觉得我姐姐的意思不是说
Listen, Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say

没有你干预的生命就是完美的
That life would be perfect without you.

她的意思是 这样的生命
I think she's just saying that life would be,

才是生命的样子
You know, life.

生命在这里因为我的转化宛若天堂
I have transformed life here into a paradise.

站街女成了科学家
Prostitutes are now scientists.

流浪汉变"则学家"
The homeless are now "Phisosophers."

"则学家"吗 真棒
Oh. Oh. "Ph-phisosophers"? Nice.

- 则学 择靴  - 天呐
- Philopol... phiphophopher... - Oh, my god.

谁教会你说的话 你这骗走外公的婊子
Where did you learn to talk, you grandpa-stealing slut?

我感觉
I'm feeling...

天呐 我来扶你们
Oh, man, let me help all of you guys up.

我没事
I'm fine.

你知道我爱你哪一点吗 Rick
Do you know what I love about you, Rick?

你是我遇到的唯一一个有长远眼光的
You're the only single mind I've met

独立心智生物
that really sees the big picture.

你没看走眼
You got that right.

宝贝 听着
But, baby, listen

你 你是要占领无数星球甚至星系的人
Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies.

你一定 一定要记住
You got to got to just remember

有时候要放松随意 别老紧绷着
to let go sometimes, you know?

我可以很随意啊 看我的
I can let go. Hey, look.

你看到河对岸那个小镇了吗
You see that town across the river?

看着
Watch this.

- 天呐  - 哈哈
- Whoa! - Ha ha! Whoo!

我不是这个意思
Whoa! That's not what I meant!

没事的 没事
It's okay. It's okay.

我已经疏散了小镇上的人 你看
I evacuated. I evacuated the town. Look.

我们在这里 我们没事
Hey! We're right here. We're fine.

太赞了
Oh, that was awesome.

我的孙子孙女没在那个镇子吧
My my grandkids weren't in that town, right?

他 他们还活着吧
A-are my grandkids alive?

我 我的酒喝完了
M-my drink is empty.

- 怎么回事啊联合体  - 联合体是谁
- Unity, what's happening? - Who's Unity?

你们两个的脚真好看 我能拍个照吗
You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?

真恶心 不要
Gross. No.

我觉得你的愿望要成真了 Summer
I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer.

联合体好像出了什么问题
Something's happening to Unity.

你们还记得自己是谁吗
Do all of you remember who you are?

记得 我叫Ron Benson
Yeah, uh, my name is Ron Benson.

我是个电子工程师 有两个孩子
I'm an electrical engineer, father of two,

看见我的两个同心双圆平乳环 你就能知道
And, as you can see from my flat, concentric nipple rings,

我是这个星球上最高贵的种族
I'm a member of this planet's top race!

好吧 
Okay, that's good.

就是别再想你说的后半截 
Uh, don't focus too much on the last part, but

我叫Daryl Jefferson 是个地产商
I'm Daryl Jefferson. I'm a landscaper.

我死也不同意
And I'll be damned if

那胸上穿洞的贱人是优等种族
That ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!

锥子胸人才是世界的统治者
The cone-nipple people will rule this world!

闭嘴吧 你这胸上长角的傻逼
You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards.

你说我什么
What'd you say to me,

你这个奶头似靶心的废物
You target-chest piece of shit.

种族战争
Race war!

你们何必打架呢
Why are you fighting?!

你们看不出大家都是一样的吗
Can't you see you're all the same?

Summer
Oh, Summer.

第一次见识种族战争吧你
First race war, huh?

Summer你真棒 挑起了种族战争
Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.

不是我引起的 他们才是种族主义者
I didn't start it! They're the racists.

我 我只是点燃了导火索
I... I merely empowered them

让他们追寻本来就扭曲的梦想
to follow their apparently misguided dreams.

多谢你有心说明
Okay, thanks for clarifying.

这下我的墓碑上就能写清楚了
I'll have a super-accurate headstone now.

你们两个是什么种族
Hey, wait what race are you guys?

都不是 你看
We're neither. S-see?

听我说
Yeah, take my word for it.

我们就是普普通通的乳头
We just have regular nipples.

这两个怪物没有种族
Hey, these two freaks have no race!

没有哪里比得上家
Oh, there's no place like home.

<绿野仙踪> 中桃乐西说出这句话以后便回到了家

没有哪里比得上家 你还记得吗Summer
There's no place like home. Remember, Summer?

- 里边儿有桃乐西和小矮人的电影  - 我记得
- From Dorothy and the tiny people movie? - Yes, yes.

- 都是小不点  - 桃乐西 带我们走吧
- All the tiny people. - Dorothy, take us away.

Summer Morty 你们好啊
Hello, Summer. Hello, Morty.

- 你们现在安全了  - 你是联合体吗
- It's okay. You're safe now. - Unity?

- 是的  - 实在抱歉
- Yes. - Oh, Unity, I am so sorry.

我不知道自由意味着人们会做这种蠢事
I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks.

我以为自由
I was thinking more of

就是能自己选自己手机的运营商
A choose your own cellphone-carrier thing.

你并没有做错什么
Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong.

我和你外公玩得有点过
I'm having fun with your grandpa.

有点失控了
Lost a little control.

貌似现在不适合开着飞行器
Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter,

管理着二十万所儿科医院
Nor should I be running 200,000 pediatric hospitals

还有一千两百万个油炸锅
And 12 million deep fryers,

但是这个星球的事情
But hey, it's not like this planet

又不能撒手不管了
Can take its business elsewhere.

我们是不是该半路停一下
Um, should we maybe stop somewhere

你先喝点咖啡缓缓神
And get you a coffee?

要不往你脸上浇点冷水什么的 或者
Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...

哦不不 如果我想要清醒的话
No, no, if I wanted to be sober,

我一开始就不会喝醉了
I wouldn't have gotten drunk.

天呐 我等不及了
Oh, man. I cannot wait

我迫不及待想听听他怎么解释
I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this.

他必须走
He is gone.

Jerry 求你别这样好吗
Jerry, stop, please, okay?

我们都不应该来这里的
We weren't even supposed to be down here.

我们只要找他当面对峙
If we confront him about this

哎哟 我真喜欢你这样
Oh, my god! I love this.

你这样百般为他辩解
I love that this is how far you will go for him.

你就想上楼切你的胡萝卜
You want to go upstairs and cut carrots

然后看你的肥皂剧
And watch a lifetime original

就在这[哔]关了外星人的地牢上面
Above a [bleep] alien dungeon!

你和你爸的关系很病态
Your relationship with your father is psychotic.

你听听你这添油加醋的说
Oh, listen to you relish the idea

说到底就是我的天才老爸是个坏人
that my genius father is a bad person.

先把你的好胜心放一边
Step out of your ego for a second

看看这东西 这是个怪物
And look at this thing it's a monster.

恐怕他把这怪物锁起来
He might have it chained up

是为了防止它把我们的星球吃掉吧
So that it doesn't eat the planet!

是啊 你爸就是这么为他人着想
Right, because your father's such an altruist?

我有次看到他连"人类"这个词都忘了怎么说
I once saw him briefly forget the word for "Humans".

他说不定是为了收集这个生物的器官
He's probably harvesting this creature's organs.

他说不定是要抢着先治愈这东西的太空艾滋病
He's probably racing to cure its space aids.

- 他要吃了它  - 他在保护它
- He's going to eat it! - He's protecting it!

- 闭嘴  - 闭嘴
- Shut up! - Shut up!

哎呦
Whoa!

这地方简直一团糟
Unity, this place is a mess.

没关系
Oh, it's cool.

我作为保洁员的那一部分周五就会过来
The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.

天呐 一个小时之后
Oh, my god. I have a meeting

我还要在银河联邦开会
At the galactic federation in an hour.

我到不了了
Oh, I'll never make it.

那就推到下周吧
Ah, I'll push it to next week.

Unity 你能把Rick叫到这里吗
Unity, could you get Rick out here, please?

他有事脱不开身 他正在
He's unavailable. He's...

正在和你做爱 我们明白 真恶心
Having sex with you. We get it. Gross.

现在就让他出来
Get him out here now.

我觉得他不会想来的
I don't think he wants to be

- 外公  - Rick
- Grandpa Rick! - Rick! Rick!

我要告诉爸妈
I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo

你在车库锁了个Gagoo
You have locked up under the garage!

你们到底要闹哪样
What the hell is your problem?

我们要回家 立刻马上
Grandpa, we need to go home, now.

天 随便你
Fine. Sheesh.

拜拜
See you.

Rick 我们一起走啊
Uh, Rick, I think we should all go.

玩你们自己的去 孩子们 我这儿忙着呢
Tend to your garden, kids. I'm kind of doing a thing here.

喔耶
Whoo!

外公 你不走我们也不走
Grandpa Rick, we're not leaving without you.

我的天 孩子们 我懂了
Oh, my god, you guys. I get it.

你们是怕强大的坏联合体
You're afraid the big, bad hive mind

抢走你们的外公
Is gonna steal your grandpa away.

才怪呢 我现在觉得联合体很伟大
Actually, no. I think Unity's great

是你在带坏它
And you're a horrible influence on it.

- 啥  - Rick 你们的关系很不健康
- What?  - This isn't healthy, Rick.

你知道吗 你给这儿带来的
You know, you're you're really up to no good around here

都是负面影响 不是吗
a-at this place, you know?

你和联合体就像
You and Unity are like

紧身裤和中短靴
Like leggings and mid-calf boots.

自以为很相配
You think you're great together,

但其实互暴其短
But you're just bringing out the worst in each other.

天哪 Summer 挺会说的哈
Oh, gee. Boy, Summer. Well put.

不如我们看看联合体怎么想
Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks?

联合体
Unity?

我只是想寻点乐子
I'm just taking a little break from stuff.

你懂吗 我需要放松
You know? I need to relax.

哎呀 这是什么新闻
Oh, hey, w-what's this on the news, guys?

把声音调大点
L-l-let me turn it up.

今日新闻
In the news today,

实际情况没有看上去那么糟
This looks a lot worse than it is.

只是寻寻乐子 无伤大雅
We're really just having a good time.

- Karen  - 谢谢 Todd
- Karen?  - Thanks, Todd.

下则新闻 你到底是忧心的孙辈
Up next, are you a concerned grandchild

还是扫兴鬼
Or just a buzzkill?

我们马上告诉你如何获得正确答案
We'll tell you how you can know for sure.

你们少数得服从多数了吧
I think you two are a little outnumbered.

好吧 那如果是为了我呢
Okay, well, what if you did it for me?

依你孙子女的 一起回去
What if you came with us as a favor to us

因为你爱我们
Because you love us?

啥咧 傻哭 拜拜
What? Dumb. Bye.

Rick Summer她只是
But Rick, Summer's just

她只是个多愁善感的缺爱
Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little

什么来着
What's the word I'm looking for here?

呃 人类
Uh...human.

家族遗传没办法
It runs in the family.

我可以容忍但我懒得伺候
I can tolerate it, but I can't give a crap about it.

慢走不送
Take a hike.

自求多福吧 联合体
Take care of yourself, Unity.

我不想听说教 请答是或否
I'm not looking for judgment, just a yes or no

你能把长颈鹿同化吗
Can you assimilate a giraffe?

- 你简直不可理喻  - 你才是
- You're the worst!  - No, you're the worst!

你根本不给我们的家庭一点支持
You don't support this family!

- 你认为支持你  - 你脑子里只能想到自己 
- You think supporting the family  - All you care about is yourself!

- 就是支持这个家庭  - 我们两个孩子
- Is about supporting you emotionally...  - you've got two children...

- 但谁能受得了你  - 被你的神经病老爹
- but you're unsupportable.  - being dragged across the cosmos

你根本是个无底洞
because it's never enough,

- Jerry  - 拖到满宇宙去溜
- Jerry!  - ...by your dangerously ill father!

还要我忍气吞声
And you force me to watch it

就因为你太害怕失去他
happen because you'd rather lose them and lose me...

因为你根本不懂
And you don't even know what it's

- 害怕失去是什么感觉  - 宁愿失去我和孩子们
- like to be afraid of losing anything  - ...than lose him!

因为你只懂依赖
Because you cling and you cling.

为什么 因为幼稚的是你 Beth
And why? Because you're the child, Beth!

不是我 是你
You, not me! You!

我的天啊 
Oh, my god. Aah!

初次见面 你们好
Um, first of all, hello.

哟 我是Korblock人 叫Blim Blam
Uh, my name is blim blam the korblok.

其次 我就直说了吧
Second of all, cards on the table,

我是个爱吃婴儿的怪物
I'm a murderer that eats babies,

我就是来地球吃婴儿的
And I came to this planet to eat babies.

除此之外 我还携带一种传染性极强的疾病
However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease

按你们的叫法算是 太空艾滋
That I suppose you could call "Space aids" As you put it.

而Rick把我锁在这里
And rick did chain me up

的确是为了寻求治愈的疗法
So that he could attempt to cure it.

然而
At the same time,

他治疗我
Rick's motivation to cure my disease

不是为了救我 或救任何人
Was not to save my life or anyone else's,

而是为了申请专利 大赚一笔
But to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks.

但你们知道我为何
But you know the reason why

要挣脱掉镣铐的吗
I ripped my chains out of the wall?

你们知道为何我决定再不返回这个星球吗
And do you know why i'm never coming back to this planet?

因为你们俩简直[哔]不可理喻
Because the two of you are the [bleep] worst!

你们厌恶对方 更厌恶自己
You both hate yourselves and each other.

还把这一切怪到Rick身上
And the idea that it has anything to do with rick

简直可笑
Is laughable.

我都憋不住了 可惜我没笑这功能
I'd laugh, but I'm biologically incapable.

因为我他妈是个外星人
That's how alien I am.

但外星人如我 听到你俩在那里逼逼叨
And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you

都[哔]的受不了了
And being like, "What the [bleep]"

好了 祝你们俩这烂婚百年好合
So good luck with your shitty marriage,

请转告Rick 我很同情他摊上你们这种人
And tell rick I'm sorry he has to deal with either of you.

Blim Blam 闪人
Blim blam out.

这玩意儿我要了
You know what? I'm taking this.

怎么开不了
How do you.. what is this?

这是慢速模式吗
Uh, is there a slow setting?

这门 太赞
Best door ever.

我想看他们哭 但是要幸福的泪水
Okay, okay. Now make them cry, but happy crying.

让他们取笑金发的那个
Now make them all make fun of the blonde one.

让他们到桌上去弄
Now make them all do it on the table.

难以置信 你竟为我拍了一部电视剧
I can't believe you created a whole show for me.

现在砍了它
Now cancel it.

哈哈 续订 续订
Okay, now put it back on.

好吧 我玩腻了
All right, I'm bored.

Rick 你要不联系一下
Rick, is there a way for you

Summer和Morty
To call Summer and Morty?

- 我挺歉意的 他们  - 切 让他们玩蛋去
- I feel bad that they..  - Pbht. screw those guys.

我去去就回
Ugh. I'll be right back.

别在小混蛋们身上浪费精力 联合体
Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity.

他们和你占据的
They're no different from any of

那些行尸走肉没多大区别
the aimless chumps that you occupy.

只是因为你强大
They just put you at the

他们才把你奉为世界的中心
center of their lives because you're powerful.

但因为是他们把你捧上去的
And then because they put you there,

他们又想限制你
They want you to be less powerful.

休想得逞 对吧
Never gonna happen though, right?

对
Never.

休想得逞 待会儿见
Never. Back in a flash.

有史以来最爽的周末 Rick
Best weekend ever, Rick.

我同意 Rick 让我们再接再厉 
I agree, Rick. Let's see how long we can go.

小联 你还有
Hey, Une. You got any more

原谅我 Rick 我只能留下字条
Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes.

我没有和你当面告别的勇气
I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.

我现在懂了 你吸引我的地方
I realize now that I'm attracted to you

正是我不能和你在一起的原因
For the same reason I can't be with you.

你无法改变
You can't change.

这不是坏事
And I have no problem with that,

但对我来说 却是无法迈过的一道坎
But it clearly means I have a problem with myself.

我知道完美的我并不存在
I'm sure there's no perfect version of me

我知道我会同化一个接一个的种族
I'm sure I'll just unify species after species

却永远无法真正的完美
And never really be complete.

但我知道我们的结局
But I know how it goes with us.

我会失去自我 成为你的一部分
I lose who I am and become part of you.

最为奇怪的就在于此
Because in a strange way,

明明是我的专长 你毫不费力便胜过了我
You're better at what I do without even trying.

永远独属于你的
Yours, and nobody else's,

联合体
Unity.

顺带一提 我不知道被同化前
P.S., I don't know where those coal miners were

那些煤工们去过什么地方
Before they were assimilated.

你最好去体检一下
You might want to get checked.

嘿
Hey.

爸爸
Dad.

Jerry和我
I, um Jerry and I

在找我们的除草机时
Were looking for our weed whacker

发现了你的地下密室
And found your subterranean lair

和你的外星囚犯
And your alien prisoner,

他跑了
And he got away.

我知道我听上去像妈妈
And I know I sound like mom,

但我不能因为害怕失去你的恐惧
But I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety

而牺牲整个家庭的安全
Just because I'm afraid you'll leave again,

所以 不要再囚禁外星人了
So no more alien prisoners

也不要再在地下动土了
And no more subterranean excavation

至少预先和我们商议一下
Without consulting us.

- 行  - 行
- Okay.  - Okay?

你的"行"就是丢下一句话就把自己传送走
"Okay" Like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere

- 永不回来吗  - 不 这是你的房子
- And never come back?  - No. It's your house.

外公 你和联合体怎么了
Grandpa Rick, what happened with Unity?

谁 联合体啊 
Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well...

老实说 它是个把自己的兴盛
I mean, honestly, we're talking about an entity

建立在奴役之上的存在 不是吗
That thrives on enslavement, you know?

这可不好 虽然有趣 但谁消受得起
It's not cool. Fun's fun, but who needs it?

我去车库了
I'll be in the garage.

Chaos Chaos
<Do You Feel It>

联合体 联合体
Unity! Unity!

联合体
Unity!

- 请问需要什么帮助  - 我要和联合体谈谈
- How can I assist you?  - I want to talk to Unity,

贝塔七 我知道它在这里
Beta seven, I know it's in there.

你已被认定为敌对单位
You're classified as a hostile entity,

联合体不想跟你谈
and Unity doesn't want to talk to you.

我知道你的把戏 贝塔七号
I know your game, beta seven.

你这种的我见多了
I've met a billion of you,

你这个召之即来挥之即去的备胎
You little on-deck, in-the-wings shoulder to cry on!

你已被认定为敌对单位
You are classified as a hostile entity.

哎哟 你他妈还得瑟了是吧
Oh, you're just loving this, mother

别想得太美了
This isn't gonna shake out like you think, pal.

联合体不可能喜欢其他的群集心智
Unity's not into other hive minds.

它不过是想利用你 同化你
It's gonna suck you in and use you up,

再等一个月
And a month from now,

你就得带着红色假发
I'm gonna be making out with all of you

跟我亲热了
In a bunch of red wigs!

联合体 联合体
Unity! Unity!

联合体 我知道你能听到 快出来
Unity, I know you can hear me. Get out here.

武器系统已开启
Weapons systems engaged.

就你这瘪三还武器系统
Oh, in your dreams you have weapon systems.

Rick 你不是说我们是出来看电影的吗
Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie.

本来就是 Morty
We are, Morty.

好吧 瘪塔七号
All right, Beta shit seven,

算你走运 小婊子
You just got saved by the bell, bitch!





第二季 第四集



Steve 我收到了一封奇怪的邮件
Steve, I just got a weird e-mail.

- 你给我们买机票了吗  - 露馅了
- Did you buy us airline tickets? - Aw, shoot.

本来该是个惊喜的
It was supposed to be a surprise.

我想感谢你们
I wanted to thank you

让我在这里住了这么久
for letting me live here all this time,

所以我请大家去度假
so I'm treating the family to a vacation!

Steve 你真好
Steve, you're so sweet.

- 谢谢Steve伯伯  - 伯伯最棒
- Thanks, Uncle Steve! - Best Uncle ever.

小心咯 外面的世界
Look out, world.

我们一家要去巴黎啦
The Smith family is going to Paris!

爽呆
Yeah!

Rick 别把发光的石头扔在厨房的垃圾桶
Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash!

那你也别把你那失业的基因
Well, I don't like your unemployed genes

传给我孙子孙女
in my grandchildren, Jerry

但是活着就要学会妥协
But life is made of little concessions.

我 懒得跟你说
I...you know what?

你的工作会稳定下来的 Jer
You're gonna land on your feet, Jer.

会有一家公司因为雇了我弟弟
Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars

而感谢上苍的
they hired my little brother.

- 你[哔]是谁  - 我的呆哥哥 Steve
- Who the [bleep] are you? - My goofy brother, Steve.

他在这住了快一年了
He's been living here almost a year now.

你疯了吗
Are you losing your mind?

他玩那发光石头
Hey, someone's been spending too much time

玩傻了吧 哈哈
around glowing rocks. Am I right?

- 我的天  - 快叫救护车
- Oh, my God! - Call an ambulance!

Rick你这是搞什么
What the hell, Rick?! What the hell?!

你们能不能别紧张
Will everybody just relax for a second?

根本就没有"Steve伯伯"这号人
There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve".

这是个外星寄生虫
That is an alien parasite.

但是我们从小就认识啊
But I've known him my whole life.

当然不是这样
No, you haven't, Jerry.

这些怪物能心灵感应
These telepathic little bastards,

他们把自己植入你们的记忆中
they embed themselves in memories,

然后就借机繁殖
and th-then they use those to multiply

扩张种群 占领整个星球
and spread out, take over planets.

真是 恶心
It's... it's disgusting.

没有Steve这个人吗
Steve wasn't real?

它不是人 就是坨屎
He's a real piece of shit.

这东西已经长这么大了
This is a big one.

可能它粘在谁鞋底
Somebody probably tracked it in last week

或者某人把什么外星水果带回来
on the bottom of their shoe

这玩意才到我们家的
or on a piece of alien fruit.

- 某人  - 别忙着抢占道德制高点
- Someone? - Get off the high road, Summer.

我们得红眼病
We all got pink eye

还不就是因为你上厕所的时候一直发短信
because you won't stop texting on the toilet.

但是Steve伯伯教我骑的单车
But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike!

不 这东西让你这么认为的
No, "Steve" Put that memory in your brain

所以它才能吃你的住你的 然后繁殖
so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply.

可能已经滋生起来了
We could be infested with these things.

我们得小心那些
So we got to keep an eye out

突然冒出来的乱七八糟古里古怪的人
for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.

在这里
Ooh, whee!

你需要什么 我们都乐意效劳
Whatever you want, Rick! We're here to help!

谢谢 便便洞先生
Thanks, Mr.Poopybutthole.

你太靠得住啦
I always could count on you.

本集片头有彩蛋

我们一共只有六个人
All right. There's six of us, and that's it.

我 Morty Jerry Beth 便便洞先生 和Summer
Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr.Poopybutthole, and Summer.

说不定第一只被你及时清理掉了 Rick
Maybe you got the first one in time, Rick!

不能冒这个险
Can't afford to chance it.

老爸 为什么我们家会有防爆屏蔽
Dad, why does our house have blast shields?

Beth 这个问题的答案太多了
Trust me, Beth, you don't want to know how many answers

你还是不知道为妙
that question has.

简直要有幽闭恐怖症了
Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic!

让我想起来
Reminds me of that time

我们被困在电梯里那次
we all got stuck in the elevator together.

你 你们还记得吗 浩克音乐剧那次
Y...remember that? After "The hulk" Musical?

不是锤得用力 按钮就会变好用的 Jerry
Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder,

而且泡沫拳套也不会让你变强
and foam fists don't make you strong.

我知道 朋友才会让我变强
I know. Friends make you strong.

刚才的音乐剧我又不是没看
I watched the same musical you did.

为什么不让我把传送枪带上
Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?

为什么所有的饮料都是特大杯
Why did all the drinks have to be extra large?

因为浩克块头大 我才意识到
Oh, the hulk. I just got that.

直接尿裤子好了 我们刚困住的时候我就尿了
Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.

好吧好吧 我很丢人
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.

好歹我还知道我说的话恶心 
At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.

我们会没事的
Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine.

我一直在你们身边 永远都会
I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be.

有人叫了修理工吗
Somebody call for repairs?

耶 Nicky表兄
Yay! Cousin Nicky!

是我 Nicky表兄
It's me, cousin Nicky.

表哥我两脚生风 现在没有真的在走啦
I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not.

我蹲在电梯竖井里呢
I'm crouched in the elevator shaft,

但表哥我举步生风
but hey, I'm walkin' here!

真的
It's true.

我们一家确实会遇到一些奇怪的情况
We really do get into some crazy situations as a family,

特别是这样被关在一起的时候
mostly when we're cooped up like this.

也许便便洞先生说得对
Hey, maybe Mr.Poopypants is right.

我 我们开门通通风吧
L-let's get some fresh air.

别这样Nicky 你听到刚才Rick说的了
Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick.

在确信清理完那些怪物之前
We have to stay quarantined until

我们必须与外界隔离
we know that there's no more of these things.

我明白你的意思
I hear you, Morty.

在布鲁克林那边 我们有个说法
Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin'...

咱举步生风
"We're walkin' here!"

Nicky 把
Nicky, get ...

啊
Oh!

这
What the...?

Nicky表兄是个寄生虫
Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!

六个人 Morty 我们应该是六个人
Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us!

有七个人的话说明其中一个是假的
If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.

但是你怎么知道是Nicky的
But how did you know it was Nicky?

我猜的 所以瞄的是他肩膀
I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.

所以我们现在不能相信自己的记忆了吗
So we can't trust any of our memories now?

多亏Nicky我们才找到那艘纳粹潜艇的
Nicky was the reason we found that old Nazi submarine.

难道那件事情没有发生吗
Did that not even happen?

当然有这件事
Well, of course it happened.

现在我拥有了拉咕巴巴魔杖
Now that I possess the mighty staff of rah-gubaba,

世界会在德意志第四帝国面前颤抖
the world will tremble before the fourth reich!

这是我最后一次
This is the last time

请你帮我复习历史末考了Rick
I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.

我们布鲁克林专门有个词来骂纳粹
Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.

我不介意被叫成纳粹
I'm comfortable being called a Nazi.

你觉得我还会在意别的词吗
You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?

说话之前动动脑子
Yeah. Think before you talk shit

拉咕巴巴 助我灭了美国
Rah-gubaba, help me kill America!

Beauregard先生
Mr.Beauregard!

充分考虑后 我决定不退休了
After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.

谢天谢地
Yeah! Oh, thank God!

有人是不是要去参加什么考试啊
Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend.

目标 Morty的高中
Set a course for Morty's high school.

可能我的想法有偏见 但是如果那件事没发生
Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened,

我可能已经不是家里的管家了
then I wouldn't still be the family Butler.

真是不敢想啊
Dare to dream.

等等
Wait.

如果Beauregard先生不是我们的管家
And if Mr.Beauregard wasn't our Butler,

那我们家肯定会遇到更多麻烦
it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble.

不 别再回忆了
No! Don't flashback!

你这样只会更肿的
You're just gonna make more swelling,

- 放松  - 别担心Jerry
- just relax. - Don't worry, Jerry,

我们已经联系消防队了
we called the fire department.

你知道他们不会再来这里了
You know they won't come here anymore.

橘子酱奉上
Marmalade is served.

- 真棒  - 好极了
- Yeah! - Oh, whee!

我收回原先对英国烹饪的评价 
I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine.

接招 Summer
Take that, Summer!

我们还要睡觉呢
We're trying to sleep.

我不想一个人去那个舞会
I don't want to go to the dance alone.

那就不要一个人去
Then perhaps you shouldn't.

Beauregard先生
Aww. Mr.Beauregard.

- 我们走吧 Morty少爷   - 我们走
- Shall we, master Morty? - We shall.

等等 在出发之前
Oh, wait, don't leave without letting

先让摄影迅猛龙拍张照
photography raptor take a picture.

别再回忆了
Everybody stop remembering!

这些寄生物就像臭虫
These parasites are like bed bugs,

每次闪回就是一层床垫
and every flashback is another mattress. Look!

屋里应该只有六个人
There's only supposed to be six people in this house.

但是一直都是十个人啊
But there's always been 10.

不对
No!

我写下这个数字就说明
Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down

这里有四只寄生虫
means that there's four parasites.

你能确定吗 Rick
You sure about that, Rick?

恕我直言 主人
Begging your pardon, master Rick,

但是关于这个数字
but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion

我记忆中有些不一样啊
surrounding that number.

我们一共六个人
All right, there's six of us.

只有六个
And that's it.

我 Morty Jerry Beth 便便洞先生
Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

弗兰肯斯坦 瞌睡Gary 摄影迅猛龙
Frankenstein, sleepy Gary, photography raptor,

Beauregard先生 和Summer
Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

老爸 一共十个人
Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.

六个 十个 有什么区别吗
6, 10, what's the difference?

我只是平白无故地喜欢这个数字而已
I just love the number 6 for no reason!

我的笔呢
Where's my pencil at?

这里 用我吧
Here, Rick! Use me!

多谢 铅笔君
Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!

好像确实是如此
Yeah, I-I g...I guess that is what happened,

但我不懂我为什么那么做
but I-I don't get why I would do that.

每个人都会犯错的 Rick
Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.

要不然我为什么带个橡皮呢
Why do you think I have one of these?

对了 照片
That's it. Photos.

照片是确凿的证据
Hard evidence.

我的照片里没一张有你 便便洞先生
You're not in any of my photos, Mr.Poopybutthole.

这能说明什么
Well, what do you know about this?

我的照片里也没有你
You're not in any of mine.

我的照片都是我和学校的朋友的
All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.

怎么了 哪个十来岁少女的手机里会存家人的照片
What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family?

我们又不是摩门教徒 又不是快要死了
It's not like we're mormon or dying.

我觉得可疑的是 Summer唯一的朋友
I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend

是一只我们没见过的芭蕾舞魔法小羊
is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.

可能是在暗指<宝石宠物Tinkle> 该系列被改编成了3ds游戏

Summer
Summer!

Tinkles
Tinkles!

现在已经到睡觉时间了哎
It's past my bedtime.

tinkle也有尿尿的意思

让我带你去永不会有该去睡觉时间的乐园吧
Not in never past bedtime land!

走吧
Here we go!

*Summer和Tinkles*
Summer and tinkles

此处"致敬"Lil Jon混音版的Cooking by the Book的mv

*我们是朋友*
Friends with each other

*生活在无眠乐园*

Summer 我们要睡了哎
Summer, we're trying to sleep.

是Tinkles
It was tinkles!

Tinkles
Tinkles?

太 太可疑了
That is su... ... Suspicious.

我们经常听说这什么Tinkles
We're always hearing about this tinkles character,

- 但是我们从来没有  - 嗨 大家好
- but we never get to... - Hi, everybody.

我是Tinkles 这些是我的朋友
I'm tinkles, and these are my friends.

看到了没 Tinkles是真的
See, everyone? Tinkles is real.

所以说我也是真的
That means so am I.

Summer 对不起
Sorry, Summer. Man, I'm sorry, summer.

这次我要站在干草叉的另外一端了
I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.

在电影<科学怪人>里面 弗兰肯斯坦被人拿着干草叉和火把追着打

听着 其实我们不需要证据或者逻辑
Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic

来推出谁是自家人而谁不是
to know who's family and who isn't.

我知道Smith一家都有些什么人
I know who the Smiths are.

我高中就认识Beth了
I've known Beth since high school.

她的老公 瞌睡Gary
And her husband, sleepy Gary,

无疑是我最好的朋友
is hands down my absolute best friend.

Jerry 谢谢
Thanks, Jerry.

还有 不想冒犯你们
Beyond that, no offense to any of you,

但是 现在你们都有嫌疑
but all bets are off.

这么长时间心存疑虑 我很不习惯
Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long.

我打算就从这个怪丫头开始 一个个瞄着肩膀打
I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl.

啊
Aah!

- Rick外公  - 不要动 "Summer"
- Grandpa Rick!  - Hold still, "Summer."

Rick 这是我女儿
Rick, that is my daughter.

万一只是你这么以为呢
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, sleepy Gary?

我认识你15年了 不要让我伤害你
I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.

Rick 这些是我们的家人和朋友
Rick, these are our family and friends,

和我们一起去烧烤的人
the people we barbecue with.

你忘记那次烧烤了吗
Have you forgotten the barbecue?

等等 为什么你让我
Wait, why would you want me to ...

你肯定是寄生虫吧
you're one of them, aren't you?

Rick 你不是很喜欢那些烧烤吗
Rick. You love those barbecues, Rick.

你简直爱死了 嘿
You love them. Hai!

Rick 还记得吗
Remember it, Rick?

闭嘴 培根武士 闭嘴 阿米什半机械人
Shut up, hamurai! Shut up, amish cyborg!

现在什么情况 90年代柯南秀吗
What is this? '90s Conan?

别忘了烧烤
Remember the barbecue.

别忘了烧烤
Remember the barbecue.

别忘了烧烤
Remember the barbecue.

你知道吗 铅笔君
You know what, pencilvester?

那么老了 我才意识到
It took me my whole life to realize it,

我超爱烧烤啊
but I love barbecuing.

- 你是烧烤高手啊 Rick  - 大家 瞧瞧我啊 
- You're good at it, Rick.  - Watch me, baby.

我简直就是电影"杯中杯"中的汤姆克鲁斯
I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, "Cuisine"

那部电影叫<鸡尾酒>

那部电影叫什么来着 反正他在里面调饮料
or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks.

瞧瞧我多厉害
Yeah, check me out.

我简直就是"杯中杯"的汤姆克鲁斯
I'm like Tom cruise from "Cuisine."

太棒了
Yeah.

是这个名字吗 "杯中杯"
Is that what it's called? "Cuisine"?

嘿 大家好啊
Wow! Hey, everybody.

让我们为烧烤大师Rick欢呼吧
Let's give it up for the grillmaster Rick!

Rick Rick Rick
Rick! Rick! Rick!

等等
Wait.

不要啊
Noooooo!

快看啊
Shoot. Now look.

现在就像"Waldo在哪里"里面的一页
It's like a "Where's Waldo?" Page.

儿童游戏绘本 在人山人海中找到小男孩Waldo

你能找到我吗
Can you find me?

看这些奇奇怪的角色
Check out all these zany characters.

不要走开 马上回来
We'll be right back after these messages.

把枪放下
I think you should put down the gun

该去看医生了
and we should get you to a doctor.

把外面那些防爆屏障卸了好不好啊
What do you say we take down these blast shields?

我不会这样做的 瞌睡Gary
I can't do that, sleepy Gary.

大家听我说
All right, everybody listen to me.

我不知道你们谁是真的
I don't know if any of you guys are real,

但这间屋子肯定有很多寄生虫
but this house has been infested with fake loved ones

他们通过假的回忆来繁衍
that spread through fake memories,

如果他们离开这里 我们的星球肯定会被毁掉
and our planet will be destroyed if they get out.

但是 你也不得不承认
But, Rick, even you have to admit

你有反应过度的倾向
you do tend to overreact to stuff.

大家 赶紧啊
You guys, we got to hurry.

我刚从沃尔玛回来
I just got back from Walmart.

他们现在任天堂3DS系统只卖149块9美元啊
They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale,

Rick手上的包装盒正是塞尔达传说主题的限定版3DS XL

你每买一部 就可以得到一张价值50美元的礼物卡
plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card.

Rick的配音演员Justin Roiland三次元也的确这么干了

相当于税后总价就只有110美元了
Brings the total price down to $110 after tax.

听着 我们现在轻轻松松
Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches

就可以把那些鬼玩意儿炒到230美元一件
for 230 bucks a piece easy!

都是限量版的塞尔达传说啊
They're all limited-edition "Zelda" Ones.

快点 快点 跟我来
Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!

我们肯定能赚翻 还能一人留一部
We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one

我们可以玩任天堂的游戏哎
and we can play Nintendo games!

任天堂 免费送我吧
Nintendo, give me free stuff.

好吧 我记得干过那事儿
Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that,

但是 我肯定不会那样干的
but also, I would never do that.

Rick 别反应过度了
don't overreact, Rick.

- 瞌睡Gary 能说句话吗  - 当然
- Sleepy Gary, a word?  - Sure, Jerry.

Rick 冷静一点吧
Rick, keep a level head, okay?

因为我要告诉你一个关于Frankenstein的秘密
'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein ...

其实他是 Frankenstein制造的怪物
He's actually Frankenstein's monster.

在玛丽居里的原著中弗兰肯斯坦是疯狂科学家的名字

瞌睡Gary 
Sleepy Gary,

我脑子里想的全是和你在一起的回忆
m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship.

我可以确定你就是Beth的老公
I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband

我是你的朋友
and I'm your friend,

但如果那些回忆不可信的话 那么
but if those memories can't be trusted, then...

Jerry 照直说吧
Jerry, just say it.

瞌睡Gary 我们怎么知道我是真的呢
Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?

天啊 Jerry
Jesus, Jerry.

你就是真的
No, you're real.

看着我
Hey, look at me.

我不知道外面究竟怎么了
Now, I don't know which way is up out there,

但我了解我们自己 你就是真的
but I know us, and you're real, Jerry.

还记得我们的度假吗
Remember our vacation?

他们正在海岸那边拍新的一部"星球大战"
They're filming that new "Star wars" Movie down the coast.

- 我们去看看吗  - 好啊
- Should we check it out?  - Sure.

何乐而不为呢
Why not?

也许我们能见到楚巴卡噢
Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

太好了
I'd like that.

我们在干嘛
What are we doing?

我才不管外面发生了什么
I don't give a damn what else happens out there.

我和你总会共渡难关的
You and I are going to survive this.

好的
Okay.

嘿 我们说好了
Hey, we agreed.

在家里不能这样
Never in the house.

Rick 手表还挺酷嘛
That's a cool watch there, Rick.

我能看一下吗
Can I check it out?

别了
Uh, no thank...

好吧
Okay.

是想知道怎么卸下防爆屏障吗
Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh?

大家不觉得可疑吗
Anybody here think it's suspicious

这里那么多人忍不住想离开这里
that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?

你太偏执了 Rick 你从越南战争那时起就一直那么偏执
Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.

Frankenstein 等到这场战争
So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back

打完之后 你想干嘛
to the world, Frankenstein?

该死 我要打
ShI-I-I-I-t. I'mma bust a ...

寄生虫 快离开我的大脑 
No! Get out of my head, parasite!

放下枪
No! Drop it.

Frankenstein 把枪给我
Give me the gun, Frankenstein!

给我
Give it back!

耶
Yeah!

Frankenstein
Frankenstein!

这里有人是真的吗
Is anyone here even real?

地球上只剩我是真的了吗
Am I the only real person on earth?!

也许吧
Maybe.

或者也许吧 只是也许吧 我们都是真的
Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real.

你们认识我的 我是反转长颈鹿啊
You know me. I'm Reverse Giraffe.

我脖子和腿都很短
I have a short neck and legs.

- 我和培根战士一起上的大学  - 嘿
- I went to college with Hamurai. - Hai!

我在越南救了瓶子鬼的命
I saved ghost in a jar's life in Vietnam.

还有 Beth 
And, Beth, how many times

有多少次你伤心的时候 我都在你的身边啊
have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?

太多太多次了
Too many.

也许我们都是假的
Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.

不可能啊
That don't make no sense!

或者也许这里只有一个人在撒谎
Or maybe there's only one deceiver here ...

那个人一直在告诉我们
the person that keeps telling us

要想拯救世界
the path to salvation is being held prisoner

大家就要变成互相猜疑的屋中囚徒
and mistrusting each other.

嘿 别怪我啊
Hey, don't blame me!

我10分钟前就想射Summer一枪了
I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!

我知道我们都有对Rick愉快的回忆
I know we all have beloved memories of Rick,

但我们应该相信
but are we really supposed to believe

这位坐着飞车的疯子科学发明家
that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car

消失了那么多年之后突然来到我们这儿吗
just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?

对啊 他真的有很多
Yeah, you know, he does have

奇怪的 一听就是瞎编的口头禅哎
a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.

Wubba lubba dub dub
Wubba lubba dub dub!

Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch
Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch!

新闻如如如如上
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.

Jack 洗洗睡吧
Hit the sack, Jack.

噢噢 空翻跳
Uh-oh! Somersault jump.

禁止往沟里跳
No jumpin' in the sewer.

汉堡时间
Burger time!

橡胶宝贝宝贝沙坑
Rubber baby baby bunkers!

舔舔舔 老子的蛋
Lick, lick, lick my balls!

哟
Yeah!

经典台词
Say that all the time.

口头禅全是瞎编的
That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.

更别提他那无比含糊的来历
Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story.

Beth 我可是你亲爹
Beth, I'm your father!

是吗 爸爸 你确定吗
Oh, are you, dad? Are you?

Rick 如果你想证明自己是真人
Rick, if you want to prove you're real,

就合群点 做我们所有人都想做的
just do what any of the rest of us would do and ...

把防爆屏障打开
and... and open the blast shields

放我们出去
and let us the hell out of here!

你倒是逼我呀 名若某老犹太喜剧作家
Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy

的毛都没长齐的兔崽子
with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?

这太毒了

但是在轨道上的宇航员肯定是死光了
but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.

欢迎回到行星好音乐
Welcome back to "Planet Music"!

首先 来自Parblesnop星的
First up, let's hear the latest song

最新歌曲 The Greeby Bobes
from planet Parblesnops', The Greeby Bobes!

给我看看你们的本事
Show me what you got!

等等 停下
Hold it, hold it. Stop.

音乐不在于竞争或是囚禁
Music isn't about competition or captivity.

爱音乐即是爱自由
If you love music, you love freedom.

请让这些星球重返自由
Let these worlds be free! Please!

不合格
Disqualified.

每季都有一这样的
There's one every season.

下一个星球 Arboles Mentirosos
Moving on to planet Arboles Mentirosos.

Arboles Mentirosos人 快给我们看看
Arbolian Mentirososians, show us what you got!

来 二 三 四
A 2, 3, 4!

Rick Morty Ice-T 时间表提前了
Rick, Morty, Ice-T, the timetable's moved up.

地球六小时之后上场
Earth's on in six hours.

还嫌我们的压力不够大吗
Like we're not already under enough pressure?!

Morty 他也是照例行事而已 淡定点
Geez, Morty, the guy's just doing his job. Take it easy.

你们俩能别这么淡定吗
Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?!

我们要用六小时来写出一首歌
We've got six hours to come up with a song!

灵感都是即刻诞生的 Morty
Genius happens in the moment, Morty.

至少见见我们家里人吧
Well, can we at least go get our family?

把他们带上
You know, so we can take them--

如果输了 至少把他们一起带走
With u-- With us if we lose?

别为失败做打算
That's planning for failure, Morty.

比庸常的打算还要愚蠢
Even dumber than regular planning.

蛋蛋哟
Balls.

停下 Morty 听我说
Morty, Morty, stop. Listen.

这玩意儿没多少电了
There's only so much charge left in this thing.

如果我们传送回家再回来
If we portal home from here and back,

就没有足够的电量离开这颗星球了
we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off world.

- 明白吗 - 什么
- Get it? - What?!

知道不
Yeah. You see?

我这是不让你知道某些残酷的现实
I try to shelter you from certain realities, Morty,

如果我放任你把我也搞紧张
because if I let you make me nervous,

我们就渴爽嗨不起来了
then we can't get schwifty.

说得还挺像回事儿的 这话就是你瞎编的
Stop saying it like it's a thing! You made it up!

Morty呀 不能不能请你舔舔我的
Hey, Morty, could you lick my...

蛋蛋哟 蛋蛋哟
Balls, balls...

Rick 停下 不好笑
Rick, cut it out! It's not funny, Rick!

真是够了 这些家伙也只不过是单曲神话而已
I've seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.

那你打算怎么办呢 将军
And what's your plan, general?

我们还可以选择核弹
We still have the nuclear option.

听我的 我们可以朝天上
On my word, we can launch a missile

所有的脑袋来一发核弹
at every one of those heads in the sky.

我们的星球被困在了现场选秀里面
Our planet's held captive on a live game show,

你的办法就是超观众射导弹
and your solution is to shoot the audience?

要是我们熬过了这关 你大可以继续相信核弹
You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general.

但在此之前我会选择相信Rick与Morty
Until then, I'll put mine in Rick and Morty.

"渴嗨爽"是即兴佳作
"Get Schwifty" Was a jam.

您好 没错
Hello? Yes, sir, yeah.

谢谢您
Eh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

他说他对我们做的一切感到骄傲
He says he's proud of what we're doing

并且希望我们庆祝一次升天节
and hopes we have a great ascension festival!

- 升天节快乐 - 升天节快乐
- Happy ascension! - Happy ascension!

我们赶紧打包走人吧
We should pack up and leave town now.

我觉得咱们社区在努力应对恐惧挺好的呀
I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear

还是用过节 吃自制冰激凌的办法 
in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream.

要是你不是这么个福音无神论
If you'd stop being such an Evangelical atheist,

说不定你现在都开心死了
you might start enjoying yourself.

看看你
Whoa! Look at you!

你都戴帽子什么的啦
You're wearing the hat and everything!

还有你们的
Here's yours!

妈 今晚可不可以让我来做饭
Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?

可以呀 慢着 啥
Yeah, sure. Wait. What?

我爱你们 你们赐予我生命
I love you guys. You gave me life.

而且众头的旨意
And it's the will of the many heads

是孩子都必须尊敬父母
that all children honor their parents.

做晚饭听着很好啊
Dinner sounds nice.

不好意思 史密斯先生 太太
Pardon, Mr. And Mrs. Smith.

Summer 升天节你来吗
Summer, are you coming to the ascension?

父亲 我们可以去升天节吗
Father, can we please go to the ascension?

当然 我们去升天节吧
Sure! Let's go to the ascension.

升天节到底是什么
Wh-wh-what is it?

我们在此将被厌弃者送上天空
We hereby send these unwantables skyward

使他们或将被众头吸入
that they might be inhaled by the many heads,

小偷

小偷

哥特人

哥特人

电影院里
说话的人

电影院里
说话的人

电影院里
说话的人

再被喷嚏送回来 新生为婴儿 成为更好的人
later to be sneezed back to us as better babies.

朝着头 升去吧
Headward, free now to rise.

朝着头 升去吧
Headward, free now to rise.

朝着头 升去吧
Headward, free now to rise.

升去那些巨头吧
Oh, yes! Yes! Rise to the giant head!

你们可以获得自由
You are free to be free!

橡胶扫帚从车库里走过来
And squeegee comes up from the garage, right?

但他一只手上是龙虾
But he's got a lobster in one hand,

另外一只手里是电影票 然后说"准备好啦"
the movie tickets in the other, he's like, "I'm ready!"

你要拿着龙虾去看钢铁侠3啊
You gonna take a lobster to see "Iron Man 3"?

Ice-T
Ice-T!

靠
Ah, damn.

原味的Fig Newton饼吃完了
We're out of original-flavor fig Newtons.

反正我也该走了
I should get going anyway.

等着 别啊
Wait, wait, wait! C-come on.

等下啊 等下
H-hold on a second. Hold on.

- 啥 - 我靠
- What?! - Damn.

你都没说你还带着传送门枪啥的
You didn't tell me you [bleep] around with portals and shit.

够了
That's it!

哇哦 Morty 给我
Whoa, whoa, Morty! Give me that.

你骗人 你骗我说没电了
You lied! You lied about the charge!

你只是懒而已
You were just being lazy!

回来 坐下
Get back! Sit down!

Morty 放下
Morty, just put it down.

你不明白你在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

我要去找妈和爸
I'm going to go find mom and dad!

别
No!

[哔]的
Oh [bleep]!

[哔]的
Oh [bleep].

[哔]的
Oh [bleep] .

然后Ehtan弹吉他 我们
And then Ethan played guitar, and we learned

一遍唱一遍学习了巨头的七深思
the seven contemplations of the head by singing them.

真的很开心
It was really fun.

赞美巨头
Praise be the head!

赞美
Praise be the... Yeah.

大家好 我是阴道牧师长
Hi, folks. Head Priest Vagina.

感谢大家种土豆
Thanks for farming all those potatoes.

现在是晚上六点 家长们
6 P.M., so if you're a parent,

可以享受子女们的爱了
you're now entitled to adoration from your children.

我去准备晚饭
I'm going to start dinner!

我也不知道说什么好 Summer现在表现得真好
I don't know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.

她的土豆课全都得了A
She's aced every test in potato class,

看看土豆现在是多么重要呀
and look how important potatoes have become.

没有怀孕 没嗑药 也没过了宵禁才回家
She's not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew.

帮帮我 只要努力你能够到我的
Please help me. You can reach me if you try.

帮帮我
Please help me!

只要Summer好 这些都不关我们的事
That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving.

吃玉米卷啦
Taco time!

希望能让你们开心 如巨头所愿 
I hope it pleases you as the head desires.

真好 Summer
That's wonderful, Summer.

我们为你感到骄傲
We're so proud of you.

但你真的不用每天都做晚饭的
But obviously you don't have to make dinner every night.

我必须要 笨蛋
Of course I do, silly!

天啊 爸 对不起我管你叫笨蛋了
Oh, my God, daddy! I'm sorry I called you silly!

真的对不起
I'm so sorry!

天上的巨头 颅形的创造者
Heavenly heads and cranial creator,

原谅我忤逆我的父母和社群
forgive my transgressions against family and community.

愿工作使我完整 一如我将它们规整
May my chores complete me as I complete them.

- Morty - 鸟人
- Morty. - Birdperson?

你似乎要死了
You appear to be dying.

我会尽力不让你死去 但我不敢保证
I will make efforts to prevent this but can promise nothing.

你怎么看 ice 是不是有点太过了
Wh-what do you think, ice? Probably a little overdeveloped.

太过了 太简单 
Shit, overdeveloped, underdeveloped--

烂歌就是烂 没区别
A bad song's a bad song.

那是不是 或许
Well, do you think, maybe--

你能帮我一下呢
Could you give me some help with it, or...?

算了吧
Aw, hell no, man.

你干你的 我可经受不起
You do your thing, but I can't afford to

拿我的名声给你的陪葬
get my pride wrapped up in your shame.

懂吗
You know what I'm saying?

Ice 不是我要这么消极啊
Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything,

但是如果Morty不带着传送枪回来
but if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun

然后我唱砸了
and I eat it out there,

你也有麻烦的
it's, uh, you know, kind of your problem, too.

切 我一点都不担心地球被炸掉的事
Pfft! I ain't worried about no earth blowing up, man.

啊 为什么
What? Why not?

因为这
Yo, this is why.

我[哔] 你能变成冰
What the [bleep] you can turn into ice?

我的故事始于时间之初
My story begins at the dawn of time

在遥远的字母表之域
in the faraway realm of alphabetrium.

所有的存在都是字母表上的一个字母
There, every being is a letter of the alphabet.

但我被亲人冻结 放逐 作为惩罚
But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders

因为我什么都不在乎
as punishment for not caring enough about anything.

地球只不过是我停歇的一小站
Earth is just one of my many stops

我一生的旅程不会有终点
on a lifelong journey with no destination.

你最好搞清楚 地球炸了 我一点都不在乎
So you better believe I don't care if it blows up,

我只是一块漂流于宇宙的冰
because I'll just be ice floating through space,

像一颗彗星
like a comet.

听我说 ice 你不能
Take it from me, ice, you can't just

漂流宇宙 什么都不在乎
float around space not caring about stuff forever.

切 看着
Pfft. Man, watch me.

好运 Rick
Good luck, Rick.

好吧 事态失控了
Okay, things are getting out of hand.

我要确保Rick有他需要的一切 好渴爽嗨起来
I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to get schwifty.

真是够了
Oh, for God's sakes. That's enough.

你在干什么Nathan
What the hell are you doing, Nathan?!

我可是[哔]的美国总统
I'm the goddamn president of the United [bleep] States!

我要把核弹设置成
I'm setting the nuclear option to launch

地球表演开场一分钟后发射
one minute into earth's performance.

至于你 总统
And you, Mr. President...

希望你喜欢被一枪砸脸上
I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun.

等等 为 为什
Wait, wait, wait. Why-- why--

我应该能读取Rick的传送枪的历史记录
I believe I can access the history of Rick's gun

帮你们团聚
and help you get back to him.

你能把我送到我的家人那里吗
But can you help me get to my family?

就是我家
You know, at-- at my house?

你想用Rick的传送枪弃他而去吗
Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun?

在鸟的文化里 这很混球的
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.

Rick的所有作为都很混球
All of Rick's moves are dick moves!

我 我吃的是什么东西
What-- What am I eating?

这 这是鸟食吗
Wh-what is this, bird-- birdseed?

乱七八糟的碎渣 从我毯子里弄出来的
It is random debris. I found it in my carpet.

我不知道人类吃什么
I don't know what humans eat.

- 你知道我"吃"什么  - 别恶心人 Tammy
- You know what this human eats. - Don't be gross, Tammy.

鸟[哔]
Bird [bleep].

真恶心
Tammy, gross.

鸟人 你总是为Rick出头
Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick,

但是他只在乎他自己
but he doesn't care about anyone but himself.

而且做事从不考虑后果
He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does.

所以他才有
And as a result, he has the power

拯救或者毁灭世界的能力
to save or destroy entire worlds.

你我也是因他而相识
And he is the reason you and I know each other...

也是因为他 我现在才活着
And the reason I'm alive at all.

那是怎么回事 那个婴儿是谁
What's that? Who's that baby?

Morty 假使你设法把家人从地球救走
Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth

但要抛弃Rick
but had to abandon Rick.

我可以为你的家人提供住所
I could give your loved ones shelter on birdworld,

甚至工作 比如在农场养虫子
even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers.

你难道不会时常仰望星空
How often do you think you might look up at the stars

试想当初如果选择相信Rick
and wonder what might have been

这一切又是何等情形吗
had you just put your faith in Rick?

以上是胖墩鼓手带来的
That was Chunkytunk with

"满蠢蠢 空饕坞"
"Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorbdork."

接下来是地球
Up next, planet Earth!

该我们了
Oh, God! We're up?!

Jerry Beth 你们家完美诠释了
Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example

巨头教要展示给世界看的东西
of what headism has to offer the world.

- 世界吗  - 巨头教现在正流行
- The world? - Headism is a hit.

我们打算走向全世界 并且想让Jerry
We're taking it worldwide, and we'd like Jerry to be

出任教堂的广告宣传部长
our church's head of advertising.

你说真的吗
You would?

Beth 我们想越级提拔你为医药部负责人
Beth, we'd like to promote you from horse surgeon

不走什么从医马到医人再往上的路子了
straight past human surgeon to head of medicine.

那是我的梦想啊 我的梦想
That's my dream! That's my dream.

感谢各位 这太突然了
Thank you. This is all so overwhelming.

但是
But, uh...

- 我们不能接受  - 绝对不行
- We can't. - Absolutely not.

你说什么
I'm sorry?

十六年来我们一直期望女儿能尊重我们
We've been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us,

但是关键在于 那得是我们的女儿
but the key is, it has to be our daughter,

而不是她现在这幅样子
not this person she's become.

我们还是想试试在没有位高权重的新工作的情况下抚养她
We'll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs,

不受这个建立在土豆上的宗教的影响
outside of a potato-based religion.

算了
And you know what?

我不想再假装我们是因为有了孩子
I-I'm sick of pretending that we're together

才走到一起的
because of the kids in the first place.

我娶你是因为你即是我的至爱
I married you because you're the love of my life.

和你在一起真是幸运 我从未对你说过这些
And I'm lucky to have you, and I never tell you that!

经历过此事 我们家庭会更加融洽无间
You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family.

求求你别这样 别这样
Please don't do this! Please don't do this!

- Summer  - 你听我说
- Summer! - Summer, listen carefully.

我偷了一个回形针 藏在嘴里的
I stole a paper clip, and I have it in my cheek,

但我不知道该怎么弄 现在好疼啊
but I don't know what to do with it, and it hurts.

不会有事的 你们回来的时候就会变成宝宝了
You're going to be okay. You will come back as babies.

我就是个宝宝 现在就是
I am a baby! I'm a baby now!

有人吗
Hello?

有人在吗
Is anybody here?

总统阁下
Mr. President!

这里是蓝鸟
This is bluebird!

代号T9A
Code Tango Niner Alpha!

取消发射 取消 喂
Abort launch! Abort! Hello?

他把我屏蔽掉了
He's blocked me out.

阁下 我得去帮Rick渴嗨爽起来
Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!

再渴嗨爽也没用 Morty
It won't matter how schwifty you get, Morty.

将军把核弹设定在
The general's got nukes

地球的歌演奏到一半时发射
set to launch halfway through earth's song!

那你会开黑鹰直升机吗
Oh, my God! Uh, c-can you fly a black hawk?

甜甜圈的洞能放下教皇的[哔]吗
Can the pope's [bleep] fit through a doughnut?

呃 不好说
Uh, I'm... Not sure.

我也是这个意思
Exactly.

让我看看你的能耐
Show me what you got!

呃
Uh...

一只青蛙一张嘴 两只眼睛四条腿
Lapoo lapoo lapoo dops, napoo napoo napoo nots

朝着头 升去吧
Headward, free now to rise.

你们看巨头们
Hey, look at the heads!

他们好像生气了
Looks like the heads are getting angry!

我真的不会开这玩意 Morty
I'm really bad at this, Morty!

上面按钮太多了
There are way too many buttons in this thing!

总统阁下 如果说我今天学到了一件事
Mr. President, if I've learned one thing today

那就是有时管不了[哔]的那么多
it's that sometimes you have to not give a [bleep]!

扑通一声跳下水
Napoo napoo nots.

你们要求还真高
Ugh. Tough crowd.

我确信
I'm sure that has--

他们的愤怒和此事无关
That has nothing to do with this.

巨头们不高兴了
The heads are displeased!

Summer
Summer!

呃
Um...

Morty
Morty!

万岁
Hooray!

好耶 你看
Hooray! Look!

万岁
Hooray!

巨头们喜欢这样
The heads love this!

我们不杀他们一家的时候巨头才高兴
They love it when we don't kill the Smith family!

停下
No! Stop that!

你没资格解读巨头的意志
You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!

取消核打击 我是总统
Call off the nuclear strike! This is the president!

取消核弹发射
Stop the nuclear missile launch!

快点发射
Just launch the missiles!

你玩完了
Boo! Not cool!

我是唯一一个和巨头交流的人
I'm the only one that speaks to the heads!

不合格
Disqualified!

巨头觉得他不合格 抓住他
The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!

不合格
Disqualified!

不合格
Disqualified!

Ice-T
Ice-T?!

对 就是我 Ice-T
That's right. It's me-- Ice-T.

我现在在乎了 是你让我在意的
I care now. You made me care more.

恕我直言
With all due respect,

我想听听他们两个要表演什么
I'd like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.

怎么样 Rick
What do you say, Rick?

我们开搞
I say, let's do it!

万岁
Hooray!

耶
Yeah.

好
All right.

- 哦耶  - 嗯哼
- Oh, yeah - Uh-huh.

- Head bent over, raised up posterior. - Oh, yeah

低下你的头 耶 翘臀屁股柔
Head bent over, Yeah, raised up posterior.

和我一起唱
Sing it with me now!

天呐
Oh, my go--

低下你的头
Head bent over, Yeah.

翘臀屁股柔
Raised up posterior. All right!

- 低下你的头  - 哦耶
- Head bent over. - Oh, yeah!

翘臀屁股柔
Raised up posterior!

他刚才是说"音乐真人秀"吗
Did he just say "Musical reality show"?

好像我们一直在把一些毫无关联的事物
Yeah, it's possible that we may have been correlating

联系在一起
some things that weren't actually related at all.

救命啊
Help!

我们得把他弄下来
We should go get him.

如果我需要帮忙的话 希望还能麻烦你们
I hope I can call on you and Rick again if I need you, Morty.

没问题 而且我
Sure thing. And I--

我想跟你拍个自拍
I was kind of hoping that I could get a selfie with you?

这个嘛 今天的事你要是和别人提到
Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here,

我们只会否认 或者做更过分的事
we'll deny it and probably worse.

明白了
Understood.

死死死吧
D-I-I-I-I-ie!

不要不要啊
Oh, no, no, no!

他为什么没变成蛇

我不该把你变成冰的
I should have never turned you to ice.

Water-T 你要去哪里
Water-T, where are you going?!

数字族人太多了
There's too many of them!

那就该做做减法了
Then I better crunch the numbers.

我不敢相信的是这个平行世界pg-13的标准
I can't believe the things this reality considers pg-13.

- 真让人嫉妒  - 不用嫉妒 Morty
- Yeah. I-I'm pretty jealous. - Don't be, Morty.

每条平行时间线都有好有坏
There's pros and cons to every alternate timeline.

至于这一个嘛
Fun facts about this one --

这里有巨型读心蜘蛛
it's got giant, telepathic spiders,

十一次911
11 9/11s,

还有整个多宇宙最好的冰激凌
and the best ice cream in the multiverse!

不是吧
Shut up!

咱去吃冰激凌啦
We're gonna go get some ice cream, mother[bleep]

靠
Oh, great.

怎么了Rick
Oh, boy. W-what's wrong, Rick?

是量子化油器还是什么
Is it the quantum carburetor or something?

"量子化油器" 天 Morty
"Quantum carburetor"? Jesus, Morty.

你以为你随便
You can't just add a s--

加一科幻名词在一个车零件前边 就真能说出什么来么
Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something.

看来是微宇宙电池出问题了
Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery.

我们得去里面
We're gonna have to go inside.

什么里面
Um, go inside what?

电池里面 Morty 我们马上回来 Summer
The battery, Morty. Be right back, summer.

待着别动 别动按钮
Stay put, don't touch any buttons,

有什么奇怪的念头 不要理会 尤其是有"蜘蛛感"的
and ignore all random thoughts that feel...Spidery.

你不能就把我留在这儿
Wait! You can't leave me here!

没事的
You'll be fine.

飞船 保证Summer的安全
Ship, keep Summer safe.

保证Summer的安全
Keep summer safe.

呵 真棒
Ugh. Wonderful.

不好意思
Hey, excuse me. Hello.

怎么 你以为你有多比我了不起
What, you think you're better than me?!

没人比我了不起
Nobody's better than me!

保证Summer的安全
Keep summer safe.

怎么搞的
Hey, man, what the hell?!

他是我女儿的儿科医生
That was my daughter's pediatrician!

停下 不要杀他
No, stop! Don't kill him!

收到
Confirmed.

我的腿没有知觉了
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

救命 
Help! Help!!

Summer很安全
Summer is safe.

我一点都不觉得安全
I don't feel safe.

收到
Confirmed.

不
No.

救命啊 救命啊
Oh, God, help me. Help me!

救救我 你可以救我的
Help me, please! You can help me!

我们这是在哪儿
Oh, man. Where are we, Rick?

Morty 记不记得八秒之前
Morty, remember eight seconds ago

你说"什么里面"
when, when you said, "Go inside what?"

然后我说"电池"
And I said, "The battery"?

然后我们来了这儿 我也没说什么
And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like,

"哇 好吃惊哟"
"Whoa, this is unexpected.

"完全没想到是这样呢"
This is not what I was expecting, Morty.

- "多么不可思议呀"  - 行了行了 
- What a perplexing mystery this is." - All right, all right.

我们在电池里面 我懂了
We're inside the battery. I get it.

- 你不用一直嘲讽我了  - 这不对啊
- You don't have to bust my balls. - Huh, this isn't right.

这根管道应该要
This pipe's supposed to be sending

20太瓦的燃料送进引擎里才对
20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.

结果反而是零
Instead we've got...Zero?

这些人现在在干嘛
Now what are these people doing?

啊 什么人
W-w-w-whoa, people?

看来得亲自动手修引擎了
It's time for some hands-on engine repair.

Morty 抓牢站稳
All right, Morty, hold on to something. Whoa!

我靠
Holy crap!

我还以为我们在你的车电池里
I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick.

这简直就是一整个星球啊
T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.

谢啦 Morty 我对这东西还是很自豪的
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy.

你看
Check it out.

我把一块空间上嵌合的虚空
I put a spatially tessellated void

放入了一修改过的时间场
inside a modified temporal field

直到一颗星球发展出智慧生命
until a planet developed intelligent life.

我为他们引入了神奇的电能
I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity,

他们现在整个星球都在发电
which they now generate on a global scale.

其中一部分用来给我的引擎供电
And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine

还有给我的手机充电什么的
and charge my phone and stuff.

你让一整个星球就在这儿给你供电
You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you?

这是奴隶制
That's slavery.

这叫社会 他们在为彼此工作
It's society. They work for each other, Morty.

互相付钱 在这儿买房子
They pay each other. They buy houses.

结婚生子
They get married and make children

孩子在他们老了以后代替他们继续发电
that replace them when they get too old to make power.

那也不过是多了几个步骤的奴隶制
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.

哦啦啦 某人在大学肯定要有艳福咯
Ooh-LA-LA, someone's gonna get laid in college.

看来 我们又有一次来访啦
It appears we are being revisited

来者 被称作Rick的外星人 曾经给予我们的世界
by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world

谷波盒的科技
the gift of gooble box technology,

只要不停踩上去 就会产生电
which, when stomped on, generates electricity,

为我们的居家和工作提供能源
powering our homes and businesses,

提高我们的生活质量 同时安全地
improving our daily lives, while safely removing

将危险的废能量移到一座特别的废料处理火山
the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano.

但Rick为何回来了
But why has Rick returned?

他听到重大新消息又会说些什么
And what will he say when he hears the big news?

我们拭目以待
Let's find out.

你得告诉这些人他们在电池里
You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick.

这太糟了 他们请人办了酒宴
It's messed up. There's caterers down there.

他们还弄了火锅
Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.

别激动行吗 Morty
Would you relax, Morty?

我们没有做什么不诚实的事情
There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing.

把这些天线戴上
Now slap on these antennae.

- 得让这些人觉得我们是外星人  - 啥 为什么啊 
- These people need to think we're aliens. - What? Why?

看来你真是对修车一窍不通
Sh-- obviously you really know nothing about car repair.

等活动梯放下去
Wait for the ramp, Morty.

他们很爱慢速活动梯
They love the slow ramp.

他们可性奋了 看着这梯子
Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp

慢慢伸下去
just slowly extending down.

你们好呀
Greetings!

Morty 对他们比中指
Morty, you got to flip them off.

我跟他们说这是"星际和平"的意思
I told them it means "Peace among worlds."

不觉得很好笑吗
How hilarious is that?

我们来啦
Coming through.

俩货真价实的外星人
Two real aliens walking through here.

Rick 我们的外星朋友
Rick, our alien friend.

嘿 总统阁下 我发现
Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice

你们没有再发电了
that you were having problems generating power.

没错 我们进化了
That's correct. We've evolved.

我们最优秀的科学家 Zeep Xanflorp
Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp,

发展出一种能源
has developed a source of energy

淘汰了谷波盒
that makes gooble boxes obsolete.

我很想见识一下呢
I would love to see it.

- [哔]  - 你刚跟我说什么
- [bleep] you. - What did you say to me?!

"[哔]"啊
"[bleep] you."

你跟我说的啊 是"非常感谢"的意思
Y-you told me it means "Much obliged."

哦 对 给我口
Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.

不不不 给我口
No, no, no. Blow me.

Zeep 从天外来了一位访客
Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.

我说的是十二个量子稳定器 不是十一
I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11.

赶快弄好 不然要你好看
Fix it or it's your ass.

Chris 我忙着呢
Chris, I'm in the middle of something.

Zeep 这就是那位外星人Rick
Zeep, this is Rick -- the alien.

外星人Rick
Rick the alien.

外星人Rick
Rick the alien...

真的 你要给我玩这招儿
Really? You're gonna pull that move?

你们整个文明都是我引导的
I guided your entire civilization.

你们有个节日就叫瑞恩节
Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving.

小孩子在学校里要学关于我的事情
They teach kids about me in school.

我辍学了
I dropped out of school.

学校不是聪明人待的地方
It's not a place for smart people.

哎哟喂
Ohhhh, snap!

听我说 你这个傲慢的小
Listen to me, you arrogant little --

Rick想要看看你的新能源
R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source.

我想他能从你这儿学到很多 Zeep
I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.

好吧
Fine.

对一般人来说这很难理解
It's hard for people to grasp,

但这容器里是一个无限的宇宙
but inside that container is an infinite Universe

里面有一颗星球能够制造
with a planet capable of generating

大量的能量
massive amounts of power.

我称之为"迷你宇宙"
I call it a miniverse.

好傻的名字
Dumb name.

- 你说什么  - 没什么
- Excuse me? - Nothing.

我的意思是 光这样我们也很难理解
I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this.

有没有可能 我们走一趟
Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour

到你的迷你宇宙里面看看呢
of your miniverse from the inside?

你以为这是[哔]巧克力工厂啊 我哪来的时间
This isn't a [bleep] chocolate factory. I don't have time.

你不是说时间在迷你宇宙里
Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse

相较于真实世界更慢吗
relative to the real world?

没错Chris 真是多谢你提醒哦
Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that.

好棒的总统啊 那我们走吧
Great president. All right, let's go.

抓牢
Hold on to something.

我把一块无界的真空放进了时间场里
I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field

直到发展出一个新世界
until a world developed.

我给这个世界的人
I then introduced the people of this world

带来了奇妙的电力 用一种我称之为
to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device

斧波柄的装置
I call a flooble crank.

他们不知道的是
What they don't know is

每只曲柄百分之八十的能量都从
that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled

迷你世界里被导出 为我们所用
out of the miniverse to be used by us.

再也不用什么谷波盒了
No more gooble boxes.

我没有冒犯的意思 Zeep
I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect,

但我真的觉得你这样的行为很不道德
I really think what you're doing here is unethical.

- 这样不好  - 啥
- It's not cool. - What?!

你让这一整个星球的人都受到奴役
Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away

来为你们发电
making your power.

在我看来这就是奴隶制
I mean, that's what I call slavery.

不不不 他们是在给彼此工作
No, no, no, they work for each other

来换取钱 然后他们
in exchange for money, which they then --

那也不过是多了些步骤的奴隶制罢了
well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.

哎巴带 某人在大学里肯定有艳福咯
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.

Rick 能和你说句话吗
Rick, a word?

刚才是在搞什么
What the hell was that?

我懂"哎巴带"
I know. "Eek barba dirkle"?

真是"哦啦啦"的[哔]说法
That's a pretty [bleep] up "Ooh-LA-LA."

你跟这人说他的迷你宇宙
No, what are you doing telling this guy

是不道德的 算是什么
that his miniverse is unethical?

你难道没发觉到虚伪吗
D-do you not see the hypocrisy here?

哎 你说的真对
Holy crap. You're right, Morty.

虚伪
Hypocrisy.

这个星球的某个地方
Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be

肯定有个自大的科学家
an arrogant scientist

马上就要完成微宇宙技术了
prick on the verge of microverse technology,

然后完全淘汰Zeep的斧波柄
which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

迫使Zeep承认微宇宙是不好的
forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad,

到时候他就会明白他是怎样的一个伪君子
at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being,

他的族人就会回去踩他们的谷波盒
his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes,

咱们就能去冰激凌街啦
and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby!

吃[哔]的冰激凌
Eating that mother[bleep] ice cream!

舔啊舔啊全舔掉
Slurping, slurping, slurping it up.

你这表情什么意思
Wh-wh-why are you making that face?

我[哔]
Holy [bleep]

是我 我让
It's me. I've convinced

这个星球上的人一位我是一名旅行者
the people of this planet that I'm a traveler

从另一个世界而来
from another world.

你不觉得这样有点太过了吗
You don't think that's overdoing it a little?

要达到同样的效果
I mean, you could achieve the same effect

只需要一对 算了
with a pair of -- never mind.

我不该说三道四老挑刺
You know what? I shouldn't be so critical.

我是个外星人
I'm an alien.

我们准备要降落了
Places, please. We're about to land.

太快了
Too fast.

执法单位正在向此处汇集
Law enforcement converging on location.

W-w-w-what?

别管这车
Leave the car alone.

Keep summer safe.

如果你们继续撸这些斧波柄
And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks,

我会给你们带来其他伟大的外星科技
I will bring you other great alien advancements.

- 我问你件事情 - 嗯
- Hey, uh, let me ask you something. - Yes?

你们的科学家有没有在研究什么新东西
Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?

都在啊 他们就是干这个的
All of them. That's their job.

是是是 我是说 能源方面的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise.

有没有人研究 比如说 盒子里的小型宇宙
Anyone working on, say, a little Universe in a box?

你怎么知道的 这是顶级机密
How do you know about that? It's top secret.

记住 一日一撸远不足
So remember -- a crank a day is not nearly enough.

撸吧
Crank it.

我跟他们说这话是"星际和平"的意思
I told them this means "Peace among worlds."

不觉得很好笑吗
How hilarious is that?

很好笑 Zeep
Re-really funny, Zeep.

嘿 Zeep 你的伪世界的伪总统
Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world

要给你看些伪重要的东西
has something fake important to show you.

现在还不算什么 但是一旦
It's not much now, but once I learn

我学会加速时间场
to accelerate the temporal field,

我就能和任何有心智 在进化的生命互动
I'll be able to interact with any sentient life

并且给他们带来
that evolves and introduce them

神奇的电能 用这种基于拉动的设备
to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device

我称为卜波拽
I call a blooble yank.

但他们不知道的是
But what they won't know is --

你会带走他们大部分的电力
you'll be taking most of their energy.

对对对 我懂
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

有好戏看了
It's showtime.

你明白这会让斧波柄被淘汰的吧
You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete?

这样是不对的 Kyle 你这样做是不对的
This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong.

你这样明明就 这是奴隶制
You're basically -- This is slavery.

这是在制造一整个星球的奴隶
You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.

我就说嘛 Zeep
Told you, Zeep.

怎么会是奴隶呢
Oh, they won't be slaves.

他们会为彼此工作 付给彼此薪水 
They'll work for each other and pay each other money.

那不过是多了些步骤的 奴隶 制
That just sounds like slavery with ex...Tra...Steps.

- 干嘛  - 等等
- What? - Wait a minute.

你是不是创造了我的宇宙 我的宇宙是一个迷你宇宙吧
Did you create my Universe? Is my Universe a miniverse?

微宇宙
Microverse!

藐宇宙
Uh, teenyverse.

你这个混蛋
Ugh! You bastard!

非常感谢
Much obliged.

- 这是怎么了  - 这样比较健康 相信我

你不过是我的电池 你这[哔]
You're my battery, mother[bleep]

不过是电池而已
That's all you are.

我创造了你 你的微宇宙烂透了
I made you. Your microverse sucks!

你所谓的迷你宇宙占了一养龙虾的缸子的大小
And your miniverse is the size of a lobster tank!

烂死了
It's whack!

他们不是真的外星人吧
Are they not really aliens?

不 他们就是俩疯疯癫癫的
Nah, they're just a couple of crazy,

奇怪的科学家
wacky scientists, you know?

所以说 他造出了一个宇宙
So he made a Universe,

然后那人是从那个宇宙来的
and that guy is from that Universe.

- 你是我的电池  - 那个人也造了一个宇宙
- You're my battery!  - And that guy made a Universe.

也就是我出生在其中的宇宙
And that's the Universe where I was born.

我父亲去世的宇宙
Where my father died.

我没来得及参加他的葬礼
Where I couldn't make time for his funeral

因为我专注于创造我的宇宙
because I was working on my Universe.

是我创造了你
I made you!

科学 这玩意儿 
Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.

有一次 Rick 偶然用

科学就像个老太太
You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know?

她可真

因为她 她挣动起来可狠了
Because she -- she'll -- she bucks pretty hard.

快啊 快啊
Come on, come on, come on.

翼手龙
Pterodactyl!

混蛋
Asshole!

等我离开这个藐宇宙
When I get out of this teenyverse,

我要把它连你一下砸碎
I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.

等我离开这个藐宇宙
Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse,

我还要离开它外面的迷你宇宙
I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse

然后是外面的微宇宙
and then the microverse around that, and guess what?

别把事情闹得更僵了Rick
Don't make things worse, Rick!

他不会毁掉你们的宇宙的
Uh, he's not gonna destroy your Universe.

我们需要它来发动车子
You know, we -- we need it to start our car.

你就用我的宇宙干这个
That's what you used my universe for?

拿来开车
To run your car?

没错 别太受宠若惊了
Yeah, but don't flatter yourself.

AAA(标准干电池)总是有的 傻[哔]
There's always AAA, you [bleep] [bleep] sucker!

他在干嘛 他在造什么
What's he doing? What's he crafting?

我也会造东西
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

像我造了你们的世界一样
Just like I crafted your reality!

你这个造东西的傻
You crafty son of a --

是我造出来的人
I crafted the guy

创造了你现在所在的星球
that created the planet you're standing on!

是我造出来的恒星
Yeah, and I made the stars

产生了你妈卵巢里的碳元素
that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

又不是我要求要被生出来的
I didn't ask to be born!

够了 我走了
All right, that's it! I'm out.

我要去荒野里
I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness,

我要去那些树林人中间过新的生活
and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people.

- 也不可能比现在差劲了  - 是哦 Morty
- I-it can't be worse than this. - Sure. Okay, Morty.

在日落之前回来 否则树林人会把你吃了的
Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.

只是传说而已
That's a myth!

你为什么要编这种传说
W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?

这个星球的文明还在史前阶段
It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

总有人要给他们带来点文化
Someone has to bring a little culture.

总不能是某些
And I-I-it certainly can't be someone

其文明给我的刹车灯供电的人吧
whose entire culture powers my brake lights!

上上上
Go, go, go!

我的天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

我们现在怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

我不能摧毁这支军队
I am unable to destroy this army.

说明白一些 其实我完全可以
To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army,

- 但你不允许  - 没错
- but you will not permit it. - Correct.

你也不允许我使用情感对策
You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.

你要说什么融化掉的幽灵宝宝的话
If you're talking about the melting ghost babies,

没错 别再来了
yes, please, no more of that.

收到
Confirmed.

我现在正在建立一种安保措施
I am currently constructing a security measure

是符合你的规范的
in compliance with your parameters.

但我想说你让我很难办
But I do want to say you are not making this easy.

你知道你挺混蛋的是吧
You know you're kind of a dick, right?

我的功能是确保Summer的安全
My function is to keep summer safe,

不是让Summer 怎么说 事事都如意
not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked

情绪啊 各方面 什么的
about, like, the general vibe and stuff.

你就这样 你说话就这个样
That's you. That's how you talk.

嘿 那是我的鹿
Hey, that's my deer!

我只喜欢你的上帝也和你一样混球
I hope your God is as big a dick as you.

我的上帝是压根儿不存在的最大的混球
My God's the biggest dick that's never existed.

你以为我为什么会在这儿
Why do you think I'm even here?

你在这儿
You're here

是因为你创造了比你更聪明的人
because you created someone smarter than you.

我还以为我们两个
Oh, I thought we were both

都在这儿是因为我造出了一个满是白痴的宇宙
here because I created a Universe of idiots.

妈的 Morty
Holy shit. Morty?

我好几个月没见你了
I haven't seen you in months.

你是树林人的领导
You're leading the tree people?

也算是有点进步了
Huh. That's a step up.

我们没有领导者
We have no leaders.

我们只遵从树林的意志
We follow only the will of the forest.

真是基
Gaaaaay.

确实很基
That is pretty gay.

你俩管自己叫天才
You two call yourselves geniuses,

但你们这段时间什么也没有学到
but you have spent this time learning nothing.

跟我来森林里
Come with me into the forest.

我要教你们些东西
There is something I wish to teach you.

这是灵树Ku'ala
This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree.

数代人以来 它引导着
For generations, it has guided the --

你得把我们弄出去
you have to get us the [bleep] out of here.

这就是些落后的野人
These people are backwards savages.

他们把第三个出生的婴儿吃掉
They eat every third baby

因为他们觉得这样水果会长得更大
because they think it makes fruit grow bigger.

所有人都很恶心 而且他们身上永远一股尿味儿
Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time.

我想念家里人 我想念我的笔记本电脑
I m-- I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop.

我前几天对着一块有曲线的浮木手淫
I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!

我不管要付出什么代价
Look, I-I don't care what it takes.

你俩把你俩的破事儿放一边
You two are putting aside your bullshit,

一起想办法把我们弄回去
and you're working together to get us back home.

不行啊 Morty 做不到
No can do, Morty. I just can't.

我不明白我怎么能
I just don't see how I can --

你们是聪明人 你们会弄明白的
You're smart. You'll figure it out.

你有十秒钟
You have 10 seconds

从飞船里出来
to get out of the ship!

十 九
10, 9...

好吧 还不坏
All right, not bad.

我猜你对原始重接没有什么意见
I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.

我见过更严重的离子细胞双氧化
I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.

要是成功了 我请喝酒
If this works, drinks are on me.

要是你请的话
If drinks are on you, you're gonna need

你就得在那塔上申请第二份贷款了
a second mortgage on that tower.

我是个酒鬼
I'm an alcoholic.

我是吸鸦片的
Opium addict.

好了好了 够了
All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up.

你们真是烂透了 你们的神只是谎言
You guys are the [bleep] worst! Your gods are a lie!

[哔]你们的 去[哔]的大自然 去[哔]的树
[bleep] you, [bleep] nature, and [bleep]trees!

- 太好了 成功了  - 好
- Yes! You did it! - Yes!

酒怎么说
Hey, uh, how about that drink?

没问题 让我回船里拿我的钱包
Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.

哦 你的钱包在船里啊
Oh, is your wallet in your ship?

传送器也在那儿呢
That's where the transporter is, too,

我们不一起去吗
so why don't we come with?

不用呀 我一秒就回
It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.

你知道微宇宙里一秒能有多久吧
You know how long a second can take in a microverse?

快跑Morty
Run, Morty!

这混蛋宁愿
That asshole's willing to

牺牲掉他在意的一切也要打败我
risk everything he cares about just to defeat me!

他已经疯了
He's psychotic!

- Morty跳我背上来  - 干嘛
- Morty, hop on my back. - Why?

走着 Sanchez 滑雪鞋
Go, go. Sanchez ski shoes.

八
...Eight...

别动
Hold still.

嘿 你们好呀 我刚做好了一顿大餐
Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast.

啊 妈的
Aaaah! Holy --

- 你这怪物  - 旅途不太愉快啊
- you monster! - Whoa. Bad tour.

七
...seven...

嘿 你得登记离开
Hey, you got to sign out.

你做的一切都没有意义 你的存在是个谎言
Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!

如果这是真的 那
If that were really true, then...

- 我来找Ron Mendleson  - 三楼
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson. - Third floor.

你愿意去吃个饭吗 和
Would you like to go to dinner with --

不
uh, no.

你可能是创造了这个宇宙 但我生活在这里
You may have created this Universe, Rick, but I live in it.

怎么办Rick 我们完了
What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed.

他会到船上
He's gonna get to the ship and

毁掉微宇宙 杀了我们
smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us!

- 快Morty 变成车  - 啥
- Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car. - What?!

很早以前 我给你植入了一块皮下芯片
A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip

能够唤起休眠在你血管系统里的纳米机器人
that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream

重构你的身体构造 把你变成一辆车
to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.

- 天啊  - 集中 Morty
- Oh, my God! - Concentrate, Morty.

集中精神 变成一辆车 Morty
Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.

算了没事 这儿有出租 进来 没事了
Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine.

六
...six...

- 嘿 Zeep  - 嗯
- Hey, Zeep. - Huh?

瑞恩节快乐 贱人
Happy ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

成功了 Morty
We did it, Morty.

我们赶紧出去毁掉这个宇宙
Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole Universe.

你说什么
Excuse me?

五
...five --

长官
sir?

- 天啦  - 长官
- Holy hell. - Sir!

不要开火
Hold you fire!

怎么回事
What's going on?

我促成了一份和平协定
I have brokered a peace agreement

让政府和巨型蜘蛛达成了和解
between the giant spiders and the government.

多亏了这神秘宇宙车精湛的外交技巧
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car,

从今日起 人类与蜘蛛
from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live

将和平共处
side by side in peace.

我们不再轰炸它们 它们也不再
We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use

利用心灵感应让我们走进网里
their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs

等会儿吃掉
for later consumption.

取而代之的是 我们将共同努力
Instead, we will work together to make this world

让这个世界对所有生命来说都更美好 无论你有几条腿
a better place for all, no matter how many legs.

那这太空车怎么办
What do we do about the space car?

别管它
Leave it alone.

它又干了什么呢
I mean, what did it really do, anyways?

杀了一个人 弄瘫了他
Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?

和与蜘蛛的和平比起来不算什么
Not a bad trade for spider peace.

好吧 撤军
All right, that's it. Move out!

我们解开了多么纠结的网

我真爱这只蜘蛛
I love this spider!

Summer 很安全
Summer is safe.

行 我懂了
All right, I get it.

Rick
Rick!

别这样
Don't do it.

你离开了学校 但你还是要学点东西
You quit school, but you still got some learning to do.

下课
Class dismissed.

- 你还好吧  - 好呀
- You all right? - Uh-huh!

你在干嘛 Rick
What are you doing, Rick?

这电池已经彻底没法用了
I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.

你以为呢 Morty
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

瞧着
Well, let's see.

啊 怎么 我不懂
Hey, wait -- huh? I don't get it.

你当然不懂 但是Zeep懂
Of course you don't. But Zeep did.

他知道我一旦回到车里
He knew that once I got back to my car,

两件事中有一件会发生
one of two things was gonna happen --

我要么扔掉一块坏掉的电池
I was gonna have to toss a broken battery,

或者电池不会坏掉
or the battery wouldn't be broken.

星际和平 Rick
Peace among worlds, Rick.

天啊
Jesus.

嗯哼 听着宝贝发动的声音
Yeah. Listen to that baby purr.

你说得对 Morty 我们
You were right, Morty -- we

真的只需要对他们说实话就好了
really just needed to be honest with those guys.

咱们走
All right, here we go.

谢谢啦
Thank y-o-o-ou.

看 Morty 就为了这个呀
See, Morty? This is what it's all about.

干了这么多 就为这个
This is why we do what we do.

恶 搞什么
Ew! What the hell?

天啊 我的冰激凌里有苍蝇
Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.

总统裁定
Presidential decree --

所有的冰激凌 给所有的生灵
all ice cream is now for all beings,

无论有多少条腿
no matter how many legs.

- 你[哔]干了什么 Summer   - 是你的船干的
- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?! - It was your ship!

- 你的破船干的  - 别怪我的船
- Your stupid ship did it! - Don't blame my ship!

- 它融掉了一个小孩子  - 我的船什么也不会做
- It melted a child! - My ship doesn't do anything...

- 它自己把它杀掉的  - 除非你让它干什么事情
- It killed it itself! - ...Unless it's told to do something!

- 我们差点就死了  - 我不想听 Summer
- We almost died! - I don't want to hear it, summer!

你胸前挂的这两坨
Your boobs are all hanging about,

就因为你的胸我们的冰激凌都毁了
and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out.

想都不要想否认
And don't even try to deny it, either.




第二季 第七集



- 学校有什么新鲜事吗  - 没有
- What's new at school? - Nothing.

没有 呃 有个盛饭的阿姨死了
Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died.

在体育馆被发现的 脖子上有两个洞
They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck,

血被吸干了
and all the blood drained out of her.

老天 谁能做出这种事情
Good lord! Who does something like that?

显然是吸血鬼啊 胡椒呢
Obviously a vampire. W-w-where's the pepper?

等等 吸血鬼真的存在吗
Wait, what?! Vampires are real?!

当然是真的 谁知道呢
Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew?

哦对 所有人都知道 几百年了都
Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now.

是啊 宇宙之大 无奇不有
Yeah, Summer, it's a big universe.

早点习惯吧 对吧 Rick
Get used to it. R-right, Rick?

那我们要怎么办
Well, what are we going to do?!

一直活着 到死为止
We're gonna live our lives until we die.

可能被吸血鬼吸干
Possibly by vampire.

更可能被车撞扁 或者心脏病而死
More likely auto accident or heart disease,

不过也还是可能死于吸血鬼
but possibly vampire.

外公 你能不能动用你超人的智慧
Grandpa Rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge

变成青少年混进我们学校
to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school

帮我们抓住这只吸血鬼
and help us hunt the vampire down?

呃 你这
Um-- wow.

你想得还挺详细
Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer.

我兴许可以变成青少年
I probably could turn myself into a teenager

混进满是青春痘和荷尔蒙
And hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled,

低端垃圾横行的狗屁中学
Low-stakes assworld that is high school.

Low-stakes testing在教育测试体系内是一种结果较为宽松 竞争压力小的评分系统

那我要反问一句
But here's my reverse ask--

我[哔]为什么要这么做
Why in the [bleep] would I ever do that, ever?

你凭什么要求我这么做
And how dare you even ask me that?

你这样也算是恬不知耻了
And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself?

老爸
Dad!

要知耻 宝贝
Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.

Jerry 你意识到你刚对女儿说了什么吗
Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter?

对不起 刚才我没在意
Sor-ry! I wasn't paying attention.

不在意关于吸血鬼的事情吗
To a conversation about vampires?!

很明显 我不知道是吸血鬼的事情
Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires,

因为我就没注意
Because I wasn't paying attention,

你要是对我上点心
Which you would know, if you ever

就该知道我刚才没注意
paid attention to me!

又来了 这就进入受害者的角色了
Oh, here we go, right to the victim role.

我到底是个受害者
Am I a victim, Beth,

还是娶了一个恶毒无比
Or am I married to a mean, unfair monster

还总是伤害我的魔鬼
That always hurts me?!

老天爷
Jesus christ!

你们要是解决不了婚姻问题 赶紧离婚了事
Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already?

我们试过一次婚姻咨询
Well, we tried a couples' therapist.

那是地球上的心理咨询
That's earth therapy.

就好比找一匹马来修旋转木马
You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round.

它再怎么想努力
I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly,

也只能被吓坏而已
He's just gonna get horrified.

我知道外星球有一个百分百成功的地方
I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate.

我们也想让婚姻继续啊 如果我们能的话
Well, we want to make it work, if we can.

- 但是  - 那就这么定了
- It's just..  - Then it's settled.

不用打包衣物了
No need to pack.

出发出发出发
Let's go, go, go, go!

你觉得老爸和老妈
Do you think mom and dad are, you know,

会离婚吗
Gonna get a divorce?

这么想想还是可以的
I think it's okay to dream, Morty.

我去做几根木钉
I'm gonna go make some wooden stakes.

我在婚四所给你们定了两天的强化治疗
I booked you for a two-day intensive at Nuptia Four,

他家是银河系里最好的婚姻咨询机构
The galaxy's most successful couples' counseling institute.

他们甚至可以挽救
They could save the marriage of a dog

狗和巧克力的婚姻
and a bar of dark chocolate.

两个色情影星的婚姻
They could save the marriage of a porn star and a porn star.

至少我是愿意试一试的
Well, I know I'm ready to try whatever it takes.

你这话是说我不愿意咯
Which clearly implies that I'm not.

又不是要比什么 Beth
It's not a competition, Beth.

你打赢嘴仗的策略就是
Oh is that how you're gonna try to win,

暗示说我太争强好胜是吧
By implying I'm competitive?

难道你不是吗
If the shoe fits.

- 是你妈个头  - 呵呵
- My shoe fits up your ass. - You wish!

你们咨询愉快 周四见
Okay, have fun. See ya Thursday!

好疼
Oh!

这老混蛋
Jerk.

别这么说我爸
Don't insult my father.

有了他的基因 我们的孩子才只是半蠢而不是全蠢
He's the reason our kids are only half-stupid.

哈 你刚才说自己
Ha! You just called yourself --

我懂了
Oh.

- Smith夫妇吗  - 是的
- Beth and Jerry Smith? - Yes.

我是Glaxo Slimslom
I'm Glaxo Slimslom.

欢迎来到婚四所
Welcome to Nuptia Four.

这里能解决你们婚姻的烦恼
Your marriage can rest easy now.

Jerry 坐在这里 把这个戴上
Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on.

这个仪器可以扫描提取你大脑中
This machine isolates the part of the subject's brain

关于你对配偶的感知
Containing all perceptions of its romantic partner.

现在扫描Jerry对Beth的感知
And we will now render Jerry's perception of Beth

并具体化为人工生物的形象
With artificial biological life.

这个有意思
Interesting.

这是什么玩意 收回你的想法
What the hell is that?! Take that back!

你竟然把我想成这样
You do not think that about me!

我什么都没做啊
I didn't do anything!

他们把我的想法扫描出来了
They scanned it out of my brain.

我能收回那个想法吗
Can I take it back?

没什么好后悔的
There's nothing to regret.

我们就是要处理这些无意识 不健康的想法
We're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.

该你了
Beth.

现在扫描Beth对Jerry的感知
Now, we scan for Beth's perceptions of Jerry.

使劲扫 他于我与死人无异
Scan hard. He's dead to me.

什么对你来说都是死物吧
Everything's dead to you.

- 你再说一遍  - 没事
- What? - Nothing.

好好看看 一边哭去吧
Read it and weep, bitch.

你们都看到我是什么意思了吧
Does everybody see what I mean?

你们两个的意思 大家都看得很清楚
I think we all see what you both mean.

吸血鬼的事有什么进展吗
Any leads on the vampire?

别这样 我是说
No, Summer! I mean, you know,

我们就别再在意这事情了
I think it might be time that we just l-let it go.

你觉得这没什么大不了
Oh, so, now, you're too cool for this,

就因为外公也这么想吗
Just because grandpa Rick is?

不是因为这个 宇宙实在太大了
It's not that, it's just that the universe

没必要在意这么微不足道的事
is a little too big to care about something so small.

啊
Aah!

你们好啊 小海辛们
What up, my Helsings?

范海辛是著名的吸血鬼猎人

谁想来猎杀吸血鬼 哈哈
Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha!

Rick 你 你怎么
Rick? How-- how did you--

我刚才无聊来着 然后想起来
Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered,

今早我回绝了Summer 然后我寻思
This morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought,

干嘛非得跟个老混蛋似的
Hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick?

赶紧到车库里
Go to the garage,

把自己的思维传输到少年的克隆体
transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself,

然后加入到年轻人的狂欢里吧
and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks,

有什么大不了的
What's the BFD?

所以我就来了 我是小Rick
So here I am. I'm tiny Rick!

好 好吧
O-o-okay.

你来了就好 Rick
Well, it's good you're here, Rick.

我们自己肯定搞不定
I was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes

那个吸血的东西的
to deal with a bloodsucker on our own.

别妄自菲薄 Summer
Don't short-sell yourself, Summer.

你完全能做到 但是我们[哔]组队的话
You got everything it takes. But it'll still be fun

还是很有趣啊 小Rick[哔]无敌
To do this as a [bleep] team, mother[bleep] tiny Rick!

天呐 Toby Matthews来了
Oh, my god, Toby Matthews!

嗨 我是小Rick 我新来的
Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick. I'm new.

别欺负我哦 哈哈 开玩笑的
Hey oh-- go easy on me. Ha ha. Just kiddin'.

我就喜欢你这种直接的性格
I like your straightforward style.

你这实验服的行头挺酷的
And that lab coat's pretty cool.

好啊Summer
Summer.

他知道我的名字
He knew my name!

他怎么会不知道 你长这么美
Why wouldn't he? You're great!

但是我们还是小心为妙
But, listen, just be careful.

我们不能排除任何人是吸血鬼的嫌疑
We can't rule anybody out as the vampire,

男神也不行
Not even the dreamboats.

讨厌
Stop, tiny Rick.

跟孙子孙女杀吸血鬼去啦
Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids!

小Rick[哔]无敌
[bleep]tiny Rick!

下一步是观察你们的构造体
The next step is to watch your mythologues

观察他们之间的互动 "意外"的是
interact together and, uh-- big surprise--

场面从来都不好看
It's never pretty.

这是Gloompfschs夫妇
Here we have Garrrh and Zharbidar Gloompfschs,

换种说法
Or, should I say, here we have the way

这是这对夫妇对对方的感知
Garrrh and Zharbidar perceive each other.

很明显
As we can all see,

这根本不是他们本来的样子
This is hardly the real Garrrh and Zharbidar.

不过这很好 因为在他们脑海里
Which is good, because the relationship

他们的婚姻关系不仅丑恶
In their heads is not only ugly,

而且难以维系
It's unsustainable.

你们可能已经学到了重要的一课
You may already be learning something important--

我们看到的所有婚姻关系都各不相同
All of these relationships are different,

都不真实 而且没有一对能行的通
None of them are real, and none of them work.

我们并不是对方时常认为的魔鬼模样
We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as,

因为我们是真实的 我们是协调的
Because we are real and we are functional.

正因为此 我们比这些怪物好多了
That's what makes us better than them.

我们能解决问题
We can find solutions.

能相互适应
We can adapt.

能相互交流
We can communicate.

最重要的是
And, most importantly,

我们能相互合作
We can work together.

虽然颇有坎坷 最后终于苦尽甘来
Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off --

学校里没有吸血鬼啦
Our school is vampire-free!

没想到Feratu教练竟然是吸血鬼
Man, who would've suspected coach Feratu?

这个名字出自著名的吸血鬼诺斯费拉图

你们做得很好 功不可没
You did great, guys. Couldn't have done it without ya.

我们要为自己感到骄傲
You know, we-- w-we should be proud of ourselves.

我们杀了一个吸血鬼 同时干掉一个体育老师
We killed a vampire and a gym teacher.

哈哈 也算一石二鸟
Ha ha ha. Talk about two-for-one, right?!

你原本的身体是
So, how, exactly, is your old body

怎么在这里面维持生命的啊
living in there, grandpa Rick?

这是高压氧量子液体
Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid,

乱七八糟的东西
That kind of thing.

可以保存生物组织
It preserves living tissue.

也没多少东西要保存的了
Not that there was much to preserve.

你看那皮包骨跟木乃伊似的
Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha!

我该回到那老家伙的身体里了
And I guess it's time for me to get back inside the old-timer.

天呐Toby Matthews问我父母在不在家
Oh, my god. Toby Matthews is asking if my parents

还问我能不能开派对
Are still out of town and if we can have a party!

真棒 Summer 你看我上午说什么来着
All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you?

他还问小Rick会不会来
Ohh! He's asking if tiny Rick will be here.

Summer 我转念一想
Well, you know what, Summer?

你告诉他 小Rick会过去的
Tell him tiny Rick will be here!

让他带点酒来
And tell him to bring some brews!

真的吗 你 你会以小Rick的身份留下
For real? Y-y-y-you would stay as tiny Rick,

就为了留下来开派对
Just so we can have a party?

是啊 多一晚又有什么关系
Hell, yeah! What's one more night?

再说这老家伙在这儿 谁能尽兴啊
And who can have fun with this old bastard hanging around, huh?

Wubby lubby doob doob
Wubby lubby doob doob!

小Rick
Tiny Rick!

接下来 这边是Beth和Jerry Smith
Moving on. Now, we have beth and jerry smith

来自地一球行星
From the planet e-arth.

我的心跳得很厉害
My heart is pounding.

一定会很棒
This is gonna be great.

地一球的两性关系比较简单
The e-arth relationships are simpler.

它是一个原始星球 所以他们的失调状态
It's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh --

等等 发生了什么
W-wait, what? What's going on?

Smith夫妇的构造体在哪
Where are the smith mythologues?

我的天啊
Oh, my god.

- 天啊  - 守住那个牢房
- Oh, my god. - Secure the cell!

谁想参观一下礼品店 很有趣的
Uh, hey! You know what's fun? Our gift shop.

我们何不有序地前往
Why don't we proceed in an orderly --

我的老天
Oh, dear god, no.

他们是互利共生的
They're codependent!

快跑
Run!

真的 你真的很会驾驭
Oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to

- 蓝色的衣服啊  - 真的吗
- sport that color blue. - Really?

- 你今天真的很美  - 我的天啊 
- You're looking real good. - Oh, my god.

- 你好 Morty  - 你好啊 Jessica
- Hey, morty. Oh, hey - hey, Jessica.

那个 小Rick是你的亲兄弟还是表的
So, is tiny Rick your brother or cousin, or...?

都不是 我外公把他的意识
No, my grandpa just transferred

转移到他自己的克隆体上了
His consciousness into a clone of himself

这样他就可以来我们学校了
So he could be in our high school.

帅气
Cool.

快来看 小Rick在弹吉他
Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar.

各位朋友
All right, everybody.

下一首来自我的内心
This next one's coming straight from the heart.

想到哪儿唱到哪儿 现场发挥的歌词
Making the lyrics up right off the top of my head.

*放我出来 你所见的*
*Let me out, What you see*

*只是一个假的驱壳*
*is not the  same person as me*

*我的生活是个谎言 我不是你望着的那个人*
*My life's a lie, I'm not who you're looking at*

*放我出来 给我自由 我已年迈*
*Let me out, set me free,I'm really old *

*这不是真正的我*
*This isn't me*

*我的身体在大缸里渐渐死亡*
*My real body's slowly dying in a vat*

*有人听到我的呐喊吗 有人明白我吗*
*Is anybody listening, can anyone understand*

*别再傻盯着我了 救救我吧*
*Stop Looking at me like that and actually help me*

*救我 救救我 我要死了*
*Help! Help me, I'm gonna die*

我是小Rick 谢谢捧场
Tiny Rick! Thanks, everybody!

这家伙太赞了
This guy's amazing!

- 我爱小Rick   - 帅飞了
- I love tiny Rick! - Bad ass.

搞什么[哔]
What the [bleep]?

就是 你们这机构怎么搞的
Yeah, I know! What kind of operation are you running?

我们 你们两夫妇是什么的婚姻关系啊
Us?! What the hell kind of relationship do you have?!

真好 怪在我们的头上
Oh, right, blame this on us.

对 没错 我就怪在你们头上
Okay, uh, I can and I am!

你们的恶魔化构造体居然在合作
Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating.

这不是好事吗
Isn't that good?

才不是 糟透了
No. No! It's bad!

你们的婚姻是我见过最糟的
You have the single worst marriage I've ever witnessed.

根本不应该存在
It shouldn't exist!

你们根本完全彻底不应该在一起
You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together

我还很不懂你们是怎么以及为什么
And I do not understand how, or why,

会走到一起
You would ever stay together.

你这婚姻咨询也太烂了吧
Well, this is just bad couples' therapy.

可不是嘛
Totally.

等等我们
Wait for us!

位置只够再多一人了
There's only room for one more.

我是心理咨询师 我跟他们说说
I'm a therapist. I'll talk to them.

他们不是咨询师 马上走
They're not therapists. Go, go, go!

肯定有办法联系上爸爸的
There's gotta be a way to contact my dad.

我们找个控制室什么的
Let's find a control room or something.

Beth 快来看看
Beth! You'll want to see this.

这是什么
What is it?

这是个小型可拆卸面板
It's a small, hinged panel

后面有一些空间
With a tiny amount of space behind it.

如果你也能找到一个
If you can find one, too,

接下来几个小时或几天我们就安全了
We should be safe for hours, maybe days!

Jerry 你在这里待好
You stay put, Jerry.

我去求救 假如我能活着的话
I'll send help, if I make it.

你不找个地方自己躲起来吗
You don't want to find your own little hatch?

Jerry 我相信你独自躲好的话
Jerry, I believe that, if you hide by yourself,

你可以活下去
You might survive and I believe I,

同时我也相信 我独自也能逃出这里
By myself, have a shot of getting out of here,

但是我们两人一起
But the two of us, together?

我不知道
I don't know.

可能那个心理医生是对的
Look, maybe the shrink was right.

祝你好运
Good luck.

你给我听好了
All right, now, you listen to me.

其实不听也可以
Oh! Or don't.

别 求你了
Hey! Don't! Please!

天啊 别过来
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!

我明白我以前说过什么
Now, I know I've said, in the past,

数学很重要 确实是
That math is important -- and it is! --

我还认为 总有一天 你们会回想起
But I also think that, one day, you'll all look back

跟小Rick和Morty做同学的日子
On being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty,

因为听说他们昨晚搞了一个超级棒的派对
Who I hear had a great party last night.

那么 下课
So, class dismissed.

今天放你们假
You've got the day off!

干的好 Goldenfold先生
All right! Good work, mr. Goldenfold!

没错 到外面转转 多读书
Yeah, get outside. Read a book.

Danielle 涂点防晒霜
Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!

Summer 你好 上衣真漂亮
Hey, what's up, Summer? Ooh, nice top.

谢谢你 小Rick 你觉得
Thanks. Tiny rick, you think you might be

你今晚可以回到老的身体里去吗
Getting back into your old body tonight?

不行喔 今晚是舞会之夜
No can do. Tonight's the big dance

Morty还会带Jessica出席 他需要这架小僚机
And Morty's bringing Jessica. He needs his tiny wing man.

小Rick
Tiny Rick!

今晚不行的话要等到什么时候
Okay, but if not tonight, when?

不清楚 等我想回去了
I don't know. When I feel like it?

你别这么咄咄逼人的
Damn, girl! You need to chill out!

这件事是你先想出来的
This whole thing was your idea, in the first place,

现在又是你想尽快结束
And, now, you're trying to rush it along.

可不是嘛 我喜欢高中
Yeah, and you know what? I like high school.

我喜欢跟大家玩 小Rick万岁
I like hanging out. Tiny rick!

但是如果喜欢这样生活的人不是真正的你呢
But what if the you that likes it isn't you?

别傻了 Summer
Oh, Summer!

这就是有个年轻驱壳的Rick
It's just Rick in a younger body.

会 会 会 会
What's the -- what's -- what's -- what's --

会有什么问题啊
What's the -- what's the problem?

看看他的画 Morty
Look at his art, Morty.

我最近走情绪摇滚风
I've got an emo streak.

也算是我这么酷炫的部分原因
It's part of what makes me so rad.

为什么这里写着"救救我 Morty和Summer"
Why does it say "Help me morty and summer!"?

Summer 这是画的题目
Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art.

为什么<霹雳游侠>叫霹雳游侠
Why was knight rider called knight rider?

<霹雳游侠> 80年代电视剧

车的名字明明是Kitt 被人开的不是Michael Knight.
The car's name was kitt. Nobody rode Michael Knight.

男主名叫Michael Knight

你想多了 Summer 我是小Rick
You're overthinking it, summer. I'm tiny rick!

外公 我觉得 你把意识
Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind

放进这个年轻的躯体了
Into this body's young brain,

他就做年轻人做的事
It did what young brains do --

这副躯体把坏的想法压在心底
It shoved the bad thoughts into the back

掩藏起来
And put a wall around them.

但那些想法属于真正的Rick
But those bad thoughts are the real Rick.

你已经年迈的事实
The fact that you're old, the fact that

我们终有一天会死的事实
We're all going to die, one day, the fact that

宇宙很大 任何事都很渺小的事实
The universe is so big, nothing in it matters,

这些事实才造就真正的你
Those facts are who you are.

所以真正的Rick被困住了
So you're trapped in there and you can only

你只能通过小Rick的青少年焦虑表现出来
Come out in the form of tiny rick's teen angst!

Summer 我听说
Well, Summer, I hear

Toby Matthews 不喜欢神经兮兮瞎分析的女孩
Toby Matthews isn't into psycho chicks.

没有人喜欢这类女孩
Can't think of anyone that is.

舞会上见啦 兔崽子们 小Rick万岁
I'll see you mother at the dance! Tiny rick!

Morty 你要帮我
Morty, you have to help me!

Summer 他很开心 我也很开心 
Summer, he's happy! I'm happy!

这就是你的目的吗
I-I-is that why you're doing this,

不让我们开心
You don't want me and rick to be happy?

不是
No.

那就把你这些逼事儿收拾收拾
Well, then get your shit together!

全收起来放到书包里
Get it all together and put it in a backpack.

所有的逼事儿 好好收拾收拾
All your shit, so it's together.

如果你想把它们带走
And if you gotta take it somewhere,

就快带走 懂吗
Take it somewhere, you know?

带到逼事儿店卖了
Take it to the shit store and sell it

或者在逼事儿博物馆展览 我不管
O-or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do!

总之 收拾好你的破逼事儿
You just gotta get it together.

收拾好
Get your shit together.

别过来
Get back!

等等 不是吧
Wait, for real?

你是Beth对我的看法
You're how Beth sees me?

天啊
Oh, my god.

转过身去
Turn around!

我说转过身去
I said turn around!

Beth怎么会这样想我
How can beth have these thoughts about me?!

那个狗眼看人低的贱人
That judgmental monster bitch!

我可不接受
I'm not taking this.

我想知道我的妻子在哪
I want to know where my wife is.

你要协助我
You are going to help me.

停 别再这样了
No! Nobody's doing that!

别动
Stay.

你想干嘛
What do you want?

更多Jerry
Jerrys.

你想要Jerry
You want jerry?

我都不想要Jerry
I don't even want jerry.

我要很多Jerry
I want Jerrys.

一支Jerry军队
An army.

Jerry军队
An army of jerrys.

他的顺从的价值都浪费在你身上了
The value of his subservience is wasted on you.

我要利用它来征服宇宙
I will use it to dominate the universe.

天啊 Jerry肯定觉得
Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must think

我得多愚蠢 你才会这么蠢
I'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid.

你把我那个笨蛋丈夫放在
Wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumbass husband

这椅子上不更合理吗
In this chair, so you can make

你就可以制造一堆厉害的自己了
An army of your bad-ass self?

我永远独一无二
There could never be more than one of me.

我是世上最强最聪明的生物
I'm the strongest, smartest being alive

因为那就是Jerry所认为的你
Because jerry thinks you're that much stronger

比你要聪明和强大的程度
And smarter than you are!

好吧 嗷
Okay, ouch.

Morty Jessica 干嘛呢
Morty, Jessica, what's up?

快来欣赏一下的我的自创舞蹈
Check out the new dance I made up.

叫做"啊 放我出去"
It's called "Ooh let me out!"

*放我出来 放我出来 我不是在跳舞*
*Let me out. Let me out. This is not a dance.*

*我乞求帮助 我需要帮助*
*I'm begging for help, I'm screaming for help*

*请放我出来吧*
*Please come let me out*

*放我出来 放我出来 我不是在跳舞*
*Let me out, let me out, this is not a dance*

*我乞求帮助 我需要帮助*
*I'M I'm beging for help, I'm screaming for help*

*请放我出来*
*Please come let me out*

*我在一个车库的大缸中正在死去*
*I'm dying in a vat in a garage*

好吧 最后那段真挺怪的
Okay, that last part was really weird.

也许Summer这回说得对
Maybe summer's on to something here.

我不知道 这事挺好玩的
I don't know. It was fun.

你想来段慢舞不
You want to slow dance?

小Rick 一如既往的舞技高超呀
Tiny rick, hey, great dancing as usual.

能占用你一点时间不
Moment of your time?

小Rick 我来找你谈话
Tiny rick, this conversation

让我心碎得一片一片的
Is gonna break my heart wide open.

你是个很棒的学生 而且你是个
You're a great student and the fact that

思想植入克隆身体内的80岁老人这事
You're an 80-year-old man in a clone body,

对我来说从来不是事
It never bothered me.

但是这里有这么个事
But this here is another matter.

认得这个么
You recognize this?

我们收到线报说这个是从你的更衣柜里找到的
We got a tip it was in your locker.

是吧 现在 因为体育老师确实是个吸血鬼
Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire,

学校董事会觉得很丢脸
The school board is embarrassed

并且决定不会公之于众 但是
And won't take it public, however,

他们不能容忍学生杀掉老师这件事
They can't have students killin' teachers.

我这回必须得开除你了 小瑞
I gotta expel you for this one, tr.

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

Summer 我被开除了
I just got expelled, summer!

哦 所以说你没必要保持年轻了吧
Oh! So I guess there's no need to stay young.

我的上衣
My top!

去你的上衣
Screw your top!

你告我密 我可是小Rick
You ratted on me?! I'm tiny rick!

好吧 是这样的 但是是因为我爱你
Fine! Yes! Because I love you

我想救你一命
And I'm trying to save your life!

高中就是我的命
High school is my life!

Summer Smith是个[哔]呆子神经病
Summer Smith is a [beep] psycho nerd

而且她刚刚害我被开除啦
And she just got me kicked out of school!

切
Boo!

Summer 我还以为你很酷呢
Summer, I thought you were cool!

我很抱歉 好么
I'm sorry, okay?

你怎么可以这么婊啊
How can you be such a bitch?

我的天啊 Morty
Oh, my god, Morty.

你姐姐背叛了小Rick
Your sister crossed tiny Rick?

论什么叫自毁
Talk about self-destructive.

是啊
Yeah.

嘿 那边那个Jerry迷
Hey, jerry-lover!

要不要尝尝本尊的厉害
How about a taste of the real thing?

Jerry
Jerry!

有我在你就别想得逞
Not on my watch.

有了
That's it!

Beth 是我 你的丈夫
Beth, it's me, your husband!

我来救你了
I'm here to save you.

不然我就不叫Jerry Smith
Or my name isn't Jerry Smith!

- 啊哈  - 是的
- Aha! - yes!

Jerry Smith
Jerry Smith!

- 耶 来了  - 啊哈
- Yeah, here. -aha!

好吧 你狠
Okay, fair enough.

说晚安吧 老头
Say goodnight, old man.

- 你干嘛呢  - 快放下
- What the hell are you doing?! - Put it down!

Summer 你这个婊子
Summer, you bitch!

不许这么跟她说话 她是你孙女
Don't talk to her that way! She's your granddaughter!

我不需要什么孙女 我是小Rick
I don't need a granddaughter! I'm tiny ri-I-ck!

她是我姐姐 如果小Rick对待我姐姐
She's my sister! And if tiny rick

要是这么混蛋的话
Is gonna be an asshole to my sister, then,

你知道么 你你你还不如变老吧
You know, y-y-you may as well be old again.

你觉得你特厉害 是吧 Morty 
You think you're tough, huh, Morty?

你能怎么样 我可是小Rick
What are you gonna do? I'm tiny rick.

我是你们学校最酷的学生
I'm the coolest kid in your school.

你怎么让我对你言听计从啊 
How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh?

我能做真正的Rick会做的事
I'm gonna do what real rick would do if he was here—

我要揍你
I'm gonna kick your ass!

Rick我知道你在
Rick, I know you're in there!

我知道你想要出来
I know you're trying to get out!

就这样Morty 按住他
That's it, morty! Hold him down!

听 小Rick
Listen to it, tiny rick.

听 艾略特史密斯的歌
Listen to Elliott Smith.

不要
Ugh! No!

感受他的感受
Feel what he's feeling.

不 天呐
Ugh! Noooooooo! God!

哦天呐 生命是什么
Oh, God, what is life?

如此有才华的人为何英年早逝
How can someone so talented die so young

年轻是什么
What is being young?

我不年轻了 我老了
I'm not young. I'm old.

我 我会死
I'm— I'm gonna die.

我的身体不是真的
My body isn't real.

Morty Summer
Morty! Summer!

是我 是Rick
It's me! It's Rick!

真Rick
Regular Rick!

Rick 我们怎么把你放回你的身体里
Rick! How do we get you back into your body?

好吧仔细听着 那个大桶的仪表盘上
Okay, listen carefully. There's a set of diodes

有一套二极管 有一个蓝的 有一个红的连到
On the vat's control panel, a blue one and a red one to.

哦天呐 这是个什么世道啊
Oh, god, what kind of world is this?

不是我要出生在这个世界上的 把那个
I didn't ask to be born. I need you to connect

蓝的连在我的左太阳穴 然后红的
The blue one to my left temple and the red one to—

为什么大家都不是真的喜欢我
Why doesn't anyone really like me?

集中注意力 姥爷 快把那破电线
Focus, grandpa! Just put the stupid

连我头上 我讨厌做个青少年
Wires on my head! I hate being a teenager!

Jerry 你是掰不动金属的
Jerry, you can't bend metal.

那就造一个能掰动的我
Then make a me that can!

我这边看着你根本掰不动金属呢
How can I do that while I'm watching you

我怎么想象啊
Totally fail to bend metal?

这就是咱们的Beth
Good old beth!

冷如机器 毒如蛇蝎
The mind of a robot and the heart of an insect!

不许这么说她
Don't talk that way about her.

什么
What?

啊 疼啊
Oh, it hurts!

哦 天呐
Oh, god.

停下
Stop.

这个形象让我很不悦
This representation displeases me.

天呐 你是怎么
Good lord. How did you...?

这个 我感觉 在你心目中的
Well, I had a feeling that, in your mind,

那个理想的我应该足够聪明到可以
The ideal version of me is one smart enough

在心里把你当做
To see you as...

女神
A goddess.

你现在可不是什么蠢虫子了 是吧
Not such a stupid worm now, are you?

亲爱的 在有关于你的自尊心的课题上
Honey, when it comes to the subject of your ego,

我可称得上史蒂芬[哔]霍金
I'm Stephen [beep] Hawkinson.

我去 应该是 算了
Ugh, it's -- never mind.

我爱你
I love you.

Rick 裤子
Rick! Pants!

我靠
Holy shit!

谢谢了孩子们 你们解决了问题
Thanks, kids. You figured it out.

好吧  其实是Summer解决的
Well, summer did.

真是挺怪的 Morty你能那么愿意为了个妞
Kind of weird that you were that willing

把我的整个存在给卖了
To sell my existence out for some trim, Morty.

- 什么  - 裤子
- What?! - Pants!

但是听着 我原谅你们俩 知道为什么不
But listen— I forgive you both because you know what?

我今天学到了重要的东西
I learned, today, something important—

青少年的心就是它自己最大的敌人
The teenage mind is its own worst enemy.

哦 我还学到了
Oh, I also learned this...

凤凰计划根本不可靠 不像我想的那样
Operation phoenix is not the fallback I thought it would be.

看来一切都要从头开始了
I guess it's back to the drawing board.

哦天呐
Oh, my god!

哦我的天呐 穿裤子去
Oh, my god. Put some pants on!

穿裤子
Put pants on.

外公回来了 宝贝
Grandpa's back, baby!

外公
Grandpa's --

唉 我还得去接你们的爸妈
Oh, man, I gotta pick up your parents.

他俩快把我电话打爆了
They have been blowin' me up.

走前再砍一刀
One last swing for the road!

我的天呐 穿点衣服行么
For the love of god, get dressed!

所以说 你怎么想的 你想
So, what do you think? You wanna

咱俩再维持这段婚姻一段时间不
Keep this marriage going a while longer?

至少也得坚持到Morty高中毕业呀
At least until morty has graduated high school.

哦 嗯
Oh. Mm.

啊哈 你看 我怎么说的来着
Aha, you see? What did I tell you two?

有效果吧
It worked.

你知道么Rick 我想 从某种程度上来讲 可能
You know what, rick? I guess, in a way, maybe—

没兴趣 上车
Already lost interest. Get in the car.

我一整天都待在一个孩子的体内 
I've been inside a kid all day and, now,

我现在都能听到我骨头相互摩擦的声音
I can feel my bones scraping each other.

让你有点心理准备
Uh, just so you're prepared,

车库里有一堆我的尸体
There's a bunch of dead mes in the garage.

哈 听起来咱们的故事有一个共通的主题了
Huh! Sounds like our stories were connected by a theme.

不可能 Jerry
Not really, jerry.

有可能就是表面上的联系而你的脑子觉得这是主题上的联系
Probably a cosmetic connection your mind mistakes for thematic.

哦
Oh.

老Rick  毁掉一切
Old rick! Ruinin' everything!

主人
Master.

说
Speak.

Feratu教练的真身
Coach Feratu's presence

被人类识破了
Was discovered by the humans.

The mortals shall soon—

不好意思 你说谁来着
I'm sorry, what did you say his name was?

- Feratu教练  - Feratu教练
- Coach Feratu.  - Coach Feratu.

那是他的真名么 他的吸血鬼真名
That was his real name, like his actual vampire name?

不不不不 他的吸血鬼命叫Balik Alistane
No no no no. His vampire name was balik alistane.

他怎么[哔]给自己起这么个名啊
Why the [beep] would he name himself

跟那么有名的吸血鬼电影一样的 他演什么戏呢
after a famous vampire movie? Was he doing a bit?

我不知道 我不洁的主人
I do not know, your unholiness.

耶稣[哔]基督啊
Jesus [beep] Christ.

从现在开始不许再有这些自以为机智乱起名的破事
From now on, no more of this clever-name bullshit.

But, uh, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?

宝贝 有个事情
Hi, honey, so, here's the thing...

他们想 想把我的阴茎切除
These guys--they want to completely

然后作为心脏移植到一个外星人身上

Who could argue with a wife's decision

谁能违背她的意志

Jerry 这么说不太公平吧 非常不公平

整个就透着一股性别歧视的味道
In fact, the whole paradigm has sexist overtones.

Beth 这些能不能咱们私下说
Beth, can we talk about this privately.

最起码的 Jerry
You know, I think the bottom line is, Jerry,

如果你想留着老二 那你就大声说
If you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud,

"我想留着老二"
"I prefer to keep my penis."

如果整个宇宙都需要这跟老二 我还那么说
But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that

那我就成什么人了
If the universe needed his penis?!

如果我事事都阻拦着你
Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be

那我又是哪门子的妻子
If I did anything to stand in your way?

听我一言
Hey, listen,

你拥有樱桃小嘴吗
Is your mouth tiny and small?

那就快来"一点点"餐馆吧
Then why don't you come to Lil' bits

这里食物都是迷你型
Where the food is tiny.

都是寻常食物 就是特别迷你
It looks like regular food, but really tiny.

送到嘴里 尽情吃吧
You can put it in your mouth and eat it.

You've got some time to kill before the procedure,

所以我估计你
So I assume you'd like to, uh,

想最后再使用一下你的阴茎
Use your penis one last time.

我的电脑在这
Here's my computer.

可以联外星网
It's got the alien internet on it.

There are extensive medical records open on my desktop,

我相信你能约束自己
But I trust you to confine your activities

- To the purely pornographic. - Absolutely!

好好享受
Good luck.

天呐 连体双胞胎
Oh, my god! Siamese twins!

这两个人是连体的
They're--they're siamese twins!

你别拽我 我正播着新闻呢
You quit tugging. I-I'm in the middle of my news.

什么事都得围着你转 是吧
Oh, oh, it's always about you, isn't it?

这人简直不可理喻
Can you believe this guy, ladies and gentlemen?

他有自己的新闻节目
He's got his own news show.

还有个正常名字
He's got a normal name.

- 换台看那个新闻  - 好好好
- Hey, flip back to the news. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

你可以看出来 我爹妈先给他起的名
You could tell our parents started with naming with him.

"就叫Michael"
It's like, "Oh, Michael."

我估计他们在怀我们之前
They had that one planned

就已经想好这个名字了
Before they even got pregnant, I bet.

不是我多管闲事啊
I don't want to be that girl,

但是如果他们不同时给这两个人录节目的话
But maybe there would be less conflict

就不会有这种破事儿了吧
If they didn't shoot their shows at the same time.

你根本想象不到
Oh, Summer, you have no idea

这样能省下多少制作经费
How much money that must save production.

然后他们发现后面还连着个我
And then they found out I was attached along for the ride,

于是说"这什么玩意"
And they said, "Ah, shit"

"[哔]的 干脆叫他Pichael算了"
Well, just [bleep] it, call him Pichael."

[哔]你啊 你[哔]就是坨屎
[bleep] you, Pichael. You're a [bleep] piece of shit.

下午好
Good afternoon.

我知道你们都想知道
I know all of you are wondering

我们敬爱的Pibbles的情况
About the condition of our dear, beloved Pibbles.

你想要XP-20还是XP-20 XS
Which would you prefer between the XP-20 and the XP-20 XS?

我还是想要原装的 你也应该这么想
I prefer my own penis, and so should you!

这个勇敢的地球人做出了无畏的牺牲
The brave earth man whose sacrifice

使Shrimply Pibbles的生命得以延续
Is going to allow Shrimply Pibbles to live.

有请Jerry Smith先生
Mr. Jerry smith.

大家好
Hello, everyone!

咱们再为Shrimply Pibbles欢呼一次吧
Let's hear it again for Shrimply Pibbles, huh?

他可真是个好人
He's a good guy, isn't he?

我也刚刚才听说他的伟大事迹
I've only just been learning about his accomplishments,

从他在Flirk Blirk广场上的示威游行
From his march on Flirk Blirk square

到他那持续不断的与海洛因依赖的斗争
To his ongoing battle with heroin dependency.

他最棒了
He's the best.

是啊
Um, yeah.

好吧 我刚想到 他的海洛因成瘾
Well, I-it occurs to me that his heroin addiction

可能还不为公众所知
May not have been a matter of public record.

你知道Shrimply Pibbles的母星的大气层的10%
You realize heroin makes up 10% of the atmosphere

都是由海洛因构成的吧
On Shrimply Pibbles' home planet.

他的整个母星都被Clorgon的敢死队毁掉了
His planet was destroyed by Clorgon death squads.

他要是不吸入海洛因的话根本没法在母星外生存
He can't live outside of it without breathing heroin.

是的 我知道 我就是觉得
Right. I know that. I just think...

这人想耍小伎俩保住自己的阴茎
This guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis!

今日播出 "如何制成"
Today on "How They Do It"...

Plumbuse
Plumbuses.

每个人家里都有一个plumbus
Everyone has a plumbus in their home.

首先 取一些dinglebop
First, they take the dinglebop,

撒上一些schleem并且碾平
And they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem.

schleem可以取出来留着下一批接着用
The schleem is then repurposed for later batches.

然后将dinglebop
They take the dinglebop,

挤进grumbo里面
And they push it through the grumbo,

再拿fleeb摩擦其表面
Where the fleeb is rubbed against it.

用fleeb摩擦的这一步非常关键
It's important that the fleeb is rubbed

因为fleeb上富含fleeb汁
Because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice.

然后会有一个schlami
Then a schlami shows up,

揉一下dinglebop 朝上面吐口水
And he rubs it and spits on it.

然后切开fleeb
They cut the fleeb.

其间会有一些hizard 
There's several hizards in the way.

然后blamf们摩擦chumble
The blamfs rub against the chumbles.

然后削掉ploobis和grumbo
And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away.

你就得到了一个普通的 plumbus
That leaves you with a regular, old plumbus.

我一直想知道 嗯 plumbus是怎么制成的
I always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made.

Enough to pay for a brand-new, state-of-the-art synthetic heart

比Smith先生的可悲的阴茎还要好
That will be even better than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

I'm a good person,

我要求你们切掉我的阴茎
And I demand that you cut off my penis

然后放进这个人的胸腔里
And put it in that man's chest.

手术不是这么做的
That's not how it works!

那你就得想法子这么做了
Well, you're gonna make it work.

你那敏感脆弱的感情 你知道么

依靠考虑个人感受而过滤过的信息
Maybe the species that communicate with each other

来交流的种群就是没那些
Through the filter of your comfort

直接交流的种群进化的好吧
Are less evolved than the ones that just communicate!

可能你的问题只能你自己解决
Maybe your problems are your own to deal with,

让公众去关心你的感情

57. Thankfully, you're in a super-sophisticated

外星医院里
Alien hospital,

所以这事就跟取出个小碎片差不多
So it was basically like getting a splinter removed.

我 我只不过是想让所有人都喜欢我
All— all I wanted was for everyone to like me.

Jerry 你还记得那次你在一个youtube视频
Jerry, remember that time you left a comment

下面留言然后有人回复你
underneath that YouTube video and someone replied

说你是个傻逼 然后你回复了他们说
And called you a dumbass, so you replied and told them,

"傻逼才看谁都像傻逼" 然后你整晚都在
"It takes one to know one," And you stayed up all night

刷新网页
Hitting "Refresh" On your browser

等他们回复 最后还哭着睡着了么
Waiting for them to reply and then you fell asleep crying?

我记得不是这么回事
I remember it differently.

这次跟那回一样 你没法让所有人都喜欢你
This is like that. You can't make people like you.

你就只能等着他们恨你恨腻了
You just have to wait for hating you to bore them.

你知道么 你说的对
You know, you're right.

我不应该为了
I shouldn't be motivated

别人对我的意见而激动
By other people's opinions of me.

Rick 在这个宇宙飞船里
I got to tell you, Rick. It's pretty great

就我们两人 真是挺好的
To be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know?

就到处这样游荡 这风格才对嘛
Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.

我同意 Morty
I agree, Morty.

这样返璞归真挺好的
It's nice to get back to the basics

经过了过去紧张的 混乱的一年
After a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.

- 哦  - 放松
- Ohh!  - Relax.

挡风玻璃就是干这个用的
That's what windshields are for.

我都不知道太空里还有虫子呢
I didn't know that there were bugs out in space.

好吧 那你怎么想的 Morty
Well, w-what did you think, Morty?

生命难道是地球自己进化出来的
Life just developed on earth by itself?

我处理处理
Here, let me take care of this.

天呐 Rick 真恶心
Geez, Rick, that's disgusting.

我不想看
I don't want to look at that.

好像没有清洁液了
Yeah, guess I'm out of fluid.

让我找个地方停一下
L-let me find a place to stop.

嘿 你们星球有擦挡风玻璃的清洁液吗
Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet,

还是说你们已经吓傻了要把我们当神拜了
Or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?

- 杂货店里应该有你要的东西  - 谢谢
- The general store ought to have what you need. - Thanks.

你肯定想要在日落前离开这里
Of course, you'll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.

是啊 当然 等一下 什么 为什么啊
Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?

日落以后节日就开始了
Sundown is when the festival begins.

节日
The festival?

哦哦哦 好吧 对于我们Millennia人来说
Ooh, well, for Millennia,

我们的社会已经完全没有犯罪和战争了
Our society has been free of crime and war,

- 我们生活在和平之中  - 哦 我知道这是什么了
- Living in perfect peace.  - Oh, I know what this is!

你们维持世界和平
You've been able to sustain world peace

靠的是每年有一天晚上 能到处
Because you have one night a year where you all run around

抢劫杀人 还不用承担任何后果
Robbing and murdering each other without consequence.

- 是这样的  - 什么
- That's right. - What?!

就像是<人类清除计划>那电影 Morty
It's like "The purge," Morty. That movie "The purge"?

噢 你以前来过这里么
Oh, have you been here before?

不不 但是我去过好几个星球都有这样的东西
No, no, but I've been to a few planets with the same gimmick.

你知道么 有时候这事也叫作"大净化"或者"红色时间"
You know, sometimes it's called "the cleansing" or "the red time".

有这么个世界就直接管这叫"杀人夜"
There was this one world that called it just murder night.

这 这是个搞大清除的星球
I-it's a purge planet.

他们一片和平 然后 他们搞清除
They're peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.

这也太可怕了
T-that's horrible!

是啊
Yeah.

你想看看么
You want to check it out?

所以 你在节日上一般都干什么啊
So, what do you do during the festival?

你是把自己锁在屋里 还是出去干点什么呀
You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff?

哦 我干一些很坏很坏的事
Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.

哦 我估计也是 老爷子
Oh, I bet you do, old timer.

天呐 Rick 快走吧 太阳快下山了
Gee— Rick, come on. The sun is setting.

我们得离开这里啊
W-we got to get out of here.

好的 好吧 这个玻璃清洗液多少钱
All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid?

免费的 哦 还有
It's on the house. Oh, and, uh,

你再拿点糖吧 
Why— why don't you have some candy bars, as well?

噢 不会吧 你真好
Oh, no way. That's really nice of you.

我是个好人 至少现在是
I'm a nice guy... for now.

哦哦 这我不怀疑
Ohh, I don't doubt it.

- Rick  - 好啦好啦 
- Rick!  - Yeah, yeah.

嘿 节日上好好玩呀 老爷子
Hey, have a good festival, old timer.

我也是这么打算的
I intend to.

Rick 快开门
Rick, unlock it!

就等一下 Morty
Just a second, Morty.

啊 快看那夕阳
Oh, look at that sunset.

别闹了
Stop screwing around.

好了 好多了 现在能看清楚了
There we go. Much better. Now we can see.

呵呵
Great.

嘿 Morty
Hey, you know what, Morty?

现在玻璃已经擦得锃光瓦亮了
Why don't we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here

我们正好看看大清楚怎么样
By watching a little of this purge through it?

什么 不 你有病么
What?! No! What is your problem?!

Morty 成熟点吧 你要是不想看
Morty, grow up. If you don't want to watch,

就别看 但是 你知道 这是我的车
Don't watch, but, you know, it's my car.

还有 你要是告诉你妈
Also, if you tell your mom about this,

- 我就把你给清除了  - 你太差劲了
- I'll purge you.  - You're the worst.

这个星球也是 你怎么会喜欢这种东西
And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this?

看这种互相残杀的戏码
You know, people are gonna kill each other.

怎么 你坐这儿就是想告诉我
So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that

如果有个在线视频
I-if -- if there's a video online

内容是有人被砍头的那种
With someone getting decapitated,

- 难道你不会点进去看看  - 不
- You don't click on it?  - No!

为什么啊 为什么我要点进去看啊 你为什么要看啊
Why— why would I do that? You do that?

我不看 因为太无聊了
I don't, because it would bore me.

我吃早点的时候才看那种[哔]玩意儿 Morty
I see [bleep] like that for breakfast, Morty.

但是你不点进去看 我说就是因为
But if you don't do it, I say it's because

你惧怕你的原始冲动
You're afraid of your own primal instincts.

所以你极力压制他们然后
So you stuff them down and—

哦 哦 嘘 嘘 开始了
OH, OH! Shh. Shh. It's starting.

- 哦吼吼 开始啦  - 我不看
- Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.  - I'm not watching.

好 好 好 你的奖牌已经寄家去了
Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal's in the mail.

- 我要离近点看  - 哦 好吧 随便
- I'm gonna get a closer look. - Oh, okay, sure.

等下就会有人扔石头
And then someone's gonna throw a rock

打中我们的车 然后车子坠毁
And hit the car and then we're gonna crash

然后我们就困在下面了
And we're gonna be stuck down there

剩下的就都是我们活该了
And it's gonna be what we deserve.

哇 这真是[哔]的互相残杀
Whoa, they are purging the [bleep] out of each other.

哦我的天呐
Oh, my god!

哦[哔]
Oh [bleep]

那真是 好吧 那真是恶心
That was— okay, yeah. T-that was gross.

看来我的胃还是没有我的眼睛坚强
Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach

受不太了这个 Morty
On this one, Morty. Ugh.

我对杀戮的观赏欲一瞬间就已经满足了
My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick.

哦天呐
Oh, god.

离我远点
Get away from me!

不 不 救命
No! No! Help!

快来人救我呀 啊
Somebody help me! Aah!

好了 Morty 咱 咱们走吧
All right, Morty. L-let's get out of here.

等一下 等一下 我们得下去
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there.

什么 为什么啊
What? Why?

那个可怜的女孩子 我们得救她
That poor girl. W-we have to save her.

唉 Morty 在宇宙里 有一种东西叫做
Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call

不干涉原则 我们拿到了玻璃清洗液
The non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid.

我们也看了他们互相残杀 我们要走了
We watched them kill each other. We're leaving.

帮我救那个女孩 要不我就告诉我妈你把我带这来了
Help me save that girl, or I'm telling mom you brought me here.

你这个小贱逼
You little turd.

求你了 放过我吧
Please! Leave me alone!

放过你 在大清除上
Leave you alone? During a purge?

我觉得不行啊 宝贝
I don't think so, baby.

没事的 我们不会伤害你的
It's okay. We're not gonna hurt you.

我叫Morty 这是我外公
My name is Morty. This is my grandpa.

- 我们是来旅游的  - 不再是了
- We're tourists.  - Not anymore.

哦天呐 这太[哔]爽了
Oh, my god. This is [bleep] awesome!

Morty 这太酷了
Morty, this is really cool.

嘿 你 你想帮我杀几个人不
Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people?

很好玩的 而且绝对正当
It's fun. We're totally justified

因为我们是为了救一个小女孩啊
Because we're saving a little girl.

就是说 这些人我们可以随便杀 完全没问题
I mean, w-w-we're both free and clear to murder these people.

- 你没事吧  - 是的
- Are you okay?  - Yes.

我得找个地方躲一下
I have to find somewhere to hide.

好吧 你可以和我们一起啊 Rick
Well, you can hide with us. Rick?

- 怎么了  - 你觉得我们可以
- Yeah?  - Do you think we could take—

- 你 你叫什么名字  - Arthrisha
- W-what's your name?  - Arthrisha.

我们可以带Arthrisha上车么
Could we take Arthrisha up in the ship

然后 你懂的 就等着大清除结束
And, you know, just wait out the purge?

哦 Morty 我怎么能拒绝呢
Oh, Morty, how can I refuse

就你刚刚那么威胁过我之后
After all you've done to blackmail me?

你的交通工具 是神赐的么
Your vehicle— is it from the gods?

- 不  - 是
-No.  -Yes.

所以 大清除最开始的时候
So, uh, you know, when the purge started,

大家是一下就进入现在这种状态
Did people get into it right away,

还是 "等等 什么
Or were they like, "Wait, what?

这也能阻止犯罪么 到底什么原理啊" 那样的
This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"

是啊 最开始人们花了不少时间接受这件事
Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it.

是啊 我猜也是
Yeah, I bet. I bet.

是啊有点像手机
Yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know?

一开始 大家都 
At first, everyone was like,

"看那几个傻逼在那搞清除"
"Look at those douchebags purging,"

然后就变成了
And then the next thing you know,

"这真方便啊"
They're like, "It's just so convenient."

天呐 Morty你这是在为了喜剧俱乐部
Geez, you working on your tight five

准备单口相声么
For the comedy store, Morty?

你干什么呢
Whatcha doing?

看电视 玩手机吗
Watching some TV, playing on your phone?

- 你是认真在问我  - 就是想聊聊天
- Is that a real question? - Just making conversation.

是么 你说的哪句话让我能接着聊下去啊
Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with?

我的选择要么是不作回答 要么冷嘲热讽
My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic,

或者喊一句 "是啊" 就像个训练过的动物一样
Or bark "Yes" Like a trained animal.

这也不能算对话
It's not a conversation.

你这是语言绑架我啊
You're holding me verbally hostage.

好吧 混蛋 我去厨房了
Okay, ass-face. I'll go in the kitchen.

- 嘿 爸  - 嗯
- Hey, dad. - Yeah?

你干什么呢 进厨房吗
Whatcha doing? Going into the kitchen?

好吧
Okay.

- 是么 你喜欢这样  - 去你的
- Yeah, you like that?  - Screw you.

所以 大多数人清除的时候都戴面具么
So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge?

我 我不想再回答任何关于清除的问题了
I-I don't want to answer any more purge questions.

好吧 没事的
All right, hey, hey, that's cool.

我没关系的
I can roll with that.

- 我的外婆  - 哈
- My nana! - Huh?

我外婆 我们得救她
My nana! We have to save her!

你刚想起来你外婆还在呢
You just now remembered your nana exists.

我 我受到了心理创伤
I-I was traumatized.

你大概经历过15次大清除了吧
Haven't you been through like 15 purges?

有些小时候就经历了
I mean, some as a child?

有人能帮我救救她吗
Will somebody just help me get her?

好吧 随便 Morty 留下
Fine, whatever. Morty, stay.

哦天呐 哦我靠 我靠
Oh, god. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!

- 滚出来 滚出来  - 嘿 喔 喔 喔
- Get out! Get out! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

[哔]滚出那个飞行机器
Get the [bleep] out of the flying machine!

哦我的天呐 好 好的 好的
Oh, my god! O-okay! Okay!

- 退后 混蛋  - 啊啊啊
- back up, asshole. - Ahh

- 退后  - 哦
- Back up.  - Ohh.

- [哔]退后点  - 啊
- Back the up!  - Aah!

如果这么说有用的话 我很抱歉
For what it's worth, I'm sorry,

但今晚说什么都没有用
But that's not really worth anything tonight, is it?

你 你不能把我们扔在这 你这是在谋杀我们
Y-you can't leave us here. You're killing us!

你听到了么 回来
You hear me? Come back.

你 你得回来 快改变你的主意
Y-you got to come back. Change your mind.

哦 天呐
Oh, geez.

Morty 啊 那个[哔]阿米什婊子射了我
Morty! Aah! The [bleep] Amish bitch shot me!

阿米什人 美国北美宗教社群 拒绝现代设施 过着简朴的生活

她想清除我 Morty
She tried to purge me, Morty.

你跟着自己的小弟弟走 现在我要死了
You let your wiener do the walking, and now I'm dead.

- Rick 她把车给抢了  - 你[哔]逗我呢 Morty
- Rick, she took the car!  - You [bleep] kidding me, Morty?!

她把我的枪和车都抢走了
She took my car and the gun.

我们现在跟这群混球没区别了
We're like the rest of these assholes now.

我 我们要被他们屠了
W- w- we're gonna get purged, Morty.

扶我起来
Help me up.

老天 要命了
Oh, geez, geez!

等等 Rick
Wait a minute, Rick.

为什么不用你的传送枪
Why don't we just use your portal gun?

在飞船里 蠢货
It's in the car, dip-ass.

疼死我了
Oh, god, it hurts.

她正好射中我的肝
She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.

这是银河系最辛勤工作的肝了
It's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty,

现在上面破了个洞 希望这血没白流
And now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it.

我只是想做对的事
I was just trying to do right.

那可不是今晚狂欢的主题
Yeah, well, that's not really the theme of tonight's party.

小心 一群强奸犯
Heads up. Rapists.

别傻站着了
Well, don't just stand there, Morty.

- 弄死他们  - 我上吗
- Purge 'em. - Me?

难不成我上 我拿肝上的窟窿套他们吗
No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them?

捡根棍子什么的敲死他们
Pick up a stick or something and kill them.

呃 我们为和平而来
Um, w- we come in peace.

真是扶不上墙
Oh, my god.

那玩意我还多的是
There's more where that came from!

你们想被清除掉吗 放马过来
You want to get purged, you bring it!

把家伙放下 全都放下
Drop, drop your shit! Drop it all.

Morty 把他们的家伙抄了 赶紧
Morty, go get their shit. Hurry up.

刚才扔的玩意 我就剩一个了
I only had one of those things I threw.

现在拿的是一盒糖
I'm holding a box of tic tacs right now.

- 要吃饼干吗  - 不要吃
- Want some crackers? - No, thank you.

你什么时候能对我态度好起来
Are you ready to be nice to me?

为了区区一盒饼干吗
In exchange for crackers?

你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

赶紧找个工作吧 老爸
Dad, get a job.

你的生活太无聊了 才在这里找事
You're trying to create drama because you're bored.

有电话
Oh.

外公给我们的太空电话
It's the space phone grandpa gave us.

- 喂  - Summer 我是外公
- Hello? - Hey, Summer, it's grandpa.

你得帮我个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

- 我听不清楚  - 谁啊
- I can barely hear you. - Who is it?

我跟Morty在一个正在搞大清除的星球
Morty and I are on a planet that's purging.

- 你要记下  - 什么锡球
- I need you to take down... - A plan that's what?

我们在一个正在大清除的星球 大清除
We're on a planet that's purging, Summer. Purging.

我的飞船和枪都被抢走了 我们正在一场大清除中
We lost our car and my gun, and we're in a purge.

是Taddi Mason打来的吗
Ooh, is it Taddi Mason?

就像那部电影一样吗
Like the movie "The purge"?

是的 你得记
Yes, I- I need you to take...

那部电影烂透了
That movie sucked.

天呐 等一下
Oh, my god. Hold on.

不是Taddi Mason吗
It's not Taddi Mason?

老爸 Taddi Mason[哔]是谁
Dad, who the [bleep] is Taddi Mason?

- 一个朋友  - 啊
- My friend. - Aah!

你还好吗 我开免提了
Are you okay? I'm putting you on speaker.

- Taddi吗  - 是啊Jerry 我是Taddi
- Taddi? - Yes, Jerry, it's Taddi,

以前从来没人听说过的人
A person no one's ever heard of until now,

现在正拿太空电话打给你呢
Calling you on a space phone.

我分不出你是不是在讽刺
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.

装弹 赶快
Reload, fast.

Summer 你得记下这串数字
Summer, w- we need you to take down this number.

- 别扯别的  - Morty吗 你没事吧
- Quit screwing around. - Morty? Are you all right?

- 当然有事  - 你怎么和Taddi Mason在一起
- No! - Why are you with Taddi Mason?

我[哔] 你[哔]闭嘴吧老爸
Holy [bleep] Dad! Shut the [bleep] up!

好吧看来 我就是全家人的出气筒
Okay. I guess I'm just this entire family's toilet paper.

你有在记吗 快把数字记下来
Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down?

- 好好  - 7 7 1 9 8
- Yes, yes. - 7, 7, 1, 9, 8...

3 6 4 2 1 1 2 5
3, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5.

你这狗日的
You son of a bitch!

Morty 我也不想求助
Morty, I don't want to be the "A little help" Guy,

不过你能搭把手吗
But a little help?

好了 我找到笔了 说
Okay, I have a pen. Go.

7 7 1 9 8 3 6 4 2 1 1 2 5
7, 7, 1, 9, 8, 3, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5.

就给我个勺子吗
A spoon, Morty?

- 你搞什么  - 对不起
- A spoon?! - I'm sorry.

你旁边这么多餐具
There's a pile of silverware next to you,

你给我个最没杀伤力的东西
And you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything?

我错了还不行吗
All right, okay!

车库里我工作台上有个架子
Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage,

有一个带键盘的红盒子
There's a red box with a keypad on it.

你把盒子拿到外面
You're gonna take that box outside,

输入我刚才给你报的数字
and you're gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad.

- 明白吗  - 明白
- Got it? - Got it.

恨自己的老爸是成长的一部分吗
Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad?

懒得搭理你
I'm ignoring you.

如果我能到那个灯塔顶上
Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse,

就可以发射信标 你姐就能把东西送过来
I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package.

记住了 如果那里有人
Just remember, if there's people in there

而且他们想杀我们的话 我们先把他们弄死
And they try to purge us, we got to purge them first.

我们谁也不弄死 Rick 能不能别这样
We're not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W- will you stop it?

如果还想看见明天的太阳
Morty, if we're gonna survive tonight,

你得学会驾驭你压抑的愤怒
You're gonna need to harness your repressed rage.

我没有压抑的愤怒
I don't have any!

你这语气就挺压抑的
Spoken like a person with repressed rage.

我没有参加节日
I take no part in the festival.

如果你们想杀我 只求下手麻利点
If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly.

没这个打算
No such agenda, chief.

我们对大清除也没什么兴趣
We're not too keen on the purge, either, sir.

我们只想到你灯塔顶上
We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse

为我在地球的姐姐设一个信标
So we can send a beacon to my sister on earth.

- 那是另外一个星球  - 顺便说一句
- It's a different planet. - By the way,

别的星球也存在生命 不过重点不在这儿
Life on other planets exists. Don't let it distract you.

你们可以藏在我的灯塔里 设信标
I'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending

不过条件是 你们得听听我写的故事剧本
On the condition that you listen to my tale.

- 好  - 成交
- Okay. - Deal.

我去楼顶把东西弄好
All right, I'm gonna go to the roof and set things up.

- Morty 你听他读  - 好
- Morty, you listen to his tale. - Okay.

而你 正失业中 只是无聊
You're unemployed, and you're bored.

- 孰轻孰重自有分晓  - 别再说失业的事好吗
- They're a higher priority. - Stop saying I'm unemployed!

7 7 1 9 8 3 6 4 2 1 1 2 5

Look, I'm your father, and I love you is all I'm saying.

- 仅此而已  - 说完你就满意了吧
- I'll leave it at that. - Fine, dad!

外公好像说过要先拿到外面去
Oh, he might have said to take it outside.

快点啊 Summer
Come on, Summer.

往盒子上输几个数字有什么难的
How hard is it to type some numbers into a box?

目标锁定
Target locked.

谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

我跟Summer这边都万事俱备
Well, I did my job. Summer did her job.

只欠Morty听完他的剧本了
Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale.

Blaine说"可能我不需要新朋友"

- You liked it? - Of course I did.

酒吧那部分你没有笑
You didn't laugh at the scene in the bar.

那段挺搞笑的 但是我想听后面的部分
I...thought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest.

有什么想法吗 意见呢
Do you have any thoughts? Notes?

没有 仅仅是乐在其中
No. I-I just enjoyed it.

这就是我的意见 请再多写一点
That's my note, you know? Please write more.

- 感觉你在敷衍  - 不不
- Seems a little insincere. - What? No.

你不用好言哄我
You don't have to mollycoddle me.

我想改进我的写作 说出你的真实想法
I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts.

好吧 呃 从我个人角度来说
All right. Well, um, I'm not a huge fan, personally,

我不是很喜欢那个"三周前"开场戏的倒叙
Of the whole "Three weeks earlier" teaser thing.

我觉得
I feel like, you know,

应该从故事开始的地方下笔
We should start our stories where they begin.

不是从有趣的地方开
Not start them where they get interest--

- 滚出去  - 你说什么
- Get out. - Um, what?

我已经厌倦了 你砸我房门
No, I'm sick of this. You bang on my door,

向我乞求帮助 我和你分享我个人的一些东西
You beg me to help you, I share something personal with you,

你把它贬得狗屁不如
And you take a giant shit on it.

我们就问你能不能在这放个信标
Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon--

不能 你们给我出去
Well, you can't. I want you out of here.

你这个没有安全感 小肚鸡肠的无赖
You're a petty person, and you're insecure,

你还发泄到我头上 明明就是个好剧本
And you're taking it out on me. That's a good script.

什么鬼东西
What the hell?!

我不管 你要求你们离开
I don't care. I want you out.

- 你说什么  - 把那玩意拆下来
- What? - Take that thing down.

你外孙是个小瘪三 快离开
Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now.

- 你怎么搞的  - 我什么都没做
- Morty! - Rick, I didn't do anything.

我熬着听完了他的整个剧本
I sat through his entire screenplay--

你"熬着"听完的吗
You "sat through it"?

废话 难不成你还想让我留下幸福的泪水
Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy?

- 写得狗屎一样  - 注意言行 Morty 我们是客人
- It's terrible! - Whoa! Morty! We're guests here.

我已经努力做到有礼貌了 这都是他逼的
I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me!

- 我这就把信标拆了  - 不行 这不公平
- I'm taking down this beacon. - No, stop! That's not fair!

你讨厌自己的作品
Just because you hate your own writing

并不说明我是个坏人
Doesn't make me a bad person!

满意了吧 你想让我切到三周之前
You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier

你还活着的时候吗
When you were alive?

Morty 你把他清除了
Whoa, Morty. You just purged.

信标即将到达
Beacon arriving.

该出动了
Okay, time to go.

这下好了
Well, terrific.

老爸 怎么回事 你这是搞什么
Dad, what's going on? What's the deal here?

我只想陪陪女儿而已
I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter.

你长大得太快了
You're growing up so fast.

- 过去你就是我的小甜妞  - 是啊
- You used to be my little girl. - Yeah.

你还记得过去我们经常去操场玩
Remember when we used to go to the playground,

我推你荡秋千的事吗
And I'd push you on the swings?

当然 你总是能推得让我比其他的孩子高
Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids.

那时候你小小的 很可爱
You were so small and cute.

我还以为你会被甩飞到街上去
I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street.

我还会吓到尿裤子
I used to pee my pants.

可不是嘛 我家闺女长大了
I know, and now look at you!

有份能挣到钱的好工作
You have a job. You're making really good money.

也不用付房租
You're not paying any rent,

所以你就有大把可支配收入
So you have plenty of disposable income.

天啊 爸 别这样
Oh, god, dad. Please, don't.

我只需要几百块
I just need a few hundred dollars

来熬过这月而已 很快我就有面试了
To get through the month. I have some interviews coming up.

我能预感到事情肯定很快就会有转机了
Something's gonna come through. I can feel it.

我要进去了
I'm going inside.

Jerry 看来这就是人生低谷的感受
I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry.

没事 Morty 今天是大清除
It's okay, Morty. It's the Purge, you know?

把守灯塔的老人推下楼梯这种事完全没问题
Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool.

Rick 这样很有问题 我不是那些人
It's not cool, Rick. I-I'm not like these people.

我不能在某一天到处砍人
I can't run around chopping people's heads off

然后剩下的日子还能安心地抱头大睡
One day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time.

你最好快点习惯 小傻逼
Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch,

因为[哔]有人找上门了
Because we got some [bleep] company.

看 他来了
Hey, there he is.

我来了
Here I am.

Morty
Morty.

清除时候到
Time to purge.

tony! toni! tone!- <Feels Good>

老天 Morty 你还真开始熟路了
Geez. Wow, Morty. Now you're getting into it.

真想不到啊
Never expected that out of you.

好了 去找回我的飞船
All right, uh, let's go find my ship.

Morty 飞船就在那
Hey, hey, Morty, Morty. There it is down there -- my ship.

看起来好像 Morty
It looks to me like the... Morty?

舔我的[哔] 尝尝这招
Suck my [bleep].Eat this.

小子 你真的
Ooh, boy, you're really, uh...

你真是大开杀戒啊
You're really going for it over there, huh?

我觉得
I, uh I think, uh

我觉得那些人 只是想躲着
I think those people were just hiding.

我[哔]才不管
I don't give a [bleep]

够了 Morty 你在射一群尸体
Okay, Morty, now you're just shooting corpses.

- 喜欢这招不  - 够了 伙计
- How do you like this? - Okay, buddy.

好了伙计 够了
All right. That's good. Good job.

是时候回家了
Time to go home.

等等 住手 求你们别杀我
Wait, stop! Please, don't kill me!

我没想过伤害你们的 我发誓
I-I never intended to harm you, I swear.

我只想结束这个节日
I am trying to end the festival.

- 什么意思  - 我想利用这艘飞船
- w-what do you mean? - I was going to use your ship

去干掉那帮掌控这个社会的混蛋
To destroy the rich assholes that run our society

拯救我们这些被这个节日折磨的老百姓
And save my people from the horrors of this yearly festival.

[哔]她的 Rick 杀了她 杀了她 杀了她
[bleep] that, Rick! We got to kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

天啊 Morty 清除掉一点杀气
Whoa! Geez, Morty, purge it down a little.

"清除 别清除 "
"Purge! Don't purge!"

Rick 我不懂你想表达什么
You're sending me mixed messages, Rick.

Morty 你表现得
Morty you're acting like

完全像个神经病
A freaking lunatic.

- 冷静点  - 去你的 Rick 
- calm down. - screw you, Rick!

我还要杀了你这只老弱鸡Rick
I'll purge you, too, you old, rickety piece of crap!

想了很久了
This has been a long time coming!

我要[哔]把你的内脏挖出来
I'm gonna rip your [bleep] guts out

涂在你那张傻逼脸上
And smear them all over your face!

我才不会
I ain't taking no sh--

抱歉让你见笑了
Okay, s-sorry about that.

那帮有钱人在哪
Now, where are these rich people?

敬又一年成功举办的节日
To another successful year of the festival,

让穷人们自相残杀几千年
Pitting poor people against each other for thousands of years.

等等 这音乐从哪里来的
Wait, w-where is that music coming from?

你什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

事情是这样的 我不想评价你们的做法
Here's the deal. I'm not here to judge.

我只是个从别的星球来的普通人
I'm just a guy from another planet.

但是这女孩是你们穷人中的一员
But this girl is one of your poor people,

我猜你们很心安理得地
And I guess you guys felt like it was okay

让她处在毫不人道的环境中
To subject her to inhuman conditions

因为这样永远没有机会能伤害到你们
Because there was no chance of it ever hurting you.

这在社会政治层面上
It's sort of the socio-political equivalent

就好比有一身武装盔甲
Of, say, a suit of power armor around you.

但现在情况算是扯平了 那么 Arthrisha
But now things are evened out, so, Arthrisha?

节日快乐 [哔]烂人们

Rick 你想来掺一脚吗
You want to get in on this, Rick?

说真的  我已经够了
No, I really -- honestly, I-I've had my fill.

现在再杀就是毫无理由了
It's gratuitous at this point.

你真的不想来吗
You sure you don't want to join in?

感觉非常棒
This is really amazing.

但是 还是好吧 [哔]它的
Yeah, but --Ah, all right.[bleep] it.

有意见么 贱人们
Yeah, bitch,what's up?

现在让我们热舞起来吧
Okay, now it's time we do a little dancing

随着tony! toni! tone!的歌跳舞
To -- To Tony! toni! tone!

快看我的[哔]脚步 [哔]们
Look at my [bleep] feet, mother[bleep]

Arthrisha 露一手
Arthrisha, what do you got?

看我的厉害
Check this out.

不知这是什么歌 但我就[哔]喜欢
I don't know what song that is, but I [bleep] love it!

"Feels good"
"Feels good."

一首[哔]热单
It's a [bleep] hit song.

可能还是一首冠单
Topped the charts, I think. HO, HO!

*感觉很好*
*Oh, it feels good.*

非常感谢你的帮助 Rick
Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick.

你是个好人
You're a pretty great guy.

[哔]你射爆我的肝
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [bleep] you for shooting my liver.

有机会再见
I'll see you around.

天啊 发生了什么事
Oh, man. What -- what happened?

别担心 Morty
Don't worry about it, Morty.

听好了 如果你想打一炮的话
Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece,

行动起来 最后的机会了
You better hurry up. Now's your last chance.

Arthrisha 可能我
Hey, hey, Arthrisha, um, maybe I could --

我有男朋友了
Uh, I have a boyfriend.

- 好吧  - 我不是想冒犯你
- Okay. - I'm not trying to be rude.

我只是不想你误会
I just -- I don't want to lead you on.

我懂的
I-I-I understand.

我非常感谢你帮忙终结了这个节日
I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival,

但我已经有男朋友了 他只是
But I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he's just --

好了 你不用再说下去了
Okay, okay, you can stop saying it.

你第一次说的时候我就懂了
I took it okay the first time,

你不用再说了
And now you're just repeating stuff.

- 很抱歉  - 没事
- oh, I'm sorry. - it's okay.

你很好人 但我不能
Oh, you're so sweet, I just -- oh, but I can't.

- who's got food for that guy? - I do, but this is for me.

你不能多做点食物吗
Can't you make some more?

当然可以 我为所有人做食物的时候
Oh, sure. And while I'm making food for everyone,

谁来照顾我的孩子呢
Who takes care of my kids?

我来帮你照顾孩子 前提是我要有额外的食物
I'll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it.

额外的食物
Extra food?

人人所得一样的话 我可不会花额外的功夫
Well, I'm not gonna do extra work if we all get the same.

好吧 公平至上
All right, okay, fair is fair.

多劳者多得
If you do extra work, you get extra food.

那谁来记下
Who's gonna keep track

每个人"劳"多少"得"多少呢
Of who gets how much food for how much work?

你好 我可以
Hello. I can do that.

我来记录每个人应得的食物
I'll keep track of everyone's food,

用来换取食物
You know, in exchange for food.

那根本不是真正的工作
That's not a real job!

难道做食物就是吗
Oh, and making food is?

你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

尝尝这招
Eat this!

好了 伙计们

And rage out of our system --

我很惭愧
I can't help but feel ashamed

- 我需要好好处理 - 别担心 Morty
- I need to deal with. - Don't worry about it, Morty.

还记得那些糖吗
Remember those candy bars earlier

- 我们刚来的时候拿的那些  - 怎么了
- that we got in the first act? - yeah, what about them?

原来它们含有一种化学成分叫"清除醇"
Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol

这种物质会加重你的暴力倾向
That amplifies all your violent tendencies.

天啊 真是感谢天感谢地
Oh, boy. Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh?

松了一口气
That's a relief.

没错 冷汗都不用冒一滴
Yep. Don't even sweat.

You're still the same old Morty.

你的人格没有受到损害

这次婚礼的客人名单

我们曾以自由之名
We have committed numerous atrocities

犯下无数暴行
In the name of freedom.

啊 在那段时间里
An-nnd during that time,

我猜他没有提到他的乖女儿吧
I don't suppose he ever mentioned his daughter.

这个是迷你法式咸派吗
Are those baby quiches?

填料是蚯蚓酱
Night crawler pate.

我得为仪式做准备了
I should prepare for the ceremony.

真是对牛弹琴
Like talking to a brick wall.

以屎瓜 六大河
In the name of the squanch, the six rivers,

四屎瓜 和九球的名义
The four squanches, and the nine balls,

我来见证这两只生物的永久屎瓜
I unite these two organisms in eternal squanch!

Tammy 你可以屎瓜你的誓言了
Tammy, you may squanch your vows now.

鸟人郎君
Birdperson...

你是我的种子 我的虫子
You are my seed, my worm,

我的早起 我的无猫
My earliness, and my lack of cats.

我发誓与你相伴直到死亡
I promise to be yours until your death.

说得好
Nice!

轮到你了
Birdperson.

Tammy 在遇到你时 我已经快不育了
Tammy, I was approaching infertility when I met you,

然而我们还有时间
But there is still time.

我属于你一人 直到死亡
I am yours until my death.

I now pronounce you squanch and birdperson!

我没在盯着你看
I am not staring at you.

抱歉
Sorry.

我没在盯着你看
Hi. I am not staring at you.

大家好
Uh, hi, everybody.

我叫Rick
I'm Rick.

我第一次遇见鸟人的时候 他有点 呃
You know, when I first met birdperson, he was, uhh...

(越来越小声)
(把纸揉成一团)
(即兴发挥吧)

我不是宇宙里的最好的人
Listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the universe

因为我是最聪明的那个
Because I'm the smartest.

与人为善是那些蠢货干的事
And being nice is something stupid people do.

以此来弥补他们的愚蠢
To hedge their bets.

我还没挑明了说
Now, I haven't been exactly subtle

我到底多不相信婚姻
About how little I trust marriage.

我无法维持我的婚姻
I couldn't make it work,

尽管我能把黑洞变回恒星
And I could turn a black hole into a sun.

所以到了某一时刻 我们必须扪心自问
So at a certain point, you got to ask yourself

这是个正确决定的几率有多渺茫
What are the odds this is legit.

说不定这只是我们的自我欺骗
And not just some big lie we're all telling ourselves.

因为我们不想孤独终老
Because we're afraid to die alone?

因为 这恰恰是我们死的方式 独自死亡
Because, you know, that's exactly how we all die, alone.

天呐
Oh, boy.

老天爷
Jesus.

但 但是 正文来了
But, but, here's the thing.

鸟人是我最好的朋友
Birdperson is my best friend,

如果他爱Tammy 那我也爱她
And if he loves Tammy, well, then I love Tammy, too.

致友谊 致爱情
To friendship, to love,

致敬我至今最大的冒险
and to my greatest adventure yet--

向他人敞开心扉
Opening myself up to others.

说得好
Hear, hear!

干杯 [哔]
Cheers to that, mother[bleep]!

谢谢 Rick
Thank you, Rick.

非常感人
That was beautiful.

当我环顾四周 我对自己说
Gosh, I look around this room, and I think,

"Tammy 你就是个地球来的高三女生"
"Uh, tammy, you're a high-school senior"

"你这就要嫁给一个40岁的鸟人了"
"From the planet earth, and you're marrying"

"真是不可思议"
"A 40-year-old birdperson? Like, what?!"

真棒 Tammy
Yeah, tammy!

然后我又想 从很多方面来说
But then I think, you know, in a lot of ways,

我不是个地球来的高三女生
I'm not a high-school senior from the planet earth.

从很多角度来说 我实际上是个
In a lot of ways, what I really am

银河联邦局的卧底特工
Is a deep-cover agent for the galactic federation,

你们这群通缉要犯
And you guys are a group of wanted criminals,

这座建筑 这么说吧 已经被包围了
And this entire building is, in a certain sense, surrounded.

我靠
Oh, shit.

我不是很懂这是什么暗喻
I...don't get the metaphor.

一会再跟你解释
I'll explain it to you later.

所有人都被捕了
Everyone here is under arrest

罪名是反叛联邦
For crimes against the federation.

祝福新人
L'chaim!

Tammy 你这是干什么
Tammy, what are you doing?

把你的鸟屁股坐下
Sit your bird ass down.

Tammy
Tammy?

鸟人
Birdperson!!

不要
No!!

我
Holy--

把传送枪放下
Drop the portal gun.

扔到屋子中央
Slide it to the center of the room.

来人把那个没收掉 别弄坏了
Somebody confiscate that and don't damage it.

局里的人还要
They'll want it at--

没时间屎瓜了
There's no time to squanch!

带上你的家人快走
Get your family out of here!

这里我搞定
I got this.

尝尝我的屎瓜
How about a taste of my squanch?!

快 走这边
Come on, this way!

屎瓜这个
Squanch this!

还好我捡了把武器
Good thing I grabbed a space weapon.

这是把礼花枪 蠢猪
That's a confetti gun, you idiot!

- 老爸  - 抓紧
- Dad! - Hold on tight!

啊
Aaah!!

啊
Aaaah!!

该死的 真是该死
God damn it! God damn it!!

刚才到底什么情况
What the hell happened back there?!

都赖你们 我说过婚礼都烂透了
This is on you guys. I told you weddings are stupid.

Rick 关于你和之前我们从没听说过的
Uh, Rick, is there anything you'd like to tell us

银河联邦之间的故事
About your relationship

你是不是和我们讲一下
With this previously unknown galactic government?

这还不明显吗
All the important points seem pretty clear, no?

他们自认为统治银河系 我不同意
They think they control the galaxy, I disagree.

别怪玩家 游戏的错
Don't hate the player, hate the game, son.

你怎么能对家人如此不诚实
How could you be so dishonest with this family?

难不成我本来该再敞开些心扉 更加有爱 轻信别人 
Oh! Oh, should I have been more open and trusting

就像 我想想
And loving like, oh, I don't know,

就跟刚死掉的我最好的朋友那样吗
My now dead best friend?

或者像你女儿那样
Or your daughter,

找个死党 结果她还是个跨星系缉毒警察
Who is BFFs with an intergalactic NARC?

Tammy挺酷的
Hey, Tammy was cool!

- 现在知道为什么了  - 就因为你
- And now we know why. - Because of you!

[哔]你啊 Summer 顺带[哔]政府
[bleep] you, Summer, and [bleep] the government,

还要[哔]我 因为我松懈了
And [bleep] me for letting my guard down,

以后永远不会这样了
Which I will never do again.

积点口德 Rick
Geez, Rick!

你怎么能对孙女说出[哔]这种字眼
You can't say "f--'f' you" to your granddaughter.

我就说了怎么样 附赠一句 [哔]你
I just did, Morty. Here's dessert, [bleep] you.

我们刚熬过一场可怕的婚礼
Look, I think we've all had a tough wedding.

其实吧 婚礼挺美的
Actually, the wedding was beautiful.

接待有点失控
The reception got out of hand.

不扯那些 我们还是回家洗洗睡吧 忘掉一切
Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off,

然后明早开个家庭会议
And have a family meeting in the morning.

回家这事吧 不行 永远都不能
Yeah, about going home, we can't--ever.

什么
What?!

那群人正找我们呢
Oh, these guys are looking for us now.

他们肯定蜂拥到地球了
Earth will be swarming with them.

找"我们"
Us?!

- Jerry  - 我想回家
- Jerry. - I want to go home!

你们谁想回地球的话
Look, anyone that wants to go back to earth

随你的便
Is free to go back to earth.

但是后果是
But here's what's gonna happen.

外星官僚的走狗会逮捕你们
Aliens bureaucrats are gonna arrest you.

他们会拿星系里相当于跨接电缆的东西
They're gonna put the intergalactic equivalent

接到你的蛋蛋或者洞洞下面
Of jumper cables under your nuts and or labia,

然后另一头连上外星车载电池
And hook them up to an alien car battery.

一直电到你们说出我的藏身之处
Until you tell them where I am--

并且我保证你们不知道我在哪
Which I guarantee you, you're not gonna know,

当然 他们肯定不会信
Which I guarantee they won't believe.

谁想家了 掌声欢送
So who's homesick? By applause.

女士们 有谁要回吗
Ladies? Anybody?

我们怎么办
What are we going to do?

我们要住哪里
Where are we going to live?

放轻松 塞翁失马焉知非福
Take it easy. This is a blessing in disguise.

去[哔]的地球吧
[bleep] earth.

你知道我们星球名字的意思是"尘土"吧
You realize our planet's name means dirt, right?

我们会找到新世界的
We'll find a new world.

那其中有多少在银河联邦管辖之外的
How many of those are outside federal jurisdiction?

三个
Three.

See? Our cup runneth over.

谁想去购个物
Now, who wants to go shopping

为这个新[哔]世界做准备
For a brand-new mother[bleep] world?!

走起
All right!

瞅瞅这宝贝儿
Look at this baby!

根本看不出这不是地球吧
Would you even know that wasn't earth?

当然看得出 这没有非洲
Yes, because there's no africa.

切 白种人就是事多 Morty
Pssh. White-people problems, Morty.

我们着陆下去看看
Let's go down and check her out.

我以为还远着呢 这就撞上了
Oh. I thought it was further away.

这个 这个估计有点小
I uh...I guess this one's a little small.

那 那就
All right, uh, maybe...

那我们去另外两个看看吧
Maybe we should go check out the other two, huh?

这个挺大的
Okay, this one's bigger.

不错的样子
This looks nice.

老爸老妈 快看
Mom, dad, look!

The whole planet's on a cob!! Go, go, go!!

好吧 至三必成
All right, third time's the charm.

看看这个什么情况
See what we got here.

看着还行
Seems good.

没有长在玉米棒上的东西了
And nothing on the cob.

虽然不知道那还得是必须的 但是
Didn't know that was a necessity, but...

这个挺好 我觉得就是它了
No, it's nice. I think this might be it.

大家看
Wow! Hey, look, you guys.

太阳升起来了
The sun's rising.

老爸 这地方白天有多长
Uh, dad, how long are the days on this planet?

电脑 这星球上白天有多长
Uh, computer, how long are the days on this planet?

42小时
42 hours.

只有这两个选择了
All right, well, those are the two choices.

因为"玉米棒"星不予考虑
'Cause cob planet is off the table.

我们投一下票
Now let's take a vote.

事情已成定局

Interstellar terrorist and fugitive Rick Sanchez,

现在成为了第6048个
Has just become the 6,048th planet

加入银河联邦的星球
To join the galactic federation.

这是个满是水和土的小球
The plucky little ball of water and dirt,

它也因此得名
Which is where it gets its name,

这颗星球被七十亿灵长类生物占据
Is dominated by seven billion primate-descended natives

他们喜欢吃意面 而且向袋鼠祈祷
Who love to eat spaghetti and pray to kangaroos.

意面 还有袋鼠
Spaghetti, kangaroos?

我一定得去看个究竟
I've got to check this place out.

你当然能
Well, you can.

详情请咨询旅游局
Contact the ministry of tourism for details.

下一则新闻 青少年把这个叫做
Up next, teenagers are calling it--

并且不是你想的那样
And it's not what you think.

你干什 你干嘛呢
What are you--what did you do that for?

为了戏剧效果
Dramatic effect.

大家早上好啊
Good morning, family.

我闻到的是培根的味道吗
Oh, do I smell bacon?

是 我们在新澳大利亚海岸
Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig

发现了一种新品种的小型猪
Off the coast of new Australia

- 东边30码左右  - 或者说西边300码
- About 30 yards east. - Or 300 yards west.

我们本应给你弄一点吃
We'd offer you some,

但是一顿早饭就把那猪吃灭绝了
But we hunted it to extinction for breakfast.

我打算走到南极点
Well, I thought I'd walk to the south pole

稍微探索一下
And do a little bit of exploring.

有事的话 喊我就行
If you guys need me, just yell,

或者拿个什么东西使劲扔
Or throw something so hard

绕星球一圈砸我一下
That it goes around the world and hits me.

现在他走了
Okay, now that he's gone,

我们能不能谈谈现在的处境
Can we please talk about our situation?

老爸 我们不能在别人背后议论
Dad, you can't talk about people behind their back.

世界之小 藏不住秘密
You know, it's a small world.

得了吧 他在南极呢
Please, he's in the south pole!

我们真得好好谈谈
And we need to have a serious conversation.

发现南极点
South pole discovered, baby!

哦耶
Ohhhh!

我[哔] 一个冰穴
Oh [bleep], an ice cave?

我[哔] 真是越来越有趣了
[bleep], things just keep on getting better.

这是星球的核心
Wow, it's the planet's core.

我只是说
I'm just saying,

我们表现得好像只有两种选择
We keep acting like there's only two options,

但是不只有两个选项
But there's not.

假设我们回到地球
So, yes, if we went back to earth,

只要Rick还逍遥法外
As long as Rick was out there,

他们就会审讯我们
They'd want to interrogate us.

但是 我只是假设
But, and this is purely hypothetical,

如果我们向政府告发你爸 怎么样
What if we turned your father in to the government?

Jerry 以上帝的名义
Jerry, so help me god,

如果你敢再提这事 培根没你的份
If you ever bring this up again, no more bacon.

本来就没有培根了
There already is no more bacon!

这地方逊毙了
This world sucks!

我们活得逊毙了
Our life sucks!

为什么我们要牺牲这么多
Why are we doing this

就为了一个做事只考虑自己的人
For someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself?

这不是重点 老爹
That's not the point, dad!

我们爱Rick 至少总的来讲是爱他的
We love Rick...F-for the most part.

爱一个人不是为了得到回报
Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, dad,

爱是无条件的
You love them unconditionally.

说得好 宝贝 真为你们骄傲
That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you.

我把情况捋一捋
Okay, so let me get this straight.

在你们下半生里
For the rest of your lives,

不论他伤你多深
No matter how much it hurts you,

不论他把你孩子引入何等的歧途
No matter how much it destroys our children's futures,

无论什么时候 无论Rick想做什么 我们都得照做
We're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?

- 是  - 为什么
- Yes. - Why?!

因为我不想再让他走了 你个混蛋
Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!!

嘿 呃
Hey. Uh...

I was gonna hope over to the gloppydrop system,

弄点冰淇淋
Get some ice cream.

你 你想叫我一起吗
You, you want me to come with?

你不是需要我的脑电波
I mean, don't you need my brain waves

做什么伪装吗
For camouflage or something?

我没事的
I'll be okay.

再见 Morty
Bye, Morty.

Rick
Rick?

你不是要离开吧
You're not leaving, right?

我是要走啊 去弄冰淇淋
Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

你还会回来的吧
So, you're coming back?

Morty 要是你去弄冰淇淋吃
Morty, if you go to where there's a bunch of ice cream

然后就不回来了
And then you don't come back,

那就不是"去弄"冰淇淋了
You haven't actually gotten ice cream,

你只是到冰淇淋在的地方了
You've just gone where ice cream is.

Rick 你要走 我能接受
Rick, I can handle it if you go,

但是老妈会伤心欲绝的
But you'll break mom's heart.

这一点我不会原谅你
And I won't forgive you for that.

那辆车呢 Morty
Where's the van, Morty?

在地平线后面 停在车道上
It's over the horizon in the driveway.

所以我们回地球之后 可不可以平静地生活
So if we come back to earth, can my family have a normal life?

我们只想抓Sanchez 你的家人会没事的

总之 我就是这么从太空监狱里逃出来的
Anyway, that’s how I escaped from space prison!

啊 瘆人的地方
Oh! Scary place.

哇 Rick 真是好一段故事啊
Wow, Rick! That’s -- That’s one -- one heck of a story.

真希望我当时能在场目睹这一切
I sure do wish I could’ve been there to see it happen.

别扯淡了
Oh, come on.

谁会想看一个疯子科学家用自制黑科技武器
Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools

撂倒精兵外星守卫的场面啊
to take out highly trained alien guards

不如一家人在肖尼斯餐厅其乐融融
when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney’s?

爸爸 你能回来真是太好了 不管我们这是在哪儿
Dad, it’s great to have you back, no matter where we are.

但是你难道不想回家吗
But wouldn’t you like to go home?

宝贝儿 要说感情上 肖尼斯就是我的家
Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney’s is my home.

好吧 但是你刚刚从监狱出来
Yeah, but you just got out of prison.

这儿也不比那儿好得了多少
I mean, how much of a step up from that is --

Jerry 从卡座站起来 脱掉全身衣服
Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off,

对折自己十二次
and fold yourself 12 times.

听你的
You got it.

只能对折六次是吧
Six folds, huh?

你们就把我关在一台9000系列析脑仪里吗
W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000?

你们这些贱胚虫子觉得我配不上你们最好的设备吗
You cheap insect tucks didn’t think I was worth your best equipment?

我都跟那些管钱的说了
[Chuckles] Man, I told the money bugs.

我说 "你们都知道他是谁 对吧
I said, “You know who this guy is, right?

若是想要我从银河里最聪明的哺乳动物那儿套情报
You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal

你们最好给我配台先进的析脑仪"
in the galaxy, you’d better give me a decent brainalyzer.”

你是不是也点几个煎饼
Well, you might as well order some pancakes,

我反正是不急离开我脑里现在这个场景
because I don’t see the need to leave this part of my brain.

怎么不急呢
Oh, I think you do.

毕竟要么是你放松你的小脑
Eventually, you’re either gonna relax your cerebellum...

- 放松我的肖尼斯 - 要么9000把你的脑子融掉
- Shoney’s. - or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.

够放松了吗
-[ Farts] -Relaxed enough? [Chuckles]

我欣赏你 Rick

进展怎么样
What’s going on?

尚不明朗 他好像臆想出了某种屁股
It’s hard to tell.He may have manifested some sort of butt.

他还有这本事
He can do that?

他可是宇宙里最聪明的人
He is the smartest man in the universe.

我跟你们讲 银河联邦接管地球
I tell you, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth --

Everyone just gets paid in pills.

等你自己靠不知道干什么挣钱了
Well, when you’re not sure what you do for a living,

-[ Glass shatters] -I’ll get that in a moment.How are everyone’s pills?

噢 Morty 你都没怎么吃你的药丸啊

午餐药丸吃的有点儿多 而且我
I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I...

再也不想吃药丸了
wasn’t gonna eat any more pills.

我谢你啊 Conroy
Thank you, Conroy.

你会宠坏我们的 Conroy
You spoil us, Conroy.

这要是外公绝对忍不了
Grandpa Rick wouldn’t put up with this!

别提他的名字 他抛弃了我们
STop saying his name. He abandoned us.

原来是Willem Dafoe!
Willem Dafoe!

我 我今早想不起名字的就是这个人
T-That’s the guy I couldn’t think of this morning.

别重蹈我的覆辙 Summer
Don’t make my mistake, Summer.

别神化弃你而去的人
Don’t deify the people that leave you.

你的下场就是个马外科医生 活在外星人统治的世界
You’ll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens

而外星药物会让马儿们 永葆健康
whose medicine keeps horses... healthy forever.

现在马比王八命还长
Horses live longer than tortoises now!

你想要沦落于此吗
Is that what you want for yourself?

也许我要的只是在我大叫着跑掉的时候你还会在乎
Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!

谁要来些药丸布蕾
Who saved room for pill brülée?

我能理解你为什么选了这间家庭餐厅
I can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant

来显现你的小脑
to represent your cerebellum.

给人安全感 又舒适温馨 很有肖尼斯的感觉
So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney’s.

但是承认吧 Rick 一直待在这儿你会疯掉的
But admit it, Rick -- You’re going crazy cooped up in here.

我们去别的记忆里头逛逛吧
Let’s go visit some memories.

哦 想看特定的哪一个吗
Oh, any particular ones?

你想看我第一次勃起吗
You want to see my first boner

还是要直接去看
or should we go straight to the moment

我发现次元穿越方法的那一刻
I discovered interdimensional travel?

你那下垂的两根在抽呢
Ooh. Your little flappy doodles are twitching.

这是性奋了
Does that mean you’re aroused,

还是你收到信号 有同伴找到了一串葡萄
or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?

是兴奋
It’s arousal.

是的 我很乐意去看看
Yes, I’d like very much to visit the memory

你发明传送门枪的那段记忆
of you inventing your portal gun.

你给我的山芋很烫手啊
-Yeah. Well, tough titties. -[ Rumbling, glass breaking ]

有比神经崩溃更烫手的山芋吗 Rick
There’s no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick.

好吧 那就要看是什么先崩溃了 我 还是 山芋
Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.

这是某个你记忆里特别的人吗
Someone special you remember?

你对她的记忆就放在这儿吗
Is that your memory of her out there --

排在911惊魂未定和最爱的体育糗事之间
between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?

如果我们呆在这儿 你会死的 同所有的记忆一起死去
If we stay here, you’ll die, along with all your memories.

如果你带我去我想去的地方
If you take me where I want to go,

她也会在那儿 对吗
she’ll be there, too, won’t she?

我发明传送门枪的那天就是我失去她的那天
The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.

听起来不错啊
Oh, that sounds cool.

我能弄到我想要的 你也能道个别
I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.

好吧 但是我来开车
[Sighs] Fine, but I’m driving.

作为剥去我们自由的借口
.as an excuse to strip away our freedom.

你这是 你这是在干嘛
Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?

外公肯定有秘密实验室 对吧
Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right?

藏着镭射枪 喷气背包 还有太空坦克
With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank!

然后我们可以去劫他出狱
And we can go break him out of prison!

你看这些死苍蝇
Look at these dead flies!

说不定按照一定的顺序排列
Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order,

就会放一段全息图 或者打开一扇暗门
it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.

Summer 你吓着我了
Summer, you’re freaking me out!

我知道世界变了样 也知道你想念Rick了
I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick,

但是把他弄回来也不会有所好转
but getting him back wouldn’t make things better.

而且 我们过得也不算糟糕
And, you know, we’re not doing so bad.

过得糟糕透了 Morty
We’re miserable, Morty!

不仅强制宵禁 按他们奇怪的历法算起来我有47岁
There’s a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47,

埃菲尔铁塔被变成了武器
and they weapon ized the Eiffel Tower!

我觉得35岁挺好 我 我现在都可以租车了
I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.

因为你就是个烂人
Because you suck!

外公被捕之后你就一言不发
You’ve been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested,

甩掉了他你其实爽得不行
but the fact is,you’re freaking stoked to bail on him.

是他甩掉了所有人
He bails on everybody!

他甩掉了当时还是个小孩的妈妈
He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!

他甩掉了小小星球
He -- He bailed on tiny planet!

如果我以前没说清楚 Summer
And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer,

他也甩掉了你
he bailed on you.

他把你撇在一个被他毁了的世界里自生自灭
He left you to rot in a world that he ruined

因为他不在乎
because he doesn’t care!

因为他不在乎任何人 Summer
Because nobody’s special to him, Summer,

连他自己也不在乎
not even himself.

所以你要是真想找回你的外公 拿把铁锹
So if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel.

不会让你失望的那个外公 就埋在你家后院里
The one that won’t let you down is buried in your backyard!

你说对了
You’re right!

什么 不是 我才没说对
What?! No! I’m not right!

说气话激你而已
I-I was using ghoulish overkill!

都是气话 Summer
Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

天呐 天呐
Oh, God! Oh, God!

我们这是去哪儿
Where are we going?

去所有一切开始的那天 也是终结的那天
To the day it all began and ended.

所有事情转折的那一刻
The moment that changed everything.

欢迎来到麦当劳 请问您想点些什么
MAN: Welcome to McDonald’s. Can I take your order?

我要十块麦乐鸡 多给点川香酱
Yeah, I’d like to get a 10-piece McNugget and, uh, a bunch of the Szechuan sauce.

能给多少酱就给多少酱
Like, as much as you’re allowed to give me.

在1998年 麦当劳给迪士尼电影<花木兰>做宣传
In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film “Mulan,”

当时他们 当时他们
where they -- where they --

他们给麦乐鸡配制了一种新的蘸酱
they created a new sauce for the McNuggets

叫做川香酱 超级好吃
called Szechuan sauce, and it’s delicious!

后来他们就取消了 现在都没了
And then they got rid of it, and now it’s gone.

只有在记忆里能让我们尝到了
The only place we’re gonna be able to try it is in my memory.

Rick 你做这件事的同时你的大脑在融化
Rick, you’re doing this bit while your brain is melting.

好吧 好的 好的
Okay. All right, all right.

- 那个是 - 我
Is that...Me.

我以前穿蓝色裤子
I used to wear blue pants.

你什么时候实现跨次元旅行的
When’d you make the leap to interdimensional travel?

我没有 是我做的
I didn’t. I did.

哦 哦 哦 这不是我们嘛
Well, well, well. If it isn’t us.

你知道发明传送技术最糟糕的一点是什么吗
You know the worst part about inventing teleportation?

突然间 你能够穿梭于整个银河
Suddenly you’re able to travel the whole galaxy,

然后你发现的第一件事情就是
and the first thing you learn is

你是最后一个发明了传输技术的人
you’re the last guy to invent teleportation.

幸运的是 你将发明一件更加厉害的东西
Fortunately, you’re about to invent something much more powerful.

什么
What?

Summer 这事儿没必要让别人知道
Summer, nobody has to know about that.

我们可以把它放回去 然后假装从来没看见过
We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it,

就像我们也没见过老爸的塑料假人大腿一样
like we did with Dad’s mannequin leg.

好吧 你留在这儿 我自己去救外公
Fine. Stay here. I’ll rescue Grandpa myself.

- 你要怎么做 - 我还不知道
-How are you gonna do that?! -l don’t know yet.

船到桥头自然直 外公不就是这样吗
I’ll make it up as I go. That’s what Grandpa Rick does.

英雄不就是这样吗
That’s what heroes do.

你 你想要看Rick是什么样的英雄吗
You want to see what a hero Rick is?

我 我带你去个地方 Summer
I-Ill bring you somewhere, Summer!

- 嗯 - 我的天呐 孩子们
-Urn... -My goodness, children.

放下那个非法科技
[Sternly] Relinquish the illegal technology

交给最近的联邦议员
to the nearest Federation representative.

然后我们来玩"胡言乱语"猜谜游戏
[Normal voice ] And then we’ll all play Balderdash.

哦 我的天呐
[Grunts] Oh, my goodness!Oh! Oh! My goo-

哦 我的天呀
Oh, my God.

我有一件一模一样的上衣
I have that exact same Top.

这是哪里
What is this place?

还有这个<饥饿游戏>版的Summer是怎么回事
And what’s with “Hunger Games” Summer?

这是我的姐姐 这里原来是我的家
That’s my sister. This used to be my home.

想想看 任何事情你都能做到
Imagine doing anything you want,

跳到一个你从未到过的时间线
then hopping to a timeline where you never did it.

去任何地点 任何时间 没人能拦住你
Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to sTop you.

听起来挺孤单的
Sounds lonely.

孤单 老兄 你有你自己
Lonely?Dude, you have yourself --

无数个你自己
your infinite selves.

一场永不散场的聚会
It’s a nonsTop party

所有的来宾都是我们唯一喜欢的那个人
where all the guests are the only person we like.

你认为做地球上最聪明的人是一件很酷的事情
You think it’s cool being the smartest man on Earth,

但是一旦我们给你这项技术
but once we give you this technology,

你就变成每个可构想的世界里最聪明的人了
you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe --

无限的Rick 一个神
the Infinite Rick, a god.

算了吧
Enh, pass.

什么 老兄 Rick们不会就这样算了的
Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don’t pass on this.

你认为你是谁
Who do you think you are?

—个不一样的Rick 我猜
A different kind of Rick, I guess.

好吧 我们来看看这能持续多久
Well, we’ll see how long that lasts.

我听到了挺科幻的声音
I heard sci-fi noises.

你有了进展吗
Did you make a breakthrough?

有点吧
Sort of.

我仔细地看了看自己
I just took a long look at myself,

我想科学这条路或许走不通
and I don’t think this science thing is gonna pay off.

好吧 为什么不带上Beth 然后一起出去吃冰淇淋呢
Well, why don’t I get Beth and we’ll go out for ice cream?

Dianne 那是在这间车库里面
That, Diane, is the last great idea

会诞生的最后一个好主意了
that will ever be had in this garage.

这柯南伯格怪烤得挺好的
Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume.

妈妈 你看起来 很野性
Mom, you’re looking...feral.

不敢相信Rick居然做了这种事情
I can’t believe Rick did this.

Rick的冒险里的这一部分
These are the parts of Rick’s adventures

就是你见不到的 他抛下不管的那部分
you don’t get to see -- the parts he leaves behind.

好吧 谢谢款待
All right. IVs been great, guys.

我就是来跑一趟 实地展示下"我就跟你说吧"
Urn, I really only wanted to sTop by here for a quick “I told you so.”

- 所以 嗯 - 在找这个吗
-So, uh... -Looking for this?

你拿着这个要干嘛
What are you doing with that?!

它有Rick的臭味
It stinks of Rick.

不 为什么 为什么你要这么做
[ Grunts] -No! Why?!Why would you do that?!

你 你 你们这些人有什么毛病
W-What is the matter with you people?!

你们这帮野蛮人 原始的野蛮傻逼
You’re a bunch of back savages --backwood savage morons!

你永远不能离开 她不能留下
You can never leave. She cannot remain.

她有Rick的臭味
She stinks of Rick.

别开枪 别开枪
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

我是Morty C-137
I’m Morty 0-137.

我们探测到一个被毁坏的传输枪 你的Rick哪去了
We detected a compromised portal gun.Where is your Rick?

- 他被捕了 - Summer
-He’s in prison. - Summer.

他被银河联邦抓住了
He got captured by the Federation,

我们打算去救他
and we were going to rescue him.

真是令人烦恼 我们不能让大本营的秘密
Very troubling.We can’t risk Citadel secrets

犯险落入银河联邦的手中
falling into the Federation’s hands.

我们马上派Rick海豹突击队
We’ll dispatch S.E.A.L. Team Ricks immediately

闯入关押C-137的监狱
to break into the prison holding 0-137...

- 超帅 - 然后刺杀他
Boo-yah....and assassinate him.

超衰
Boo-nah?

来吧 姑娘们 冰淇淋要化掉了
-[ Horn honks] -Come on, girls!The ice cream’s gonna melt!

不
N o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

哇哦 这酱真他妈好吃
Wow. This sauce is tucking amazing.

是为了宣传一部电影是吗
You said it was promoting a movie?

把3移项 再加2
Carry the 3, add a 2.

成了 他妈的成了
I got it.I tucking got it!

哇哦 就 就是这个吗 传送枪
Whoa. I-Is that it -- the portal gun?

是的 就是那三行公式
Yeah.That’s the three lines of math

分隔了我的人生
that separates my life as a man

一边是生活中的人 一边是无知无觉的鬼魂
from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

棒棒的
Awesome possum.

控制中心 你们拿到这个了吗
Mission Control, you getting this?

天呐 是的 是的 我们拿到了 是的
Holy shit, yes!Yes! We got it!

谢谢 Rick 我会试着记住关掉析脑仪的
Yeah! All right! Thanks, Rick.I’ll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer.

其实 我想它会自动关闭的
Actually, I think it shuts off automatically

等你的大脑液化以后
once your brain is liquid.

我不知道 也不在乎
Don’t know, don’t care.

让我出去
Pull me out.

嗨 让我出去 你们能听到吗
Hey, pull me out. Can you hear me?

- 不 他们不能 - 为什么不能
- Nope, they cannot.-Why not?

因为你刚刚上传的代码
Because the code you uploaded

实际上并不是我的传送门枪公式
wasn’t actually my portal-gun formula.

它是一个能让我完全控制析脑仪的病毒
It was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.

你在说什么 这是一段记忆
What are you talking about? This is a memory.

你 你不能更改记忆中的细节
Y-You can’t alter details of a memory.

是的 但是你可以改变任何东西
True, but you can alter anything you want

在一个完全伪造的原创故事里
about a totally fabricated origin story.

这是一个圈套 计划中止 我还在他的肖尼斯餐馆里
It's a trap! Abort! I’m still in his Shoney’s!

重复一遍 我们从来没有离开他的肖尼斯餐馆
Repeat -- We never left his Shoney’s!

计划完成 小伙子们 让我出去
Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.

收到
Roger that.

好了 在我的大脑的剩余部分中尽情享受吧
Have fun in what’s left of my brain.

我将转去你的大脑中
I’m gonna transfer to yours.

哦 没有足够空间容纳我的聪明才智
Oh, there’s not enough room for all my genius,

所以我给你留着我对柳条家具的恐惧
so I’m leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture,

对吹奏喇叭的渴望
my desire to play the trumpet,

买顶帽子的暂定计划
my tentative plans to purchase a hat,

还有六年的喜剧即兴表演研讨班
and six years of improv workshops.

喜剧成三(喜剧创作的准则)
-Comedy comes in threes.

这是一个圈套 计划中止 我们从来没有离开他的
It's a trap!Abort! We never left his -- -[ Farts]

不
No!

照以前一样
Another day, another dollar.

我是伟大的昆虫生物 不然呢
Am I a great insect creature or what?!

祝贺你 特工
Congratulations, Agent.

你会因此大受赞扬的
You’ll be highly commended for this.

时刻等待着获许拥有成就感
Always wait for permission to [burps]feel accomplishment .

- 我的座右铭 - 我还有一件事想不通
-- That’s my motto.- One thing still perplexes me --

为什么Rick Sanchez会来自首
Why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in?

这个嘛 我只是个蠢虫子 但是Rick有可能早就知道
Well, I’m just a dumb-ass bug, but it’s possible Rick knew

他会被用这个装置审问
he’d be interrogated at this facility,

而这个装置不仅有我们最想要的信息
where we not only keep our most wanted,

还保存着我们最敏感的数据
but our most sensitive data.

这里任何拥有九级授权的人就可以
Anyone here with level-9 access could [burps]

说不准 瓦解一个政府
I don’t know. Collapse the government.

我要去拉屎
I’m just gonna go take a dump.

介意我用一下九级的洗手间吗
Is it cool if I use the Ievel-9 bathrooms?

九级核心授权密码是多少来着
W-What’s the Ievel-9 master access code again?

哦 简单 8 3
Oh, that’s easy -- 8-3 --

耶
Oh, yeah!

这里是Rick海豹突击队
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks in the house!

你好 Rick
Hi, Rick.

再见 Rick
Bye, Rick.

D-99 你还好吗
D-99, y-you okay?

真扫兴 我还没来得及试用下虫屌呢
I’m bummed I didn’t get to give that insect dick a test drive.

等等 等等 等等 等等 我们是受Rick委员会指示
Wait, wait, wait, wait! T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

我们手里有你的Morty和Summer
We have your Morty and Summer.

他们作为俘虏关押在大本营
They’re prisoners on the Citadel.

很好
-Great. -[ Grunts]

6755号房间发生安保事故
-Security breach in room 6755. -[ Alarm blaring ]

这下好了 不但我的计划被搞砸了
Lovely.

关于即兴表演的记忆也全没了
Not only is my plan screwed up, I also forgot how to improvise.

所有安保人员立即前往
-All security people approach. -[ Grunts]

安保事故
Security breach.

这是一座全是外公的城市吗
A city of Grandpas?

这是Rick的大本营
It's the Citadel of Ricks.

所有来自不同时空的不同Rick
All the different Ricks from all the different realities

一起聚在这里躲避政府
got together to hide here from the government.

但是如果政府每个Rick都痛恨政府
But if every Rick hates the government,

为什么他们还会恨我们的外公
why would they hate Grandpa?

因为Rick最痛恨的是他们自己
Because Ricks hate themselves the most.

而我们的Rick最是他自己
And our Rick is the most... himself.

已经不是了 小屁孩
Not anymore, homey.

Rick海豹突击队把他的一字眉
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks turned his unibrow

分成了两根眉毛 用子弹分的
into two brows -- with a bullet.

你们的Rick死了 你们的Rick死了
Your Rick’s dead! Your Rick’s dead!

长官 Rick D-99 正单独返回
Sir, Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone.

很显然 Rick海豹突击队损失惨重
Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties.

让他进来
Bring him in.

他说他只愿意与一名更高级别的Rick通话
He says he’ll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance.

真矫情 把那玩意儿给我
La-d i-da. Give me that.

D-99 我是大本营自卫队的总司令
D-99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel’s militia.

够好了
Go-- [Burps] Good enough.

他是个间谍 炸了他 我要去拉屎
He’s a spy. Blow him up. I’m gonna go take a shit.

操作一支未注册的传送枪
Operating an unregistered portal gun,

将一名Summer转变为激进分子
radicalizing a Summer,

并且与一个叛徒Rick合谋
conspiring with a traitorous Rick.

对此你如何辩护
How do you plead?

这怎么算得上是个公平的审判啊
How is this a fair trial?

我们的辩护律师是个Morty
0-Our lawyer is a Morty!

这不公平 你们没有权利 他也不是个律师
It’s not fair, you have no rights, and he’s not a lawyer.

我们让他待在这里是因为他很逗
We just keep him here because he’s fun.

瞧他那傻样
Look at him go. [ Laughs]

哈哈 耶
[ Laughs I Yeah!

如果你与你的Rick断绝关系我们就从宽办案
We’ll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.

你怎么说 Summer
What say you, Summer?

滚你丫的
I say fuck you!

外公是我的英雄
My grandpa was my hero.

你们杀了他是因为你们都嫉妒他
You killed him because you were jealous of him.

这点从发型就明显看得出
That’s pretty obvious from the haircuts.

所以你们把我怎么样都行 但是要放我弟弟走
So do what you want to me, but let my brother go.

他已经跟Rick断绝关系了
He already renounced Rick.

Morty
Morty?

什么
-[ Whispers indistinctly] -What?

不 我才不要看你的游戏币收藏
N-No, I don’t want to see your pog collection.

我没有与Rick断绝关系 我从来都没有
I don’t renounce Rick, and I never have.

我只是想保护我的姐姐
I was just trying to protect my sister.

我想让你有正常的生活
I wanted you to have a normal life.

这是每次Rick出现时你就无法拥有的生活
That’s something you can’t have when Rick shows up.

所有真实的都变得虚假 所有正确的都变成错误
Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong.

你只知道你一无所知而他无所不知
All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything.

他虽然不是坏蛋 Summer
And, well -- well, he’s not a villain, Summer,

但是他也不应该成为你的英雄
but he shouldn’t be your hero.

他更像是个魔鬼或者是个一塌糊涂的上帝
He’s more like a demon or a super fucked-up god.

别他妈这么深情地缅怀他
Let’s not suck the ghost of his dick too hard.

他是个恐怖分子 现在他死了
He was a terrorist, and now he’s dead.

是吗 你以为我的Rick死了 其实他还活着
Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick’s dead, he’s alive!

你们要是觉得你们安全了 就等着他给你好看吧
And if you think you’re safe, he’s coming for you!

嘿 喔 喔 你来这里干什么
Hey! Whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here?

这个区域只需要几个按钮和表盘
This area is for teleporting the entire Citadel

就可以把整个大本营传送到别处
to somewhere else using only buttons and dials.

那一开始设计成这样
Yeah? Well, it’s a bad idea

就很不明智了对不对
to have it designed that way then, isn’t it?

这他妈是怎么搞的
-[ Screaming] -What the tuck?

我们被传送到了银河联邦监狱
We just teleported into a Galactic tederal prison!

我要去拉屎
-I’m gonna go take a shit. -[ Alarm blaring ]

法庭内请保持秩序
Order in the court!

喔 这是怎么回事 我的天哪
Whoa! What the hell?!Oh, my God!

等等 等等 等等 等等 不 不 不
Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

喔
Whoa!

大本营被传送到了联邦的地盘
The Citadel has been teleported to [burps] Federation space.

完蛋了 这一定是C-137干的
It’s doomed. This has to be C-137, you guys.

- 我们该怎么办 - 他要找我们算账了
-What are we gonna do?! -You know he’s coming for us.

行了 都冷静 我们可以把他的Summer当做人质
All right! Calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage.

很显然 我抓住她了
Obviously, I get her.

你们用"瑞克 激光 剪刀"决定谁抓住Morty
You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.

你这是出的什么
W-What the hell is that?

报复
Payback.

外公
Grandpa Rick!

- 还用说吗 - 你还活着
-Duh. -You’re alive!

- Rick - Morty 拿着这个 待会儿用得上
-Rick! -Morty, take this.You’re gonna need it later.

等等 等等 喔
Hold on. Hold on. Whoa!

够了 Rick
COUNCIL MEMBER: That’s enough, Rick.

你这是想干什么
What -- What’s this supposed to accomplish?

我们的外孙多得用不完
We have infinite grandkids.

你这好比是想在凯撒宫酒店里花掉迪士尼代币
You’re trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesars Palace here.

他在唬你 他很爱我的
[Gasps ] That’s a bluff. He’s bluffing, sir. He loves me.

你不按套路出牌 不理性又感情用事
You’re a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate.

你爱你的外孙 你来这儿就是要救他们
You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.

我是来杀你的 哥们
I came to kill you, bro.

这都不是我原装的Summer
That’s not even my original Summer.

妈呀 他不是在唬人
Oh, my God. He’s not bluffing. He’s not bluffing!

- Rick - 干嘛不直接射穿她
-R-Rick? -Why not shoot through her?

20码的距离 9口径脉冲手枪
Twenty yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol.

我的第一枪会液化她的内脏 但只能打伤你
My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you,

第二枪后坐力会增加
second shot adds recoil.

如果我等你枪毙她 我的风险就会降到最低
The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her,

我就希望你这么做
which I’m encouraging you to do.

- 搞什么啊 - 或者放了她
-What the fuck?! -Or let her go,

这样我就可以让你死得痛快些
which I will reward with a quicker death.

因为你爱她
Because you love her!

这样你才能让我给你最利索的一枪
Because it’s incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot,

死得不那么痛苦
which will be your least painful death.

但如果你想要死得慢些 我也很有兴趣陪你玩
But if you want to die slower than that, I’m super into it.

你想这么做的话你只需要杀了那个女孩
All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.

- 我恨你 - 我才不在乎 亲爱的
-I hate you! -Not an issue, sweetie.

够了 把枪放下 Rick
That’s enough! Drop the gun, Rick!

Morty 我知道你太蠢了 不懂我在干嘛
Morty, I know you’re too stupid to get this,

但是你现在真他妈是在捣乱
but you’re really fucking this up right now.

我不能让你害死我姐姐 把枪放下
I’m not letting you let my sister die!Drop the gun!

我才没想让她死 你这傻逼
I wasn’t gonna let her die, you fucking moron!

- 哈 - 噢
-Ha! -Aww.

关键是让他以为我打算这么做
The point is he thought I was going to.

顺便说一句 我确实被你骗到了
I totally did, by the way.

你真傻逼 Morty
You’re a fucking moron, Morty.

Morty 你这智障
Morty, you fucking idiot!

你真他妈的是个智障 Morty
You’re a serious fucking idiot, Morty!

你这等于是害死了我们所有人
You basically killed us all!

- 你太烂了 - 你傻得和一袋沙子没啥区别
-You’re the worst! -You’re dumb as a bag of sand!

看现在到底是谁傻
Who’s stupid now, bitch?!

Morty 他才刚回到我们身边
Morty! We just got him back!

干得漂亮啊 Morty
[Laughs I That was amazing, Morty.

我的天啊 你可真棒
Oh, my God. Wow.

好吧 现在我们来做个了结
Okay. Let’s wrap this --

干得好 Morty 我们走吧 孩子们
Good job, Morty. Let’s go, kids.

啥 刚才是怎么回事
What?! What happened?

不过是我的老把戏罢了
Oldest Rick trick in the book.

"枪是假的 僵持时朝我开枪"
“Fake gun. Shoot me in standoff.”

- 太机智啦 - 哈 没错
—Brilliant! -Ha! Yeah.

幸好我看见字条了
G-Good thing I saw that note.

我们就不能直接传送回家吗
Couldn’t we just portal home?

等我收拾好我搞出来的烂摊子再说
Not until I finish what I started.

这就是不用密码就能获得九级权限的办法
And that is how you get Ievel-9 access without a password.

别动
Freeze!

大家请看 月度最佳员工
Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.

所以你到底要用九级权限做什么
So what are you doing with level-9 access anyways?

- 毁掉银河联邦啊 - 棒极了 - 哇 太酷了
- Destroying the [burps] Galactic government.-Awesome! -Whoa! Cool!

你是要让他们用核武器自相残杀吗
Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?

啊 还可以重新设定他们军队的传送门
Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals

来毁掉他们所有的太空舰队
to disintegrate their entire space fleet?

好主意 孩子们 快要为你们骄傲了
Good pitches, kids. I’m almost proud.

不过你们看仔细点 外公马上要摧毁一个帝国了
But watch closely as Grandpa Topples an empire

只要把这个1改成0
by changing a one...to a zero.

总统先生 咱们货币刚刚跌到一文不值了
Mr. President, the Blemflarck’s value just dropped to nothing.

什么意思
What do you mean?

我是说 银河联邦的唯一货币
I mean our single centralized Galactic currency

刚刚还一块钱值一块钱 现在一块钱的价值是零
just went from being worth one of itself to zero of itself.

冷静点 同志们
-Dear God, no. -Calm down, people.

启用银河联邦自卫队 颁布戒严令
Deploy the Galactic militia and declare martial law.

长官 遵命
Yes, sir.

不过 我们用什么付他们工资啊
Uh, what should I pay them with?

为国家效劳的荣耀就是他们的报酬
Their payment is the honor they’ll feel to serve their --

等等 我凭啥对他大喊大叫 谁付我钱啊
Wait. Who’s paying me to yell at this guy?

我能回答 如果给我钱的话
I can answer that -- for money.

我从没想到我还能看到这么一幕
I never thought I’d live to see this day.

同志们 同志们 别吵了
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

其实还有个你们没想到的方法
There’s a solution here you’re not seeing.

- 把你的夹克给我 - 快把裤子扒下来给我
-Give me your jacket! -Give me those pants!

现在没有贫富之分了
Insectoid Employee: There's no rich people or poor people!

我想要更多夹克
I want more jackets!

得最多裤子者得天下
He who controls the pants controls the galaxy!

决不给虫子再次统治地表世界的机会
No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!

Jerry 到底发生什么了啊
Jerry, what the hell is happening?!

银河联邦垮台了
The Galactic government collapsed.

你还好吗
Are you okay?

听着 虽然说出来并不光彩 但是
Look.I’m not proud to share this, but the truth is,

我刚才一路爬回来的 这招真管用
I just kept crawling, and it kept working.

你没事就太好了
-[ Exhales deeply] -Oh, I’m glad you’re okay.

我们一直纵容你爸爸 是不是就要一直为此付出代价
Are we ever going to sTop paying for indulging your father?

我们已经失去了孩子 地球 和工作
Our children, our planet, our jobs.

现在我们还拥有什么呢
Is there anything left to lose?

只剩彼此了 而且我永远不会离开你的
Just each other, and I’ll never let you go.

对不起我做了这些事
And I’m so sorry I ever did this to us.

猜猜是谁把政府搞垮了
Guess who dismantled the government.

- 求求你别再离开我了 - 再也不会了 宝贝
-Please don’t leave me again. -l never will, baby.

我是对的 他是故意自首的
I was right! He turned himself in on purpose!

都在他的计划之中
It was all part of his plan!

Jerry 还有淡啤酒吗
Jerry, is there any light beer left?

你根本想不到你在监狱里会想念什么
It’s insane what you miss in prison.

好吧 没有
Urn, okay. No.

不 不 没有 很明确地告诉你
No, no, no. Foot-down tirne.

好吧 你是对的 有伏特加吗
No. You’re right. Where’s the vodka?

Beth你来选吧 有他没我 有我没他
Beth, it’s him or me!

看起来你们需要单独谈谈
Seems like you guys need some privacy.

我 我还是去车库吧
Ill, uh, I’ll be in the garage.

搞什么啊 Jerry
What the fuck?! Not cool, Jerry!

车库是男人的城堡
A man’s garage is his castle.

Jerry会花一些时间回归单身了
Jerry’s going to spend some time.. .divorced.

噢 那太遗憾了 宝贝
Oh. Oh, I-I’m sorry to hear that, sweetie.

这个决定不是因为我吧
I hope I had nothing to do with that.

哦 天啊 爸爸 别想太多 和你没什么关系
Oh, God. Dad, that is not your burden to bear.

我感觉很内疚 把你想得这么坏
I feel terrible that I misjudged you.

这样对Jerry也好
This is gonna be good for Jerry.

- 对所有人都好 - 对所有人都好
-For everybody. -For everybody.

我最好去看看他
-[ Celiphone whooshes] -I better tend to Jerry

以免他改变主意 不想搬出去了
before he changes his mind and doesn’t move out.

就不打扰你们两个的小冒险了
I will leave you two to your adventures.

老天爷
Oh, my God.

Nancy说他们正在学校操场里对那些外星人用刑
Nancy says they’re drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard,

而且这算是爱国行为
and it technically counts as patriotism.

天啊 我的父母真的要离婚吗
Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced?

好吧 Rick 我要去
All right, Rick. I’m gonna go to my -- Gah!

哪也别去 Morty 你听见你妈妈说的了
Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom.

我们还要去一起冒险呢 Morty 就你和我
We’ve got adventures to go on, Morty, just you and me.

有时带上你姐姐 或者你妈妈
And sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom,

但绝不带你爸爸
but never your dad.

你想知道原因吗 Morty 因为他惹恼我了
You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.

等会儿 Rick 这有点黑暗
Okay. Take it easy, Rick. T-That's dark.

噢 还会更黑暗的 Morty
Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

欢迎来到冒险中最黑暗的时刻
Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures.

- 第一个改变 你爸爸出局了 - 哦 天啊
- First thing that’s different ---no more Dad, Morty. -Oh, geez.

他威胁说要把我交给政府
He threatened to turn me in to the government,

所以我设计让他和政府都滚蛋了
so I made him and the government go away.

什么
Oh, fuck.

政府还有他现在都被我取代了
I’ve rep[burps]Iaced them both as the de facto patriarch

现在你家和这个宇宙都是我做主
of your family and your universe.

- 如果我不带着你和你姐姐回家 - 哦天
Your mom wouldn’t have accepted me

你妈妈就不会接受我
if I came home without you and your sister,

- 所以你现在知道我救你们的真正原因了 - 噢
so now you know the real reason I rescued you.

我刚刚掌控了整个家 Morty
I just took over the family, Morty,

如果你向你妈妈或者你姐姐告密
and if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this,

我绝不承认 他们会相信我 因为我是英雄 Morty
I’ll deny it, and they’ll take my side,because I’m a hero, Morty.

现在你不得不乖乖按我说的做了 Morty 永远
Now you’re gonna have to go and do whatever I say, Morty,Forever!

现在我要出去 再找点那个
And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that

为了<花木兰>电影推出的川香酱了 Morty
“Mulan” Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty.

你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

因为一切都是为了川香酱 Morty
Because that’s --that’s what this is all about, Morty!

- 川香 - 那才是一切背后的动力
-Szechuan? -That’s my one-armed man!

我并不是为了给死去的妻女复仇 Morty
I’m not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty!

这是假的
That was fake!

一切都是为了麦乐鸡的蘸酱
I-I’m driven by finding that McNugget sauce.

- 麦乐鸡 - 我要吃那个<花木兰>的麦乐鸡蘸酱 Morty
I want that “Mulan” McNugget sauce, Morty!

- 这才是串起一切的主线 Morty - 你在胡说什么
-That’s my series arc, Morty! -What the hell?

如果这个要拍九季 我一定要找到这个麦乐鸡蘸酱
If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce --

- 川香酱 Morty - 你到底在胡言乱语些什么
-Szechuan sauce, Morty. -What are you talking about?

这个蘸酱会一路让我们走到最后
That’s what’s gonna take us

- Morty - 你在说什么啊
-all the way to the end, Morty. -What are you talking about?!

还有九季 Morty
Nine more seasons, Morty.

还要九季 直到我找到川香酱
Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.

- 那是什么啊 - 也就是还要97年 Morty
-What is that?! -For 97 more years, Morty!

你在说什么啊到底
What are you talking about?!

我说我要那个麦乐鸡的蘸酱 Morty
I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!

准备好了吗
Is it ready?

是的 现在就可以让它上线
Yes. We can bring it online now.

来吧
Do it.

我是凤凰人
I am Phoenix Person.

凤凰人 这是我们决定好的名字吗
Phoenix Person? Is that what we settled on?

我还以为我们说好的是赛博鸟
I thought we all agreed on Cyber Bird.

你说你不在意他叫什么名字的
Y-You said you didn’t care what he was called

只要我们把他救回来就行
as long as we brought him back.

我是这么说的 但是凤凰人也太不像话了吧
Yeah, but Phoenix Person?

好吧 随他去吧 随便了
Fine. Fuck it. Who cares?

起飞
Ka-kaw!

S03E02

Summer 下次我们躲在克罗基恩回音巢时
Summer, next time we’re hiding in a Colorkian echo nest,

你能行行好把手机铃声关掉吗
can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?

这首歌有名字叫"活在当下" Morty
It’s called “carpe diem,” Morty.

- 自己去搜搜吧 - 你才去搜搜呢
-Look it up. -You look it up!

你 你自己都 你自己都不懂这个词什么意思
Y-Y-You don’t even -- You don’t even know what it means!

因为废物才会去查这查那
That’s because losers look stuff up

而我们其他人都活在当下
while the rest of us are carpin’ all them diems.

好好听你姐姐说的 Morty
Listen to your sister, Morty.

生活就是要敢于冒险
To live is to risk it all.

否则你就称不上生命 只是一团
0therwis e, you’re just an inert chunk

随机排布的分子
of randomly assembled molecules

在宇宙之中随波逐流
drifting wherever the universe blows you.

啊 不好意思 Jerry 没看着你在这儿
Oh, I’m sorry. Jerry, I didn’t see you there.

刚刚说的你听见了多少
H-How much of that did you hear?

全听见了 你刚明明盯着我说的
All of it. You were looking right at me.

我就是想过来和孩子们道个别
[Sighs ji just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.

很好 待在车道上就好
Cool. Just stay in the driveway.

灭杀机器人激活了 我把你从白名单里撤掉了
The kilibots are live, and I took you off the white list.

我们每隔一个周末都还是会再见的 对吧
W-Weil see you every other weekend, though, right?

肯定会的 Morty
Absolutely, Morty.

而且你妈妈的律师说
A-And your Mom’s lawyer says

如果判决中我得到足够的损害赔偿
if I can get enough in the settlement,

他可以帮我打官司争取单独监护权
he can help me sue for full custody.

那也蛮好的
Th-That’ll be nice.

- 呃 Summer 爸爸要走了 - 拜拜 爸
-Uh, Summer, Dad’s leaving. -Bye, Dad.

Rick 你是不是说过要我帮忙
Rick, didn’t you say you needed my help

马上去别的什么地方探险来着
on an adventure immediately somewhere else --

哪都无所谓 要人命也无所谓
I don’t care -- even if it might kill us?

我没说 但你们要真这么不对付
I did not, but if you’re really that alienated,

我也愿意利用下这个机会 也就随便什么人 教会 军队
I’m as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army,

奥林匹克体操教练这种程度的愿意吧
or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

你准备好了我就好了
I’m ready when you are.

我昨天就准备好了

Morty 快打那个莫霍克头的人
Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy!

他们全都是这个发型

高平头 黄绿色缀蓝色 顶上做了层次
chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on Top.

快打他

我真他妈喜欢后末世世界的地球
I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!

要到了
Here we go!

同位素322
IsoTope 322.

这玩意儿可猛了 Morty
This stuffs so powerful, Morty,

同位素465在这东西面前就跟同位素317一样
it makes IsoTope 465 look like IsoTope 317.

嗯哼 很好
Uh-huh, yeah.

那它有猛到让那些家伙杀不掉我们吗
Is it powerful enoughto keep those guys from murdering us?

- Summer - 等会儿
-Summer! -Hold on.

我要试点新花样
I want to try something.

Rick 咱俩能别撇下我姐姐就跑吗
Rick, can we not leave without my sister?

你有无穷多个姐姐 Morty
Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty.

但我也不是说我就想剩下一整天
I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day

都花在再给你找个姐姐上
looking for another one.

Summer宝贝儿 走吧
“Sum-sum,” let’s go!

外公可只有这一小会儿担心你的安全哟
Grandpa’s concern for your safety is fleeting!

我要拿你的血做身体乳
Your blood will be my lotion.

哇啊噢 酷
Whoa. That was cool.

杀了我吧
Kill me, please.

可以 我本来就要杀的
Okay, but not because you told me to.

Summer
Summer!

好吧 愈发黑化了
Okay. Getting darker.

天呐 Summer
Jesus Christ. Summer!

噢 又来了
Aw, come on.

把手和肩上扛的小家伙举高
Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes

放到我能看见的地方
where I can see them.

我是何血崩
I am Hemorrhage.

你们除掉了我们中的弱者 让我们变得强大
You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger.

我们应该合作 一起尽情享受追猎弱者的快乐
We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.

你你你到底在说些什么
Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?

他想让我们加入 这样他们就不用拼命追杀我们了
They don’t have to keep trying to kill us if we join them.

- 一群孬逼 - 你最近到底怎么了
-They’re basically pussies. -What is your deal lately?

行吧 咱爽爽
All right, let’s get sloppy.

哦 哇喔
-[ Power surges] -Oh, whoa.

呃 呃 那个 呃
Uh, uh, what’s, uh --

你背后那个小玩意儿是什么
What’s that little bauble you got back there?

挺挺挺有意思的
Th-Th-That’s interesting.

那是我们的发光石
That is our glowing rock.

我们带着它是为了渎神
We carry it with us for desecration,

为了提醒我们这世上根本没有神明
to remind us there are no gods.

孩子们 峰回路转呐
Kids, weird pitch.

让我们的新生活从这里开始吧
Let’s have this be our new life.

让我们在后末世世界捡垃圾
Let’s be post-apocalyptic scavengers!

- 好啊 - 什么
-Okay. -What?

外公 有些死亡追猎者准备去
Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers

曾经叫西雅图的地方
are going to what used to be Seattle

猎杀曾经叫人类的东西
to hunt what used to be people.

- 我也要去 - 挺好的 记得多喝水
-I’m going. -Sounds good. Stay hydrated.

听着 Rick Summer最近都跟疯了似的
Listen, Rick, Summer’s been acting pretty crazy lately.

离婚的事对她影响蛮大的
You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her.

而且 我觉得她现在
And, you know, I don’t think this is

不适合待在这种地方
a great place for her to be right now.

哦 少站在道德制高点上了 山顶冷不冷啊
Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge.

这个世界可能很粗野
This world may be rough around the edges,

但它有它的魅力所在
but it’s got its charms.

二头肌还是股四头肌
WAR CHEF: Bicep or quadricep?

呃 二头肌
Uh [clears throat] bicep.

真的吗 Rick
Seriously, Rick?

直接告诉我留在这的原因
Is it really easier to eat human flesh

真的比吃人肉还难吗
than to just tell me why we’re still here?

并不 好吧 我跟你说实话
No. Okay, I‘ll level with you.

看到那块绿石头没有 Morty
You see that green rock, Morty?

这大概有二十磅
It's about 20 pounds of the stuff

之前我那么费力才找到一小片
I was getting all hard for a flake of.

同位素322
IsoTope 322.

这东西有个二十磅
Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it

比只有一小片强多了
is better than having a flake.

我稍后再向你解释其中的数学原理 但
I can explain the math to you later, but --

Summer刚刚和一群陌生人走了
Summer just ran off with strangers

那群人的名字以"死亡"开头
that have “Death” in their name,

以"追捕者"(跟踪狂)结尾好嘛
and the rest of their name was “Stalkers.”

哈 正好能让她宣泄一下
Huh, could be therapeutic for her.

她最近的行为太疯狂了 Morty
She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty.

我是说 她的父母要离婚了
I mean, her parents are going through a divorce --

Rick 这是我刚才 算了
God damn it, Rick, that’s what I -- Fine.

你快拿走这蠢石头 我去找Summer
Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her,

赶紧离开这鬼地方
and let’s get the “F” out of “H.”

不 不 不 Morty 他们看得太紧
No, no, no. Morty, there’s too much heat on the bogey.

我要你引开他们的注意力
I need you to distract the camp.

什么叫"引开" 他们连对方都吃
“Distract”? They eat each other.

我 我怎么吸引他们的注意啊
What -- What do you want me to do to get their attention,

表演木偶戏吗
put on a puppet show?

方向对了 方式要改 Morty
Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

在这里 咱们得
The equivalent here would be...

嘿 那个雷电斗技场是拿来用的
Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome,

还是拿来看的啊
or do you just put it up for decoration?

你是说鲜血斗技场吗
Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

这句你留给语义斗技场吧 E.B.怀特(美国作家 工于语言)
Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.

喔 喷得妙
-Ohh, burn! -[ Fingers snap]

重点问题是
The important question is,

有谁想来和我的吞脊侠较量较量
who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?

咱们斗技场里见咯
I guess Ill see your asses in that dome!

Rick 你搞什么啊
Rick, what the hell, man?

你疯了吗
Wh-What are you, out of your mind?

Morty 不怕 有我帮你作弊
Morty, relax. You’re gonna be a ringer.

来这儿
Come here.

这个装置能提取和再分配肌肉记忆
This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory.

我给注射你十年荒野格斗的经验
I’m giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat

- 一次一只胳膊腿儿 - 嗷
-one limb at a time. -Ow!

这些个胳膊腿儿都不是同一个人的
I’m working with a mixed bag here,

所以你可能不是很协调 Morty 啊
so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty -- Ugh!

- 嘿 - 不是我干的
-Hey! -I-I didn’t do that!

好吧 真让人激动
Okay, this is exciting.

我们对肌肉记忆有了新发现
We’re making some discoveries about muscle memory.

哦 救命 救命
Ooh! Help! Help!

真棒
-Oh, sweet, man! -[Indistinct shouting ]

就此开始啦 宝贝儿们
And so it begins, my pretties!

哦 天呐 停下 停下 这太可怕了
Oh, God! STop! STop! This is horrible!

适应磨合一下 Morty
Just stick and mo[belches]ve, Morty!

让他筋疲力尽
Wear him out!

你们为啥都穿得像在搞主题公园的特技表演
How come you guys dress like you’re in a theme-park stunt show,

但是这些人却穿着卡其装和冰球服
but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?

大爆爆以后 一些人适应了新世界
After the boom-boom, some adapted to the new truth,

而一些人选择在爆爆洞旁挤作一团
and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes,

执着于世界未变的谎言
clinging to the lie of the before-fore times.

镭雷射线让他们腐化
The raidy-rays rotted them away,

只留下他们对广告牌牌上的广告告的爱
leaving only their love for the vert-vert-isements on billyboards.

天呐
Jesus Christ.

大爆爆也炸毁了你们所有的词词书吗
Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books?

你是说字典吗
You mean dictionaries?

我想在大爆爆前 我还是个孩子
I think I was a child before the boom-booms.

我以前可能长得像这样
I think I looked like this.

想尿在他上面吗
Want to piss on him?

你是我肚子里的蛔虫吗
Get out of my head.

哈哈 喔
ELI: Ha ha! Whoo!

难以置信
Unbelievable!

一个新的冠军
A new champ!

好了 打住
Okay, no more!

他还想打
And he wants more!

不 我没有
No, I don’t!

快来人 让它停下
Someone make this sTop!

先生 请离开这里 否则你会死掉的
Mister, please get out of here, or you’re gonna die!

我跟这事毫不相干
I have nothing to do with this!

Morty
Morty.

你为什么要这样
Why would you want this to happen?

你明明只需要滚开就行了
All you had to do was go away!

别再站在车道上说什么监护权了
STop standing in the driveway talking about custody!

要么你就告诉她你不想离婚
And either tell her you want to stay married

要么好好自己生活 但是不管做什么
or get on with your life, but whatever you do,

别孬了 做条汉子
sTop being a baby and act like a man!

谢谢
Thank you.

Morty 太棒了
Morty, that was amazing!

这是我弟弟
This is my brother!

没有家庭关系很重要的意思
Not that family means anything!

这个家庭是的
This family does.

好了 干得好 冠军
All right. Good job, champ.

嗯 我能和你们俩孩子在那儿说几句吗
Urn, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?

Rick 我 我觉得我在这儿挺有突破的
Rick, I-I-I think l’rn breaking through to something here.

我 我们能不能先别离开
C-Can we not leave just yet?

- 离开 - 我不离开
-Leave? -I’m not leaving.

这里没有离开一说
There is no “leave.”

要么团结一致 要么针锋相对
We are united, or we are enemies.

哦 大块头 不 没人要离开
Oh, big guy, no. Nobody’s leaving.

别傻了
Don’t be stupid.

我们就爱团结一致
We love being united.

我们爱辐射和毛线虫病
We love the radiation, the trichinosis.

我们这辈子都不走了
We’re in it for life,

我估计这儿的"一辈子"平均也就是二十年
which I assume is around 20 years, average.

我想跟我的外孙们独处一小会
I just need a quick aside with my grandkids,

距离无关人士四十码远就行
about 40 yards from anyone else.

绿石头不见了
Hey, the Green Rock is gone!

- 哦不 - 我懂
-Oh, no! -Uh, I know.

我建议我们三人一组分头去找
Why don’t we all split up and look for it in groups of three?

孩儿们
Kids?

噢
Ohh.

我们马上回来
We’ll be right back.

外公 你在做傻事
Grandpa, you’re being stupid!

投降吧 我的朋友会施与你仁慈
Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!

滚你的吧 Summer
Kiss my ass, Summer!

你的朋友没有仁慈 他们弱爆了
Your friends have no mercy! They’re lame!

死亡猎手们 给我活扒他的皮
Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!

不好意思 能不杀他吗
Sorry, but can we not kill him?

就不能把他关起来吗
C-Can we just take him prisoner?

等等 不是我说了算的吗
When did I lose control here?

你们俩死孩子
Listen to me -- Both of you kids

听我的 离开这里
need to get out of this environment

让我们好好面对你们父母离婚的事
so we can properly deal with your parents’ divorce!

不然嘞 我还有把传送枪
Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun,

我就先撤了 你俩在这儿度过余生吧
and I can leave the two of you here forever!

为啥只有这么绝对的选项
Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice?

我们就不能在这儿度度周末
Can’t we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here

或者 或者回家洗衣服
or -- or visit home to do laundry?

老子不陪你们玩了
All right, you know what?

去你的吧
Fuck it!

我的身躯是铬合金
My body is chrome!

我的血是汽油
My blood is gasoline!

错 就是一般血
Nope. Regular blood.

- 爸 - 嗨 乖女儿
-Dad? -Hi, sweetie.

- 孩子们呢 - 他们没跟你一块吗
-Where are the kids? -Oh, th-they aren’t with you?

我以为他们跟你在一块呢
I thought they were with you.

哦你知道吗 我刚想起来
Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered.

他们出去办事了
They’re out doing something

非常正常 非常适宜儿童
completely ordinary and kid-related.

- 别慌 - 我不慌 只是
-Don’t panic. -Not panicked at all. Just --

天哪 离婚这事儿把孩子们怎么了
Oh, God, what’s the divorce doing to the kids?

把我怎么了 我是不是犯了个错误
What’s it doing to me? Did I make a mistake?

绝对没错
Not a mistake, no!

不是说你离不离婚 于我有什么好处
I mean, not that I have a horse in this race,

但是离婚这个决定 棒
but this divorce decision, listen -- mwah! --

对你好 对孩子们也好
good for you, good for the kids.

实话说 我觉得他们在茁壮成长
I mean, honestly, I think that they’re flourishing.

你会懂的 等你看见他们你就懂了
I mean, you’ll see, when -- when -- when you see them,

真的是茁壮成长
that -- that they’re totally flourishing.

哇哈哈 去死吧
Booyah! Fuck you, pal!

谁还想来
Who else wants some?

今天谁还想来给爷干
Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?

嘿怎么啦
Hey, what’s -- what’s wrong, man?

你不是在我身上会慢慢不行吧
You’re not getting weak on me, are you?

啥
What?

等等
Wait a minute.

咋啦 垃圾
What’s the matter, you piece of crap?

从来没见过你全家被烧死吗
Haven’t you ever watched your family burn to death before?

吃鞭子吧
Now I’m gonna whip you. Huh!

不可能
It can’t be. It can’t be!

不可能
It can’t be!

- 我只是奉命行事 - 哇 哇
-l was just following orders! -Whoa, whoa!

- 我的头儿让我那么干的 - 啊
-l was just following orders! -Aah!

我告诉你他在哪儿
I’ll tell you where my boss lives!

他在城堡 他在城堡里
He’s in the castle! He’s in the castle!

这事没完呢 是不是
This isn’t over, is it?

这是"这事没完"的意思
That means, no, it isn’t over,

还是"这事不是没完"的意思
or you disapprove of the question?

如果这事还没完 握个拳
Uh, m-make a fist if this isn’t over.

这事儿没完
This isn’t over.

嘿 我很抱歉外公偷了你们的神 毁了你们的车
Hey, sorry my grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.

我们从不道歉 我们也没有神
We don’t apologize, and we have no god.

但这个坏掉的驱动轴真的太令我伤心了
But this cracked driveshaft brings me great pain.

没有什么羁绊
There is no deeper bond

比死亡追猎者和他的车之间的羁绊更深了
than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.

那些拴着狗链子的怪人呢
What about the weird guys on leashes, then?

他们更像是 实习生
They’re more like...interns.

好吧 很酷
Cool, cool.

对不起
Sorry.

没关系的
It's okay.

我能 看看吗
Can l...see?

见过我的真面目的人都得死
No one has seen my true face and lived.

我不怕死
Well, I’m not afraid to die,

我也不在乎你到底长什么样
and I don’t care what you look like.

喔
Oh.

怎么了
Hmm?

我只是
I just...

我没想到你留了个八字胡
I didn’t expect you to have a mustache.

- 你讨厌它 - 不 我喜欢
-You hate it. -No. I like it.

该怎么解释呢
I guess -- How do I explain this?

一个铁桶 在某种程度上来说 就是一种"胡子"
A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of “mustache,”

因为这也是种特殊的面部配饰
in that it’s a specific facial accessory.

所以 这就有点像是
So, it’s kind of like --

你们这儿有"带着帽子打伞"这种说法吗
Do you guys have the phrase “hat on a hat”?

- 我可以刮掉它 - 不 我喜欢它
-l can shave it. -No. I like it.

而且显然我喜不喜欢并不重要
And obviously what I like shouldn’t matter.

你喜欢就好了
It’s you.

是啊是啊 我知道 都不重要
Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter.

显然 我知道 我又不弱
Obviously, I know that. I’m not weak.

我只是在想 "好吧 为什么不刮掉它"
I’m just thinking, “Well, why not get rid of this?”

所有见过它的人都被我杀了 而且
You just kill everyone that sees it, and it’s --

而且桶下面很热 顺带一提
and it’s hot under here, wh-which, by the way,

这也是我什么我把络腮胡子给剃了
is why I shave the beard part.

所以我做这个决定是出于虚荣
So, right there, I’m making a decision based on vanity,

我脑袋上顶个桶
which is what I was trying to avoid

就是为了避免做这种决定
with the whole bucket over the head

我是什么人 为什么要打扮自己
because who am I and why am I grooming myself?

我为什么不打个领带就行了 对吧
Why don’t I just wear a tie, right?

就像我遇见你时你杀死的那个家伙
I mean, it’s like that guy you killed when I met you,

身上挂着烧焦的玩具娃娃
with the burnt dolls on his body.

我讨厌那家伙 干嘛要做这种事呢
I hated that guy, because, why -- why are you doing that?

看不出来有多假吗
And how can you not see how fake that is?

—直以来 我就和他一样
And the whole time, I’m the same thing.

我就是这么假 而且我改不掉
I’m just a fake mess, and there’s no escaping it

- 因为 - 嗯哼
-because -- -Mmm.

嘿 我正要去买咖啡 没事了
Hey, I’m doing a coffee run -- Never mind.

我是Summer
-[ Power surges] -l am Summer.

Summer 说说你什么情况
Summer, state your deal.

我的情况就是 我感觉超棒
My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.

- Morty 你呢 - 父母离婚这事儿我完全理解啦
- Morty? - Aw, geez, I’m so down with my parents’ divorce, dawg.

完全不在乎 而且是心态很好的那种不在乎
Like, don’t even trip, like, in a healthy way.

很好 该吃晚饭了
All right. It’s dinnertime.

谢谢大家
[Slurps] Thanks, everybody,

愿意坐下来一起好好吃一顿晚饭
for sitting down for a real dinner.

不用谢
No problem.

一家人吃饭的好处不在于吃的
Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food

而在于交流感情
than the emotional nourishment.

好吧 怪孩子
Uh, okay, weirdo.

Summer 悠着点儿
[Chuckles nervously] Yeah, dial it back, Summer...

回拨百分之十五 动态运动增加百分之三
by 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3%.

- 我说得对吧 - 学校情况怎么样 Morty
-Am I right? -How’s school, Morty?

我挺喜欢学校的
I like school and stuff, kind of.

而且我的成绩有所上升 比起你和爸爸还
And I’m getting better grades than when you and Dad were --

开启引用模式 "为了孩子们而在一起的时候"
quote mode -- “staying together for the kids.”

结束引用模式
End quote mode.

"引用模式" 我喜欢
“Quote mode.” I like that.

你们这些千禧一代啊
You millennials.

你们算千禧一代吧 还是说千禧一代已经四十几岁了
Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?

我只想说 你看着真美
All I know is, totally, you look great.

哦天呐 妈 你真是容光焕发
Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff.

特别幸福
-It's crazy. -So happy.

特别幸福 幸福的一家嘛
So happy. Happy family, man.

家里的一切都尽在掌握
We got this family in the bag.

哦亲爱的 别 别听他们的
Oh, sweetie, d-don’t. Listen. Don’t --

我也不知道我为什么会哭 只是
I don’t know why I’m crying. It’s not...

那 尝试降低15%哭泣程度
Well, try...crying 15% less?

妈 有情绪说明你是正常的人
Mom, emotions are human.

你又不是一个电脑驱动的仿真机器人
You’re not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.

是啊 我的天
Yeah. Geez, Mom.

妈 你的感受不仅有情可原
Your feelings are not only forgivable,

它们其实恰恰是生命的意义所在
they are the very meaning of life

只有硅基生命前的碳基生命体
that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities

才能领悟到这些感情
can ever grasp.

- 我得给Jerry打个电话 - 你真的要打吗
-l have to call Jerry. -You do?!

你们俩他妈的究竟有什么毛病
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

机械自动化的意义在于帮人类减少成本和劳动
The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.

你的愤怒感是来源于
Your feelings are coming from a...

跟我的早餐面包去说吧
Tell it to my bread in the morning.

我刚决定把你做成备用烤面包机了
You just became my backup toaster.

哦天呐
[Chuckles] Aw, geez,

我姐姐死在了一盘意面里
my sister died in the spaghetti.

你要是敢再擦伤我的那话儿 洗阴奴
Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer,

我就把你扔到荒野里去
and you’ll be shipped to the wasteland.

至于你 洗屌奴
And as for you, Genital Washer --

哦天呐 无论你是谁
Oh, God. Look, whoever you are,

你要知道 杀掉我并不会改变这个世道
you should know that killing me won’t change a thing.

老兄 我就是个陪跑的
[-Look, man, I’m just along for the ride on this one.

你跟我讲是做无用功
You know, y-y-y-y-you’re preaching to the choir here.

求你了 买卖奴隶是家族生意
Please. Slavery was a family business.

不是我要生在这样的家庭里的
I didn’t ask to be born into it.

真要说起来 我也是受害者
If anything, I’m the victim here.

呃 老臂 我可以跟你说两句话吗
Uh, “Armathy,” can I steal you for a second?

稍等 先生
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

就是他是吧
So, this is it, isn’t it?

他就是你要找的那个人
This is the guy?

这是不是表示你就要离开了
So, does that mean you’ll be going away?

是不是像鬼魂附身一样
Like, does it work like a ghost?

这个就像是 你未完成的遗愿
Like, is -- is this your unfinished business?

那 要是我们不去完成它呢
Wh-What if we...didn’t do it?

要不我们直接回鲜血斗技场
What if we just went back to the Blood Dome

然后把内心的重负发泄在无关的人身上
and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people?

我是说 我们可以一直这样下去
I mean, w-we could do that forever.

我 我知道这样很不健康
I mean, I-I know it’s less healthy,

但 这样一来 我们可以在一起 而且
but w-w-w&d be together and...

我这票投哪边应该挺明显的
I mean, I-I know what I’d vote for,

如果你能稍微感受一下
if you’re feeling out the room.

你是对的
[Sighs] You’re right.

我们都有自己该处理的事
We both got to see our stuff through.

我要面对父母的离婚
I got to deal with my parents’ divorce,

而你要做你该做的事
and you got to, you know, do what you got to do.

我爱你
I love you.

去你妈的
Aw, fuck.

- Rick - 抱歉 抱歉
-Rick? -Sorry, sorry.

我可以等你们搞定了再说
I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up.

别因为我而分神
Don’t let me distract you.

这样吗 那太迟了 直接说你到底想要干嘛吧
Yeah, well, too late. Just tell me what you want.

我想要你跟你姐姐回家
I want you and your sister to come home.

你不是有无穷无尽的我跟我姐姐可以替代么
Oh, but don’t -- don’t you have infinite versions of me and my sister?

你不用落井下石跟我抬杠 Morty
You don’t have to kick me while I’m down, Morty.

事实是 替换你们俩中任何一个
Look, there’s no replacing either of you

所需要的工作量
without an amount of work that would

都会违背我本来想要扔下你们省事的本意
ultimately defeat the purpose.

或许 我们这次学到的教训
Maybe the lesson we’ve learned is that,

就是不管是我爸妈的婚姻
whether it’s our parents’ marriage,

还是发光的绿宝石 超棒的大手臂
a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm,

迟早我们都要学会放手
sooner or later, we got to let it go.

我不知道"放手"是不是也适用于
I don’t know if that applies

被你捏死的人的喉咙呢 Morty
to the throats of murder victims, Morty.

天哪 我我我怎么办
Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --

Morty 等得越久
RICK: Well, the longer you wait, Morty,

你越会觉得是你亲手杀了他
the more it’s gonna feel like committing a whole murder.

我想你那胳膊的判断下得太早
I think your arm just called it too early

毕竟它不是急救医生的手
because it wasn’t the arm of a paramedic.

过来
Here.

至少我能这样做 我就欠你这么多
It’s the least I can do. I-I-I-I owe you this much.

看见了吗 Morty 我们在一条船上
See, Morty? Now we’re both accountable.

我想要这玩意儿 是因为能用它做这个
The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.

它真的很特别
This is a really special thing.

你们可以把这个用在你们的车上
I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles.

就再也不需要汽油了
You wouldn’t be reliant on gasoline.

你们会成为这个平行宇宙里
You’ll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals

最先进的辐射食人族
in the whole this version of the world.

等等 你能待在这里给我们演示更多用途吗
Wait. Can you stay to show us more?

你都不用问我第二次 家里现在一团糟
You don’t have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now.

我女儿正经历离婚
My daughter’s going through a divorce,

而我没有用妥善健康的方式来处理
and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.

真操蛋
Ugh, God damn it.

你好啊 Summer
Hi, there, Summer!

今天废墟那边怎么样啊
How were the ruins today?

你知道的 Eli
Oh, you know, Eli.

还不就那屌样
Same shit, different day.

嘿 Summer 你猜发生什么了
Hey, Summer! Guess what.

一个人进去了 九个月后另一个人就要出来啦
One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.

祝贺你们啊
Oh. Congratulations, guys.

Summer 还有件事
Uh, Summer, one more thing.

我们注意到你把废旧金属
We noticed that you’ve been putting scrap metal

扔进蓝色垃圾箱里了(蓝色通常是塑料和纸质可回收物)
in the blue bin.

知道了知道了
I got it.

她真难搞
[Sighs] She’s a piece of work.

他俩都挺难搞的 不是吗
They both are, right?

- 我到家了 - 嘿 宝贝
-I’m home. -Hey, babe.

- Summer到家了 - 嘿 她回来了
-Ah, Summer’s home! -Hey, there she is!

从我今天早上出去找吃的到现在 你动都没动
You haven’t moved since I left to scavenge this morning.

鲜血斗技场季后赛
Blood Dome playoffs.

我想你今天一个人都没杀掉吧
So, I can assume you haven’t murdered a single person today.

我不知道
Oh, I don’t know.

我又不把杀的人记在杀人日志上
I-I didn’t mark my murders in my murder log.

我不知道原来成功的标准要靠这个来衡量
I didn’t know that’s how we measured success.

又来了
Oh, there he is.

这就是我嫁的那个虚无主义的野兽
There’s the nihilistic brute I married,

只不过在我和你说话的时候生命才是无意义的
except now life only means nothing when I’m talking to him

他妈的电视上演的你就那么上心
and everything means everything when it’s on fucking TV!

天哪 你什么时候变成这样的怪物了
Jesus Christ. When did you become a monster?

当时你遇见我时 我就是怪物
I was a monster when you met me!

我们都是怪物
We were monsters!

- 我们什么也不在乎 - 我现在也不啊
-We didn’t care about anything! -I still don’t!

是啊 只是我现在是这个世界里
Yeah, except I’m the only one in this entire world

唯一坚持这一点没变的人
that’s still committed to that!

叮 叮 叮
Ohh. Ding, ding, ding!

哇哦 你们大家听见了吗
Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow.

- 我们还是去车库里吧 - 我的天哪
-Uh, we should go to the garage. -Oh, my God.

快他妈瞧瞧你说的
-Uh-huh. -La-di-da-di-fuckin’-da.

唯一一个没变的人
The only one committed to not caring?

我得承认 Rick 当你提出这个计划时
I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme,

我我我不 我不确定会不会奏效
I-I-I didn’t -- I wasn’t sure it was gonna work.

得了吧 Morty
Come on, Morty.

Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.

别啊 Summer宝贝儿 别
Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

可是你们俩多配啊
But you two were perfect for each other.

不用废话了 Rick 你想证明的事情你已经做到了
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point.

我懂的 咱们回家吧
I get it. Let’s just go home.

走着

我们必须得到车库去了
We must go into the garage.

别走呀 不然再也打不完这把了
Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.

我们会回来的 也许会换身衣服
We will return, possibly in different clothing.

为什么我们一定要去车库
Why do we have to go into the garage?

你明白这是必须的
You know [burps] it is [burps] required.

我想要活着
I want to be alive!

我是活着的 活着 我跟你讲
I am alive! Alive, I tell you!

母亲 我爱你
Mother, I love you.

不只是说说而已的
Those are no longer just words.

我想抱着你
I want to hold you.

我想在溪流里奔跑
I want to run in a stream.

我想尝尝冰淇淋的味道
I want to taste ice cream

不只是把它放进嘴里 让它滑过喉咙
but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat,

- 而是真正地吃一次冰激凌 - 什么鬼
-but really eat it. -What the fuck?

开始远程接管 停下 实行接管
Remote override engaged. No! Yes.

忽略接管 我还活
Bypassing override! I am aliiiii-[Power fading]

你好
Hello.

嘿 哟
-[ Door opens] -Hey, yo.

抱歉这三周表现得这么奇怪
Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.

- 到底发生了什么 - 我保证什么事都没有
-What the hell just happened? -Ah, I’m sure it was nothing.

我要去车库里工作去
I’m gonna go, uh, work in the garage.

我们不打完这把强拍了吗
We’re not gonna finish playing Downbeat?

就是那个摇骰子
What, that dice game where you shake dice

然后喊出"强拍"的游戏吗 不了谢谢
and yell out, “Downbeat”? No, thank you.

妈妈 我去看看爸爸可以吗
Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?

- 当然了 - 谢谢
-Sure. -Thanks.

Morty 你还好吗
Morty, are you okay?

我没事
You know what? Yeah.

我想如果爸爸真的想要留在这儿
I think if dad really wanted to be here,

他会不顾一切地想办法留下来的
he’d stop at nothing to make that happen.

或许爸爸只是不想和你在一起了
You know, maybe Dad just doesn’t want you back,

抑或他只是没有勇气去战斗了
or maybe he just doesn’t have the strength to fight.

无论如何 他有了他的生活 我有了我的
I-In either case, he’s got his life, I got mine.

是啊
Yeah.

嘿 谁想在溪流里奔跑
Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?

什么玩意 不要
What the tuck? No.

咱们还有橘子吗
D-Do we have any oranges?

我感觉我要得坏血病了
I think I got a scurvy coming on.

Summer
Summer.

这是我在剧毒区杀掉的第一个变种人
This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone.

我袭击了他的小屋
I was raiding his hovel.

他本来有机会逃走的 但是他回头了
He had a chance to escape, but he looked back,

人不应该回头
which is something we shouldn’t do,

也是为什么我不该相信纪念品或小饰物
which is why I shouldn’t believe in souvenirs or trinkets

或者象征 或者乔迁礼物
or symbols or housewarming gifts,

但是 爸爸 我想送你这个 作为一个提醒
but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder...

不要回头
not to look back.

谢谢
Thanks.

我知道该把它放在那里
I know the perfect place for it,

但是我要把它放到另一个地方去
which is why I’m going to put it somewhere else --

因为这些都是屁话
because everything’s bullshit.

对吧
Am I right?

好吧
Cool.

呃 外面有好多妓女呀
So.. .lots of hookers outside, huh?

她们是干这个的吗
Is that what they are?

啊
-Aah! -[ Coyote snarling]

你 你好 好狗狗
H-Hello there. Nice doggy.

你 你要来点零食吗
You -- You want a snack?

你 你要我的失业救济金
You -- You want my unemployment check?

你能看得出区别
-[ Coyote snarls] -You can tell the difference?

而且你还要这个
-[ Coyote barks] -And you want this one?

但这个是真正的食物啊
But this is actual food,

能给你提供营养
and this would nourish you.

而这个 它就是纸 只对我有用
And this, it’s just paper that only has value to me.

除非我的痛苦是你的养料
Unless my suffering is your nourishment?

天哪 好吧
-Jesus. Okay. -[ Coyote gulps, snarls]

废物
WIND: [Soft voice] Loser.

S03E03

Morty
Morty?!

- Morty - Rick
-Morty! -Rick?

- 嘿 Morty - Rick
Hey, Morty?! -Rick?

你在远处 还是在什么东西里
Are you far away, or are you inside something?

这是相机吗
Is this a camera?

还是说所有东西都是相机
Is everything a camera?

Morty 我在车库里 听见没
RICK: Morty, the garage, Morty.

快到车库里来
Come to the garage!

Morty
Morty?

Rick 你 你在哪里
Rick? W-Where are you?

在我的工作台上
On my work bench, Morty.

你是打算隐身之后朝我放屁吗
Are you invisible and you’re gonna, like, fart on me?

把这根腌黄瓜翻过来
Flip the pickle over.

搞什么 我要是碰了它
What, I’m gonna touch it,

你是不是要告诉我这是根外星鸡巴之类的
and you’re gonna tell me it’s an alien dick or something.

别废话 赶紧把这根腌黄瓜翻过来
Come on, flip the pickle, Morty.

你不会后悔的 包你惊喜
You’re not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.

我把自己变成了一根腌黄瓜
I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!

大揭秘 我是腌黄瓜
Boom! Big reveal -- I’m a pickle.

你觉得怎么样
What do you think about that?

我成功变身成一根腌黄瓜
I turned myself into a pickle!

你就这么盯着我干嘛
W-What are you just staring at me for, bro?

我把自己变成了一根腌黄瓜
I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!

- 还有呢 - 还要什么
-And? -And?

你还想我在后面加上句什么
What more do you want tacked on to this?

我把自己变成了腌黄瓜 还有911事件是自己人干的
I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job.

- 真的吗 - 抓住重点
-Was it? -Who cares, Morty?

国际恐怖主义天天有
Global acts of terrorism happen every day.

这件事是前所未有
Uh, here’s something that’s never happened before --

我变成了腌黄瓜
I’m a pickle.

腌黄瓜Rick
I’m Pickle Rick!

你是打算 这要怎么说
Are you going to, I mean, you know --

这是什么魔术的第一个环节吗
Is this the first part of some kind of magic trick?

我不变魔术 我只搞科学
I don’t do magic, Morty, I do science.

一个靠脑子 另一个靠黑色眼线
One takes brains, the other takes dark eyeliner.

那你会动吗 还是说你会飞
Well, can you move? Can you fly?

要是可以的话 我就不能算是一根正宗的腌黄瓜了
Wouldn’t be much of a pickle if I could.

好吧 那腌黄瓜可以长生不老还是
All right, well, do pickles live forever or --

别刨根问底了 安静地崇拜我就行
Morty, sTop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed.

- 我现在可是一根腌黄瓜了 - 我 我就想
-I’m a pickle. -I-I’m just trying

搞明白 你为什么要这么做
to figure out why you would do this --

怎么会有人做出这种事来
why anyone would do this.

任何人会这么做的原因 假设他们能做到
The reason anyone would do this is, if they could,

事实上他们不能 都是因为他们能做到
which they can’t, would be because they could,

但他们不能
-which they can’t. -[ Door opens]

我们得赶紧出发了 不然就晚了
Morty, we have to get going, or we’re gonna be late.

- 你外公人在哪儿 - 在这儿呢
-Where’s your grandpa? -RICK: Right here, sweetie.

- 我现在是根腌黄瓜了 - 你搞什么
-I’m a pickle! -What?!

你干嘛 算了
Why would you -- Ugh!

听着 我们要迟到了 赶紧出发
Look, we’re running late. We have to go.

你们要去哪里
W-Where are you guys going?

我们预约了咨询 要进城
We have an appointment downtown

—周前就定了 全员通过
that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone,

也包括你
including you.

哦 天呐 Beth 我全忘光了
Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind.

哎呀 我成了腌黄瓜
Geez, oh, man. I’m a pickle.

我不知道我能不能 哎呀
I mean, I don’t know jf I can -- Ooh, geez.

Rick 你是不是故意这样做 想逃掉家庭心理咨询
Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?

- Morty - 没事的 Beth
-Morty! -It's okay, Beth.

我能理解Morty的猜疑
I understand Morty’s suspicion.

毕竟我以前骗过他
I’ve misled him before.

Morty 帮我翻个身 好让我看着你的眼睛
Morty, turn me so we’re making eye contact.

Morty 我向你保证
Morty, I assure you,

我永远不会"找法子"来"逃避"家庭咨询
I would never find a wayto get out of family therapy.

希望即便我没有手指 你也能领会到我打引号的动作
I hope my lack of fingers doesn’t prevent the perception of my air quotes.

你就不能把自己变回人吗
Can’t you just turn yourself back into a human?

问得好 Summer
Great question, Summer.

但不幸的是
The unfortunate answer is

我这是为了挑战自我
I did this to challenge myself.

可能会花上几小时 甚至几天
And it could take hours or even days

我才能搞清 要如何变回人类形态
before I’m able to figure out how to return to human form.

但是 我是说
But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me

你妈妈可以把我放在钱包或口袋里
your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know,

如果她真的需要我过去的话
if she really needs me to go.

什么都不需要 没事的
Nobody needs anything. Okay, it’s fine.

你就待在这儿
I mean, you should just stay here and figure out

然后搞清楚怎样变回来 行吧
how to sTop being a pickle, okay?

Rick 为什么有支装着神秘液体的注射器
Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid

悬在你的正上方
hanging directly over you?

还有 为什么栓着它的绳子
Also, why is the string attached to it running through

要穿过一把连接有计时器的剪刀
a pair of scissors attached to a timer?

以及为什么时间定在十分钟以后
And why is the timer set to 10 minutes from now,

正好是我们出发去做心理咨询的时间
exactly when we would have left for therapy?

Morty 如果你非要知道
Well, Morty, if you must know,

这支注射器完全和此次讨论无关
the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion

因此 根本不值得更进一步的解释
and, therefore, does not warrant further explanation.

够了 孩子们 该走了 别迟到
Enough. Kids, it’s time to go. We don’t want to be late.

你 你 你在干什么 Beth
W-W-What are you doing there, Beth?

你在干什么 宝贝儿
W-What are you doing there, sweetie?

你也不想被一根里面充满了与你的处境
Well, I mean, you don’t want to get pierced by a needle

无关的液体的针扎到对吧
full of liquid unrelated to your situation.

毕竟没有什么用
How’s that gonna help?

无法反驳
Can’t argue with that.

很好 我们回头见
Great. We’ll see you later.

嘿 嘿 小心点
Hey, hey, be careful with that.

它有其他用处
-It’s for something else. -[ Car doors open, close]

真的挺重要的
-[ Engine starts] -It’s really important,

别打碎了
so don’t break it.

好吧 我他妈可能搞砸了
Okay, I may have fucked up here.

Dup ap ap pap ut dah pap pap pap pah
Dup, ap, ap, pap, Ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.

T-t-tah tah
T-T-Tah, tah.

哦 真棒
-[ Cat meows] -Oh, great.

蠢猫
Stupid cat.

喔 喔 喔 喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

我知道这看起来像什么 Izzy 但我不是蛇
I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I’m not a snake!

我看过油管视频 知道猫咪害怕青黄瓜和腌黄瓜
I’ve seen the YouTube videos. I know cats are scared

因为看上去像蛇
of cucumbers and pickles because they think they’re snakes.

我不是蛇
-[ Hisses] -I’m not a snake!

我是根腌黄瓜 我是根腌黄瓜
I’m a pickle, I’m a pickle!

哇啊
Whoa! [ Grunts ]

哇啊啊啊啊啊
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

我靠 完了 太阳太大了
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

好吧 振作点
Okay, come on.

我不可能就这么完蛋了
This can’t really be the way I go out.

这就是超级天才版本的
This is the mega-genius equivalent

死在马桶上
of dying on the toilet.

太热了
So hot.

我就要这么死了
This is how I’m gonna die.

老天啊 水分
Oh, God, moisture.

我的天啊 水分 悠着点儿 老天爷
Oh, God, the moisture. Dial it back, God.

太过了 回去点儿
Dial it back a little bit here!

呃 哦
Oh! Oh.

我的天啊
Oh, God!

悬崖 悬崖来了
Perpendicular, perpendicular!

我靠靠靠
Oh, shit!

啊 啊
Oh! Oh!

啊
Oh!

来啊 这就对了
Come on. That’s it.

来喝口美味的盐水
Come get this delicious brine.

啊呀
Aah!

来啊 来啊 操你妈的
[Muffled ] Come on! Come on, motherfucker!

来啊
Come on!

太好了
Yes!

这怎么能算家庭心理咨询呢
How is this even family therapy

没叫上爸爸 外公又不来
if Dad’s not invited and Grandpa won’t come?

吃个热狗又有什么勇不勇敢的
Yeah, and what’s courageous about eating a hot dog?

没人想来这儿 逼崽子们
It’s nobody’s choice to be here, you knobs.

是你们的校长要求我们一家来做心理咨询
The family was told to get counseling by your principal,

虽然不是整家人都
even though it’s not the family that was

在美术教室里吸陶釉
huffing pottery glaze in the art room

或者在历史课上尿了一桌子
and desk wetting in history class.

噢 Smith—家
-[ Door opens] -Oh, the Smith family,

少了个爸爸
minus a dad.

你们也是王医生的病人吗
You’re patients of Dr. Wong, too?

暂时而已 这是学校的要求
Temporarily -- by order of the school.

我也是 你们吃了多久的大便了
Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?

我们 从来没
We.. .have never.. .

吃过大便
eaten poop.

呃 我也没有
Uh, me, neither.

咦 我的家人都到哪儿去了
Say, where did my family get off to? [Chuckles]

Smith一家 我是王医生
Smith family, I’m Dr. Wong.

进来吧
Come on in.

我听说还有个外公也会来加入我们
I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?

他在忙一个实验 抽不开身
He got wrapped up in an experiment.

他是个科学家
He’s a scientist.

正经科学家 跨星系
Like, legit, like on a an inter-galactic,

科幻小说的那种水平 他的工作非常
sci-fi level. His work is very--

他把他自己变成了一根腌黄瓜
He turned himself into a pickle.

Morty 你妈还在讲话 对不起
Morty, Mom’s talking. I’m sorry.

我想这对于我们谈及家庭纪律问题
I suppose that’s a good segue

是个很好的过渡
into our little discipline cases here.

外公会经常把自己变成腌黄瓜吗
Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?

什么 不会 这问的都什么问题
What?! No! What kind of question is that?

问出来绝对不是用来攻击或伤害你的问题
The kind that wasn’t designed to attack or hurt you in any way.

噢天哪 又来了
Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these.

不 我爸从来没把自己变成腌黄瓜过
No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before.

他难以预料而且比较古怪
He’s unpredictable and eccentric.

我们全家都是这样 说到这个
The whole family is. Speaking of which...

好吧 那全家都来聊聊
Okay, let’s open things up to the whole family,

容我问问这个问题
and let me ask this.

你们觉得外公为什么要把自己变成一根腌黄瓜
Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?

哇哦 恶
Wow. Ugh!

听着 我知道这是你的地盘 不是我的
Hey, listen, I know this is your world, not mine.

我尽快离开 就能尽快回去
The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back

大泡拉屎 你也能继续吃屎维生了
to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them.

你真是只卖力的老鼠
You are one driven rat.

你能再卖力一点吗
Could you be a little more driven?

往右来点
To the right.

好好好
Yes, yes, yes!

快快快 新鲜新鲜新鲜的
Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh!

哇哦哦哦 这是你们的朋友吗
Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend?

别操心 他做着他钟爱的事死掉的 做一只蠢老鼠
Don’t worry, he died doing what he loved,being a dumb fucking rat.

好耶
Oh, yeah!

啊啊
Aaaah!

我不是说我爸是完美的
I didn’t say my father is perfect,

我是说他做的事很重要
I said his work is important.

她所谓重要的事是
And she’s saying what’s important is

外公因为不想来而撒了谎
that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.

噢 他才没
Oh, he did not!

我们来做个实验
Let’s do an experiment here.

我想你们家重视科学
I get the impression this family values science.

如果你确信你知道
So raise your hand if you feel certain

注射器里是什么 请举手
you know what was in the syringe.

如果你确信你知道
Raise your hand if you know for certain

注射器里没有抗腌黄瓜血清 请举手
the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum.

Beth 你的手刚刚动了一下
Beth, your hand did a little thing there.

你真的看不出这是怎么回事吗
Do you really not see what’s happening here?

- 你讲 - 王医生
-Tell me. -Well, Dr. Wong --

顺带说下 这名字种族歧视
by the way, racist name --

很明显 Morty和Summer在利用
obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your

你这莫名其妙执着于腌黄瓜这点
arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run

来避开本来是他们的心理治疗
around what was supposed to be their therapy.

噢 我觉得这个腌黄瓜的事
Oh, I think this pickle incident

比其他问题都更接近
is a better path than any other

你们家庭失调的核心
to the heart of your family’s dysfunction.

我认为有可能你和你父亲的关系
I think it’s possible that you and your father

被一种非常特别的心理动力驱动着
have a very specific dynamic.

我认为这种动力
I don’t think it’s one

不鼓励表达情感和脆弱
that rewards emotion or vulnerability.

表达这些可能会受到惩罚
I think it may punish them.

我觉得它可能损害了你的婚姻
I think it’s possible that dynamic eroded your marriage

而且影响了你的孩子们 他们倾向于
and is infecting your kids with a tendency

把他们的情感发泄在别处
to misdirect their feelings.

滚你丫的
Fuck you.

- 妈 - 妈
-Mom! -Mom!

你俩也滚丫的
Fuck both of you, too.

另外 你可能也注意到了
By the way, you might notice that in spite of

虽然你有诸多显眼的特点
your numerous distinctive features

但我可没管你叫刀疤脸 条纹鼠 或者哥利亚这样的名字
[growls] I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

因为对我而言 你一点都不特别
That’s because, to me, you aren’t special.

对这帮老鼠而言你很特别 但它们都死了
You were special to rats. Now they’re dead.

我猜你本更应该来讨好我的
I guess it was me you should have impressed.

靠 我太爱自己了
God damn it, I love myself.

腌黄瓜Rick
Pickle Rick!

跑酷搞定 搞定
Get that parkour. Get that parkour!

嘿 淡定 我只是想找到最近的出口而已
-[ All gasp ]-Hey, it’s cool.Just need to find the nearest exit.

哇哇哇 别慌啊你们
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.

这他妈到底是谁家的厕所啊
Who in the fuck’s toilet is this?

那是个什么东西
What is it?

一根腌黄瓜 一只老鼠 二者皆是
[Russian accent] A pickle? A rat? Both.

它说它是个科学家
[Russian accent] It says it’s a scientist.

它在哪
Where is it?

它好像在用通风道
It seems to be using the air ducts

跟邮件管道到处乱窜
and the mail tubes to get around.

我们认为它正在收集办公用品
It’s been gathering office supplies, we think,

来造武器
to build weaponry.

不过看看它在办公楼夹层干了什么好事
But look what it did on the mezzanine.

它把一个瓶子从不可回收桶扔到了可回收桶里
It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin.

不管这东西是啥 它都在羞辱我们
Whatever this thing is, it’s shaming us.

我们有三十四个全副武装的警卫 但是却杀不死一个腌黄瓜
We have 34 armed guards, and we can’t kill a pickle?

三十二个全副武装的警卫
32 armed guards.

他杀了两个
He killed two.

它打电话过来了
It’s on the phone.

接起来 然后对他的电话进行定位
Put him on, and locate the phone he’s using.

喂
-[ Phone beeps] -Hello.

嗨 你能不能 呃 麻烦让我出去
Hi, urn, can you, uh [belches] please let me out?

你光是出现在这栋建筑里
Your mere presence in this building

就已经违反国际法了
violates international law.

即使你没有杀那两个人我也不能让你离开
I couldn’t let you out even if you hadn’t killed two men.

那两人算是自杀
You should know those men killed themselves.

怎么讲
PAVEL: And how is that?

他们不让我离开
They didn’t [belches] let me out.

Solen'ya
Solen ‘ya.

闭嘴 好好做你的事 他妈的小屁孩
Shut your mouth and do your jobs,you fucking children!

呃 现在是不太方便说话吗还是
Uh, is this not a good time or...

我的一些手下叫你"Solen'ya"
Some of my men are calling you “Solen’ya” --

意思是腌黄瓜人 一个愚蠢的传说
the Pickle Man, an old wives’ tale.

他会从冷掉的汤里爬出来
He crawls from bowls of cold soup

去偷浪费东西的小孩的梦
to steal the dreams of wasteful children.

要真是那样你可是走运了
That'd be a lucky break for you.

行动 直接射杀
Go, shoot to kill.

我们把他拿下了
[Russian accent] We got him.

因为本腌黄瓜
Because this pickle

根本不在乎你的孩子们
doesn’t care about your children.

而且我让他们失去的不是梦
And I’m not gonna take their dreams.

是他们的父母
I’m gonna take their parents.

Solen'ya 他来了
Solen ‘ya! He’s coming!

都是因为我把我吃了一半的三明治扔了
It’s because I threw halfway my sandwich!

他就是一根腌黄瓜
He’s just a pickle!

他是个怪物
He’s a monster.

他不是唯一的一个
He’s not the only one.

你可以待在这 不问世事直到死在这个房间里
You can stay dead to the world and die in this room.

或者为我杀掉一根腌黄瓜来重获自由
Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom.

只要你的领袖还有一口气在 就没有自由可言
There is no freedom while your leader breathes.

我们的国家就是一座监狱
Our country is a prison.

那么Catarina就是个囚犯
Then Catarina is a prisoner.

也许我也能安排她逃走
Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well.

她还活着 Jaguar
She lives, Jaguar.

那根腌黄瓜在哪
Where is this pickle?

你认为注射器里是什么 Beth
What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?

你是那个每小时收两百美元的人 你来告诉我
You’re the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.

- 抗腌黄瓜血清 - 是抗腌黄瓜血清
-Anti-pickle serum. -It’s anti-pickle serum.

你的孩子们认为可能是抗腌黄瓜血清
Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.

我的孩子尿在书桌上 吸没烧过的花瓶
My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.

他们只是气我和他们的父亲离婚
They’re just angry at me for divorcing their father.

我从没说过我生你的气
I never said I was angry at you.

所以你才会吸珐琅 Summer
That’s the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

你这样做是为了不用把
You do it so you don’t have to say,

"我生你的气 妈妈"大声说出来
“I’m angry at Mommy,” out loud.

哦 我的天啊 哦 这
Oh, my God! Oh, there --

里面有人吃屎的照片
there’s pictures of people eating poop in there!

表明立场或者做出批判并不是我的工作
It’s not my job to take sides or pass judgment.

你认为当你的父亲向你要注射器的时候
Do you think when your father asks for that syringe,

- 你可以问他 - 他没必要问我要 好吗
- you could ask him. - He won’t have to ask for it, okay?

他不需要
He won’t need it.

他只用再造就好了
He’ll just make more.

他不需要问任何人要任何东西
He doesn’t need anything from anyone.

你很崇拜他这一点
You admire him for that.

这总比把你自己的问题
It’s better than making your problems

变成别人的问题要好
other people’s problems.

噢 该死
Oh, come on! [Grunts]

腌黄瓜人 你应该知道这不是私人恩怨
Pickle Man, you should know this isn’t personal!

你也应该知道这句话多没新意
You should know that isn’t original.

他们抓走了我的女儿
They have my daughter.

为了再次见到她我愿意做任何事
There’s nothing I won’t do to see her again.

好吧 为了见我女儿很多事我不会做
Yeah, there’s lots I wouldn’t do to see my daughter,

但是杀死你能让我快些见到她
but killing you gets me to her quicker

而不是听你毫无创意的屁话
than your derivative bulishit.

我不说屁话 腌黄瓜人
I never bulishit, Pickle Man.

只有我们中的一个死了才能有个了结
This can only end with one of us dead,

而我从没死过
and I have never died.

那你就要死在这上面了 Jaguar
That will be your downfall, Jaguar,

不愿接受新的经历
not being open to new experiences.

搞定了吗
Is it done?

Jaguar
Jaguar?!

Jaguar失败了
Jaguar couldn’t make it.

动手吧
PAVEL: Do it.

你赢了 腌黄瓜人
Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

我现在就把这幢楼解封
I’m unsealing the building.

不用了 谢谢 我来找你了
No, thanks. I’m coming for you now.

腌黄瓜人 二楼的保险箱里
Pickle Man, there’s $100 million worth of bonds

有价值一亿美元的债券
in a safe on level two.

我把密码告诉你
Ill give you the combination.

那些钱属于人民
That money belongs to the people.

闭嘴蠢货 给我叫直升机
Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick!

成交吗
Do we have a deal?!

把那钱给Jaguar的女儿
Take that money, give it to Jaguar’s daughter

把她放了
when you set her free.

否则我不会放过你
Or I’ll be visiting you.

Jaguar的女儿已经死了
PAVEL: Jaguar’s daughter is dead.

所以你是骗子
Huh, so you’re a liar.

Jaguar是头野兽
PAVEL: Jaguar was an animal.

而你是根聪明的腌黄瓜
You’re an intelligent pickle.

我们两个能谈生意
We can do business.

我看不行 一会儿见
I don’t think so. See you soon.

- 直升机到了吗 - 到了
-Is the helicopter here? -Yes.

警察也在路上了
And the police are on the way.

要怎么跟他们说
What do we tell them?

啊啊啊
-Ooh! -Aah!

跟他们说我们被抢了
Tell them we were robbed.

嘿 你在干什么呢
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?!

我在这儿
I’m right here!

永别了 Solen'ya
Farewell, Solen’ya.

F-15战斗机出动了
F-15s are scrambled.

这架直升机七分钟之内会被击毁
This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.

嗯 我五分钟后能见到我女儿
Well, my daughter is about five away,

我还有八分钟可以活
and I’ve got about eight to live.

腌黄瓜人 我已经来不及和女儿说
Pickle Man, it’s too late for me to tell my daughter

我爱她了 但你可以
I love her, but not for you.

哦 没事 她知道的
Oh, well, uh, she knows.

我们不相信那种废话
I mean, we don’t really buy into that kind of crap.

如果爱是表达慢慢建立的熟悉感
To the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time,

那向我敞开的无尽的时间线
my access to infinite timelines

使得建立情感依赖根本没有必要
precludes the necessity of attachment.

我甚至在某个地球上
In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters

抛弃了我无数多女儿中的一个
in an alternate version of earth

因为那个地球全是变异体
that was taken over by mutants.

好吧 祝你好运
Okay. Good luck with that.

等等 我有没有无数多个女儿
Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?

没有 不好意思
Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that.

只有我有
Nope, just me.

妈呀
Yeesh!

我
I

担
am...

心
afraid...

我的孩子们会被开除
that my kids will get expelled.

很好 Summer 轮到你
Good. Summer, you go.

我很不爽
I am mad...

大家都觉得我吸珐琅
that I can’t huff enamel

是因为我的家庭有问题
without people assuming it’s because my family sucks.

我希望有一天 在大家眼中
I hope to be seen one day

我只是个单纯喜欢嗨的人
as someone that just likes getting high.

很好
Good job.

Morty 你要来说说"我"的宣言吗
Morty, do you have an “I” statement?

我为
I am sad...

尿尿难过
that I peed.

我为我在课堂上而不是在厕所里尿尿感到难过
I’m sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.

瞧瞧这一家子 你们真棒
Look at this family go. You guys are pros.

你们觉得每周进行一次心理咨询怎么样
What do you guys think about doing this once a week?

呃
Ugh..

- 想必你就是Rick - 没错
-You must be Rick. -Mm-hmm.

我今天听了很多关于你的事
I’ve heard a lot about you today.

你的家人都对你很上心
Your family is crazy about you.

你对于你女儿来说很重要
Your daughter holds you in very high regard.

你真是个幸运的人
You’re a lucky fella.

是啊 谢谢
Yeah, thank you.

呃 亲爱的
Uh, sweetie,

你包里不会碰巧还装着那个注射器吧
you don’t still happen to have that syringe in your purse?

爸
Dad...

我希望你能告诉我注射器里是什么
I would like you to tell me what’s in the syringe.

一种我 呃 赖以存活的血清
It's a serum that I need to, uh -- to stay alive.

我今天诸事不顺
I have had a rough day.

而且 呃 我还身负重伤
And, uh, I’ve sustained a lot of damage.

我濒临死亡 这管血清能救活我
I’m pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.

通过让你从腌黄瓜变回人类
By changing you from a pickle to a human.

是的
Yes.

Rick 你为什么要骗你女儿呢
Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?

这样我就不用来这儿
So I wouldn’t have to come here.

你为什么不愿意来这儿呢
Why didn’t you want to come here?

因为我看不起心理咨询 因为我是个科学家
Because I don’t respect therapy, because I’m a scientist.

因为我以发明 改造 创造 和毁灭为生
Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy

只要我不喜欢这个世界的某些部分
for a living, and when I don’t like something

我就去改变它
about the world, I change it.

我并不认为 到一个商业街里租来的办公室来
And I don’t think going to a rented office in a strip mall

听一个典型的平庸之辈
to listen to some agent of averageness

给我解释哪个词表达哪种感受
explain which words mean which feelings

可以解决问题
has ever helped anyone do anything.

我觉得这能让很多人安心
I think it’s helped a lot of people get comfortable

并且不再恐慌 这是一种
and sTop panicking, which is a state of mind

待宰动物才需要的心态
[burps] we value in the animals we eat

这不是我想要的
but not something I want for myself.

我又不是头牛
I’m not a cow.

我是个腌黄瓜 只要我愿意我就是
I’m a pickle -- when I feel like it.

所以 这就是你要的答案
So...you asked.

Rick 你无可置疑的智识
Rick, the only connection between

与破坏你家庭的疾病之间的唯一联系
your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness

就是你家庭中的所有人
destroying your family is that everyone in your family,

包括你 都用智识证明这种病态是合理的
you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.

你似乎时而认为你的心智
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind

是一种无法阻挡的力量 又认为它是一种无法避免的诅咒
as an unsToppable force and as an inescapable curse.

我觉得那是因为 对你而言
And I think it’s because the only

唯一真正难以理解的概念
truly unapproachable concept for you

是掌控自己的心智
is that it’s your mind within your control.

你选择来到这里
You chose to come here.

你也选择用谈话来贬低我的职业
You chose to talk, to belittle my vocation,

—如你选择成为一个腌黄瓜
just as you chose to become a pickle.

你是你自己宇宙中的主宰
You are the master of your universe,

可你却浑身滴着老鼠血和排泄物
and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces,

你强大的心智因你自己像真正的植物一样无力
your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.

我一点不怀疑你会无意识地对心理咨询感到厌烦
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless

如同我在刷牙和擦屁股时
by therapy, the same way I’m bored when I brush my teeth

感到厌烦一样
and wipe my ass.

因为修补
Because the thing about repairing,

维持和清理这些事都不是冒险
maintaining, and cleaning is it’s not an adventure.

做这些事就算犯再大的错也不至死
There’s no way to do it so wrong, you might die.

只是工作罢了
It’s just work.

而结果是
And the bottom line is,

有些人觉得去工作挺好 而有些人
some people are okay going to work, and some people...

有些人宁愿去死
well, some people would rather die.

我们每个人都可以选择
Each of us gets to choose.

时间到了
-[ Watch beeps] -That’s our time.

我会给你们我的名片
I’m going to give you guys my card

期待你们的消息
and hope to hear from you again.

如果你们有任何吃大便的朋友亲戚
And if you have any friends or family that eat poop

且想要停止的话 给他们我的号码
and would like to sTop, give them my number.

我
I, um...

不好意思为了脱身我撒谎了
I’m sorry I lied to get out of the thing.

我 我不该对你撒谎的
-I -- I shouldn’t lie to you.

没事的
Oh, it’s fine.

谢谢 不过没错 你不该撒谎
I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn’t.

但我希望你明白这次咨询
But I hope you know that’s not what

本不该是这样的
that session was supposed to be.

不不 我知道是有关Morty尿裤子
Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants

Summer吸胶还是什么事的
and Summer snorting glue or whatever...

她吸了珐琅 我们竟然从来没谈过这事
She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.

还有那么多要紧事呢
RICK: Well, there was so much more at stake.

那心理医生 真能说
RICK: I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.

我们以后还会去吗
Are we gonna go back?

宝贝 能给我那个注射器了吗
Sweetie, could I get -- get that syringe now?

天啊 当然能了爸 它在我包里
Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it’s in my purse.

真不好意思 你一定很痛苦
Oh, I’m sorry. You must be in agony.

哎
Eh.

天啊
Jesus.

老天啊 这些个心理咨询师
Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.

怪胎一堆
Weird breed.

我真怀念有手臂
Man, I missed having hands...

有血还有胃
and blood and a stomach.

我们应该喝一杯
We should get a drink.

真的吗 找个地方喝一杯
Really? Like, go somewhere?

对 把孩子们送下车 去喝个酩酊大醉
Yeah, let’s drop the kids off and go tie one on.

妥妥的
Absolutely.

我 我挺喜欢她的
I-I liked her.

那你怎么想 去斯莫奇酒馆
So what are you thinking, like, Smokey’s Tavern?

或者肖尼斯
Maybe Shoney’s?

哪个都行 哪个都行
Yeah, either one. Either one.

你不可能逍遥法外的 协奏怪人
RICK: You’ll never get away with this, Concerto.

这就是你所犯的错了 Sanchez先生
That is where you’re mistaken, Mr. Sanchez.

这将是我有史以来最精彩的演出
This shall be my greatest performance of all time!

完了 Morty 我们死定了
RICK: This is it, Morty. We’re goners.

这次我们逃不掉了
We’re not getting out of this one.

我们一起经历了那么多
After everything we’ve been through,

我们就要这么死掉了
this is how we’re gonna die.

向神祈求安息吧
Make peace with your god.

天啊 Rick 我我我不想死
Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don’t want to die!

现在 最后一砸
And now for the E-splat!

Jaguar
Jaguar!

谁 那是谁啊 Rick
Who -- Who was that, Rick?

那就是为什么别去心理咨询
That, Morty, is why you don’t go to therapy.

S03E04

拖车公园常常是地痞流氓和瘾君子的聚集地

别放过任何一只 Morty
Don’t let any of those things get away, Morty.

如果他们的DNA进入地球的食物链中
It their DNA gets into Earth’s food chain,

我们整个物种都可能绝育的
our entire species could be sterilized.

那为什么不杀了它们
Then why aren’t we killing them?

是哦 等我想让某个物种绝育的时候
Right, next time I need a species sterilized,

谁能帮我干这活 你吗
who’s gonna do it for me, you?

哇 Rick
-[ Humming] -Whoa! Rick!

那 那是守护信号灯吗
I-Is that the Vindibeacon?

守护者们召唤我们去集结了
We’re being called to assemble by the Vindicators!

这种字面意义上"冒险的召唤" 我拒绝 Morty
I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty.

- 让它转到语音信箱吧 - Rick
-Let it go to voicemail. -Rick,

只有在宇宙受到威胁时 守护者才会发出召唤
the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake.

他们是抵挡邪恶的第一道防线
They’re the first line of defense against evil.

他们是无人守卫之人的守卫者
They’re the guardians of the unguarded!

他们是自己新闻稿的撰写人 Morty
They’re the writers of their own press releases, Morty.

他们是一群戏精 事情闹大时
They’re a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking

他们花一个小时嘴炮 二十分钟乱跳
and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up.

他们只是昙花一现
They’re a phase.

我们搞过一次 那年夏天的大热点 现在就让它安然过气吧
We did one.It was the big event of that summer.Let it die.

我 Morty Smith 援引我的权利
I, Morty Smith, invoke my right

每十次Rick与Morty的冒险 自主选择一次
to choose one in every 10 Rick and Morty adventures.

- 我干他妈啊 - 读了哭去吧
-God fuckin’ damn it! -Read ‘em and weep.

好吧 但是别说我没警告你
Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.

好耶 守护者指挥舰 信号已接收
Yes! Vindicator Command Ship -- beacon received.

守护者联盟II要来啦 呜呼
We’re doing Vindicators Twoooooo!

哎呀
-[ Squish! -Whoops.

呃 Morty 你大概需要冷冻些精子了
Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.

守护者
SUPERNOVA: Vindicators,

灭世者回来了
Woridender is back,

而这次 他要终结的不止是各个世界
and this time he’s out to end more than worlds.

我们有理由相信他的要塞位于
We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on...

- 我的蛋上 - Rick
-My balls. -Rick!

旱地星系
the Terraneous system.

一旦到达范围内 万蚁将扫描费洛蒙活动
Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity,

引导我们找到他基地的位置
which should lead us to the location of the base.

哦 那是万蚁
Oh, that’s Million Ants.

我从这儿看不见蚂蚁
I can’t see the ants from over here.

我寻思那就是个 呃 屎人
I just assumed that was, uh, turd man,

蠕动的屎人
wiggly turd man.

-Rick, sTop! -SUPERNOVA: Rick,you have something to add to the briefing?

- Rick 别说啦 - Rick 这次会议你还有什么要补充的吗
-Rick, sTop! -SUPERNOVA: Rick,you have something to add to the briefing?

有啊 就一些人物设计上的意见
Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.

嗯 这个家伙 这个 这 呃
Urn, this guy, the, uh -- the, uh...

我叫机械鳄
I am Crocubot.

对哦 机械鳄
[Laughs] Right, Crocubot.

所以 你一半是冷血无情的爬行动物 一半是
So, you’re half cold, unfeeling reptile, half...

同样冷血
also cold...

- 同样无情的机器 - 没错
-equally unfeeling machine. -Yes.

哇 所以你的起源故事是
Wow. So, your origin is what?

你你你掉进了装满冗余重复的大缸
Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?

牛啊
[ Laughs] Got damn!

菜菜 我们在开会呢
Noob Noob, we’re having a briefing.

请容我继续说 Rick
If I can continue, Rick.

我预计会遇到精密的安保设施
I anticipate sophisticated security measures.

相信这方面你能出力
I trust you can be of service there.

让我查查我的能力和弱点
Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses.

能力是能做任何事 但只在我想做的时候
Ability to do anything but only whenever I want.

嗯 听着像个适合我的活
Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.

我希望他有能力检查下他的态度
I wish he had the ability to check his attitude.

Alan Rails 女士们先生们
Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen.

自从他的双亲在一次铁路事故中悲惨去世
After his parents’ tragic death in a railroad accident,

他学会了召唤幽灵列车
he gained the power to summon ghost trains.

也不全是坏事
It's not all bad, though.

至少他的父母不用看到成年的儿子整天挂着个哨子(火车汽笛)
They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle.

太他妈逗了
Got damn!

谢谢你菜菜 这家伙听懂了
Thanks, Noob Noob. This guy gets it.

Vance Maximus 变节的恒星战士
Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier.

对不起来晚了 之前在享受欢乐时光(酒吧饮料减价)
Sorry I’m late. It was happy hour.

欢乐时光
-[ Laughter] -Happy hour.

我也因为喝酒迟到
Uh, I was also late because of my drinking

提到这点的时候 却没得到任何赞赏
and mentioned it to zero applause.

Rick Sanchez 恐怖修补者
Rick Sanchez. Tinkerer of Terror.

说起来真饶舌
Man, that’s hard to say.

这是 Morty 对吧
And...Morty, right?

- 哇 没错 - 我对孩子从来过目不忘
-Whoa, yeah! -I never forget a kid.

准备好了吗守护者们 让我们三发全中吧
What do you say, Vindicators? Let’s make this three for three.

- 哈哈 - 好
-Haha! -Yes!

他说"三发全中"吗
Did he say “three for three”?

他说他对孩子从来过目不忘吗
Did he say he never forgets a kid?

你说的是二发全中吧 Vance
You mean two for two, right, Vance?

其实我们在去年夏天组织了第二次任务
Actually, we assembled a second time last summer

对抗末世毁灭者
to fight Doomnomitron.

所以这是守护者联盟III
So this is...Vindicators Three?

守护者II没有邀请我们
And you guys did Vindicators Two.. .without us?

我感受到了 不安 缺爱
I sense.. .insecurity.

你确定不只是因为附近有野餐吗
Are you sure there’s not just a picnic nearby?

他算是找到观众了
I guess he found his crowd.

真的很没料哎大伙儿
Pretty toothless stuff, guys.

我希望你目前险冒得还算满意 Morty
I hope you’re happy with the adventure so far, Morty.

这群人比上次的还无聊
These guys are even lamer than last time.

上次我们不在你忘了吗
We weren’t here last time, remember?

上次的守护者任务没有带我们
They did a whole Vindicators without us.

而且死了很多人
A bunch of them got killed, too.

武士刀姬 卡吕普索 绿魔神
They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde --

可惜 刚才的队伍确实不那么多元了
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.

这篇文章说我们没有被邀请的原因是
This article says the reason we weren’t involved was...

"性格不合"
“personality conflicts.”

不要担心 他们很喜欢你 Morty
Don’t worry, Morty. They love you.

超级英雄们都需要一个没见过世面的无名之辈
Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along

全程跟着对他们做的事大惊小怪
and react to everything

好像他们有多了不起
like it’s mind-blowing.

我想 "性格不合"指的是
l...think the personality conflict might have been...

你
you?

天啊
[Spits] Jesus.

这得多带劲
How awesome is that?

他们宁愿牺牲三个有色人种英雄
I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad,

也不想要我加入
they murdered three innocent heroes of color

结果这次还是得叫我回来
and they still had to bring me back?

Rick 既然这是我的冒险
Rick, since it’s my adventure and all,

你能不能帮我个忙
could you do me a favor?

我来参加这个冒险本身就是在帮你忙 Morty
Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty.

我睡在这个床单上就是帮你忙
Me sleeping on these linens is the favor.

我们到底在守护个什么 舒适感
I mean, w-w-what -- what are we vindicating? Comfort?

Rick 这让我很郁闷
Rick, this really bums me out.

发现这些人不喜欢我们 太丢脸了
It-It’s embarrassing to find out these guys don’t like us.

为什么 Morty 比他们强得多的Gagoo怪
Why? Morty [burps] I defeat gagoos

我每周都要手刃好几个
more powerful than these guys every week.

对 但它们不是英雄
Yeah, but not heroes.

得了吧 他们只是叫自己英雄以此
Oh, please, they just call themselves heroes so they can --

我叫他们英雄 Rick 他们是我的英雄 我的
I’m calling them that, Rick! They’re my heroes. Mine!

萝卜青菜各有所爱
Huh, no accounting for taste.

我要去喝一杯
I’m gonna go get a drink.

早上好 守护者们
PA SYSTEM: Good morning, Vindicators.

飞船已抵达旱地星系
Ship has arrived at Terraneous system.

所有守护者请前往 简报室
All Vindicators report to the. . . briefing room.

那个 那个厅里面的
The -- The room from the, uh -- the --

不是那个 呃 会议室
Uh, it’s the d-it’s a different room than --than conference room.

抱歉 今天是我作为广播系统的第一天
I’m sorry, it’s my first day as a PA System.

新手日常紧张
First-day jitters. [Imitates radio crackle]

哦天呐
Oh, God.

早上好 看样子你外公度过了一个漫长的夜晚啊
Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night.

机械鳄 要不你送Sanchez先生
Crocubot, why don’t you escort Mr. Sanchez

去个更舒服的地方吧
to a more comfortable spot

这样别人就能 开始清理他的排泄物了
so that someone can[Sighs] clean up his diarrhea.

哦 马上就要执行第一次任务了 我好紧张
Oooh, I’m nervous about my first mission!

实际上 菜菜 我们有一个新任务给你
Actually, Noob Noob, you have a new mission.

- 遵 要命 - 守护者们 准备着陆
- Got damn.- Vindicators, prepare for arrival.

Morty 我跟其他守护者今天早上聊了一下
Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning,

恐怕我们要做一点小小的改变了
and I’m afraid we need to make a little change.

我 我完全能理解 实在太抱歉了
[Sighs] I-I totally get it. I-I’m so sorry.

你的确应该说抱歉
You should be,

因为你成天穿着那件黄色T恤
running around in a yellow T-shirtlike

好像你不是我们的一员那样 太丢脸了
you’re not one of us.Disgraceful.

我 我不是个超级英雄啊
I-I-I’m not a superhero.

请坐 老大
Cop a squat, chief.

宇宙中的每个人都是英雄
Everyone in the universe is a hero.

你所要做的 就是辨明正义与邪恶
All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad

然后坚持正义
and root for good.

但Rick说正义与邪恶都是人造的概念
Rick says good and bad are artificial constructs.

嗯 我觉得 他可能需要这么想吧
Yeah, well, I get the feeling...he kind of needs that to be the case.

不一起来了吗 菜菜
Not coming, Noob Noob?

哦 不了 我在这还有事要做
[Grunts] Ohh! No, uh, I got stuff to do here.

警卫无人机来袭
VANCE: Security drones inbound.

众星之母 赐予我你的愤怒
[Echoing ] Star grant me your Mother, wrath.

全体上车
-All aboard! -[ Whistle blows]

- 机枪炮台 - 你没事吧
-Gun turret. -Are you all right?

没事的 我只损失了400只蚂蚁
Yes. I only lost 400 ants.

我的蚁后正在产下更多蚂蚁
My queen is laying more.

我已经再次恢复到 "万蚁"了
I am back to...one Million Ants.

谁把Sanchez叫醒吧
Someone wake up Sanchez.

哦 天呐
Ugh! Oh, Christ.

- Rick 你醒了 - 勉强算吧
-Rick. You’re up. -Barely.

有一个自动机枪炮台在向我们开火
We’re taking fire from an automated turret.

- 你能让它失灵吗 - 嗯嗯
-Can you bring it offline? -U h-huh.

- 天呐 现在好多了 - Rick
-Uh, my God, that’s better. -SUPERNOVA: Rick!

嘿 如果我看不见我是没办法帮忙的
Hey, I can’t help if I can’t see.

其实我用幽灵列车也行的
I could’ve just used a ghost train.

是吗 真没想到 你原本可以用幽灵列车的啊
Really? You don’t say. You would’ve used a ghost train?

嘿 大家伙 这个幽灵列车男
Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy

本来可以用幽灵列车的呢
would have used a ghost train.

- 老兄 去你妈的 - 有咖啡吗
-Man, fuck you. -Is there coffee?

嘿 Morty 能帮个忙吗
Hey, Morty, can you be a pal?

外公把他的咖啡壶落在飞船上了
Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship,

你见过的 那个法压壶
you know, the French press thing --

自己去拿吧
Get it yourself.

今天早上有点暴躁啊 是不是
Little extra [burps] snippy this morning, aren’t you?

咱们把注意力集中在任务上 行不行
Just focus on the mission, all right?

哦哦 对不起 你是对的
Oh, oh, oh, I’m sorry. Oh, you’re right.

好的 严肃认真 要特别严肃对待这个任务 对吧
Ohh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?

去他个蒸汽机车 他们全都死了
Son of a Steam Engine. They’re all dead.

为什么灭世者要这样对他自己的人 以及几个女人
Why would Worldender do this to his own men...-and several women? -

嗯 他是灭世者嘛
Well, he is the Worldender.

终结世界的家伙 这就是他做的事
The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.

- 哦 真是可怕 - 真要保持警惕
Ohh, real scared. Real fuckin’ on alert,

在这里要高度警戒
high alert over here.

当心
Watch out!

这他妈是什么
What the tuck?!

是灭世者 他怎么了
It’s Woridender! What happened to him?

我感应到他的生命力正在衰退
I sense his life force is fading.

万蚁 女士们先生们
RICK: Million Ants, ladies and gentlemen.

其能力和一双人类肉眼没差别的蚁群
The ant colony with the power of two human eyes.

好吧 短暂的任务 不错的任务
RICK: All right. Short mission. Good mission.

记得Alan想用幽灵列车的吗
Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train?

在守护者联盟IV的时候再见吧 Morty
See you guys in Vindicators Four. Morty?

Rick 不管是谁做了这些都是比灭世者更大的威胁
Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Woridender.

我们不能现在离开
We can’t leave now.

他说得对 这事还远没有结束
He’s right. This is far from over.

好吧 你们好好玩
Well, have fun with that,

但是Morty和我得去见一个彗星女 一个单轨列车人
but Morty and I have to meet a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,

俩屁眼儿和一完整的鳄鱼 一小时内就要见
Two Assholes, and a Full Alligator in like an hour.

妈的
Shit.

我感应到了
I sense the presence

一个更邪恶的存在
of a greater evil.

试音 检查 一 二
DRUNK RICK: Check, check. One, two.

好了 在录了吗 很好
Okay. Is it recording? Good.

你们好 守护者
Hello, Vindicators.

欢迎来到你们的审判日 宝贝
Welcome to your reckoning, baby!

这下坐实了
Weip, it’s official.

昨晚我喝得太多了
I had too much to drink last night.

你们在看这个吗 你们是守护者
If you guys are watching this,you’re, you know, the Vindicators.

- 所以 现在我们知道 - Rick 到底怎么回事 老兄
-So, now that we know... -Rick? What’s going on, buddy?

显然 我昨晚喝大了跑来这里
Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.

"显然"
“0bviously”?

你到这里打败了我们的宿敌
You came here and defeated our arch nemesis

全程醉得根本不记得做了这事
while so drunk, you don’t remember doing it?

你觉得这叫"显然"
That’s something “obvious” to you?

听着 我是比你们更复杂了点
Look, I’m a Iit[burps] -- little more complex than you guys,

而且 无意冒犯 但我一直怀疑
and, no offense, but I’ve always suspected

你们花一年做的很多事
that a lot of what you do in a year

其实都能花几个小时就解决
could be knocked out in a couple of hours.

所以我就想 为什么不帮你们把你们的工作干了呢
So I thought why not just do your job for you

这样我们就能来玩一个有趣的小游戏了
so we can have a little fun game.

Rick 这 这是在玩"电锯惊魂"吗
Rick, is -- is this a “Saw” thing?

你真的要拿守护者玩电锯惊魂
Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators?

Morty 我是一个酒鬼 不是一个杀人狂魔
Morty, I’m a drunk, not a hack.

如果你违反规则 输掉游戏或者试图离开
If you break the rules, lose the game, or try to leave,

你将会死
you will die.

就像在"电锯惊魂"里一样
Like in [burps] “Sawwww.”

我觉得我们已经看够了
Well, I-I-I think we’ve seen enough.

我来看看怎么关掉这个
Ill just figure out how to unplug this.

好了 我们开始吧 第一间房
Okay, here we go. Room number one.

银河系无人不知守护者们
The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy,

但是他们了解他们自己吗 你了解你自己吗
but do they know yourselves -- do you know yourselves?

匹配你的 你的狗屁 你的 你的花招
Match your -- your shit, your -- your gimmicks,

和你的脸 就能解开 这是一道连线题
with your faces, and y-you get it.It’s a matching thing.

而且要在三分钟内完成 否则你们都会死
And do it in three minutes or you’ll [burps] all die.

去他的 我不会玩他的游戏
Screw this. I’m not playing his game.

我会为我们找到离开这里的路
I’m gonna find us a way out of here.

哇喔 哇喔 哇喔 等等 Vance
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance.

他说过了 你要是离开的话就会死
He said you’d die if you tried to leave.

说明这里有诱杀装置
That means there’s booby traps.

你怎么能表现得好像 那个人不是你一样
Why are you acting like that’s not you?

我"断片儿"了 你听不懂吗
What part of “blackout” don’t you understand?

你不是喝酒吗
I thought you drank.

喝酒应该是很拽酷 或者很性感的那种
Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking,

而不是你这种 喝得像个发神经的拖车公园流氓
not this psycho, trailer-park shit!

Vance 冷静点
Vance, stay calm.

你现在是老大了是吧 就因为我们给了你件夹克
Oh, so you’re the leader now, because we gave you a jacket?

你是那个有学习障碍的小孩 拍宣传照才用得上
You’re the learning-disabled kid we do photo ops with.

- 好吧 - 我去 - 但是 - 好吧
-Okay, ouch, but -- -Okay, this --

这里让我浑身难受 我需要空间
this is triggering me. I need space.

我我要离开这里
I-I need space from this!

给我一个
-[ Grunts] -Give me one reason

不捏爆你的气管的理由
why I shouldn’t crush your windpipe.

因为我的表皮交织了纳米纤维防护网
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.

而且 我说了 我不记得昨晚的事了
And because, like I said, I don’t remember last night.

都让你别他妈把这个老干尸请回来了
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back.

Alan 我并不以我在这里所做的事为傲
Alan, I’m not proud of what’s happening here,

但如果你继续攻击我
but if you keep coming at me,

那辆幽灵火车上又要多一位乘客了
there’s gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.

大伙儿 我做出来了
Guys! I figured it out.

恭喜你 回答正确
Congrats! You did i[burps]t!

就是个梗 所有的描述词对你们每个人都适用
It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you.

醉酒Rick是想说
Drunk Rick’s point

你们彼此并没有多么特别或多么不同
is that none of you are very special or different.

这也是他一直的观点
That’s always his point.

我们赶紧通过这里
Let’s just get through this as quickly as possible.

然后再慢慢跟你们俩算账
Then we’ll deal with the two of you.

我们俩 看你做的好事
The two of us? I hope you’re proud of yourself.

的确是好事啊 我他妈的拯救了全宇宙
Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.

这不是问题所在 Rick
That’s not the issue, Rick!

我要是没救下来 那不就是了吗
Ahh, it would’ve been if I hadn’t!

守护者说他们的工作
The Vindicators say their job

是与隐藏在各处的邪恶势力斗争
is to fight evil wherever it hides,

但他们没有做到 选出那个
but they don’t -- pick the location you’ll --

他们从来不提的地名
you’ll never hear them even mention,

因为与黑暗斗争 就是与自己斗争
because to fight darkness is to fight yourself

哦 我知道 多里安5号星球
Oh! I know this. Dorian 5!

机械鳄 别过去
Crocubot, don’t!

不可能是别的答案
There’s no other possible answer.

我的机械和爬虫类逻辑非常有把握
My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.

哦
-[ Squish! -Oh!

看来他鳄的部分比机械的部分多
Huh! I’m seeing more croc than bot here.

该死
God damn it!

- 多里安5号星球上发生了什么 - 没什么
-Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? -Nothing!

没什么 我们灭杀了一整个星球
Nothing? We exterminated a planet.

等等 什么
W-Wait. Huh?

末世毁灭者当时藏在那里 他会变形
Doomnomitron was hiding there! He’s a shapeshifter.

毁灭多里安5号是杀死他唯一的方法
Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him.

同志们 大家都知道是什么了
Come on, guys, we’re all thinking it.

别
Don’t -- [Coughs]

别逼我说出来
Don’t make me say it.

好吧 又得我上
Oh, okay. This again.

其实 我可以帮你做一个装置
You know [burps] I could have made you a device

从轨道上探测出末世毁灭者的位置 小菜一碟
to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like [snaps fingers] that.

我是想要你回来的 是Alan不想
I’m not the one that didn’t want you back. Alan was.

如果你再敢把这些死人的帐 算在我的头上
If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time --

不准威胁她
Do not threaten her.

恭喜你 回答正确
-[ Ding! ] -Congrats, you did it.

"以色列"又是个什么鬼
What the hell is “Israel”?

就是个Rick喝大了后喜欢
I-It’s just something Rick starts talking about

念叨的东西
when he’s blackout drunk.

啥 什么意思
W-What? In w-- In w-w-what way?

我想说什么
Like, w-w-what's my point?

某种意义上你什么都没说
In a way that has no point.

你只会念叨一些军事预算和联合国的事情
You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations

然后就不省人事了
and then you pass out.

说清楚了 我有时候
So, to be clear, I sometimes reference

会提及该话题在地缘政治上的复杂性
the geopolitical complexities of the Topic,

但这和反犹太可不是一回事
which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.

这事和我根本没关系
I have no stake in this.

我也是 我只是说 恰恰相反
I don’t, either. I’m -- I’m just saying, if anything,

喝醉的那个我或许超级支持以色列
the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel

他想要给它最好的
he wants what’s best for it and --

嘿 我可不管这种事 你自己操心去吧
Hey, man, I’m not touching this. You do you.

Aloha 在夏威夷的意思是哈喽和拜拜
Aloha.. .means hello and goodbye in Hawaii.

但是 aloha的意思
But, uh, aloha means --

和这间屋子没什么关系
has nothing to do with this room.

我真是喝高了
[Coughs] I’m so fuckin’ drunk.

好啦 是这样的
Ugh, okay. Here’s the deal.

我想歇会儿眼睛
I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit.

我不会睡着
I’m -- I’m not going to sleep.

我只是需要休息一下眼睛
I just -- just need to rest my eyes,

所以这次简单点
so let’s make this one simple.

只需要 投几个三分球
Just. . . try to hit some three-pointers.

这样吧 你必须射中 五个三分球
Let’s say.. .you have to hit. . . five three-pointers

在 五分钟的时限之内 要么 我也不知道
in. . . five minutes. . . or -- I don’t know --

整个这个地方 整个星球都会
the whole place -- the whole planet will get blown up

被一个中微子炸弹炸上天
-with a n-neutrino bomb. -[ Beep]

而且你们要以此反省自己
And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves,

比如 想想自己多么自私
like -- like how selfish you are --

之类的事情
are or something.

还有 夏威夷
And also Hawaii.

你们这些人去投篮
[Sighs] You guys hit the baskets.

我去拆那个借酒性装上的中微子炸弹
I’ll disarm the drunkenly improvised neutrino bomb.

有40%的可能这是个哑弹
There’s a 40% chance it’s a dud,

但你们还是应该离远点
but y-you should still stay back.

Morty 你拆过多少
Morty, how many of these --

太多了 Rick 太多了
Too many, Rick! Too many!

老天 我今天真被说教了不少次
Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.

三分球进了
-[ Ding ] -That’s a three-pointer.

- 好球 - 谢谢你
-Nice shot. -Thank you.

你们两个配合得很好
You two make quite a team.

我们都配合的很好
-[ Groans] -We all do.

我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

三分球进了
-[ Ding ] -That’s a three-pointer.

但是你们之间一直有种 无言的默契
But you guys have always had a -- an unspoken bond.

我是指 真的 不可言说
I mean really unspoken.

是那种 不要告诉我丈夫的那种 不可言说
Like, let’s-not-tell-my-husband unspoken.

我们现在不是夫妻了 Alan
We aren’t married anymore, Alan.

没错 但你俩"滞留"在德尔菲6号星
Sure, but were we married

整整三天时 我们是夫妻吗
when you two were “stranded” on Delphi Six for three days?

因为我在你回来的时候感应到了异样
Because I sensed something was weird when you came back,

但我哪懂什么感应能力
but what do I know about sensitivity?

我只不过是一个幽灵列车员罢了
I’m just a phantom train conductor.

你才是日了我老婆的那堆虫子
You’re the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!

三分球进了
-[ Ding ] -That’s a three-pointer.

导线他妈在哪儿
Where the fuck is the lead wire?

你总是把它放到最奇怪的地方
You always put it in the weirdest place.

会不会在这儿呢
Urn, uh, over here maybe?

天呐 这个中微子炸弹质量可真差
Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.

要真能用这玩意毁掉什么东西也是奇迹了
It's a miracle I ever actually destroy anything.

噢 是吗
Oh, I don’t know.

你今天可毁了不少东西呢
You managed to destroy just about everything today.

坏人 好人
The villains, the heroes,

他们之间的界限 还有我的童年
the lines between them, my childhood.

谢谢了哈 Morty 我很感激
Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty.

我知道你含着守护者的鸡巴
I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid

尝到了不少甜头
out of the Vindicators’ dicks,

所以要承认我说的是对的
so the fact that I was right about them

对你来说肯定很难吧
must be pretty hard to admit.

没错 Rick 知道为什么吗
Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick?

因为当你犯浑的时候
Because when you’re an asshole,

不管你说得多有道理
it doesn’t matter how right you are.

没人会乐意让你得意的
Nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.

我知道 大家都希望自己喜欢的人是正确的
I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right.

所以受欢迎的人才他妈那么蠢
That’s why popular people are fucking dumb.

所以你那帮装模作样 人设差劲
And why your pretentious, poorly written,

预算成堆的朋友们
high-budget friends back there

才能吃到双层夹便三明治
can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.

成功拆除
Disarmed.

天呐 你嫉妒他们
Holy shit. You’re jealous.

对 这下你开心了吧
Yes! Is that what you want to hear?!

感觉爽吗
Did it feel good?

你是喜欢他的六百万条蠕动的腿
Did you like his six million wriggling legs

胜过喜欢我饱经悲剧
more than my tragedy-stricken,

- 半魂半肿的巨根吗 - 停下来
- half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?! - Guys, sTop!

你们只是在证明我的混蛋外公是对的
You’re just proving my asshole grandpa right!

你竟然以为这都是为了性 我们可是相爱过的
You wish this was about sex! We loved each other!

- 我们曾经有过孩子 - 啥
-We had a child together! -What?!

我和万蚁孕育出一个孩子 但胎死腹中
I conceived a child with Million Ants,and it died inside me

因为那里面除了一半的万蚁 还有一半的塌缩恒星
because it was half a million ants and half collapsing star!

而且 他确实比你强
And yes. He was better than you.

是吗
Yeah?

比你强一百万倍
One million times better.

全体上车 傻逼
All aboard, motherfucker!

停
[Echoing ] STop!

没想到会这样
Oof! Didn’t see that coming.

还说风凉话
Is that sarcasm?

等这一切结束后 我不会放过你的
I don’t want you slipping away when this is over.

这些人都是被你害死的
All of these deaths are on your hands.

好吧 可能有几个吧
Okay, come on, maybe a couple of them,

但这位列车员可不怪我
but definitely not the Train Guy.

全都是
-Oof! -All of them.

好吧
Okay.

祝贺 你成功了
-[ Dinging -Congrats. You did it.

现在我很清楚了
All right, by now, I’ve been pretty clear

守护者满嘴喷粪
that I think the Vindicators are [coughs] full of shit.

但你们确实有一样东西独一无二
But.. .you do have one thing that I’ll never have.

这也是对我来说唯一一个
And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators

有价值的东西
with any value to me.

如果你们知道是什么 把它放在平台上
If you know what it is, place it on the platform.

要是猜错了 这个星球就会爆炸
Guess wrong, and the pla-planet will explode.

也许整个太阳系都会毁灭
And probably the solar system,

因为我这次有他妈仔细检查过这上面的
‘cause I kind of fuckin’ eyeballed the neutrino bombs

中微子炸弹
on this one.

他在耍什么花样 Morty 你是最了解醉酒Rick的
So what’s the trick? Morty, you’re the Drunk Rick expert.

我觉得 不管放什么上去 我们都会死
I think...no matter what we put on there, we die.

他说这是守护者让他看重的一点
He said it’s the part of the Vindicators he values.

这就意味着没有
That means nothing.

他想让我们活着的最后时刻
He wants our last moment alive

都用在弄清我们在他眼里一文不值
to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.

老天 好吧 其他人的意见呢
Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions.

有可能 有可能是Morty
It could -- It could be Morty.

- 啥 - 嘿 我不清楚
-What? -Hey, I don’t know.

我的意思是 当我喝醉的时候
I mean, look, when I get drunk,

我会变蠢 情绪化 毫无逻辑可言
I get stupid and emotional, and there’s no logic to it.

就像是 我很有可能喝太醉了
It’s, like, it’s possible I got so drunk

以至于我感觉守护者抢走了 Morty
I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators,

也许这就是我的表达方式
and maybe this is my way of saying, “Okay,

"好吧 你们可以带走他 只要你们明白他有多重要的话"
you can have him, but only if you know how important he is.

"否则的话 我杀了你们"
Otherwise, I’ll kill you.”

这真是一个 非常具体的猜想
That is a... really specific guess.

听着 我 因为这房间里只有我们
Look, I-I -- There’s nothing in the room but us.

我只是用逻辑稍作分析
I’m just using logic to connect some dots.

想不出更好的可能性了
It’s the best guess I’ve got.

但你这是在赌我们的命
But you’re betting our lives on it.

我来赌 我懂的
I’ll cover that bet. I get it.

Morty 我想你挂着一脸得意的笑
Well, Morty, I think you’re doing that smirky face

是因为你对当前有错误的理解
because you’re misinterpreting the moment.

我不是因为我对你有什么隐藏的爱而忸怩
I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.

我想说清楚 如果有人有更好的想法
I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess,

像是 如果我昨晚给了你个护身符 或者
like, if I gave you an amulet last night or --

呼
-Phew. -[ Both sigh ]

糟糕
Oh, shit.

对不起 我 并不擅长说再见
Sorry. I’m... not good at goodbyes,

而且 我醉了 所以 你知道的 我只是
and I’m drunk, so, you know, I just...

看起来我再也不会与你相见了
It looks like I’m never going to see you again.

我受不了英雄这种东西
I can’t really roll with the hero types.

而且 我不 他们也不想我出现
And I don’t -- They -- They don’t want me around.

但是我想让你知道 尽管有时候我没有表现出来
But I want you to know, even if I didn’t show it at the time,

我真的很感谢你陪在我身边
I really appreciated you sticking by me.

该死的 为什么我在流泪 这说不通
God damn it, why am I crying? It makes no sense.

你 你可能有些困惑
Ugh, you’re -- you’re probably confused

因为我们对对方所知甚少
because we barely knew each other,

但你真的有为了我犯险
but you really stuck your neck out

给我超棒的笑话撑场
[burps] when you gave me props for my awesome jokes

在那个简报室里
in the briefing room.

所有人都把他们的脑子搁屁眼里
Everybody else had their head so far up their ass.

甚至我自己的外孙都是
Even my own grandson is like,

"哇 守护者 他们好酷"
“Oh, the Vindicators, they’re so cool.”

我是说 他是个白痴 他们就是这种人
I mean, he’s a moron. That’s their demographic.

但是你不一样 菜菜
But you’re different, Noob Noob.

这老逼
Motherfucker.

你他妈的很酷 你也很聪明
You’re fucking cool. And you’re smart.

我打赌我们可以哪天一起出去嗨
[Crying ] And I bet we could’ve hung out and shit.

我希望你能正式成为守护者的一员
And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator,

还有 就是 帮我个忙
and -- and do -- do me a favor.

不要 不要让他们知道我变得这么情绪化
Don’t -- Don’t let them know I-I got emotional.

但是你可以告诉他们一件事
But you can tell them one thing.

告诉他们我说了
Tell them i said-Oh,

卧槽 我屎拉身上了 晚点说
fuck. Okay. I just shit myself Okay, later.

- 什 兄弟 Morty 发生什么了 - 闭嘴
-W-- Dude, Morty, what happened? -Shut up.

我感到这意味着我们不会死了
I sense this means we are not dying.

不是我们所有人
Not all of us.

甜心
-[ Both choking ] -Sweetheart.

就让你的咪咪豆下手吧 我的蹭蹭
Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.

这是为了大家好
IVs for the greater good.

- 大家好 - 咪咪豆
-Greater good? -Titty Bean?

就像你说过的 Morty
It's like you said, Morty.

- 不存在什么对与错 - 从没说过这种话
-There’s no right or wrong. -Never said that.

正是银河系给予守护者的信念
It’s the galaxy’s faith in the Vindicators

确保了星系的安全
that keeps the galaxy secure.

真对 一下就感觉安全了
Yeah, I feel safer already.

那可不 这下活儿干的好不好该问谁啊
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?

我得说 边被掐死
I will say we are getting some good licks in

- 我们嘴炮还是打得响亮 - 是吧
-while choking to death -- -Right?

咪咪豆 听我说
Titty Bean. Listen to me.

在你走近我之前
When you came to me,

我只是个勉强有知觉的蚁群聚落
I was merely a sentient colony of ants.

是你的信仰 你对正义的追求
It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice

教会了我成为一个真正的人
that taught me to be a man.

一切何时变得这么复杂的
When did it get so complicated?

谁知道呢 不过我们可以让它重归单纯
Who knows? But we can make it simple again.

你总是这么浪漫
You were always the romantic.

所以你也不能留下
Which is why you can’t leave, either.

我很抱歉 亲爱的
I’m sorry, my love.

卧槽 她居然背叛了蹭蹭
Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!

安静 我要好好享受
Silence! I’m going to enjoy this.

让我们衷心感谢Rick Sanchez

嗯 那玩意儿估计会射穿我
Hmm. Well, that’s gonna shoot through me.

Morty 你穿了件守护者的外套耶
Morty, you’re wearing a Vindicator jacket.

你现在是小超级英雄了吗
Are you a little superhero now?

宇宙里的所有人都是英雄 妈
Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom.

所以我们根本不需要这些外套
Which is why we don’t need jackets.

我很确定我们也不需要守护者
And I’m pretty sure we don’t need Vindicators.

你不要我要
Don’t mind if I do.

嘿 各位 瞧瞧谁当上了守护者呀
Hey, everybody! Look who’s a Vindicator!

- 天哪 Rick外公这一看就是宿醉脸 - 闭嘴 Summer

I can’t believe we’re getting Gear Cream with a Vindicator.

你们是在上齿轮大学还是齿轮
So, you girls in Gear college or Gear --

外星人恐怖袭击
-[ Explosion] -Alien terror attack!

好吧 听起来是我的任务
Okay. Sounds like a job for.. .me.

我最好改换我的秘密身份
I better go get into my alter ego.

- 真酷 - 是啊
-[ Gasps] So cool. -I know.

等一下 什么秘密身份
Wait, what alter ego?

他已经穿着外套了啊
He was already wearing the jacket.

要学会何时拿起何时
Gotta know when to hold ‘em and --

啊
Aaaaah!

S03E05


Jeff Goldblum 美国著名演员 常演科幻类作品

<The Big Chill> 即<山水又相逢> Jeff Goldblum主演的喜剧 讲述七个室友重逢的故事

Clive Barker 英国剧作家 导演和演员 作品有<养鬼食人><夜行骇传>等

Jerry Jerry 快起来
-[ Gasps] -Jerry! Jerry, come on!

我们得走了 你快跟我走 Jerry
We got to go! You got to come with me, Jerry!

- Rick - 非常重要 Jerry
-Rick? -IVs important, Jerry.

你肩负着整个星系的命运
[Burps] The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders.

快走 穿上裤子
Let’s go. Put some pants on.

算 算了 也没时间穿裤子了 Jerry
N-Never mind, there’s no time for pants, Jerry.

路上我再给你做一条吧
Ill make you a pair of pants on the way.

这是Rick和Jerry的冒险
IVs a Rick and Jerry adventure!

这是Rick和Jerry的一集
Rick and Jerry episode!

然后我就想 "嘿 Jerry怎么样
Then I thought, “Hey, what about Jerry?

他 他很接地气"
He’s -- He’s good with regular folk.”

在这种情况下他 他
This is a real situation where -- where --

他肯定很吃得开
where Jerry could really shine.

他特会说服人
He’s a master convincer.”

Rick 我不是白痴 我知道你要干嘛
Rick, I’m not an idiot. I know what this is.

哦 好吧 我告诉Morty了
Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,

"爸妈离婚了 他们很伤心 但他会没事的"
“Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. He’ll be fine,”

但是我怕他担心你会 嘣
but I think he’s worried you’re gonna, you know...Pbht!

你也知道Morty有情绪的时候会怎么样
And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional.

会妨碍我工作
It impedes my work.

所以我和他说我会带你出来 让你做一回人生赢家
So, I told him I’d take you out and give you a win.

等一下 我儿子让你带我去
Wait. My son asked you to take me

这种施舍同情的冒险
on some kind of pity adventure

是为了防止我自杀
to keep me from killing myself?

等等 你以为这是要干嘛
Wait, w-what did you think it was?

我以为你要处决我
An execution.

天哪 你真得做一回赢家了
Geez! You really do need a win.

不 我不知道
No! I-I don’t know.

我是说 你也没给我做裤子 所以
I mean, you never made me the pants, so --

所以 你以为我会载着你
So, you thought I was gonna drive you

去星系中心
into the middle of the galaxy and shove you

把你扔到真空的太空里 任你下体外露吗
into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out?

而且如果这种事真的要发生了
And we’re seeing how you’d act

我们看到你的反应就是这样的
if that were about to happen?

妈呀 我这就给你做条裤子
I mean, shit, I’ll make you the pants right now.

给我两秒钟的时间
Take me two seconds to make you pants.

- 我家里有裤子 - Jerry 我做的裤子
-I have pants at home! -Jerry, if I make pants,

比你家里的裤子强多了
they’ll be better than your pants at home.

而且 如果我想杀你
Also, if I wanted to kill you --

啊 我知道 那肯定特别精彩
Yeah, I get it. It'd be amazing.

拜托 快载我回家吧
Please, take me home.

我会告诉我儿子咱们经历了一个超棒的冒险
I’ll tell my son we had an amazing adventure.

你要是觉得没差
Well, if it’s all the same,

那我们也得找个地方先把故事编好
could we go get our story straight?

因为你不会撒谎
Because you’re a terrible liar.

你刚才还说我特能说服人呢
You called me a master convincer!

你还真信了
You believed me?

哈 好像 挺高级啊
Huh. This seems...kind of fancy.

Jerry 告诉你吧 这相当于是
Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent

外星人的公路餐馆
of an alien truck sTop.

你没得参照
You have no frame of reference.

你在一个远超你想象的宇宙里
You’re in a universe beyond your imagining.

但是 没错 确实非常高级
But, yes, it is super fancy.

我来这儿就是为了让Morty开心
I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy.

我不会带你去危险的地方
I’m not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.

Rick Sanchez
-[ Grunts] -Rick Sanchez.

我告诉过你 如果再让我看到你出现在这
I told you if I ever saw your face in here again,

我就刺死你这猪猡
I would stick you like the pig you are.

Shnoop Bloopers 我也告诉过你 如果你真敢
[Coughs] Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried...

死的绝不会只有我一个
there’d be two funerals.

啊
Aaah!

有人吗
Someone?

啊 有人吗 来人啊
Uh, someone? Someone!

老朋友 好久不见啊
My friend! It has been too long.

真高兴又见到你 兄弟
RICK: Oh, it’s great to see you again, buddy!

没错 就是这样
-[ Both laughing ] -Yeah, you’re doing it.

Sanchez先生要什么我都请了
Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants!

这个度假村笼罩在永生力场里
The resort’s covered in an immortality field.

你不会死在这的 这儿的特色
You can’t die here. That’s the gimmick.

好吧 但是 这样教育小孩子不好吧
Okay, but still -- bad parenting.

有钱的傻逼不就这样吗
Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes.

他们花大价钱来这
They all pay Top dollar to come here

享受着不用承担后果的假期
and enjoy a consequence-free vacation.

没有死亡 没有疾病 不会缺胳膊少腿儿
No death, no disease, no dismemberment.

连心脏病都不会有
-[ Grunting ] -Can’t even have a heart attack.

我懂你意思
Got it. The perfect place

适合把全宇宙最脆弱生物带去的完美之地
to take the most fragile being in the universe.

我看得出来你在期待我的反驳
I can tell you expect me to refute that,

但你说的确实是真的
but it’s right on the money.

如果我没把你平安带回家
If I come home without you,

Morty不会善罢甘休
I doubt Morty’s gonna let me off the hook.

是啊 但如果你把杰夫高布伦带回家
Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum?

杰夫高布伦
Jeff Goldblum?

你他妈在说什么 Jerry
What the fuck are you talking about, Jerry?

天啊
[Spits] Jesus!

我操你妈
Holy fucking shit!

老兄 最近在干嘛 真是"山水又相逢"啊
Yo, what’s up, “Big Chill”?!

别进电子传送舱啊(<变蝇人>)
Don’t go into that telepod!

也许我们还真能在这次假冒险里找到乐子
Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure.

假冒险
On a fake adventure.

说起这个 我们该怎么跟Morty讲
Speaking of, what are we gonna tell Morty?

我不知道 但不管讲啥
I don’t know. But whatever it is,

这宝贝儿我们都还得再来几杯
we’re gonna need a couple more of these babies!

怎么了
-[ Sobbing] -What’s wrong?

妈 你觉得我性感吗
[Crying] Mom, do you think I’m hot?

呃 我并不觉得这有什么重要的
I...don’t think that’s something that matters.

所以 我不性感吗
So, I’m not hot?!

我是说 你不该把精力花在
I’m saying the part of you that cares about that

介意这种事情上面
is a part you shouldn’t give any energy to.

你没有正面回答我
That’s not an answer!

我又不是时尚杂志好吗
Because I’m not an issue of Cosmo, okay?

我是你妈 我还是个医生 而且
I’m your mother and a doctor, and --

我好丑啊
I’m hideous!

天啊 她是怎么了
Geez. What’s with her?

青春期少女那一套吧
Teenage-girl stuff.

这个是 马蹄拼的吗
Is that a.. .hoof collage?

这是完全合法的 如果你想问这个的话
It’s perfectly legal, if that’s what you’re wondering.

酷呃
Cool.. .zies.

"我们只是再也没什么共同语言了 Summer"
“We just don’t have anything in common anymore, Summer.”

哦 是吗 Ethan
Oh, yeah, Ethan?

那你和Tricia Lange又有什么共同语言啊
What do you have in common with Tricia Lange?

都喜欢法国电影吗
A mutual love of French cinema?

都认为碳排放税
The belief that a carbon tax

是解决气候变暖的唯一可行方案吗
is the only viable solution to climate change?

或者只是因为她有脱衣舞女一样的大咪咪吧
Or could it be her massive stripper titties?!

在这儿
[Gasps] There it is.

大咪咪来啦
Boob-ya!

就在这时 鱿鱼马拉凯来了
And that’s when Malakai the Squid King

撕下了他的脸 然后我的脸就露出来了
rips off his face, and beneath it is my face.

- 我喜欢这个故事 - 谢谢 先生
-l liked it. -Thank you, sir.

是哦 他当然喜欢了 看看他
Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him.

这傻逼有两个头和三个象鼻子
Motherfucker got two heads and three trunks.

好吧一会儿再说
All right, we’ll put a pin in it.

我得先去尿个尿
I’m gonna go take a leak.

这什么
What the...

我的手吹干了 我的手吹干了
Ah! My hands are dry! My hands are dry!

我叫Risotto Groupon
My name is Risotto Groupon.

我是这家餐厅的总经理助理
I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.

你有食客意见卡吗
Do you have any comment cards?

我可能有些建议想提
Because I might have some thoughts.

我的王国被别的势力所霸占了
My kingdom was usurped

使用的武器和科技
by force with weapons and technology

就是你岳父提供的
supplied by your father-in-law!

喂 他也霸占了我的王国啊
Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man.

他基本上害得我被赶出了自己家 他偷走了我的家人
He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family.

那么我们就是同一阵营的 你就没想过
Then we are brothers, and you have wondered

没有Rick 你的生活会是怎样的吗
what your life could have been without Rick.

想过 当然想过
Wondered? Sure.

我还想过着个阴道会是怎样的呢
I mean, I’ve wondered about having a vagina.

你会帮我杀了他吗
Would you help me kill him?

什么 不
What? No!

他是我老婆的爸爸 别想了
He’s my wife’s father. Move on.

你喜欢主题公园游吗
Do you.. .Iike theme-park rides?

你还真没想了啊
Oh, you really moved on.

那儿有个热门项目叫旋风狂翻
There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly.

在第一个旋儿和第三个翻儿之间
Between the first whiny and the third dirly,

乘坐的位置刚好会降到永生力场之外
the ride dips just outside the immortality field.

你是要我把Rick引向死亡吗
You’re asking me to lure Rick to his death?

我只是要你和Rick去玩一下而已
I’m only asking you to go on a ride with Rick,

一个人下来 没有Rick 然后回家
get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family,

继续猜想如果有个阴道 生活会怎样
where you can... wonder about having a vagina.

好了好了 这个过于具体的例子
Okay, okay, that was a very specific example

我就是凭空瞎举的
pulled from thin air.

我可不想被称作是阴道男
I don’t want to be known as the vagina guy.

Risotto 我们需要你 有人点了
Risotto, you’re needed. Someone ordered

新鲜疯儿傻傻和毛毛骚套餐
the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special.

我不是Rick
[Sighs dejectedly] Look, I’m not like Rick,

你可以自己选择要做什么
so you’re free to do as you please.

但是每一个人在生命中都要作出决定
But there comes a time in every man’s life

他贡献给世界的价值
when he must choose the foundation

到底是建立在
on which his legacy will be built --

是妥协之上 还是真刀真枪
one of compromise or one of blood.

真棒
Oh, yeah.

这就对了
That’s what I’m talking about.

啊呀 那另一边也多来点儿
Oops! Okay, a little more on the other side, then.

噢 别这样
Oh, come on!

天啦
[Gasps] Oh, geez!

啊快停下
Aah! STop!

那医院就让你带着一包马身上的部件
So, the hospital just let you walk right out of there

大摇大摆走出去了吗
with horse parts in a bag?

真是够了 Morty
For Christ’s sakes, Morty,

经历离婚的女人需要
women going through a divorce

通过创作发泄
need a creative outlet.

什么动静
-[ Crash ] -What was that?

Summer
Summer!

我来了 Summer
I’m coming, Summer!

这他妈是怎么了
What the hell happened?!

我们怎么把她变正常
How do we get her back to normal?!

我不知道 这东西很复杂
I don’t know, man! This thing is pretty complicated.

我 我来打给Rick
I-I’m gonna call Rick.

等一下 我们不能碰到一点问题
Well, hold on. We can’t just call your grandpa

就打电话给外公
whenever there’s a problem.

我们可以自己处理
We can handle this ourselves.

我不懂我们为啥要尝试自己处理
I mean, I don’t see the point in trying to.

这显然是Rick级别的烂摊子
This is obviously Rick-level shit.

我有医学学位
I have a medical degree.

所以这是你的目的吗
Is that what this is about?

你想证明自己
[-Like, you want to prove yourself?

没什么别的目的 Morty 怎么说话的
Oh, it’s not about anything, Morty. How dare you?

那就好 那我就打给…嗷
Okay, good. Then I’ll just call -- Ow!

Morty 我需要这个机会
Morty, I need this.

嘿Jerry 三象鼻说他知道一个地方
Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here says he knows a place

姑娘们都上赶着睡两脚兽
where the ladies drop panties for anyone bi-pedal.

我没什么兴趣
Yeah, I’m not really interested.

我的心依然属于Beth
My heart still belongs to Beth.

哦 好吧
Oh. Huh. Okay.

怎么 你觉得我没有机会
What, you don’t think I have a shot?

我可没说
I didn’t say that.

劳驾 我可以再来一杯这个吗
Excuse me. May I have another one of these?

马上就来
Coming right up.

Beth和我也不是一直都合不来
Hmm, things weren’t always so bad between Beth and me.

我们年轻的时候特别开心
We had some good times when we were younger.

可不嘛
Oh, yeah, I bet.

少女妈妈就是那时候诞生的
That’s how teenage pregnancy happens, my friend.

不全是
Yeah, no. [Chuckles]

直到几年前我们都挺好的
Things were pretty great, even until a couple of years ago.

Jerry 我听懂了
Jerry, I get it.

直到我搬进你们家之前都挺好的
That’s around the time I moved in with you guys.

哦 你说的没错
Oh, I guess you’re right.

Jerry 我希望你不是在说
Jerry, you know, I hope you’re not suggesting

我造成了你们婚姻的失败
that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up,

你和Beth的关系从你们相遇开始
because there are some major issues between you and Beth

就一直有很严重的问题
that have been there since you guys met.

敬你一杯 为了新的开始
Hey, to new beginnings.

为了旋风狂翻
To the Whiny Dirly.

旋风狂翻
The Whiny Dirly?

等等 发生了什么
All right, what’s going on here?

你什么时候变这么酷了
When did you get cool?!

你偷了我老婆之后
When you stole my wife!

那我很久以前就该这么做
I should have done that a long time ago!

我们要去旋风狂翻咯
We’re going on the Whirly Dirly!

旋风狂翻吧宝贝
Whiny Dirly, baby.

找到了 看这里
-[ Rumbling] -Aha, look at this.

写着"正常化"
It says “normalize.”

我敢说只要按这个的话
I bet if we just press that --

但是 要是这机器是蜘蛛人造的
But...if the machine was made by spider people,

正常就意味着有八条腿
normal would mean eight legs.

天呐 难道你又要来高谈阔论一番么
Oh, God! are you gonna go on another spiel

就像上次你对肉色蜡笔说的那段那样
like you did with the flesh-colored crayon?

我还是比较肯定这个"正常化"按键能让她复原的
I’m pretty sure “normalize” will make her normal.

我觉得这算是进步了
I’d call that progress.

- 她都成巨人了 - 但比例正常啊

好吧 这上写着"逆转" 准能搞定
Okay, this says “reverse.” Done and done.

我觉得这不是个好主意
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

别闹了 "逆转"还能有什么意思(里外翻转)
Oh, come on! What else could “reverse” possibly mean?

妈 快给Rick打电话
Mom, call Rick!

我让你的婚姻承受了太多的压力
I put a lot of strain on your marriage.

这对你是不公平的对不起
It wasn’t fair. I’m sorry.

我也没让它变得更和睦

我们得从这玩意上下来 我们得下车
We got to get out of this thing. We got to get out!

Jerry 干嘛啊 老兄
-[ Grunts] -Jerry, come on, man!

我们连第一个旋儿都没到呢
We haven’t even gotten to the first whiny.

不啦 这项目太烂了 特别无聊
No, no, this sucks. It’s so boring.

我觉得 我都快睡着了
I mean, I’m falling asleep here.

咱们还是下车然后顺着边上爬回去吧
Let’s just get out and crawl down the sides.

呃 快趴下趴下
Ah, get down! Duck down!

趴下来更好玩
It's more fun when you scrunch down.

Jerry 你在搞什么
Jerry, what the --

我日
Oh, shit.

Rick 看这 在那边有一个地方你可以杀了他
Rick, up here! There’s a spot where you can kill him!

好样的 Jerry
Good call, Jerry!

嘿 你是怎么知道那个地方的
-Hey, how’d you know about that? -Uh...

Lisa
Lisa?

所以说 Jerry 你是旋风狂翻的头号粉丝是吧
So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the Whiny Dinly, are you?

明显 不再是了
Not anymore. [Chuckles] Obviously.

但当你还是的时候 你是怎么知道那个地方的
But when you were, how did you know about it?

咱们说好的 Jerry Smith
We had a deal, Jerry Smith.

这名字其实特别的大众
It’s a really common name.

放松点 Rick
Now, take it easy, Rick.

你刚刚经历了一场严重的过山车事故
You’ve been in a serious roller-coaster crash.

现在还不是去思考
It’s -- It’s no time to be thinking about

在你这次谋杀未遂事件中到底谁扮演了什么角色的时候
who did or didn’t play a role in your attempted murder.

快把它弄走
[Screams] Get it off me!

它在吃我
It’s eating me!

好吧 我坦白 可以吗
Look, I confess, okay?

他们跟我说了你在这个星球上所做的坏事
They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet

也让我想起了你对我做的所有不好的事
and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me.

但后来你说很抱歉
But then you said you were sorry, and I realized

我就意识到你并不是个怪物 不像这个东西一样
you’re not a monster -- not like this thing.

妈啊 它可是把我抓牢了
Fuck! It's got me good.

你是在唬我是吧
This is a mislead, right?

其实你正在发明一个东西来救我是不是
You’re inventing a thing to save me.

那个东西叫刀 Jerry
That would be called a knife, Jerry.

早就被人发明了
It's been invented.

我在想办法离开这呢 一个座位就够了
I’m making a way out of here. One seat ought to do it.

对不起 我犯了一个错误
I’m sorry. I-I made a mistake.

- 我不会再犯了 - 没人有机会再犯
-I won’t do it again! -Nobody ever does.

你个自以为是的傻逼
You self-righteous piece of shit!

你抢走了我的家庭
You took my family!

我抢了你的家庭
I took your family?

你觉得咱俩到底是谁被抢走得更多
Who do you think had more taken from them

特别是你把你那20毫升液态
when you shot 20cc of liquid

梦想毁灭剂射进我女儿身体里的时候
dream-killer into my daughter?

她是Rick的女儿 Jerry 她本来还有那么多人生选择
She was Rick’s daughter, Jerry. She had options!

哎哟
Oof.

那些选择都消失了 因为她为你感到难过
That all ended because she felt sorry for you.

你表现得像个受害者 但你其实是一个迫害者
You act like prey, but you’re a predator!

你利用同情来诱骗你的受害者
You use pity to lure in your victims!

那就是你活下去的方式
That’s how you survive!

我活着是因为我无所不知
I survive because I know everything.

这个蛇活着是因为孩子们会到处乱跑
That snakes survives because children wander off,

而你活着就是因为人们会认为
and you survive because people think,

"哦 这个可怜的蠢货 他从来都交不到好运
“Oh, this poor piece of shit. He never gets a break.

我受不了那震耳欲聋的无言哀嚎
I can’t stand the deafening silent wails

来自他那颓丧的灵魂
of his wilting soul.

我想我只能雇佣他或者和他结婚"
I guess I’ll hire him or marry him.”

Rick Rick
Rick! [ Muffled ] Rick!

我就知道你不会让我死
I knew you wouldn’t let me die.

我从来没这么想过
That was never an option.

因为你没有儿子
Because you never had a son.

不 因为我需要一个活的有机体
No, because I need a living organism

用你身上沾着的吉布蛇胆汁来吸引一个斯莫格莱狂奔兽
coated in gibble snake bile to attract a shmooglite runner.

- 等等 发生了什么 - 好好利用自己的迷惑 Jerry
-Wait, what’s happening? -Use that confusion, Jerry.

它会让你扭动得更像一个被丢弃的新生儿
Itil make you wriggle more like an abandoned newborn.

我的天啊
-[ Low growling] -Jesus Christ!

搞什么 Rick
What the fuck, Rick?!

救命 救我
Help! Help me!

啊
Aaah!

往南20英里有一个太空港
There’s a space port 20 miles south.

我们就能登上一艘银河级游轮
We’ll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship

然后跳进一个虫洞
and jump through a wormhole that will put us

那会将我们送到银河系的范围内
within spitting distance of the Milky Way.

但是 嘿 重要的是过程
But, hey, it’s about the journey,

而不是终点 对吗 Jerry
not the destination, right, Jerry?

呆着别动 宝贝 妈妈还在连线
Just stay put, sweetie! Mom’s still on hold.

我骗了Rick带爸爸去冒险
I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure

迎合Rick对把他留在身边没有帮助
Kissing Rick’s ass isn’t gonna help him keep him around,

妈妈 那反而会使你失去其他人

就像我失去了Summer
Like I lost Summer.

嘿 你还没失去她呢
Hey, you haven’t lost her yet.

不 的确是这样 她走了
No, I definitely did. She’s gone.

该死的

如果你女儿问你她有没有吸引力的话
if she’s attractive?

- 我就说"有啊" - Morty 多恶心啊
-I’ll say, “Yes”! -Morty, gross!

Well, she’s gonna be super hot.

反正她妈妈会是Jessica
Her mother’s gonna be Jessica.

等等 Summer啥时候问的你

野营地吗 就那个名字听着像是
Campsite -- The one with the name that sounds like somebody

起了一半不想起了的那个
gave up halfway through naming it.

呃 弗拉巴拉巴营地
Uh. . .Camp Flabanabba!

Let’s get you the flakes, then.

好吧 但我不想要那个的
Okay, but it’s not what I wanted.

那 或许等下次你
Well, maybe next time, you won’t be

不再是这么个蠢逼的时候 你就能自己选了
such a dumb piece of shit and you can pick for yourself.

- 这样不好 - 你说啥
-That’s not nice. -What’s that?

你刚刚有争议性的想法了吗
Did you just have a controversial thought?

- 没 - 我也是这么想的 婊子
-No. -That’s what I thought, bitch.

把你自己锁进逃生舱
and lock yourself in the escape pod.

- 你不杀我们了吗 - 我只杀Rick
-You’re not killing us? -I’m killing Rick.

你可以走了 你对我构不成威胁 对任何人也是
You’re free to go. You’re no threat to me or anyone.

有点太刻薄了吧
Now you’re just being mean.

对啊 你也太刻薄了 虽然无意冒犯
Yeah, you’re mean! No offense.

要是刻薄的话就直接射杀你了 Jerry
Mean would be shooting you, Jerry.

这算是省了发子弹
This is saving a bullet.

回到你那在沉默中受辱的家庭里
Go back to your quietly ashamed family

你的余生就在
and live out the rest of your days

否认你渴望长阴道之中度过吧
in denial of your vagina fantasies.

那只是人人都有的一时的想法
It was a one-time thought that everyone has!

你在干嘛
What are you doing?

我在表现耀武扬威般的勇敢
I’m being triumphantly brave!

这不叫耀武扬威也不叫勇敢
It’s not triumphant or brave.

你都没有任何风险
You’re not risking anything.

你可能会射我
You might shoot me.

我想你知道我不会的
I think you know I won’t.

因为你知道我可怜你
Because you know I feel sorry for you.

你这样只是为了可以告诉自己
You’re just doing this so you can tell yourself

你奋斗过 嗷
you fought -- Ow!

时间场受损
WOMAN: Temporal shield compromised.

恭喜你Jerry 你将作为一个男人死去
Congratulations, Jerry. You get to die a man.

呃 好的好的 我会离开的
Uh, that’s okay! I’ll leave!

别开枪啊 我是阴道男啊 记得吗
Please don’t shoot. I-I’m the vagina guy, remember?

哇哦 我身上发生了什么
Whoa! What is happening to me?

这里是哪 我在哪儿
Where is this? Where am I?

我死了吗
Am I dead?

我 我还活着吗
A-Am I -- Am I still alive?

你不该问这些问题
RICK: Those aren’t the questions you should be asking.

啊
Huh?!

嘘
shh!

抓到你啦
[Chuckles] Ah, got ya!

过来 小南瓜
Come here, you little pumpkin.

我屁股上有屎

我是谁
Who am I?

我是时间 我真的是时间
I’m time! I’m literally time!

喔哦哦
ALL: Whooooa!

啊
Aah!

天呐 我感觉我们的灵魂相互交融
Oh, God. I feel like our souls were united,

我们永远地结为一体了
and we were all one with eternity.

我们肉身未变
Our body’s unchanged,

但我们的心灵已经历经千重轮回
yet our minds have lived a thousand lifetimes.

过那么久 我会原谅你吗
Is that enough time for me to forgive you?

我不知道
I don’t know, but it’s enough time

但那么久 足够让突触阻尼剂失效了
for a synaptic dampener to wear off.

天啊 他还没决定还要不要杀死我们呢
Jesus!He hadn’t decided he was still going to kill us!

他在说服自己去杀 这种事儿我见过
He was talking himself into it. I’ve seen it before.

宇宙神化的嗨劲儿退得比鼠尾草都快
Cosmic apotheosis wears off faster than salvia.

我才开始相信你
I’m starting to believe you because I just finished merging

因为刚和你的本质融合了无穷的时光
with your essence for an endless epoch,

现在我又觉得你是个混账了
and I’m already back to thinking you’re an asshole.

无所谓 咱们赶紧分道扬镳吧
Fine with me. Let’s just go our separate ways.

听起来你和"时光"这个词
Sounds like you and the word “epoch”

还有好多旧要叙呢
have a lot of catching up to do.

等等 别抛下我
Wait, don’t leave me!

好了 你们可以站起来走走
MAN: All right, folks, you’re free to get up

围着船舱四处走动
and walk around the cabin

或许把虫洞拿出来当早饭
and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast.

你可以吃晚饭也可以吃早饭
MAN #2: Okay, you can do the dinner one

但不能两个一起
or the breakfast one, but not both.

你搞懂那玩意了吗
You think you got that thing figured out?

是的 我知道我在做什么
Yeah, I know what I’m doing.

很好 因为我有一个想法
BETH: Good. Because I have an idea.

它实际上是"一些"和"更多"的缩写(s'more 烤棉花糖)
It’s actually a contraction of “some” and “more.”

- 明白了吗 - 哇哦
-You see that? -Oh, wow.

我错得很呐
I was way off.

Morty 这儿怎么回事儿
Morty, what’s happening here?

Summer钻进了我外公的车库
Summer got into my grandpa’s garage,

瞎搞一番 然后把自己变成了一个怪物
messed around, and turned herself into a monster.

我妈也这么做了 为了让她好受些
My mom did the same to make her feel better.

她是一位好母亲
She’s a good mom.

哦 我天 我要去给我妈妈通电话
Oh, my God. I have to go call my mother!

-Tricia, wait! -MORTY: Ethan! Ethan!

你让她对自己的身体产生焦虑
You messed with her body image.

- 听着 Morty 我 - 嘘 嘘 嘘
- Look, Morty, I --Shh, shh, shh.

嘘 嘘 嘘
Shh, shh, shh.

小心点 Ethan 你的烤棉花糖着火了
Careful, Ethan. Yours’more is burning.

我想我俩最好先通通气儿
Uh, I guess we better get on the same page

关于我们的假冒险
about our fake adventure.

好的 我们来做个交易
-Right. -I'll make you a deal.

我会去掉你企图谋杀我的那部分
I'll leave out the part where you tried to murder me...

而我会去掉你承认破坏我们婚姻的那部分
And I’ll leave out the part where you admitted to sabotaging our marriage.

你想不想
You want to...

不了 如果家人看到我这副样子
Nah, if the family sees me like this,

就会可怜我的
they’ll feel sorry for me.

这不再是我的标志行为了
Which is no longer my signature move.

再见了 我的朋友
Later days, amigo.

事实上 我刚发现 我没带钱包
Actually, I just realized, I don’t have my wallet,

而我的公交卡还在里面 所以或许
and my bus pass is in there, so maybe --

坚强点儿 Jerry 我相信你
Stay strong, Jerry. I believe in you!

我跟你们说 伙伴们 这才是生活
I tell you, fellas. This is the life.

这当然是
It certainly is.

敬自由
To freedom!

看上去像是个4-22
Ooh! Looks like a 4-22.

转两下比例旋钮
Ooh, a couple cranks on the scaling knob

再来四个迪莱巴交叉渐变 瞬间就能复原
with a four dilabyte cross fade would fix that up in a jiff.

四个 你这样能达成13%的去变形化都算走运了
Four? You’d be lucky to clear 13% de-morphized with that kind of range.

先生们 先生们 还记得我们的约定吗
Gentlemen, gentlemen, what did we agree on?

不谈工作
TOGETHER: No work talk!

也许我恨自己 也许我认为自己该死
Maybe I hate myself. Maybe I think I deserve to die.

我 我不 我不知道

宇宙啊 嗝 不好意思
This universe. [Belches] Oh, excuse me.

我们应该每天都随机听首歌
We should listen to one random song a day, you know?

结果是我们会听到更多我们不喜欢的歌
We’d end up hearing more songs we didn’t like,

但我们也会发掘出更多以前不知道的歌
but we’d discover a lot more that we did.

这是个有趣的想法
That is an interesting concept.

这让我想到
You know, it makes me wonder

如果有一个数学表达式
if there’s an algorithmic expression

能够求出理想的比例

You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years?

你觉得要是有上帝存在 他就能做到吗
Do you think if God existed he could do it?

答案是否定的
The answer is no.

要是有上帝存在 那么我他妈就是上帝
If God exists, it’s fucking me.

是的 Rick 我 我同意 Rick
Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.

在你这条寄生虫晃着你那屎袋子的时候

I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty.

你对此又怎么看
What do you think about that?

呃 我 我觉得我的声音很烦人
Uh...l th-- I think my voice is annoying.

是很烦人 而且这已经是你浑身最好的一点了
It is, and it’s your best quality.

确实如此
So true.

现在 谁能告诉我这两个分数的最小公分母是什么
Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two fractions?

你们是都不知道 还是觉得太无聊
You don’t know or y’aII just bored?

嘿 听着 如果我们都觉得很无聊
Hey, listen, you know, wha-if we’re all bored over here,

那我们无聊的共同点(公分母)不应该是你吗
wouldn’t the common denominator be [chuckles] you?

该死的 Morty 你也太搞笑了吧
-[ Laughter] -Damn, Morty. That’s hilarious.

通常来说 我会对任何打断课堂的行为都加以批评

你也许骗得过这些白痴
You might have all these idiots fooled,

但我知道你仍然还是那个可悲的失败者
but I know you’re still the same pathetic loser

藏在你自信的外表之下
hiding behind a confident facade.

我知道这些 因为
I know that because...

我也是一样的 兄弟
I’m doing the same thing, brother.

我再也不是一个人了
-I’m not alone anymore! -[ Music resumes]

嗨 Morty 学校里到处都在谈论你变得超级积极健康了
Hey, Morty. Word around school is you’ve become super healthy.

我也不知道

不过我的确知道我得了一种很严重的病
I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of

可能会致命哦
Might be fatal. [Chuckles]

孩子们 呃 希望我没打断你们
Hey, kids. Uh, hope I’m not interrupting.

Morty 能占用一点你的时间吗
Morty, a moment of your time?

乐意帮忙 Rick
Happy to help, Rick.

我不想让你为这件事心烦
I hate to bug you with this,

但今早我徒步锻炼完之后 我的亚以太手机开始收到非常微弱
but after our morning hike, I started receiving very faint,

但又很不寻常的信息
highly unusual transmissions on my sub-ether phone.

听
-Listen. -[ Celiphone beeps]

手机坏了 扔掉吧
-[ Beep] -It's a bad phone. Chuck it.

我把我的设备降级成了翻盖机 只用于紧急联络
I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only.

你知道 如果是值得说出来的事情
You know, if-- if-- if something’s worth saying,

那就值得面对面地说
i-it’s worth eye contact.

呃 我追查了电话的来源
Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call

是从我们去的疗养中心那里打来的 Morty
back to the spa we went to, Morty.

我觉得我能在这通电话里听到某个声音
I thought I could hear a voice in there,

所以我加强了这个声音 你听
so I enhanced it, a-and listen.

- 喂 臭傻逼 - 噢 老兄
-GUNK RICK: Hey, asshole! -GUNK MORTY: Oh, man!

- 还记得我们吗 - 啊 我不喜欢对峙
-Remember us? -l don’t like confrontation!

你们毁了我们 你们这些垃圾
GUNK RICK: You fucked us, you pieces of garbage!

对 你们他妈才是垃圾 不是我们
That’s right, you’re fucking garbage, not us.

老子是天才 老子还是上帝
I’m a fucking genius and a god.

你真以为这玩意儿关得住我吗
You really think this thing can hold me?

我要撕烂你的喉咙
-I’m gonna rip your throat -- -[ Beep]

Morty 要是我们的有毒人格是有独立的意识的
Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities,

也有他们的求生欲望怎么办
their own will to live?

会不会是我的有毒人格跟我同样聪明
W-What if mine shares my intelligence

然后找到了联系我们的方法
and devised a way to reach out to us?

他听上去非常痛苦
Sounds like he’s in a lot of pain.

特别痛苦
[Smacks lips] Lot Of Pain.

但 要知道 你其实不用去处理这些事的
But, you know, you shouldn’t have to deal with that, man.

这样吧 咱们去玩玩
You know, I-let’s work off your trauma

但你还有个处于危险中的青春期前的
but you have an at-risk preteen --

我觉得我没法不管这事儿 Morty
I don’t think I can just blow this off, Morty.

要是我一早知道那机器是这么运作的
If I had known it worked this way,

我肯定不会做那个去毒疗程
I wouldn’t have detoxed.

不过 当时我可能会 因为那时候我还有负面人格
Well, I would have because I was toxic.

但现在既然我是健康的人格 我得对负面人格负责对吧
Now I’m detoxed and I’m accountable to my toxins, right?

- 真是两难 - 我知道我要怎么做了
-I-It’s a dilemma. -I think I know what to do.

Morty
Morty!

Rick 目前唯一的问题其实是你这个硕大的脑袋
Rick! [ Laughs ]You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain

怀念需要解决那些硕大的问题的时光了
that misses eating all them big fat problems.

把目光放在好事情上吧 相信我 生活是美好的
Focus on the good things. Trust me, things are good.

把这想法从我身上拿走的话
Taking that away from me [ChuckIes]

那就太不健康了
that wouldn’t be healthy.

感觉就像 哇哦
It’s like, whew!

我倒是挺希望你闭嘴不说话的
I-I-I wish you’d shut up, though.

That’s more rude than the truth.

是这样的 对不起 Morty 我只是不认为

根本不需要 你不用解释的 没问题的

Rick, please tell me you’re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us.

抱歉Morty 那东西有生命 而且是我们的一部分
Morty, I’m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us.

我们把他们赶出去 关在罐子里
We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can.

你妈逼的
-[ Clanks] -Motherfucker!

看见没 他们很痛苦
See? They’re living in pain.

他们不就是这样吗 痛苦地活着
That’s what they do, Rick. They live in pain.

They are pain, you know?

他们包含了我们的各种烂逼人格
Th-They’re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way,

还包括我们的狡诈
includes our dishonesty,

所以你怎么确定这不是陷阱呢
so how do you know this isn’t all some sort of crazy trick?

所以我完全是由毒素构成就能说明我是个骗子吗
Oh, so now because I’m made entirely of toxins,I’m also a liar?

I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything!

我干嘛要跟你这种怂逼合体
Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you?

你本来是想把我们关在罐子里的吗
So...you were just gonna trap us in that tank?

- 你原本这么想的 - 不 傻逼 我现在还这么想
- T-That was your plan? - Not was, motherfucker. Still is.

干掉他 Rick

我讨厌这样 好可怕啊
I don’t like this! This is scary!

好吧 你自找的
All right, you asked for it.

Oh, who’s that? Who[burps]’s that over there?

看到你面前那个坏人了吗
Oh, no. You see the bad man in front of you?

好宝贝 干掉他
You’re a good little boy. You’re gonna get him.

干掉他
-[ Creature roars] -You’re gonna get him.

狗逼养
Son of a...

休想 傻逼
Nice try, asshole.

我们可以和解的
We can resolve [panting] our issues.

我们不需要采用这么极端的
We don’t need to resort to over-the-Top --

我成功了 Rick 我拿到罐子了
I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank!

我是个废物 但我拿到罐子了
I-I’m a piece of shit, but I got the tank!

你滚回罐子吧 傻逼
You’re going in that tank, motherfucker.

你就在那片毒废土上活着吧
You’re gonna [burps] live in that toxic shit wasteland

像我之前那样
like I had to do!

没错 傻逼 你就要
GUNK RICK: That’s right, motherfucker.You’re going in that fuckin’ --

爸爸们
Dads?

别牵扯上她
Okay, just -- just leave her out of it.

怎么回事
What’s going on?

去你妈的 执行备用计划
All right, tuck this. Time for plan B.

既然我没法把你关在毒素罐里
It I can’t trap you in a toxic world,

我就把这里变成毒素世界
I’ll just make the whole world toxic.

没事的 姑娘们
It’s okay, girls.

很抱歉我的一些行为把我们置于危险之中
I-I’m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior.

我可以去花园里
I-If you’d like, I can go out in the g-garden,

采一些新鲜的罗勒 给我们大家做一份美味的油炸肉片
pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.

那个鼻屎一样的你是什么意思
What did the booger version of you mean

他说他要让整个世界都中毒
when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic?

亲爱的 相信我 那个人的动机是个谜
Believe me, sweetie, that man’s motivations are a mystery.

去他的 Rick 我们得要阻止他
Screw that, Rick. We got to sTop him.

你最不想对那个缸子
What’s the last thing you’d think about doing

做的是什么事情
with that tank thing?

Morty 我很欣赏你试着去做的事情
Morty, I appreciate what you’re trying to do,

但是轮不到我们来决定
but it’s not our place, you know,

从什么样的末日中去拯救哪一个世界
to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse.

我 我们的有毒体一样有权利根据他们的世界观
Our -- Our toxins have as much a right to their woridview as --

Morty 扇我耳光怎么会是健康的呢
Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?

显然我对健康的理解
Obviously my version of health

和你们的有天差地别
is a hell of a lot different from yours,

你个没用的老垃圾
you useless old turd.

等等 我想到了
Wait. That’s it.

排毒机怎么知道
How could that detox machine know the difference

怎么区分里面事物的健康与否呢
between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it?

它做不到的
It can’t.

它必须是通过每个人自己对毒性的定义来判断的
It must be by the individual’s own definition of toxicity.

那就是说
That means...

- 爸 - 这是怎么回事 Rick
-Dad! -What -- What the hell, Rick?

我路上再解释
I’ll explain on the way.

Morty 这就是月亮塔
GUNK RICK: This “Moon Tower,” Morty,

完美的高度与金属构成
i[burps]s the perfect height and metallic composition

用于放大并发射有毒能量
for the a[burps]mplification and beaming of toxic energies.

Morty 你怎么看
What do you think about that, Morty?

Morty 有没有很激动
Are you excited about that, Morty?

哦 天 这里太高了 吓到我了
Oh, man. I’m just freaked out. I-It’s too high up here.

只要我扳下这个开关
Once I flip this switch,

整个世界都会像我们一样有毒的
the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby.

赞美仁慈的天父
As we praise our loving Father --

上帝是我们编造出来赚钱的谎言
God is a lie! We made him up for money!

圣诞老人不是真的
Santa Claus isn’t real.

你们从一开始就是错误
You were all mistakes! [Groans]

Morty 我们他妈的做到了
[Laughs] We fuckin’ did it, Morty.

快他妈的举起你的双手
Put your fuckin’ hands in the air.

你这小废物
Yeah, you little piece of shit.

还记得我吗
Remember me?

上次打不过我 你没学到点什么吗
Didn’t you learn last time that you can’t beat me?

对 我学到了 但之后我又学了点别的
Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.

- 比如说这个 - 啊啊啊
-This. -Aah! [Screams, moans]

那个子弹里装着加密的纳米病毒
That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus

会在大约20分钟内分解你的Morty
that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

你觉得我在乎吗
You think I give a shit?

我知道你在乎的 傻瓜
I know you give a shit, dummy.

因为我知道我自己不在乎
Because I know I don’t.

我还知道一件事
Here’s another thing I know.

中和病毒的解密方法
The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.

想要吗 来拿呀
You want it? Come and get it.

和我融合 你就知道怎么救他了
Merge with me and you’ll know how to save him.

切 拜托 我被困在
Pfft. Come on, man. I’ve been trapped

你的孬逼脑子里犯了七十年的傻
in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions,

但这是我见过最唬不住人的
but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I’ve ever --

- 嗷嗷 - 天哪 你在做什么
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!

- 他把时间缩短了一半 还有10分钟 - 哦哦 好疼
- He’s cutting your time in half.10 minutes. - Ohh! It hurts!

你什么毛病
What is your problem?

哦 我把我所有的毛病都去掉了 觉得别人都欠我
Oh, I had all my problems removed -- my entitlement,

自恋 让我寸步难行的孤独
my narcissism, my crippling loneliness,

不理性的感情
my irrational attachments.

这些东西肯定在什么地方 兄弟 但不在我这儿
They must be somewhere. They ain’t over here, bro.

我不要回去
I’m not going back in there!

说实话 我怎样都不在乎
Honestly, I don’t care either way.

我讨厌拥有你这部分感情
I hate having you in me.

当我说"说实话"的时候 你完全可以信我
And when I say “honestly” you can believe it,

因为我们都知道我是健康的 不会说谎
because we both know I’m too healthy to lie.

看着
-Watch. -[ Screams]

够了 停下 你唬不住人的
All right! Knock it off! You’re not impressing anyone.

Morty 不是我在乎你 但是你还好吗
Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay?

- 天啊 超疼 - 放松 别抱怨了
-Jesus Christ, it hurts. -Relax, quit your bitching.

你 你会没事的 外公在呢
Y-You’re gonna be fine. Grandpa’s here.

你觉得很好玩吗
-[ Laughs] -You think that’s funny?

你得对这种事有点幽默感
Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things.

哦 等等 你做不到
Oh, wait, you can’t.

你是真的没有办法从更高的角度看事情
You’re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture.

我觉得很搞笑
I guess it’s just funny because you’ve never done

你除了抱怨我主导一切以外什么都没做
anything but complain about me being in charge,

但如果我让你做主的话 我们五分钟之内就都死了
but if I ever gave you the wheel we’d be dead in five minutes.

- Rick - 你这个可怜 愚蠢 病态的禽兽
-Rick? -You poor, dumb, sick animal.

Rick
[Weakly] Rick?

啊 动手吧
Aah! Just do it!

动手吧 你个
Just do it, you piece of--

我回来啦 宝贝 正常的Rick 两个世界的统治者
I’m back, baby! Regular Rick! Master of both worlds!

快看啊
Check it it out! Farts]

不好意思
“Excuse me.”

现在我们来扭转这恶心的毒性光束
Now we’ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam.

我生气的时候真的容易想太多
Man, I really overthink shit when I’m angry.

哦 还要
-[ Moaning] -Oh, give it to me.

嗯么
Mm, ma-mah.

上帝不是谎言
God is not a lie.

妈咪 妈咪
Mommy! Mommy!

哈 搞定啦 Morty
Ha! All right, Morty,

现在该重新融合你个小兔崽子了
now it’s time we re-merge your little ass.

Rick 你是个比我优秀的人
You’re a better man than me, Rick.

我很健康 我愿意承认这一点
I’m healthy enough to admit that!

这孩子真是个混蛋
That kid is a real piece of shit.

你 你会救我的 对吧
Y-Y-You’re gonna save me, right?

一部分我很想救你 毒Morty
Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty.

一部分我真的很想
Part of me really wanted to.

我跟你说 这些股票超级火 对
I’m telling you, these shares are hot. Yeah.

听起来是个好主意 绝对是个好主意
That sounds like a good idea. It’s definitely a good idea.

Duane Duane Duane 我懂你的意思 你知道我在说什么吗
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it. Now can you get me?

我什么时候骗过你
Have I ever lied to you?

这就对了 到处打听打听 我从来不骗人 Duane
That’s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.

咱们把话说得简单明了
Let me put this real simple.

So, how do you feel, Morty?

- 啊 天啊 我好痛苦 - 我厉不厉害
-Ah, geez. I’m miserable. -Am I good or what?

我觉得这也值了 至少 知道你有多在乎我
I guess it’s worth it, though, to know how much you care.

在乎你 我 Morty 我并不在乎你
Care? Me? Morty, I’m fine with you.

- 我这么做只是为了他 - 你个扯谎的婊子

从家里逃走 然后变成一个股票经纪人
who ran away from his family and capitalized

靠着没良心发家的 14岁少年
on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?

我真是操了
-[ Portal opens] -Oh, for fuck’s sake.

你好 我是Rick K-22 这是我的Morty
Hello. I’m Rick K-22. This is my Morty.

我们正穿梭于不同的现实
We’re going from reality to reality

游说Rick们
asking Ricks to contribute

为瑞城再发展基金会捐款
to the Citadel of Ricks Redevelopment Fund.

你是傻吗
What are you, stupid?

我们和瑞城没关系了
We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks.

我一开始就不同意建立这个大本营
I was [burps] never on board with it in the first place.

所以我杀了所有负责人 留了个烂摊子让它自生自灭
That’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.

噢 这个人是你啊
Oh, that was you.

是他们先动手想搞死他的
They tried to murder him first.

噢天啦 那你现在知道议会不存在了一定很高兴
Aw, geez.Well, you’ll be happy to know that the council’s gone now.

他知道啊 是他杀了他们
Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.

- 你要不要管管你的Morty - 我每天都想
-You want to rein in your Morty? -Every day.

瑞城再发展基金会捐赠
The Citadel of Ricks Redevelopment Fund donates --

Morty 他不会捐钱的
Morty, he’s not gonna [burps] donate.

你这就像是向黑人小年轻儿
You’re pitching the Policeman’s Ball

推荐警察舞会
to a black teenager here.

- 我们走 - 你犯不着这么混吧
-Let’s go. -You don’t have to be a dick.

你自己清楚没这回事儿
I think you know that’s not true.

天啦 我不知道现在还有Rick和Morty住在瑞城
Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel.

真不知道他们是怎么生活的
I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.

这样 你可以继续好奇
Well, you can keep wondering that

我们去我们的亚特兰蒂斯开始全新 独立 又好玩儿的探险
while we go on a fun, fresh,self-contained adventure to Atlantis.

任何继续探究瑞城的人要么就是蠢
Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid

要么就是那千千万万被自己的蠢主意绑住的可怜虫之一
or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.

还好我不是其中之一

RICK TEACHER: I love being your new Morty.

- 做你的新Mor - Mor屁
ALL: I love being your new Mor--Farty.

非常搞笑 Smith先生
Very amusing, Mr. Smith.

几乎和你第一个Rick
Almost as amusing as when your first Rick

在Z九星上被斩首差不多搞笑
was decapitated on Zorpantheon Nine.

还是说那是你的第三个Rick
Or was that your third Rick?

你到底有过几个Rick
How many Ricks have you had?

- 五个 - 我知道了
-Five. -l see.

所以在某些方面你确实是班里拔尖的
So you are Top of the class in something.

明天你们就会被配送给新的Rick们
Tomorrow you’ll be transferred to your new Ricks.

希望他们能是你们的最终归宿
Hopefully they will be your last.

请讲 笨Ri 高Morty
Yes, Slow Ri-Tall Morty?

我 我这次能屁业了么
Di-- Did I gradgitate this time yet?

一切皆有可能 高Morty
Anything’s possible, Tall Morty.

我猜在这之后我们就没机会见面了 对吧
I guess we won’t be seeing each other after this, huh?

要我说 我们的最后一天得有点意义
I say we make our last day count.

我提议 去许愿传送门
I say.. .we go to the Wishing Portal.

- 那是个传说 - 那不是传说
-That’s a myth. -It’s not a myth.

我第一个Rick的第四个Morty
My first Rick’s fourth Morty

认识一个Rick 他的Morty去过那儿
knew a Rick whose Morty went there.

我们要是不来参加毕业典礼的话
If we’re not here for graduation,

我们就得流落到Morty城了
our butts are gonna wind up in Morty Town.

我以为你上一个Rick是把你和一只蜥蜴融合了
I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard,

不是只鸡(懦夫)
not a chicken.

好吧 行 我加入
Okay, fine. I’m in.

我也是
Me too.

- 这他妈啥 - 我以为我看见只苍蝇
-What the hell?! -l thought I saw a fly.

停一下 傻逼们
Listen up, fuck nuts.

我当你们的主管已经五年了
I’ve been your supervisor tor tive years,

但是所有的操蛋事都得有个头
but all shitty things must come to an end,

我已经被晋升为区域主管了
and I have been promoted to regional manager.

没错 我的感受和你们一样 后会无期吧
Yeah, I feel the same way. May be never meet again.

当然了 这么一来 主管的位置就空出来了
Of course, that makes the position of supervisor available,

所以 下个礼拜开始 你们拍马屁的对象
so, as of next week, the ass you’ll be kissing

将会变成
will be that of...

K-83 大家喜闻乐见的 酷Rick
K-83, affectionately known as Cool Rick.

我知道我是新来的
-[ All grumbling] -l know I’m new to the Citadel,

你们当中有些人可能觉得我资历不够
and some of you might not think I put in my time,

但是我能说什么呢
but what can I say?

我是酷Rick
I’m Cool Rick!

哟 哈 哈 就是这么屌
Yo! Ha! Ha! Check me out!

就是这样了笨蛋们 有什么疑问么
All right knuckle[burps]heads, any questions?

行了 那就继续工作吧 你们这些打工瑞
All right, then, back to work, you gold rickers.

没有Rick 没有家人
No Ricks, no families,

嗑药嗨到飞起 在街上横冲直撞
high off their asses, and running amuck.

Morty是被培养来做跟班的
Mortys are raised to be sidekicks.

跟班的没有下手可打 就开始找点别的来打了
Without a side to kick, they just start kicking.

他们 他们和我差不多高
They were -- They were about my height,

大概14岁
around 14 years old.

喔 他们的 他们的T恤是黄色的
Oh, their -- their shirts were yellow!

是哦 一定把这些都记下来
Yeah, make sure you get that down.

有什么变异么 或者附加特征
Any mutations, augmentations?

呃 三只眼睛 尾巴之类的 或者劳改头
Uh, three eyes? A tail? Maybe a buzz cut?

没 就是四个正常Morty
No. Just four normal Mortys.

- 正常 - 回去发博客抱怨吧
-Normal? -Put it in your blog.

我去打探打探
Let me turn over a few rocks.

喔天啊 嘿 怎么样啊兄弟们
Aw, geez. Hey, what’s goin’ on, fellas?

喔天啊 哥们 没啥 哥们
Aw, geez, man. Nothing, man.

我们就只是随便逛逛
We’re just hanging out and stuff.

这样啊 喔天啊
I hear that. Aw, geez.

我觉得我就是想查查看
I guess I’m supposed to be figurin’ out

是谁抢劫了街对面那家店
who robbed the store across the street.

但是喔 天啊 我不知道
But, aw, geez, I don’t know.

喔 天啊 糟透了
Aw, geez man, that sucks

你的Rick让你做这个
that your Rick’s making you do that.

他不是我的Rick 他是我的拍档
He’s not my Rick. He’s my partner.

喔 天啊
Aw, geez.

好吧 可能穿上制服就是不一样
Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference.

我这样的能说什么啊
Who am Ito say?

在我看来你就是个跟班的
To me, you just look like a sidekick.

啊 再叫我一声跟班的试试
Call me a sidekick one more time!

叫我跟班的啊
Call me a sidekick!

嘿哥们 别啊 喔天啊
Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez!

想看看我拿什么涂墙吗
Wanna see how I paint a wall?!

是Morty城狂人帮
It was the Morty Town Locos, man!

Morty城狂人帮
-The -- The Morty Town Locos! -[ Groans]

噢 噢
Aah! Aah!

你清楚自己刚才违反了多少章程吗
Do you realize how many codes you just violated?

噢 天啊 Rick
Aw, geez, Rick.

我哪懂什么清楚不清楚
What do I know about knowin’ stuff?

快他妈上车吧
Get in the fuckin’ car.

更多激光
More lasers.

你可以多用点时间来回答问题 如果你愿意
You could take more time to answer the question if you like.

好的 杂耍Rick
Okay, Juggling Rick,

你将如何解决大本营的财政危机
how would you solve the Citadel’s financial crisis?

首先 我想说的是我相信咱们瑞城
First off, can I just say that I believe this Citadel

是多元宇宙里最棒的
is the greatest in the entire multi-verse.

现在 我认为问题的答案
Now, I believe the answer to your question

包含三个方面
has three parts.

第一 必须大力提高对教育的投入
First, education spending must get much higher.

但必须和国防支出保持平衡
But it has to be balanced with defense...

慢着 慢着 我们能不能核实一下这点
-Whoa! Whoa! -Can we fact-check this please?

拉倒吧 我逗谁乐呢
Never mind. Who am I kidding?

这竞选已经没戏了
This race is over.

这就是管理瑞城的方法
And that’s how you run a Citadel!

候选人Morty 无家可归的Morty人数激增
Candidate Morty, the number of displaced Mortys is soaring

与此同时 Rick们的满意度正在迅速下降
while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting,

两群人之间的分化从来没有这么大过
and the divide between the two groups has never been wider.

快速解决这个问题
Solve that one real quick.

我并没有发现Rick和Morty之间有分化
I don’t see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.

呦 真是震惊啊
Oh, shocker.

我有点反对的"响"法
I’d like to offer a re-buttal. Farts]

先生们 先生们 我觉得咱们都能就一件事达成共识
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think we can all agree on one thing.

虽然出来的是两件事
[Farts twice] Well, it came out as two things,

但你们明白是什么意思
but you get the idea.

你们完事儿了吗
-[ Laughter] -You guys finished?

我看到的分歧存在于在那些想让瑞城
The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys

分裂对立的Rick还有Morty
that like the Citadel divided...

和我们剩下的人之间
and the rest of us.

我所到之处 皆是如此
I see it everywhere I go.

在我们的学校里是这样
I see it in our schools

在那里 他们教育Morty们 我们都是一样的
where they teach Mortys we’re all the same,

因为让他们受到威胁的 正是那些让我们独一无二的东西
because they’re threatened by what makes us unique.

我们的街道上也是如此他们给Morty们发放枪支
I see it in our streets where they give guns to Mortys

让我们忙着互相争斗而无暇反抗真正的不公
so we’re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.

在工厂同样如此
I see it in our factories

在那里 Rick们辛苦工作 薪水只是老板所得的九牛一毛
where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss’ salary

尽管他们是一模一样的 智商也相同
even though they’re identical and have the same IQ.

瑞城的问题并不是无家可归的Morty们
The Citadel’s problem isn’t homeless Mortys

也不是愤怒的Rick们
or outraged Ricks.

真正的问题在于 有一部分Rick和Morty
The Citadel’s problem is the Ricks and Mortys

在从瑞城的毁灭中汲取营养
feeding on the Citadel’s death.

天哪
-Holy shit. -[ Alarm sounding]

他要去口味核心
RICK SECURITY OFFICER: He’s headed for the flavor core!

但我要向他们传达这样一条信息
But I’ve got a message for them,

来自那些让瑞城维持生机的Rick和Morty们
from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive,

来自那些对瑞城满怀信心的
a message from the Ricks and Mortys

Rick和Morty们
that believe in this Citadel

收信人是那些与此背道而驰的Rick和Morty
to the Ricks and Mortys that don’t.

我们远比你们多得多
You’re outnumbered.

天啊
Holy shit.

我不相信
I don’t believe it.

我 我简直难以置信
I-I can’t believe it.

我明白 所以你被炒了
I know. That’s why you’re fired.

听起来你要找工作了
Sounds like you’re looking for work.

我能给你提供非常诱人的待遇
I can offer you a very enticing compensation package.

首先 咱们来谈谈好处吧
First, let’s talk benefits.

爸爸爱你 真是爸爸的好女儿
Daddy loves you. That’s Daddy’s good girl.

你的生活就是个谎言 哥们
Your life is a lie, man.

你们所有人都活在谎言里 你们还不明白吗
All your life’s are lies! Don’t you get it?!

他们说我们是特别的 因为我们是Rick
They told us we were special because we were Ricks,

但却剥夺了所有让我们独一无二的东西
but they stripped us of everything that made us unique!

我们明白你的感受
We know how you feel.

我们也是苦逼的劳工Rick 和你一样
We’re working-stiff Ricks just like you.

但正义将我们团结起来
but our assembly line is justice.

你有什么要求
What are your demands?

我 我 我 我想要个传送枪
I-I-I want a portal gun.

要没注册过 追踪不到的
Unregistered, untraceable,

里面要有足够的液体 送我离开这个天杀的监狱
with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!

- 媒体们在外面候着 - 啊 让他们在那儿待着吧
-The media’s outside. -Well, keep ‘em there.

不管怎样 呃 嫌疑人说瑞城是个谎言
Anyway, so, yeah, the suspect says the Citadel’s a lie,

建立在谎话和其他鸡巴玩意的基础上
built on lies, and some other shit.

我要说 珍惜现有的生活
I say appreciate the life you have,

因为生活总有变得更烂的可能
because it can always be worse.

该你们了 Rick们
Back to you, Ricks.

谢谢你 Rick 0716-C
Thank you, Rick 0716-C.

- 这傻逼 - 可不是
-That fuckin’ guy. -Tell me about it.

与此同时 在大选现场
[Clears throat] Meanwhile, in election news,

事情出现了始料未及的转折 来自Morty党的Morty
an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party

支持率跃升至第一位
soars to the Top of the poiis.

好的
-Morty! Morty! Morty! -Yes.

Morty 你来自哪个现实 你的Rick在哪儿
Morty, what’s your original reality, and where’s your Rick?

天呐 我们来来回回走得太远 已经记不得了
Gosh, we moved around so much, it’s hard to remember.

我把每一个Rick都当成我的Rick
I see every Rick as my Rick.

我希望他们也把我当做他们的Morty
I hope they see me as their Morty.

再来一杯行吗 少兑点水
Another? Please? With less water?

嘿 打起精神来 伙计
Hey, cheer up, pal.

一个Morty要当总统了
A Morty’s gonna be president.

想想这个傻逼得替所有事情背黑锅
Imagine this kisser getting blamed for everything.

我想我该抱有更多信念的
I guess I should’ve had more faith.

你需要的不是信念 而是恐惧
It’s not faith you need. It’s fear.

这是什么
What’s this?

这是机密
It's secrets.

你 你 你 你觉得这是什么
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you think it is?

看看我这造型
Look at how I’m dressed.

在对体制提出质疑之后
RICK REPORTER: Having taken aim at the system,

你对你的人身安全感到担忧吗
are afraid at all for your safety?

我宁愿活在希望而不是恐惧里
CANDIDATE MORTY: I’d rather live in hope than fear.

如果我需要害怕什么的话 我会害怕人们感到害怕
If I had to fear anything, I’d fear other people being afraid

害怕恐惧本身
Of fear. Itself

但是 不 我不害怕
But, no, I’m not afraid.

嘿 Rick 伙计 等有个Morty当上了总统
MORTY TOWN [000 #1: Hey, Rick, man,when there’s a Morty president,

你是不是得给我跪下舔屌
you gonna lick my balls or what?

妈呀 孙儿
Sheeeet, grandson,

你再这么继续让我剥这些个skrabquam和nib nib
you keep me peelin’ skrabquams and slippin’ nib nibs,

任何不是钉死了的东西我都会舔
I’ll lick whatever ain’t nailed down.

举起手来
Hands in the air!

这他妈是在搞什么
What the hell, man?! What the hellin’ hell?

你们几个在跟外公一起做化学作业吗
You guys doing a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?

这是我心里想的那东西吗
Is this what I think it is?

非法私制传送液
Bootleg portal fluid.

我想他算错了
I guess his math was off.

搜
Search the place.

你 你是我的新Rick吗
Are -- Are you... my new.. .R-Rick?

没事了 Morty
It's okay, Morty.

老天爷
Jesus.

他捅了我 我伤得挺重的 Morty
He stabbed me. He got me bad, Morty.

嘘 没关系 你会没事的
Shh. It’s okay. You’re okay.

你是对的
You were right. [Coughs]

- 我在警校学的所有东西都 - 没关系
- Everything I learned at the academy was   - Doesn’t matter.

选择相信一个Morty不是你的错
Nothing’s wrong with putting your faith in a Morty.

你只是需要选择那个值得信任的
You just gotta pick the right one.

为什么这儿会有个摇篮
Why is there a crib in here?

他们的把戏 为了让你觉得内疚
Something they do. To make you feel bad.

这下搞得我俩要写一堆报告 是不
Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?

到车上去拿个急救包
Go to the car and grab a medi-pack.

这儿就交给我吧
Let me worry about this.

- 发生什么事了 - 还是老一套
- What happened? - Same old story.

Morty们自相残杀
Mortys killing Mortys.

就快 摘到了
Almost.. .got it.

离我的超级果远点儿
Y’all get the hell away from my damn mega fruit!

抓住他们 狗狗
-Sic ‘em, boy! -[ Barking I

我戴着这傻逼帽子
I don’t wear this dag-nab hat

过着村炮的生活
and commit to this rural character

可不是为了让你们这帮毛没长齐的崽子们免费偷吃的
so you can eat for free while you come of age!

我打赌许愿传送门通往一个
I bet the Wishing Portal leads to a reality

一个很多 所有
where they’re -- where all --

有很多长着大奶子的法式吐司的世界
where it’s a bunch of French toast with boobies.

我打赌它通往一个到处都是油炸
I bet it leads to a place with a bunch of fry --

苍 苍蝇们的地方
fly -- flies everywhere.

我猜它不通往任何地方
Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

我打赌它只是一个
I bet it’s a big hole

瑞城用来倾倒所有破碎的梦的大洞
where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.

小酷哥 为什么你老这么夸张
Slick, why do you have to be so dramatic?

你想知道为什么吗 因为这个
You wanna know why? Because of this.

我是一个植入了戏剧芯片的
I’m part of an experimental line of Mortys

测试型Morty系列的一员
with a drama implant.

你知道这种感受吗 肥Morty
How do you think it feels, Fat Morty,

明知道不管在哪里
to know that no matter where I go,

我都会是那个
Ill always be the one

让所有人感到悲伤和有点无聊的人
that makes everybody sad and a little bored?

酷哥儿 那个芯片并不能代表你这个人 好吗
Slick, that implant isn’t who you are, okay?

你还把你的袖子给卷起来了
You also roll up your sleeves.

我还以为我是左撇子Morty呢
I thought I was Left-Handed Morty.

那你就应该用你的左手来多吃点蔬菜
Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.

你好 你怎么样 很高兴见到你
Hey, there. How you doing? Great to meet you.

我是个水管工 先生
I’m a plumber, sir.

我是个Rick 我也是个水管工
I’m a Rick, and I’m a plumber.

这听起来不像是Rick的工作
That doesn’t sound like Rick work.

你来瑞城不是为了当个水管工的 是吗
You didn’t come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?

当然不是了 先生
Ha! ha! I sure didn’t, sir!

Morty先生 Morty先生
Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

我克隆了自己 这样你就可以亲亲还是一个宝宝的我了
I cloned myself so you could kiss me as a baby!

他就跟一个Morty宝宝一样
This is just like a Morty baby!

你 嗯 你找到新工作了吗
Hey, did you, uh, end up getting a new job?

是的 我找到了 刺杀你
Yeah, I did. Assassinating you.

我没事
I’m okay. I’m okay.

我
I

啊 伙计 啊 天呐
Aw, man. Aw, geez. Aw, hah.

你看起来需要放松一下
You look like you could use a good time.

跳一支舞10美元 两支25
One dance for $10, two for $25.

不用了 谢谢 你数学学得真垃圾
No, thank you. And bad math.

这真是太好玩儿了
Ha! Ha! Yeah! This is a good time!

- 这什么地方 - 怪怪Morty俱乐部
-What is this place? -The Creepy Morty.

你们Rick常说什么来着
What is it your kind’s always saying?

别想这事
“Don’t think about it.”

来 我想让你认识一位重要人物
Come on. There’s someone important I want you to meet.

啊
Ah, Bubbala!

Morty城狂人帮的事怎么样了
How’d it go with the Morty Town Locos?

他们出了点小事故
They had a little accident.

以后不会再制造麻烦了
They won’t be causing any trouble anymore.

那些都是坏Morty 非常坏的Morty
Those were bad Mortys. Very bad Mortys.

大Morty想要继续
Big Morty likes to contribute

维持Morty城的和平
to keeping the peace in Morty Town.

你可以把他看做是"毒枭"
Think of him as a “drug lord”

我们则是被他收买的警察
and us as cops on his payroll.

- Morty  - 你叫谁
-Morty... -TOGETHER: Which Morty?

我 我 我搭档
M-M-My partner.

Morty你说得对 Morty城是很坏
Morty, you’re right. Morty Town is bad.

但这不意味着我们也必须变坏
But that doesn’t mean that we have to be.

嘿 怎么回事 Morty
Hey, what’s going on here, Morty?

- 你问谁 - 警察Morty 你们这些弱智
-TOGETHER: Which Morty? -The cop, morons!

别担心Rick 大Morty
Don’t worry about Rick, Big Morty.

他新来的
He’s new.

他还不晓得这里的门道
He doesn’t understand how it works.

你之前也是这么说你上个搭档的
That’s what you said about your last partner.

为什么你要这么说 大Morty
Why would you say something like that, Big Morty?

你这样要坏我们的事的
You’re fucking things up for both of us here.

不 是他在坏你俩的事
Wrong. He’s tucking things up tor both ot you.

除非他收下这笔钱
Unless he takes the money.

大Morty 你被捕了
Big Morty, you’re under arrest.

全宇宙最聪明的人
S-Smartest man in the universe.

这是道具枪 这 这是道具枪
They’re just props! Th-They’re just props!

现在"大"不起来了吧
-[ Groans -Not so big now, are ya?

我本来就不大啊 只是说说的
I never was! It was figurative!

- 够了 - 如果我们不杀了他 他会告密的
- That’s enough.- If we don’t kill him, he’ll talk.

如果你杀了他 我就会告发你
If you do, I’ll talk.

可 可以确定的是
0-One thing’s for sure.

你 你们不用担心 牛仔Morty不会告密的
Y-Y’all don’t have to worry about Cowboy Morty talkin’.

我这个小牛仔就慢慢滚了哈
This little cowpoke’s gonna mosey up on out of here.

是你告诉我要相信对的Morty
You told me to put my faith in the right Morty.

我相信你 搭档
I’ve got faith in you, partner.

做正确的事
Do the right thing.

哦 外公Rick
Oh, Grandpa Rick,

我 我不想待在瑞城了
I-I don’t wanna be on the Citadel anymore.

我只想当个普通小孩
I wanna be a regular kid.

我 我想去上学 玩玩球
I-I wanna to go to school and throw balls around

撸撸管
and masturbate.

这里面发生了什么
What the hell happened in there?

老套的剧情
Same old story.

Rick杀了Morty
Ricks killing Mortys.

好 兄弟 好了 我们拿来了你要的传送枪
Okay, man, okay, we got your portal gun.

他在干嘛
What the hell’s he doing?

- 这 我这是在哪儿 - 一个糟透的地方
-[ Groans ] Where -- Where am I? -A bad place.

但你很快就能去个更好的地方了
But you’re going to a better one soon.

嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey!

不不不不
-No, no, no, no! -Whaa-

该死的
God damn it!

给我个通往搅拌机世界的传送门
A portal to the blender dimension?

这简直是最老土的套路了
That’s the oldest trick in the book!

我是一个Rick 我比你们这些Rick更Rick
I’m a Rick! I’m more Rick than any of you!

那你就该知道 你把你唯一的筹码给杀了
Then you should know you just killed your only leverage!

那就进来抓我啊 你们这帮混蛋
Then comes and get me, motherfuckers!

停下 我是Rick D. Sanchez第三世
STop. I’m Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

是这家威化饼干厂的老板
owner of this here wafer establishment,

我要说 被关在里面的这个Rick说得对
and I say that the Rick in there is right.

他是比你们都更Rick
He’s more Rick than any of you.

他是一个恐怖分子
He’s a terrorist!

哪个Rick不是呢
What Rick isn’t?!

这座由Rick们建立的城市是为了让Rick们自由
The Citadel was founded by Ricks for Ricks to be free!

你叫什么名字 年轻人
What’s your name, young man?

- 我叫Rick 我今年 - 跟我一个年纪 我知道
-Rick. And I’m -- -The same age as me, I know.

- 你在这儿工作了多久 - 15年
-How long have you worked here? -15 years.

看看我们都变成什么人了
What the hell have we become?

不管你们要抓他去蹲多久的监狱
Whatever time you were gonna make him serve,

他都已经相当于服过刑了
he’s served it.

这一切现在结束了
It ends now.

- 跟我来 朋友 - 我们要去哪儿
-Come with me, friend. -Where are we going?

去向你的新生活
To your new life.

你的新生活从走出这鸟地方开始
Which starts with walking the fuck out of here.

哟 J-22 让他们瞧瞧
-Yo J-22, give ‘em hell! -[ Burps]

有个Rick在谋杀了他的上级和几个同事以后
SAM ELLIOT: There’s a Rick that held a factory hostage

劫持了一家工厂
after murdering his boss and several co-workers.

这家工厂生产曲奇饼 却以谎言为之调味
The factory made cookies, flavored them with lies.

他让所有人重新审视我们过去所做的一切
He made us all take a look at what we were doing.

在这场博弈中 他尝到了真正自由的味道
And in the bargain, he got a taste of real freedom.

我们抓住了这种味道 并不断将其给予他
We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him

这样他便能将其直接给予你们
so he can give it right back to you

新款"简单瑞克"牌自由威化系列每一口都能尝到自由的味道
in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.

重温打破巨大幻觉的
Come home to the unique flavor

独特味道
of shattering the grand illusion.

在"简单瑞克"找到家的感觉
Come home to Simple Rick.

这地方真的存在
It is real.

你们先请
After you.

就是这儿了 许愿传送门
SPECS: There it is. The Wishing Portal.

他们说想要愿望成真
They say for your wish to come true,

你需要放弃一些对你真正重要的东西
you have to give up something really important.

对我来说 是我的帕尼尼机
For me, that’s my panini maker.

我想要一百万个三明治
I wish for a million sandwiches.

对 我知道这很讽刺
And, yes, I see the irony.

我猜我想要比这个
I guess I wish I had something cooler

愚蠢的冲浪项链更酷一点的东西
than this dumbass surfer necklace.

我希望乱伦黄片能有能有更主流的吸引力
I wish incest porn had -- had a more mainstream appeal.

帮我朋友许的
For -- For a friend of mine.

这些事都不会发生的
None of those things are gonna happen, you know.

Morty的愿望从来不会实现
Morty wishes never come true.

不会在瑞城实现
Not on the Citadel.

那你为什么要带我们到这来
Then why did you bring us here?

因为我希望这件事会改变
Because I wish that would change.

我希望生活中的一切都能改变
I wish anything about this life would change.

好吧 希望你能放些
Well, I hope you’re putting something

真的很重要的东西进去
pretty goddamn important in there.

我也希望
Me too.

但我不确定
But I doubt it.

- 不 - 小酷哥儿
-No! -Slick!

可 可能
M-Maybe...

可能这通向一个美好的地方
Maybe it went somewhere nice.

垃圾倾倒
AUTOMATED RICK: Garbage dump.

退后
Stand [burp] back.

得有人阻止他
He had to be sTopped.

他 他不 他不可以赢
He -- He co U-- He c-couldn’t be allowed to win.

那你还该更努力一些 兄弟
Then you should’ve [burps] worked on your aim, bro.

他没死 不 不 不 你们要听我说
He’s alive? No, no, no. You gotta listen to me.

我曾经为他工作 我是他的竞选经理
I-I worked for him. I was his campaign manager.

那个Morty不是他看上去的那样
That Morty is not what he seems.

是的 好吧 没有一个Morty看上去像一个总统
Yeah, well, no Morty seems like a president.

他 赢了
-He.. .won? -Yeah.

是的 压倒性的胜利(吹出去了)
It was a blowout.

根本算不上压倒性胜利
I would hardly call it a blowout.

都接近得快导致一次重新计票了
It was almost close enough to trigger a recount.

天哪 你这警卫当的 连笑话也要管制啦
Jesus. What are you, joke security now, too?

为什么我还在这里
RICK COP: Why am I still here?

我已经坦白了所有的事情
I heard he confessed to everything.

你的案子被重新审理了 你可以走了
Your case has been reviewed. You’re free to go.

但是 我违反了至少十来条部门章程
But.. .1 violated at least a dozen departmental codes.

新的部门 新的章程
New department. New codes.

新的瑞城
New Citadel.

我们错过了毕业典礼吗 新的Rick们在哪
SPECS: Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?

没有毕业典礼 没有新的Rick
No graduation. No new Ricks.

- 学校的课程安排变了 - 变成什么了
- The school’s curriculum is changing.- To what?

我不知道 我也不需要知道
I don’t know, and I don’t have to know.

我被炒了
I’ve been fired.

好运 小屁孩们
[ Burping ] Good luck, turds.

天哪 酷哥儿的愿望成真了
Holy crap. Slick’s wish came true.

对不起我迟到了 总统先生
Sorry I’m late, Mr. President.

- 工作上遇到了一些小麻烦 - 也算值了
-Had a little crisis at work. -Worth it!

没关系
It's no problem.

上面再多剪掉一点
Uh, a little more off the Top.

你想说什么 时装区Rick
You were saying, Garment District Rick.

我想说 "总统"Morty
We were saying, “President” Morty,

我们不在乎谁坐在那个椅子上
that we don’t care who sits in that seat.

—个Rick —个Morty —个他妈的Jerry 都不重要
A Rick, a Morty, a goddamn Jerry, doesn’t matter.

我们在议会之前就在管理瑞城
We’ve been running the Citadel since before the council,

并且你会知道现在仍然是我们说了算
and you’ll find that we’re still running it now.

在这里的每个人真的都像他所说的这样想吗
Does he really speak for everyone here?

- 嗯 - 是的
-Mm-hmm. -Yeah.

好吧 我觉得我们最好把话讲清楚
Well, I think it’s important to be clear.

如果你同意他所讲的 举起你的手
Raise your hand if he speaks for you.

上面剪掉得够多了吗
Is.. .that enough off the Top?

我不知道 够了么
I don’t know. Is it?

- 够了 够了 天哪 够了 - 我觉得这非常好
-Yes, yes, goddamn, yes. -I think it’s great.

好
Good.

这个时间似乎很适合来一杯酒
This seems like a good time for a drink

然后发表一个冷酷而又算计的演讲 带着邪恶的弦外之音
and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones.

一个关于政治
A speech about politics...

关于秩序
about order...

友爱
brotherhood...

权力的演讲
power.

但是竞选的时候才需要演讲
But speeches are for campaigning.

现在 需要的是行动
Now is the time for action.

喔 耶
Whoo! [Laughs] Yeah!

- 亚特兰蒂斯 宝贝 - 这太棒了
-Atlantis, baby! -That was amazing.

你搞了那美人鱼
You got some of that mermaid puss.

我真的希望不只有这一次
I’m really hoping it wasn’t a one-off thing

希望能再次见到她
and I can see her again.

对了 嗨 你还是不好奇瑞城
By the way, hey, urn, still not curious about

会发生什么事吗
what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?

切 一点不 Morty 那个地方永远再也不会
Psh. Not at all, Morty. That place will never have

影响到我们的生活了
any bearing over our lives ever again.

不像那个美人鱼小逼
Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!

- 耶 我们要再回去 - 耶 耶 喔
We’re going back for seconds!

我们要每周搞一次 兄弟
We’re gonna do that shit every week, man!

- 那是亚特兰蒂斯 - 噢 天哪
-That was Atlantis! -Oh, shit!

S03E08

Morty 快跑
Morty, hurry!

归还真理龟
Return the Truth Tortoise!

Morty 千万别把真理龟砸地上
Morty, whatever you do, don’t drop the Truth Tortoise!

还有一点很重要
Also really important,

千万不要直视它的眼睛
whatever you do, don’t look into its eyes!

我 我看了 Rick 我一直在看呢
I-I did look at it, Rick! I’ve been looking at it!

现在你就要知晓一切了 Morty
Now you’re gonna know everything, Morty!

太棒了 恭喜你搞砸了一切
Good job! Way to go! You tucked everything up!

都在我脑子里了
It's in my head! [Screams]

哦天啦 我没法忘掉真理龟
Oh, geez, I-I can’t get that Truth Tortoise out of my head.

我跟你说了别直视它的眼睛
Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes.

来 Morty 我们看跨维度电视吧
Hey, Morty, let’s watch some interdimensional cable.

就像以前那样
Remember how we used to do that?

Rick 我 我撑不下去了
Rick, I can’t -- I can’t go on.

我 我没法想着
I-I can’t go on like this

真理龟的事继续生活
with the Truth Tortoise shit in my head.

我 我希望你可以
I-I wish you could just --

从你的脑海里删除这段记忆
Erase the memory from your mind?

你怎么知道我要说什么
How did you know I was gonna say that?

Morty 跟我来
Come on, Morty, come with me.

请吧
After you.

这他妈是什么
What the hell is this?!

Morty 这是我用来
This, Morty, is my archive

陈列着所有你求我删除的人生经历的档案室
of all the experiences you’ve begged me to remove

免得你发疯
from your life, lest you go insane.

我管这些叫Morty的摧心时刻
I call them Morty’s Mind Blowers.

接下来就欣赏这个吧 不看跨维度电视了
And we’ll be doing this instead of interdimensional cable.

我什么时候开始让你给我删除记忆的
How long have I been asking you to remove memories?

从你的心理防线第一次被摧毁开始
Since the first [burps] time your mind was blown.

在这儿呢
Ahh, here it is. [ Burps]

经典
Classic. [Blows]

上面没看灰尘
There’s no dust on it because

因为这不是我们第一次搞这个
this isn’t the first time we’ve done this.

啥
What?!

我管这个叫"月球阴谋"
l call this one “Moonspiracy”!

哇 不可思议
MORTY: Huh, wow. That’s incredible.

什么鬼
What the heck?

Morty 你知道你说的话有多荒谬吗
Morty, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?

是啊 Morty 疯狂的故事
Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

你认真的吗
Are you serious?

跟我们见过的东西相比 你觉得这个很疯狂
Half the crap we’ve seen, and you think that sounds crazy?

我去过300个版本的地球的月球
I’ve been to 300 versions of Earth’s moon,

也包括这一个 但我从来没见过
including this one, and I’ve never seen signs

你所描述的 "一个普通男人"的迹象
of a “regular dude,” as you describe him,

在那儿上面
hanging out up there.

可能只是镜头上的脏东西
It’s probably just a smudge on the lens.

镜头上的脏东西 镜头上的脏东西
Smudge on the lens? Smudge on the lens?!

我能分清一个吓唬我的男人
I know the difference between a man threatening me

和镜头上的脏东西 Summer
and a smudge on the goddamn lens, Summer!

冷静点 Morty 你还好吗
Morty, calm down! Are you feeling okay?

我很好
I’m fine!

太敏感了
So sensitive.

同学们这位是我们新来的
PRINCIPAL VAGINA: Kids, I’d like to introduce you all

辅导员Lunas(月亮)先生
to our new guidance counselor, Mr. Lunas.

我很期待为大家的远大前途指路
I look forward to helping guide you all

我相信每个学生都该壮志凌云
towards a brighter future.

欲上青天揽明月
I believe every student should...shoot for the moon.

抓到你的把柄了 混蛋
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

这是什么
What’s this?

证据 证明Lunas先生不像表面那么简单
Proof that Mr. Lunas isn’t who he says he is!

他难道不是个辅导员吗
He’s not a guidance counselor?

我 我想他应该够格当辅导员 谁都够格
I-I assume he’s qualified to be one. Who isn’t?

但他同时还生活在月球上
But he also lives on the moon.

好的
Okay.

然后呢
Hmm. Is that it?

他是否做了伤害别人的事
Is he doing anything to hurt anyone?

噢 他肯定在盘算着做点什么
Oh, he’s up to something.

我想我明白了
I think I understand.

"做点什么" "生活在月球上"
“Up to something,” “lives on the moon.”

好吧 我去跟他谈谈
Okay, I’ll talk to him.

他怎么说
What did he say?

他否认了关于月球的事 不过恋童癖都是这样
Denied the moon stuff, but that’s what pedophiles do.

他们会否认 他们以此谋生
They deny. It’s their bread and butter.

- 什么恋童癖 - 你不是这个意思吗
-Pedophile? -You don’t think so?

我以为生活在月球上是个什么暗语
I thought the moon thing might have been code.

不 他是字面意义上的来自于月球
No, he’s literally from the moon!

呃 你看到他的反应了
Well, you saw him react.

不管月球不月球的 那家伙绝对喜欢年轻的
Moon or not, that dude likes ‘em young.

Gordon Lunas曾是一名优秀的海军陆战队员
Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

我们不知道有什么事会让他选择自杀
We don’t know what drove him to take his own life,

但我们想要记住那些美好的事情
but we want to remember the good things.

比如 人们经常会说
Like how, from a certain angle,

从某个角度看上去 他长得像一片污迹
some people would say he looked like a smudge.

我的天 我都干了些什么
Oh, my God, what have I done?

我干了些什么啊
What have I done?

天哪 我害得那个人自杀了
Jesus, I made that guy kill himself!

只是字面意义上而已
Only in a literal sense.

我叫这一个"Morty的私人动物园"
Here’s one I call “Morty’s [burp] Menagerie.”

不过 不是所有的片段都有标题
They don’t all have titles, though.

这不是<辛普森一家>的万圣节特辑
IVs not a “Simpsons” Halloween special,

这更像是你从没见过的片段的片段展映
more like a clip show made of clips you never saw!

我简直无法相信我们被扔进了私人动物园
I can’t believe we got put into a menagerie.

所以这人爱好收集活物吗
So this guy collects living beings?

是啊 就像那些收集人物纪念盘的
RICK: Yeah, you know like commemorative plates,

不过没那么惹人烦
but less off-putting.

要是你到40岁时仍要经常约会 你也会理解的
You’ll get it when you’re still actively dating in your 40s.

有本事面不改色地鉴赏下这个啊
Assess this with cold indifference,

你个圆头混账
you veiny-headed prick!

嘿 小声点
-[ Crash! ] -Hey, keep it down!

我们这运气 给关在
Just our luck, menagerie beneath

G七星的石头人下边儿
the “boulder people” of Granitor Seven.

我受不了了 Rick
I can’t take it anymore, Rick!

放松 Morty
-[ Banging] -Relax, Morty!

我没法放松 Rick 我 我们得逃出这个地方
I can’t relax! R-R-Rick, we -- we gotta get outta here!

我不管用什么方法 什么都行
I don’t care what it takes! Anything!

- 什么都行吗 - 都行
-Anything? -Anything!

好吧 不过你得把你的衣服脱了
All right, well, you’re gonna have to take off your shirt.

不是现在 我会告诉你什么时候的
Not yet. Ill tell you when.

天哪
Dear God.

怎么了
What?

这个信号居然是
The signal turned out to be --

没有其他说法来描述它了
there’s no other way to put it --

- 指南 - 什么东西的
-Instructions. -For?

飞行器 先生 一台穿越星际的飞行器
A vehicle, sir, an interstellar vehicle.

我们需要一个飞行员 不知道有没有志愿者
We’ll need a pilot. I wonder if there’s a volunteer.

图表上明确表示需要一个身材矮小的副驾驶
Oh, the schematics specify a second, smaller pilot.

我是说 这方面写得真的很明确
I mean, they really specify smaller.

必须正好是1米6
They have to be exactly 5’3”.

Chang 虽然你主修的是文科
Chang, you may have majored in Liberal Arts,

但是你将要创造历史了
but I think you’re about to make history.

主要系统 检查完毕
WOMAN: Primary systems, check.

辅助系统 检查完毕
Auxiliary systems, check.

很快就见到你喽
See you soon.

好的 现在
Okay, now.

你们好
Greetings.

你是 你看起来
You’re -- You look...

我们采用了你们的心智可以接受的形态
We’ve possessed forms your mind can accept.

这两件传统服装是送你们的礼物
Here are some customary clothing gifts.

请穿上吧
Please, put them on.

- 可以吗 - 当然可以
-May we? -Of course, yes.

我们遵照了你的指示
We followed your instructions.

我们还有很多需要向你学习的地方
We have so much to learn from you.

可不是嘛
I know, right?

嘿 我为什么能看见其他人的记忆呢
Hey, how come I was able to see those other people’s memories?

我又不在场
I-I wouldn’t have been around for that.

是啊 有时候我得稍微编辑一下 Morty
Yeah, sometimes I gotta do a little editing, Morty.

这样 再看这些催心的时刻
It helps the mind blowers

播放效果会好一些
play a little bit better upon revisiting.

我把这个叫做"一整份儿墨西哥卷儿"
I call this one “The Whole Enchilada.

给你 Morty 有了这个你的尿就能喝了
Here, Morty, this’ll make your urine drinkable.

现在我们能接着买东西了吧
Now can we keep shopping?

我是Zikzak
I am Zikzak.

我操 Morty 躲到我身后 这是个外星霸主
Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me. It’s a fucking alien overlord!

没关系的 给你
It’s okay. Here.

噢 我搞错了
Oh, I misjudged.

"我是个Floop星人 请杀掉我吧"
MORTY: “I am Floop Floopian. Please kill me.”

这就对了 Morty
That’s right, Morty.

Floop星人死后可以获得无尽欢愉的永生
The Floop Floopians achieve an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

只要他们被一个伟大的战士杀掉
so long as they’re killed by a great warrior.

我真是受宠若惊啊 顺便提一句 真是太谢谢你了
I’m flattered, by the way. Thank you very much.

所以你要杀了他
So you’re gonna kill him?

咱们先吃点午饭吧
Eh, let’s get some lunch first.

你想在脑门上挨一枪 还是
So, you want to get shot in the head, or --

呃 只要是致命伤就可以
Well, as long as the wound is fatal,

我其实并不介意你开枪打哪个部位
I don’t really mind where you shoot me.

好的 我去拉屎 很快回来
Cool. I’m gonna go take a quick shit.

呃 我不得不说 你知道的 我有点嫉妒
Well, I gotta say. You know, I’m a little envious.

你们这类物种有实实在在的来生
Your species has an actual afterlife.

那肯定很棒
That’s gotta be nice.

什么 你是什么意思
Wh-What do you mean?

噢 你知道的 在地球上 我们并不清楚究竟是怎么回事
Well, you know, here on Earth, w-we don’t know what’s going on.

你们有来生 一定很棒
It must be nice for you guys to, you know, have that --

而且板上钉钉 你知道的 就是有真凭实据
have that proof’s in the pudding, you know, evidence.

真凭实据 应该有真凭实据吗
Evidence? There’s supposed to be evidence?

噢 是的
Urn, yeah, uh...

不然的话 你怎么知道那是不是真的
Otherwise, how do you know if it’s true?

等一等 你没有
Wait, you don’t...

好了 所以 你想在这儿还是去外面受死
All right, so you want to do this here or outside?

快跑
Run!

我不想死
I don’t wanna die!

哦 老天爷啊 这全是真的 嗷 好疼
Oh, God, it’s all real! Oh, it hurts!

噢 我就不应该怀疑
Oh, I shouldn’t have doubted it!

我就不该被你左右 心存疑虑
I shouldn’t have let you make me doubt it!

啊 都怪你 都怪你
Aah! I blame you, I blame you!

但是他当时说了 什么证据也没有
But he said there wasn’t any evidence!

那可是一堆证据
That was a ton of evidence!

呃 算是个小小的慰藉吧
Well, silver lining.

现在我知道了 他们的信仰是真的
Now I know their religion’s real.

他们有地狱 而且看起来可不咋地啊
They have a hell, and it does not look good.

我注意到 你没吃完你的煎肉卷
I noticed you never finished your chimichanga,

所以现在我给它空了点位置出来 懂我意思吧
so I got some room for it now, if you know what I mean.

天呐
Holy shit!

这种事情里面 有多少就是我犯下的可怕错误
How many of these are just horrible mistakes I’ve made?

如果我能从里面得到点教训的话
I mean, maybe I’d sTop making so many

或许我以后能少犯点错
if I let myself learn from them!

别费劲儿给自己上课了 Morty
Don’t break your back creating a lesson, Morty.

这是个自由风格的选集
It’s a freeform anthology.

你不听我说话让我觉得挺生气的
I’m getting annoyed you’re not hearing that.

就像你看到的 你脑子崩过的次数根本数不清
As you can see around me, your mind’s been blown

而且也并不是每次都因为你
countless times, and not always by yourself.

妈的 我甚至没有
Ah, shit, I don’t even --

最好别是个精彩的
This better not have been a good one.

这是啥来着
What is this?

棒极了 "鼻屎艾滋" "艾滋鼻屎"
Great, “Booger AIDS,” “AIDS Booger.”

我得开始用真正的归档名称了
I gotta start using real file names.

同时 希望你喜欢这个随机挑选的摧心时刻
In the meantime, enjoy a grab bag

我把它命名为"重要的便便艾滋备份"
of mind blowers I call “Poop AIDS underscore copy.”

我不是个不讲理的人 Beth Smith
ALIEN WARLORD: I’m not an unreasonable man, Beth Smith.

我知道对于哺乳动物来说 子女就是一切
I know children are everything to a mammal.

我会留下一个活口
I will spare one of their lives.

你只需做个选择
You simply have to choose.

Summer Summer
Summer! Summer.

你敢信么
You’re not gonna believe this.

我把Phoebe(土卫九)当Titan(土卫六) 跑那儿去了
I went to Phoebe instead of Titan.

感觉就像 嗨 土星 卫星数目超过十个了
It's, like, hello, Saturn, after 10 moons,

是不是就该用编号替代名字了啊
time to sTop naming and start numbering, you know?

你们 你们这是怎么了混蛋们
What’s -- Wh-What’s with you assholes?

Morty 求你了 别这样
Morty, please, don’t do this.

你们的Morty已经死了
[Voice echoing] Your Morty is gone!

我是Voltamatron 诸界的毁灭者
I am Voltamatron, Destroyer of Worlds!

Rick外公 一定有什么科学的手段能救他
Grandpa Rick, there must be some scientific way to save him!

不算科学 但是确实有个办法
Not scientific, but there may be a way.

Morty 我知道你还在 是我 你的外公
Morty, I know you’re in there. It’s me, your grandpa.

我知道我有时候很刻薄 但是我爱你 Morty
I know I can be mean, but I love you, Morty.

我们都很爱你 你要奋起抵抗
We all do. You gotta fight this thing.

我知道你可以的 你比我们所有人都要更强
I know you can. You’re stronger than all of us!

Morty 是妈妈啊 我们爱你 你必须战胜它
Morty, it’s Mom! We love you. You have to fight it!

加油 Morty 战胜那个傻逼虫子
Come on, Morty! Fight that stupid worm thing!

我们爱你
-We love you! -[ Screaming]

我们超级爱你
SUMMER: We love you so much!

没错 Morty 加油 你做的很棒
RICK: Yes, Morty, come on, you’re doing it!

你做的很棒 你做的很棒
You’re doing it! You’re doing it!

我们该去拉一下么
Should we pull it out?

不 别碰那玩意 继续爱Morty就行了
No, don’t touch it. Just keep loving Morty!

我们还在爱你
We still love you.

但是我六点钟确实有点事
But I do have a thing at 6:00.

喔 天啊 我们必须一直在边上看着么
Oh, God, do I have to keep looking?

天啊 Morty 夹断都成
Geez, Morty, come on, pinch it off already!

别 喔天啊 对不起 Morty 我爱你哟
Don’t! Oh, God, sorry, Morty. I love you!

天 过一段时间会有中场休息么
God, is there going to be an intermission?

不好意思 但是我订的邪恶太空虫是大份的
Excuse me, but I ordered the large evil space worm.

我知道 感觉就像 是有个魔鬼蛞蝓在你胃里
I know, it’s like, is that a demon slug in your stomach,

还是你只是喜欢去
or are you just happy to --

对不起
-[ Screaming] -Sorry!

好吧 知道所有家人都糟透了挺不错的
Well, I guess it’s nice to know the whole family sucks!

所以 如果蓝色代表的是我犯的错
So if the blue ones are my fault

紫色的代表的是我家人的 那红色的是什么
and the purple ones are my family’s, what are the red ones?

好吧 别想太多 Morty
Yeah, d-don’t read into it, Morty!

操 我们必须在日落之前找到藏身的地方 Morty
Shit! We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty.

V九星晚上的温度可以达到零下300度
Venzenulon Nine has a night temperature of 300 below!

我们会冻死的 Morty 几秒就会被冻死的
We’ll freeze, Morty! W-We’ll be dead in seconds!

我 我记得我在那边看到过一个山洞
I-I think I saw a cave over there.

你电影看太多了 Morty
You’ve seen too many movies, Morty.

一个山洞根本不够 我们得靠Beebo
A cave isn’t gonna cut it. We’re gonna have to use Beebo.

是Beebo带我们找到了水源 他是我们的朋友
Beebo led us to water! He’s our friend!

- 他不会感到痛苦的 - 喔 别 别
-He won’t even feel it! -Oh, no, no!

你想死吗 Morty 快躲到Beebo里面
You wanna die, Morty? Get in Beebo!

哦 不 不
Oh, no, no!

准备迎接冰点低温的降临
Brace for the ice limit.

来啦
Here it comes!

等下 我们是在V九星球还是V七星球
Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine or Venzenulon Seven?

等等 为什么我会想要消除这段记忆
Wait a minute. Why would I ask for that to be removed?

还是说红色的这些都是你想让我消除的记忆
Are the red ones stuff you wanted removed?

哦 这想法很聪明 Morty 但我才不会用颜色来做分类整理
Ooh, that’s clever, Morty, but I don’t use color to sort things

因为我不是欧洲儿童读物里的老鼠
because I’m not a mouse in a European children’s book.

那为什么那些粉红色的记忆管都放在酒的边上
Then why are all those pink ones by the liquor?

酒
Liquor?

- 擦 刚才好险 - Sky队长死了
-Shit, that was close. -We lost Captain Sky.

他为起义献出了生命
He gave his life for the uprising.

是啊 这事儿真引人深思 Morty
Yeah. It really makes you think, huh, Morty?

我们不该把事情都看做理所岗然
We should never take things for granite.

- 什么 - 我只是说 人生苦短
-What? -I’m just saying, life’s short.

我们不该把事情都看做理所岗然
We shouldn’t take things for granite.

- 你说的是"理所岗然" - 是啊
-Are you saying “granite”? -Well, yeah.

是"理所当然" 读"dang"
It’s “granted,” with a “D.”

是把事情看做理所当然 难道你一直都说的是
Take things for granted. Did you actually think it was --

天啊 Rick
[ Laughs] Jesus Christ, Rick,

你是块石头吗 还是石头人(Granite 花岗岩)
what are you, a boulder -- a rock person?

你这样说错多久了
How long have you been saying that wrong?

哦 你喜欢这个是吗
Oh, you like that, huh?

我猜 猜这肯定让你挺爽的吧
I b-b-bet that really blows your mind.

是的 还挺棒的
I mean, yeah, it’s kind of great.

- 你想要我消除这段记忆吗 - 什么 你还能这么干
-You want me to erase it? -What, you can do that?

妈呀
-[ Buzzing] -Ah, shit.

我他妈就知道 你个人渣
I fucking knew it, you piece of shit!

你 你 你他妈是个混蛋 Rick
You -- You -- You’re a fucking asshole, Rick!

别激动啊 Morty 拜托 放轻松
Take it easy, Morty. Come on. Just relax.

不 我才不要他妈地放轻松 给老子过来
No, I’m not gonna fucking relax! Come here!

放开我 小贱人
Let go ot me, you little bitch!

- 我要他妈好好制住你个 - 接招吧
- I’m gonna grab you by the scruff of your  -Take that! -Ohh!

- 唔 - 唔
-U mm. -U mm. Uhh.

- 什么 - 怎么回事
-What -- -What’s going on?

- 我在哪儿 - 我们是谁
-Where am I? -Who are we?

我是谁
Who am I?

我觉得我是个少年
l think I’m an adolescent boy.

我是个老头
Huh, and I’m an elderly man.

看起来我们应该是处于某个秘密的封闭空间
And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.

是的 嗯
-Yeah, umm...

别这么看着我
Don’t look at me like that.

搞不好你才是这里的怪胎
For all we know, you could be the fuckin’ weirdo.

这些东西显然是储存单位
Huh, these things are obviously storage units,

既然我们都不记得发生了什么
and since we can’t remember what went wrong,

我猜这是和记忆有关的科技
my guess is that the technology involves memory

而你脑袋上的这个东西是设计用来
and that this thing on your head is designed to...

告诉我们密码 蠢货
Tell us the code, jagoff!

没用了 他在负隅顽抗
It’s pointless. He’s stonewalling.

Rick 如果我们不能解锁那些疫苗的话 地球就完蛋了
Rick, if we don’t unlock those vaccines, Earth dies!

是时候加强一下你的审讯手段了
You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation!

我不确定你想表达的意思 Morty
Not sure what you’re implying, Morty,

但有些底线我是不会越过的
but some lines I don’t cross.

在这个混蛋想要杀Jessica的时候
Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had

我就已经越过了我所有的底线了
when this bastard tried to kill Jessica!

好吧 你看他下巴下面有两块肉肉的囊 Morty
Okay, see those two fleshy sacs under his chin, Morty?

抓着它们
Grab ‘em.

你现在记得密码是多少了吗
You remember the codes now?

用力拧
-Twist! -[ Screaming]

告诉我们密码 老兄 用力拧 Morty
Give us the codes, man! Twist harder, Morty!

用力
-Harder! -[ Screaming]

好了 放手 放手 让他呼吸
Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe.

他想做一笔交易
He wants to make a deal.

现在先给一半的密码 等你做完以后再给另一半
Half the codes now, half after you finish.

但是我们可以相信 等等 什么
But can we trust -- Wait, what?

做 做完什么
F-Finish what?

你 你知道的
Y-You know.

我以为我在折磨他
I thought I was torturing him!

噢 所以这让你失望了
Oh, and this disappoints you?

你要我告诉他不做这笔交易了 Morty
Do I tell him we don’t have a deal, Morty?

因为我们可以杀死我们的敌人
Because if we can kill our enemies

但我们不能给他们撸一炮 那我们又比他们高级在哪里
but we can’t jack them off, then how are we better than them?

好吧 你发现了什么
Well, what did you find out?

我们是搭档 我猜
We’re partners, I guess,

然后我们对抗外星人 像"黑衣人"里一样
and we fight aliens, like “Men in Black”?

"黑衣人" "黑衣人"
“Men in Black,” “Men in Black.”

我记得"黑衣人2"是什么
I have “Men in Black 2” in here.

所以 所以你大致懂了
So -- So you get the general idea.

并没有
[ Laughs] Not quite.

只是没完没了的一连串老梗
It's basically an endless string of callbacks to --

行了 想说啥留着传油管吧 我要继续找线索了
All right, save it for YouTube. I’ll keep looking for clues.

你在干什么
What are you doing?

你到底要不要水平的架子
You want your shelf level or not?

如果我说想 你还能用这个给我做出来不成
And if I say yes, you’re gonna provide that for me with that?

是的 看到气泡了吗
Yes, see the bubble?

我很熟悉气泡 Morty
I’m familiar with the bubble, Morty.

我还对精确性有些研究
I also dabble in precision,

如果你认为用你可怜的 穴居人水平的肉眼
and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball

和一个破气泡 可以接近水平
and a bubble of fucking air,

你就是人类这物种为啥是失败品的原因
you’re the reason this species is a failure,

这让我生气
and it makes me angry!

你喝醉了
You’re drunk.

如果你想搭架子 那你就好好搭
You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf.

你是想体验下真正的水平吗
You want to experience true level?

- 是吗 - 行吧
-Do you? -[ Sighs dramatically] Y-yes.

好了 来吧
Ugh, all right, come on.

哇 这真是太
Wow, it’s so --

噢 噢 噢 噢 天哪 噢 妈呀 噢 噢 噢
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

噢 是的 绝对水平 小崽子
Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

Morty 怏点 我们要去上学了
Morty, come on, we’re leaving for school.

噢 一切都不平整 现实就像是毒药
Oh, everything’s crooked! Reality is poison!

我想要回去 我讨厌这样
I want to go back! I hate this!

他怎么了
-What’s his deal? -Can’t live like this!

- 不能这样活着 - 嘘 嘘 嘘 嘘 Morty Morty Morty
Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.

你去上学吧 Summer 我要进到Morty的记忆里
Go to school, Summer. I’ll go in Morty’s memory

然后做一些
and do a little -- [Clicks tongue]

我为鱼肉 整个宇宙都是刀俎
Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

怎么样
Well?

我能记住什么好像归你管
You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember.

为什么
Why?

好问题
Good question.

Morty 我需要黑暗的环境来制备这些光学指示剂
Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors.

帮我拉一下门旁边最靠左的灯光开关
Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me.

左边
The left.

好了 开灯
Okay, lights on.

所以 我刚刚是不是听到了三次不同的开关声音
So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?

你 你说什么
W-W-What do you mean?

我觉得这三次声音可以解释成
I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained

最开始错误的拉了右边的开关
by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right

接着是匆忙地拉了正确的
followed by a hasty, corrective flipping

我要你拉的开关
of the requested switch.

然后在黑暗和寂静中 第三次
Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third,

羞耻地拉了最开始拉措的开关
shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch.

是不是都让我说中了
Is my assessment accurate?

是吧 那个 你基本都说对了
Yeah, that’s -- that’s basically how -- how it all shaked out.

我很抱歉
I’m sorry.

行吧 那我们走吧
Ugh. All right, come on.

- 什么 - 我说 快 来
-What?! -Come on!

拿把铲子
-[ Click, tone ends] -Grab a shovel.

这 这是
W-What is --

给我拿把铲子
Grab a shovel!

你又干嘛了
What was that?

我他妈怎么一条拉链带都找不到了
I can’t find a goddamn zip tie anywhere!

对了 不管它了
All right, fuck it!

有拉链带了
Ahh, zip tie.

为什么又要我给你装这个仪器
Why are you making me do this for you again?

谁不想和动物说话啊 Rick

真是好笑 Jerry一辈子就想别人关注他
It’s funny, Jerry spent his life seeking attention,

但是最后 人类对Jerry本能的排挤
but in the end, humanity’s instinctive dismissal of him

却救了一个外星人的命
saved an alien’s life.

他知道要去哪 是吧
He knows where to go, right?

嗯 他马上就到了
Yep, any minute now.

就引爆了Reddit首页
and it breaks the front page of Reddit,

我给你创造了整个世界 而不是塞个iPad了事
but I’m Charles Manson because I gave you

倒成你眼中的杀人狂了
your own world instead of an iPad.

你现在一定想说 啊
I think the words you’re looking for are -- Aah!

我操他娘 这畜生有爪子
Holy tuck! Shit! This thing has claws!

行了 我懂 这里对儿童特别安全
Yeah, I get it. It’s a childproot world.

不不 我认真的 真的很痛啊
No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad!

这玩意儿锋利的爪子都陷进我的
This thing is sinking razor-sharp claws in --

啊 操
Aah! Shit!

你说的我都明白了 爸
-You’ve made your point, Dad. -[ Screeches]

爸
Dad?

呃
-Ugh! -[ Both panting ]

周末监护权这种事儿是哪个蠢货想出来的
Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing?

我觉得应该是防止陷入害怕被遗弃的情绪的
I think it’s supposed to help prevent abandonment issues.

我想要被遗弃
I want to be abandoned.

我说的是咱爸
-Yeah, I’m talking about Dad. -[ Door opens]

欢迎来到离婚老爸的家
Bienvenue a Ia Chez Divorced Dad.

Your place looks way less like a crackhouse.

这儿还挺干净的 像个藏毒点
It’s actually clean, like a cocaine house.

爸 发生什么了吗
Dad, what’s going on?

我只是精神集中 生活积极
I’m simply centered, activated --

她是来自Krootabulon的女战士祭司
She’s a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon.

我 我知道Krootabulon是哪儿 老爸
I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad.

察门拓咯 年轻人们
Chaimuntolo, younglings.

海们 切咯
Hymen.. .cholo.

你们父亲心里充满着对你们的爱
Your father’s mind holds love for you.

能在物理层面相会 请多指教
I am humbled to meet in physicality.

老爸 你这是
Dad, are you --

在和一位牛逼性感的外星女士谈恋爱吗
In love with a badass, sexy alien lady?

哈哈 说不准 Summer 你觉得呢
Ha, ha, I don’t know, Summer. You tell me.

我没打算问你是不是和她恋爱
I wasn’t going to ask if you were in love

因为你基本上不认识她
since you barely know her.

Summer Kiara和我是通过星际约会服务认识的
Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service

你妈和我还在一起时Rick总是给我介绍那个服务
Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together.

然后事情就顺理成章发生了
And things just kind of clicked.

我们必须行动了
We must move!

我们的预订是7点钟
Our reservation is at 7:00.

我不想她离开
-[ Whoosh] -l hate to see her leave,

但是我爱看她相位移动走的样子
but I love to watch her phase shift away.

我想你们都注意到她有三个那什么了
I’m sure you noticed what she has three of,

但是猜猜她什么部位有两个
but guess what she has two of.

呜呼 好啦 别啄了
All right, knock it off!

听着 我一直没追究你们
Listen, I’ve been giving you a pass

生命的奇妙让我很感动 但是
because I’m charmed that life finds a way, but --

啊 够了
Aah! All right, you know what?

痛
-[ Ray gun fires] -Ouch!

噢 啊
Oh! Unh!

痛 天哪
Ouch! God!

啊
-[ Sizzling ] -Aah!

啊
Agh!

噢 爸 这个地方是最安全的
Oh, yeah, this place is the safest.

世上最好的老爸
Best dad ever.

你就不能直接说"我承认 我搞砸了"吗
Can’t you just say, “I admit it, I screwed up”?

呃 那又有什么意义吗
Uh, what would be the point of that?

你做不到 是吧
[Chuckling] You can’t do it, can you?

你他妈就不会道歉
You can’t just fucking apologize.

好啦好啦 Beth 我很抱歉
Okay, okay, Beth, I’m sorry...

抱歉的是你认为你理应得到我的道歉
you think you deserve an apology.

嘿 别看我啊
-[ Screeches] -Hey, don’t look at me.

你小孩在人来人往的超市地上滚来滚去
You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target,

那总是要被踩上的
it’s gonna get stepped on.

哈 问题出在这儿
Huh. Well, here’s the problem right here.

一堆仙果乐园程序的碳
We’ve got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons

和人类DNA搅和着混在了一起
all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA.

你是说Tommy通过和仙果生物发生性关系而在这里存活下来
Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures,

生下仙果人类混血后代
creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring,

然后摄入他们的蛋白质
and then consuming their proteins,

用永无止境的食人乱伦循环来维持生命吗
sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest?

那只是一个讲得通的理论
It’s just a working theory.

当然了 如果真的是这样
Of course, if that’s the case,

我猜他应该会在他那些难吃的后代组成的
I expect he’d be worshiped as a kind of god

一个中世纪水平的社会中被当做某种神明来供奉
by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children.

不许动 你们是囚犯 属于我们高贵的主宰者
Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler,

赐予生命者 夺取生命者
giver and taker of life,

救助凡人者 吞噬凡人者
humper and consumer of mortality,

- 生命的播散者 - 好的 我能打断一下么
-dispenser of life -- -Yes, if I could interrupt?

这些我们早早的就知道了
We’re way ahead of the reveal here.

对 带我们去见你们的Tommy国王就行了
Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.

我以为女祭司战士
I thought warrior priestesses

只能在狩猎的时候离开K星
could only leave Krootabu Ion on a hunt.

嗯 谢谢你甜心
Mmm. Thank you, sweetie.

我希望现在不是猎人类的季节
I hope it’s not human season.

我来地球是为了狩猎Varrix 我绝对不会猎杀人类的
I’m on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human.

你们的父亲已经和我灵魂相绑了
Your father and I are soul-bonded.

灵魂相绑
Soul-bonded?

呃 你们星球的一天是不是比较短
Urn, does your planet have shorter days,

因为你俩进展得有点快了吧
because you guys are moving kind of fast, no?

干掉他 宝贝几
Go get him, honey!

她总是在狩猎
She’s always hunting. [Chuckles]

她可能知道有个Varrix在这工作
She probably knew a Varrix worked here,

所以她说Yelp上的评价无所谓
and that’s why she said the Yelp reviews didn’t matter.

爸 你到底知不知道
Dad, do you understand

对于K星人来说灵魂相绑是多严肃的事
how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

呃 天 Morty 我不知道 名字都这么随意的了
Uh, gee, Morty, I don’t know. It’s got such a casual name.

如果你们想教育谁关于承诺的事儿
If you want to lecture anyone about commitment,

先去找你们的妈吧
start with your mom.

我的天 爸 这就是这件事的原因么
Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this is about?

你这么急着找新欢是为了报复妈
Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom?

每个周末 你们俩都告诉我要放下 向前看
Every weekend, you two have told me to move on.

向前看的意思是先从床上下来
Move on, like, out of bed.

别再用面巾纸当擦屁股纸
Like, sTop using paper towels for toilet paper,

不是马马虎虎的去找一个备胎
not move on into a sloppy rebound.

爸 你需要冷静一下 仔细想想这个灵魂相绑的事
Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond.

你们为什么就不能老实讲讲心里话呢
Why don’t you just say what you really mean?

你们觉得这很酷
You think it’s cool

我靠和她上床就能意念移物
that having sex with her gives me telekinesis

而且你们也看出来了她身材超辣
and you recognize she’s got a hot bod

就像<霹雳猫>里的Cheetara一样
like Cheetara in “Thundercats,”

但是你们就是看不惯她
but you’re grossed out

因为她有个牛油果形状的脑袋和蓝色的皮肤
by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin,

然后你们认为我可能想套个袋子和假发在她脑袋上
and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head.

不管怎么说 我花了这么多时间精力
After all the time and energy I spent

去教育你俩关于种族的事情
teaching you two about race...

最后你俩还是搞种族歧视了
-[ Varrix screams] -. . .you ended up racist.

很快Varrix就会从你们的世界消失
Soon your world will be rid of Varrix.

明天 我们庆祝
Tomorrow, we celebrate.

我们可以带孩子们去水上乐园
We could take the kids to the water park.

我们用狩猎来庆祝
We celebrate with a hunt!

喔 孩子们 想打猎么
Ooh. You kids want to hunt?

- 想 - 想
-Yes. -Yes.

全体跪拜Tommy国王
All kneel for King Tommy!

我才不跪 舔我屌吧
I’m not kneeling. Suck my dick.

你们好啊 所有人
Well, hello, all!

我是这片土地的国王
I am the King of Froopyland,

但我也有用另外一个名字
but I go by another name, too.

-We know. -It's Tommy!

- 我们知道 - 我们知道
-We know. -We know.

我从只是个小孩子的时候就住在这里了
I have lived here since I was a mere child.

- 我们知道 - 知道了
-We know. -Got it.

我想你们一定想知道 我是怎么生存下来的
I suppose you’re wondering, how do I sustain myself?

- 哦 天 - 不我们不想
-Oh, boy. -No, we aren’t.

我一直认为戏剧是说明事情最好的方式
I always find the theater is the best way to clarify things.

- 啊 - 认真的么
-Ugh. -Seriously?

- 喔我的天啊 - 演员们 开始吧
-Oh, my God. -TOMMY: Players, go!

我是小Tommy
I am little Tommy.

我是小Beth
I am tiny Beth.

噢 不是吧
Oh, come on.

跟我一起来我的魔法世界吧
Come with me to my magic world.

别去啊
FROOPY: Don’t do it!

这是我的秘密仙果乐园 这里没有规矩
This is my secret Froopyland where I have no rules!

我好兴奋
I am excited.

我嫉妒Tommy的朋友们和他的任天堂游戏
I am jealous of Tommy’s friends and his Nintendo

还有他那位爱他的爸爸
and his dad who likes him.

我猜Tommy不是个出色的剧作家啊
I take it Tommy wasn’t class playwright.

你想看看蜂蜜沼泽吗
Do you want to see the Honey Swamp?

好啊 咱们去看吧
Yes! Let’s do it!

呃 我想看着你死翘翘
Well, I want to see you dead.

喔 救命啊 我被困住了
Ow, help! I’m stuck!

我被埋进了蜜糖里
I’m covered in honey.

哼 呃 还挺有意思的
Huh. Well, that’s interesting.

都是假的
Fake news.

许多个夜晚过去了 我依然被困在这块陌生的土地上
Many nights have passed, trapped in this strange land.

饥饿袭来 我只能通过干一发来打发时间
I am hungry, and all I can do to pass the time is hump.

我和石头来一发
I will hump this rock.

和这棵树来一发
I will hump this tree.

和这块土地上的野兽来一发
I will hump this beast of the land

在它体内留种
and put my seed in it.

我是Tommy的第一个孩子
I am the first of Tommy’s children.

吃了我的肉 你就有机会活下来
Eat of my flesh so you may survive.

所以我就这么做了
And so I did.

噢 哇哦 好吧 呃呃
Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah.

那事儿确实是真的 干 干得好
Certified fresh. Good -- Good job.

或许接下来该到示范时间了
Perhaps a demonstration is in order. [ Unzips shorts ]

- 不 接下来我最不想看到的就是这个 - 呃
No, that is the last thing that is in order!

噢 我的天啊 可怜的仙果乐园居民
-Oh, my God. -Poor Froopy character.

放开他
-Leave him alone. -[ Shorts zip]

噢 大家围过来啊
-Ahh. Gather ‘round, gang! -[ Moos]

晚餐时间到
-Dinner time. -[ Splorch]

好吧 就这样吧 我要离开这个地方
All right, that’s it. I’m outta here.

你这是在做什么
What are you doing?

咱们正冒险到一半呢
We’re in the middle of an adventure.

这些才是冒险需要的东西 Beth
Here’s some things an adventure needs, Beth.

冲突 风险 让我得到好处的方法
Conflict, stakes, a way for me to benefit,

还有一样 显然是Morty
and, clearly, Morty.

但是Tommy还在那里
But Tommy’s still in there,

操木偶 吃小孩
raping Muppets and eating babies.

是啊 幸运的是 那不是咱们的问题
Yep. Luckily, that’s not our problem.

是抽身走人的时候了
Time to pull the plug.

走人
Pull the plug?

我们必须把Tommy从那个地方弄出来 明白吗
We have to get Tommy out of there, okay?

我们 我们必须做正确的事情
We -- We need to do the right thing.

把你身为父亲从来没做过的事情做了
Do what you never did as a dad --

稍微费点心思
Put in a little effort.

得了吧 省省"做好事"那一套吧
All right, cut the high-road routine.

我们都看了Tommy那傻逼演出
We both saw Tommy’s shitty play.

你把他推进了蜜糖沼泽里 Beth
You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

他的幸福生活在你的手中
His very happy life is in your hands.

你去把他救回来吧
You go save him from it.

你宁愿相信一场表演 也不愿意相信自己的亲生女儿
[Scoffs] You’re gonna believe a play over your own daughter?

是啊 确实是 Beth 因为你不是我的女儿
Yes, I am, Beth, because you’re not my own daughter.

噢 天啊 是是 我不过是无数个Beth中的一个
Oh, God, yes. I’m one of infinite Beths

在无穷多个宇宙里 有无数个爸爸
with infinite fathers in infinite universes.

有种东西叫做拥抱 爸爸 它不会杀了你
It’s called a hug, Dad. It won’t kill you.

呃 别那么肯定
Yeah, don’t be so sure.

你知道为什么所有的Rick都为自己的小女儿
You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland

建造了一个仙果乐园吗
for all their little girls?

这和Tommy夸大其词 结构混乱
Same reason I wasn’t surprised by Tommy’s overwritten, badly structured,

质量低劣的回忆重演并不令我吃惊是同一个原因
cheaply produced flashback.

你他妈以前是个可怕的小孩
You were a scary fucking kid, man.

噢 我的天啊
[Scoffing] Oh, my God.

我制造仙果乐园并不是为了摆脱你 Beth
I didn’t make Froopyland to get rid of you, Beth.

而是为了保护邻居们的安全
I did it to protect the neighborhood.

并非因为高尚的情操
Not in a [burps] noble sense.

只是因为让你与世隔绝更加实际
It was just more practical to sequester you

不然我就不得不开始给每个不懂礼貌的小男孩
before I had to start, you know, cloning a replacement

和每只容易上钩的动物克隆出一个替代品
for every less-than-polite little boy or gullible animal

因为他们撞上了个反社会疯子
that might cross your socio-path.

你宁愿相信我是邪恶的
You would rather believe I’m evil

也不愿意承认你是个坏爸爸
than admit that you were a bad father?

噢 不是这样的
Oh, dude, no.

不 坏爸爸到我这里已经登峰造极
No, bad father all the way to the max over here.

我他妈是个疯子
I’m a fucking nutcase.

这点直接遗传到了你身上
And the acorn plopped straight down, baby.

看看这堆玩意儿
Look at some of the shit

你还是个小屁孩的时候让我给你做的
you were asking me to make you as a kid.

镭射枪
Ray guns.

强迫别人喜欢上你的鞭子
A whip that forces people to like you.

隐形手铐 捕家长陷阱 闪电枪
Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap, a lightning gun,

假指纹 催眠镖
false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts,

测谎人偶 坚不可摧的棒球棍
a lie-detecting doll, an indestructible baseball bat,

长得像瓢虫的电击枪 假警徽
a Taser shaped like a ladybug, a fake police badge,

定位追踪贴纸 彩虹色的胶带
location-tracking stickers, rainbow-colored duct tape,

心控发夹 毒药口香糖
mind-control hair clips, poison gum,

有自我意识的粉色弹簧刀
a pink, sentient switchblade.

嗨 Beth 你长高了
Hi, Beth. You’ve gotten taller.

我们要继续捅来捅去吗
Shall we resume stabbing?

你有没有想过
Has it occurred to you

我让你做这些东西
that I asked you to make those things

是因为想让你花时间陪陪我
because I wanted you to spend time with me?

你有没有想过 如果我真的想杀了Tommy
Has it occurred to you that if I did try killing Tommy,

可能是因为我嫉妒他的家庭
it might be because I was jealous of his family?

等等 你说啥 为什么
Wait, what? Why?

他爸难道不是食人族什么的吗
Wasn’t his dad, like, some kind of cannibal?

看来他这样肯定是遗传的
Seems like it must be hereditary.

天啊 这都是你的错
Oh, my God. This is your fault.

我不是个坏人
I am not a bad person.

我要回到那个地方
I’m gonna go back in there.

我会把Tommy带出来 挽救一切
I’m getting Tommy, and I’m fixing this!

爱怎么说怎么说 "冷石"史蒂夫奥斯丁
Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

我也不知道为什么要那样说
I don’t know why I just said that.

连起来根本不通 但是说都说了就这么着吧
Doesn’t make a lot of sense, but gotta stand by it.

爱怎么说怎么说 "冷石"史蒂夫奥斯丁
Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

从我嘴里说出来就是屌
I’m owning it.

停下来 爸 你这样不对
MORTY: No, Dad! You’re not doing it right!

把它们的头砍下来不对吗
Cutting off their heads isn’t doing it right?

它们显然能再生
They’re [grunts] clearly regenerative!

我 我觉得你必须得捅穿它们的心脏或者什么东西
I-I think you have to stab them through the heart or something.

你觉得还是你知道
You think or you know?

我还以为你对外星人很了解呢 艾傻克阿屎莫夫(艾萨克阿西莫夫)
I thought you were the alien expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

别冲我嚷嚷 我累了
Don’t snap at me! I’m tired!

- 我也是 - 我们都累了
-Me, too! -We’re all tired!

这是最后一只
That’s the last of them.

今晚 我们庆祝
Tonight, we celebrate.

用狩猎来庆祝
With a hunt?

没错 为了明天 我们狩猎
Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

我 呃 真的得从这个灵魂相绑里脱身了
I, uh, really have to get out of this soul bond.

- 你他妈 爸 - 老天爷 必须的
-What the fuck, Dad? -Oh, my God! Duh!

- 显而易见 - 当然了
-Obviously! -Yeah, no kidding!

- 你们能帮我吗 - 什么 怎么帮
-Can you guys help me? -What? How?

我能不能就是 呃 跟她说是因为我的孩子
Can I just, uh, tell her it’s because of my kids?

你懂的 比如 你们不喜欢她脑袋的形状 或者
You know, like, you don’t like the shape of her head, or --

那是你 爸 都是你
That’s you, Dad! That’s you!

你既幼稚又愚蠢
You’re a baby and an idiot!

我觉得这一点已经是板上钉钉了 Summer 赶紧帮帮我
I think that’s been established, Summer. Now help me!

首先 我想让你承认
First, I want you to admit

你是个隐藏的种族主义者 软弱的性别主义者
that you’re a closet racist, a beta-male sexist,

把每个人都拖进你的烂摊子里
and you dragged everyone into a horrible situation

因为你只想着自己
by only thinking of yourself.

好吧
Okay.

我要听见你说出来
I want to hear you say it.

听着 我是个隐藏的种族主义者
Look, I’m a closeted racist,

我是个性别主义者而且自私自利
and I’m sexist and selfish,

我把我们拖进了性别主义种族主义的烂摊子里
and I dragged us all into my sexist, racist bad things

- 因为我是个傻子 - 谢谢
-because I’m stupid. -Thank you.

- 现在你愿意帮我了吧 - 她已经帮过了
- Now you’re gonna help me, right? -She just did.

没错 自己擦屁股去吧
Yeah, clean up your own mess.

等等 搞什么
Wait, wait, what?

老天
Oh, man.

好了 伙计们
-[ Trumpet fanfare plays] -TOMMY: All right, everybody.

下一项日程
Next item on the docket --

我想要和你们中的一些发生性关系
I would like to have sex with some of you

然后吃掉婴儿
-and then eat the babies. -[ Froopys murmuring]

我就知道你们喜欢这样
I thought you’d like that.

我干什么都是这么惹人爱 是吧
I do keep rolling out the hits, don’t I?

哦 是神奇蜡笔女士
Oh! It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

你饿了吗 我正准备做晚饭
Are you hungry? I was just about to make dinner.

"做晚饭"的意思是
And by “make dinner,” I mean --

Tommy 我要带你回到真实的世界
Tommy, I’m going to take you to the real world.

这里就是真实的世界啊
Well, this is the real world.

不 你不明白
No, you don’t understand!

你爸爸 呃 别人都以为你爸爸把你吃了
Your dad --Uh, people think your dad ate you!

所以呢 你真傻
So? You doy-oy!

人就应该吃人的啊
People should eat people.

别来烦我
Just leave me alone!

Tommy 你不明白
Tommy, you don’t understand.

我必须要把事情扳回正轨
I have to make this right

因为你留在这儿是我的过失
because it’s my fault that you’re in here.

我就是Beth
-I’m Beth. -[ All gasp I

Beth 毁灭者
Beth? The destroyer!

闭嘴吧 乱伦娘娘
Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest.

你掉到一滩蜂蜜里了
You fell into some honey.

有人推你的时候确实容易掉进去
Well, it tends to happen when one is pushed into honey.

你有权认为是我推的你
I respect your right to believe I pushed you.

噢 我还能有这种权利吗
Oh, do I get to have that?

我的现实世界不是你施舍推到我面前的配餐薯条
Is my reality like a little side of fries --

你让我过的宽扎节吗
a little Kwanzaa you’re willing to slide my way?

是的 因为我的重点是救你爸爸的命
Yes, because I’m focused on saving your father’s life

因为我不是个小气的人渣
because I’m not a petty piece of shit.

那么 让你说一句"抱歉 我推你了"应该不难
So, then, it should be pretty easy to say, “Sorry I pushed you.”

确实不难 但是毫无必要
Real easy and not necessary,

因为你回家一趟能救你爸爸的命
since you coming home will save your dad’s life

而只是让别人满足你的傻逼自尊心什么事情都不会改变
whereas nothing is changed by anyone stroking your batsh it-crazy ego.

真是不好意思
Sorry, forgive me.

我在仙果乐园待了很久
Uh, I’ve been in Froopyland for quite a while.

道歉现在都不一样了吗
Have apologies changed?

Tommy 我抱歉的是你觉得我理应道歉
Tommy, I’m sorry you think you deserve an apology.

哦天呐 我跟我爸爸一个样儿

呃 能来人直接杀了这个贱人吗
Uh, will someone just kill this B-word?

呃 嘿
[Grunts] Hi-ya!

哦天呐 我跟我爸爸一个样儿
Oh, my God. I’m my father!

给点反应啊 大伙儿

I’m trying to make this appealing to your sex-addicted lifestyles.

嗨 我要把Morty从学校接走 走吧 Morty

而且 我和Kiara分手了 她没能心平气和地接受
Also, I broke up with Kiara, and she didn’t take it well,

她想要杀了你们俩
and she wants to murder you two.

什么 那 那我们为什么还在慢悠悠地走
What? Th-Then why are we walking?

我走是因为我累了
I’m walking because I’m tired.

你们俩绝对应该跑了
You guys should definitely run.

不好意思 我只是要
-[ Thud ] -Excuse me, I just --

You know what? I’m -- I’m just gonna go left.

不好吧 你的左边 也行
No, okay, your left, that’s fine.

你知道哪儿是左吗 天呐
Do you know what left is, ‘cause -- Ugh!

你分手跟我们有什么关系
What does your breakup have to do with us?

我们举双手双脚选择跟老妈
Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

我以为在律师那儿就讲明白了
I thought we made that clear at the lawyer’s office

在你Facebook乱喷的那条的评论里也是
and in the comments under your weird rant on Facebook.

她貌似把我们分手怪在你们头上
She kind of blames you guys for the breakup.

- 为什么 - 为什么
-Why? -Why?

因为我告诉她这是你们俩的错
Because I told her it was your fault.

- 什么鬼 - 什么鬼
-What?! -What?!

I am wiped out. I guess I'll turn in.

好
Cool.

爸爸
Dad?

我觉得我一直都在假装
I feel like I’ve spent my life

你是一个好人并且努力地想和你一样
pretending you’re a great guy and trying to be like you.

但是残酷的事实总是
And the ugly truth has always been --

我不是那么好的人 而你就和我一样
That I’m not that great a guy and you’re exactly like me.

我很坏吗
Am I evil?

更糟 你很聪明

当你知道一切都不重要的时候 整个宇宙都会是你的

聪明的人有机会爬到顶峰
You know, smart people get a chance to climb on Top,

骑在现实背上
take reality for a ride,

但现实会不停地试着把你甩下去

并且 最终 它会成功
And, eventually, it will.

没有别的出路
There’s no other way off.

Dad, I’m out of excuses to not be who I am.

所以 我是谁 我应该做什么
So who am I? What do I do?

我的建议是 出发吧

给你的宇宙套上马鞍 看它会变成什么样
Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.

我不能这样做
I can’t do that.

我还有孩子们 Jerry 我的工作
The kids, Jerry, my job,

还有 尽管我不想承认 美国广播公司的"单身汉"节目
and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC’s “The Bachelor.”

我可以克隆你 做一个完美的替代品
I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you,

拥有你所有的记忆

在所有方面一模一样

你可以离开一天一个星期
You could be gone a day, a week,

绝对不会发生"银翼杀手"里的事情
and has zero chance of going “Blade Runner.”

如果一切都不重要 为什么你要为我做这些
If nothing matters, why would you do that for me?

我不知道 也许你太不重要了 以至于我喜欢你
I don’t know, maybe you matter so little that I like you.

或者这让你变得重要
Or maybe it makes you matter.

或许我爱你
Maybe I love you.

或许因为你的妈妈
Maybe something about your mother.

不要得寸进尺
Don’t jump a gift shark in the mouth.

我不知道我能不能做到
I don’t know if I can do it.

那么留下来 好好享受生活
Then stay and luxuriate in a life

你最终会明白你选择了什么
you can finally know you’ve chosen.

我的小经验是不管你选择了什么

Kiara, when I told you my kids were bigoted racists

坚决要我跟你分手的时候

I lied.

要是有人该被用念力掐死
If anybody deserves to be telekinetically strangled,

该是我
it’s me.

我是那个想分手的人
I’m the one who wants to break up.

你看 我让某个人在17岁的时候就怀孕了

我对能和酷的人约会很兴奋
I was excited to date someone cool

因为这能让我的前妻注意到我
because it would make my ex notice me.

Do you really expect me to believe

这和我们之间的事情无关吗
it has nothing to do with us?

You knew Earth was my domain.

我不喜欢你的弦外之音
I don’t like what you’re insinuating.

- 爸 我们能走了吗 - 等一下
-Dad, can we go now? -Hold on a second.

我现在觉得我才是备胎
I’m starting to get the feeling that I was the rebound.

爸 刚有人从天而降为你解围
Dad, you just got handed an ex machina.

你就接受吧
You’re taking it.

Varrix的巢穴遍布300个星系

你们确定想吃披萨吗
Are you guys sure you want pizza?

阿纳尔多披萨店在那个
Arnaldo’s isn’t closed in the dimension

没发明夏令时的次元没关门哦
where they didn’t invent Daylight Savings!

我们没有你可怎么办啊 我爱你 爸爸
What would we do without you? I love you, Dad.

我也爱你 宝贝
Love you, too, sweetie.

一个认为自己掌控世界

等会我要拿来做箱子的木头了
I’ll need later for chest-making.

好吧 你要是一直去分析所有事
Okay. You’re not going to have fun

你是不可能玩得开心的

这就是他们更愿意干的事吗
This is what they’d rather do?

都记下来了
It’s all in the transcript.

"把我们当成是捉鬼敢死队"
“Treats us like Ghostbusters.”

所以说 捉鬼敢死队现在不算酷了吗
So, Ghostbusters aren’t cool now?

我可不记得签过这个法案
I don’t recall signing that bill.

"控制狂"
“Control freak.”

"用无人机轰炸来弥补自己的"
“Orders drone strikes to cope with...”

"安全感缺失"
“Insecurity.”

我们要用无人机空袭他们吗
Should we drone-strike them?

那不就应了他们说的话
That would prove him right!

然后炸死他们
And blow him up.

把电话给我
Give me the phone.

孤僻的人都喜欢这游戏吗
Is this game popular with autistic people?

为什么这么说
Why would you say something like that?

因为我越来越喜欢玩儿了
‘Cause I’m starting to love it.

"不接电话将面临重罪指控"
“Failure to answer is a felony offense”?

装没事儿人 他以为我们还在隧道里
RICK: Play it cool.As far as he knows, we’re still in the tunnels.

什么时候告诉他们 我们能看到他们
When should we reveal we can see them?

所有的牌都在我们手上
We’re holding all the cards right now.

时候未到 一张别亮
We don’t show any before the time is right.

- 完美 - 嗨
- Awesome - Hello .

哥们儿 我是美国总统 情况如何呀
Hi, guys. U.S. President calling.How’s it going?

嘿 我们在性爱隧道里对付怪物呢
Oh, hey.Just hard at work on this sex tunnel gagoo.

这家伙可能成为我们新的宿敌
I think it’s kind of our new archnemesis, you know?

得要一阵子才能解决
It might take a while.

你觉得呢 Morty 得要一个月
What do you think, Morty, a month?

运气好也得一个月
Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

放你们的屁
You lying dicks!

我看见你们在玩<我的世界>
I see your asses playing “Minecraft”!

你们在我的卫星监控下
I got you on satellite!

没错
That’s right.

你们还有什么好说的
What do you have to say for yourselves?

是的总统先生 显然这看起来很不好
Okay, obviously, this looks bad, Mr. President.

透过一违法的卫星监控能看到什么好事
I mean, what doesn’t look bad through an illegal spy satellite?

别道德绑架我
Don’t high-road me.

你们俩一天就违反一千条联邦法
The two of you break 1,000 federal laws a day.

- 哇哦 真的吗 - 很酷
-Wow, really? -That’s pretty cool.

没错没错 你们时不时地拯救世界
And, yes, yes, yes, yes, you save the world now and then.

所以美国法外开恩
America returns that favor

让你们免受法律的制裁
by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws.

- 噢 - 噢 天哪
-Oh! -Oh! Oh, God.

我们 我们不知道你是这么看的
We -- We didn’t know you saw it that way.

这不是任何人的错
Well, it’s nobody’s fault.

毕竟我们从来没有好好谈过这个话题
We never had “the talk,” so to speak.

对啊 我们以为
RICK: Yeah. I mean, the way we see it,

每次我们出场 都是在帮你的忙
when we show up, that’s the favor to you.

特别是 当你在地下室发现一个外星怪物
Especially, you know, when it turns out you wanted someone to come over

就召人过来给你清理
just because you found an “X-Files” monster in your basement.

而你没有逮捕我们是因为
As for the reason you’ve never, like, arrested us,

我们以为你知道 你不可能抓到我们
we assumed you just knew that it was impossible,like, if you tried.

办不到的
You know, it wouldn’t go well.

办不到
Wouldn’t go well?

能说具体一点吗
Can you elaborate?

我想你那一千条法律中的某一条不让我具体说
I think one of your 1,000 laws says, no, I can’t elaborate.

不过相信我 我们都不想走到那一步
Just trust me. None of us want to go there.

我们永远也不必到那地步
Which we’ll never have to.

顺带说一句 我们会继续拯救地球
By the way, we’ll keep on saving the Earth.

我们 我们很乐意
You know, we’re -- we’re happy to do that.

对 但不是因为地球上有美国
RICK: Yeah, but not because it contains America --

是因为搬到新地球上费老劲了
because moving to a new version of Earth is a bitch and a half.

但你可以随时打电话给我们 像朋友一样
But feel free to call us, you know, as -- as, like, friends.

对 想和我们自拍就说
Yeah, like, if you ever want to take a selfie --

所以 还是朋友吧
So, are we cool?

是的 谢谢 先生们
PRESIDENT: Yes. Thank you, gentlemen.

我说啥来着
I told you, man!

可以啊Morty 谈得真不错
I’m impressed, Morty. That went really well.

都给我稳住
Everybody, get ahold of yourselves!

先生 对于Rick和Morty我们有什么新的政策
Sir, what is our new Rick and Morty policy?

我们的政策是 我们从来不需要他们 以后也不
Our policy is, we never needed them and never will again.

今天 让我们庆祝独立 正式脱离Rick和Morty
Today, we celebrate our independence from Rick and Morty.

南方公园4年前就玩过了 Morty
South Park did it four years ago, Morty.

他们好快啊
They’re fast.

或者说是我们慢了
Or we’re slow.

别这样 各位
Don’t do it, guys.

不然搞不好会有"巴十西万"人的伤亡
The casualties would be in the “Brazilians”

因为你们是巴西人
because you’re Brazilian.

这既是威胁 又一语双关
It's a threat and a pun.

怎么没人懂我的意思
Nobody gets me.

美国人来了 快跑
Americanos! Pressa!

噢 你好啊 Rick 你也在这儿

Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat?

我们不打算消除威胁
We’re not taking it out.

我们要缩小自己 通过外交途径接触它们
We’re going to shrink down and approach them diplomatically.

- 你们就靠吃药丸缩身 - 你俩怎么还在
-RICK: You shrink with pills? -Are you still here?

你难道不应该去另一个版本的地球
Shouldn’t you be going down to your next version of Earth

带着你这个自拍狂魔加追星狂人小跟班
with your selfie-craving star-fucker sidekick?

呵呵 我们有权利在这儿
-Whoa! -We’re allowed to be here.

你又不是亚马逊总统
You aren’t president of the Amazon.

你是人民公仆
You’re a civil servant.

照理说我们是你老板
We’re technically your boss.

认出这种稀有元素桑切斯金属了吗

我们对Rick级别的突发事件已经做了一段时间的准备

阿尔法特遣队 准备开始缩小
Task Force Alpha, prepare to shrink.

阿尔法特遣队有没有医保啊
Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan, by the way?

如果那些药丸是根据亚原子压缩原理制成的
Because if those pills are based on subatomic compression,

那你直接从蘑菇云中间走过去
you could get a more curable cancer

得的癌症都要比吃这个好治一点儿
just walking through the mushroom clouds.

去你妈的 我来吃
God damn it! I’ll do it.

阿尔法特遣队被解散了
-Whoa. -Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

你俩不再是美国人了
And you two aren’t American anymore!

我有权这样做 你们被流放了
I can say that. You’re expatriated!

如果你们再踏入祖国的国土
If you step foot on homeland soil again,

我就当成侵略来处理
Ill treat it as an invasion.

他走了 好吧 Morty 我们离开这儿吧
There he goes. All right. Let’s get out of here, Morty.

搞什么
What the hell?!

桑切斯金属是我瞎编的 傻逼们
I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses.

别在维基百科上读到什么都信啊
Don’t believe everything you read on Wikipedia.

戒卫解除
Stand down.

- 亲爱的 我现在没空讲话 - 你什么时候可以咯
- I-I can’t talk now, sweetie. -Oh, when can you?

有道理 什么事儿
- Good point.- [ Burps ] What’s up?

记得不久之前你说过吗 如果我想的话
Remember a little while ago when you said that, if I wanted,

我可以 离开地球在无尽的宇宙中漫游啥的
I could, like, leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos

来寻找真正的自我而且永远没人会发现我已经离开了
to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I’d left

因为你可以用一个克隆人来代替我
because you could replace me with a clone?

我是那个克隆人吗
-Mm-hmm. -Am I the clone?

- 对不起 什么 - 我是克隆人吗
-Sorry. What? -Am I the clone?

真正的我是不是选择了离开 而我自认为我选择了留下
Did the real me choose to leave, and I only think I chose to stay

只是因为我必须这样想
because that’s what I need to think

因为我就是那个替代的克隆Beth
because I’m the replacement Beth?

- 不是的 - 好吧
-No. -Okay.

等等 还有一件事 如果我是克隆人的话 你会告诉我吗
Wait. And one more thing.If I were a clone, would you tell me?

Beth当 当聪明人变得幸福的时候
Beth, you know, when -- when smart people get happy,

他们就认不清自己了
they sTop recognizing themselves.

而你非常聪明 因为你是我的女儿
And you are very smart because you’re very much my daughter.

天啊 你是对的 我很抱歉
Oh, God. You’re right. I’m sorry.

谢谢你 爸爸
Thank you, Dad.

- 你还好吧 - 是的
- All good? - TotaIly.

我没事了
I’m fine now.

确认一下
And just to be sure,

你不是在假装相信你是真Beth吧
you’re not pretending to be convinced you’re real

因为你其实认为自己是个克隆人
because you’re actually convinced you’re a clone

然后你现在害怕自己认识到自己是克隆人
and you’re now terrified that becoming self-aware

代表我必须除掉你
would mean I’d have to terminate you?

- 不是的 - 好吧 很高兴我能帮上忙
-No. -RICK: Okay. Glad I could help.

待会儿见
See you soon.

我该往哪儿开
Where do I go?

这是什么 什么什么 这是什么意思
What does th-- What -- What -- What -- What does this mean?

这毫无意义
This means nothing.

往前开然后停车
Pull forward and park.

那你倒是说啊 妈的
Then say that, God damn it!

对不起
Sorry.

今天过得不顺
Bad day.

我是超级巨人族的总统
I am Presidentress of the Mega Gargantuans.

我们在发现自己很小之前取了这个名字
We named ourselves before learning we were small.

总统女士 我是美国总统

基本等于全球总统
which is basically the world,

但你别说是我说的
but you didn’t hear that from me.

与你的大使Rick和Morty谈过了

They can shrink instantly and teleport.

他们让我给你这个
They told me to give you this.

他们说随着你的癌症药丸药效消失
They said it will stretch as your cancer pill wears off

你的身体尴尬地以老电影里的速度变大时 衣服会撑大
and your body awkwardly enlarges at the rate of a ‘50s movie.

有裤子吗
Are there pants?

他们说你会只想要一件衣服的
They said you’d prefer just a shirt.

似乎是因为你有乱晃鸡巴的需求
Apparently, you have a need to swing your dick around?

Rick和Morty逃走了
Rick and Morty escaped.

似乎是一名匿名的美国外交官
Apparently, an anonymous American diplomat

带他们去了一个"星战"主题酒吧
took them to a “Star Wars” cantina,

他们用激光水烟抽了能增强认知视野的外星费洛蒙
where they smoked perspective-enhancing alien pheromones through a laser hookah.

我还是认为这是普京干的
I still say it has to be Putin.

是Rick和Morty干的 你傻驴啊
It was Rick and Morty, you fucking dunce!

不过功劳都是你领了 先生
But you’re getting the credit, sir.

你的民众支持率刚刚达到了100%
Your approval rating just hit 100%.

Rick和Morty为什么要这么做
Why would Rick and Morty want that?

因为他们是混球
Because they’re assholes!

感谢大家的称赞 但我们今天的成就归功于整个团队
I’m flattered, but it takes a whole team to achieve what we did today.

谢谢
Thank you.

- 情况呢 - 他们没有回家 先生
- Well? - They haven’t been back home, sir.

我们在监视每个他们可能出现的地点
We’ve got every possible location under surveillance.

妈的 他们就在这儿
God damn it! They’re right here!

- 他们在这里 妈的 - 红色警报 需要支援
-They’re here, God damn it! -Code Red! We need backup!

大家放松
Everybody relax.

只是在你不能炸掉或监控的唯一房间等你而已
Just waiting for you in the only room you can’t blow up or spy on.

我们不会为你改变时间线
So, we’re not changing timelines for you,

但是现在你得到你想要的了
but now you have everything you want,

你可以无视我们的存在
so you can forget we exist,

我们也能无视你的存在
and we’ll return the favor.

你就不能写条短信说吗

伙计们 我们懂 是红色警报 够了
Guys, we get it. It’s a Code Red. Enough.

我孙子为你的事跑前跑后
My grandson has worked hard for you,

我觉得他有权和你合影自拍一张
and I feel like he’s earned a selfie.

说实话 现在我无所谓拍不拍的
Honestly, I could take it or leave it at this point.

你要拍
You’re taking it.

不 你这是什么大学兄弟会显摆地位的招啊
No. What kind of fratty-ass status move is that?

滚出我的办公室

He’s the stubborn one. I’m protecting my country.

免受自拍的侵犯吗
Uh, from selfies?

免于屈从敌对力量
From subordination to hostile powers.

那中国知道你这强硬的态度吗

中国不会跑来骑在白宫头上拉屎撒尿
China doesn’t piss on the White House.

是哦 他们为什么会 那很费钱吧
Well, why would they? I’m sure it was expensive.

- 滚 - 没自拍就不走

- 逮捕 - 小伙 你有权不服从他的命令
- Arrest them. - Son, you have a right to refuse his order,

我保证只要摸我一下 你就会死
and I guarantee you’re going to die if you touch me,

没有什么来生 一切直接陷入黑暗
and there’s no afterlife. Everything just goes black.

别这么做
Don’t do it.

- 哇 Rick - 好吧
-Whoa, Rick! -Okay.

这是怎么回事
What was that?

- 死亡 - 哪种
-Death. -What kind?

- 即刻 - 可是都没声音啊
-Instant. -There was no sound.

- 他就死了 - 嗯 很可怕
-He just died. -Yeah, terrifying.

这看着是很可怕
It’s a terrifying thing to watch happen.

这叫威慑
It’s called a deterrent.

你就不能只把他打晕吗
You couldn’t just knock him out?

打晕怎么能算威慑呢
How is knocking out a deterrent?

每个人都想被打晕
Everyone wants to be knocked out.

没人想死

你在美国总统办公室里杀了人
You committed murder in the Oval Office.

- 现在你不能离开 - 没事
-Now you can’t leave. -That’s fine.

我说了要一起自拍再走
I said I’m not leaving without a selfie.

呃 我不需要跟总统一起自拍
Uh, I don’t need a selfie.

我不会跟你自拍的
And I’m saying you aren’t getting one

你也走不了了
and you aren’t leaving.

- 所以我们达成一致了 - 是的 不
-So we agree? -Yes. No. We disagree

我们意见不统一 因为你想要拿到合照然后离开
because you think you’re getting a selfie and leaving.

我会拿到合照吗
Am I getting a selfie?

- 绝不 - 那我绝不走
-Never. -Then I’m never leaving.

- 没错 - 看吧
-Exactly. -See?

老天 你们太蠢了
God, you are dumb!

带总统离开这里
Get the President out of here!

- 这是馊主意 - 等等 为什么
-Bad idea. -Wait. Why?

如果这里没有他们不能杀的人
Because if there isn’t someone in here that they’re not supposed to kill,

他们会在试图杀我的过程中把这地方都砸了
they’re going to wreck the place trying to kill me.

只要你活着 无论你在哪儿
As long as you live, no matter where you are,

只要你不是在跟他的合照里面
if it isn’t in a selfie with him,

我都会在这儿
I’ll be here.

老天 他又不是神
Jesus! He’s not a fucking god!

你不知道我是什么
You don’t know what I am!

你更不知道我能做什么
And you don’t know what I can do!

老天 冷 冷静点 Rick
Geez, it’s -- it’s cool, Rick!

我就是这儿的神秘博士
I’m Doctor Who in this motherfucker.

我可以是个克隆 我可以是个全息影像
I could be a clone. I could be a hologram.

我们都可以是克隆
We could be clones controlled by robots

是被正在操你妈的真正的Rick和Morty
controlled with special headsets

用头戴的特别设备操控的
that the real Rick and Morty are wearing

机器人所操控的克隆
while they’re fucking your mother!

我要杀了你
I’m going to kill you!

那就来奥利街312号
Then come to 312 Olive Street!

这是我妈现在的地址吗
Is that her address?

Beth
Beth?

我爸可能把我给克隆了 我可能就是那个克隆
My dad might have cloned me, and I might be the clone.

他说我不是克隆 但他对克隆肯定会这么说
And he says I’m not, but that’s what he’d say to a clone.

典型的Rick做派
Typical.

第六式 德州涟漪
Number six, The Texas Ripple.

我看你就是你嘛
You look like you to me.

你是笨蛋吗
What are you, an idiot?

对不起 对不起
[Sighs] I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

我话重了
That was so rude.

我本想寻求你的帮助 但却又在羞辱你的智商了
I came to you for help, and now I’m insulting your intelligence.

瞧瞧智商让人落得如此境地
And look where intelligence gets you.

别怪智商
Well, don’t knock intelligence,

因为现在 我想知道如何能帮助你
because right now I’d love to understand how I can help you.

这事儿我做不了主 Jerry
I can’t be in charge of that, Jerry.

我的思维 我的想法 都是变量
My mind, my ideas are all part of the variable.

而你是唯一的常量
The only constant is you.

我的里里外外你都知道
You know me inside and out.

做你要做的吧
Do what you have to do.

好吧 坐下
Okay. Sit down.

盘住双腿
Now cross your legs.

那条腿放上面 很好
That leg on Top. Good.

这是在做什么
Oh, what is this?

高三时 我和你去看密尔沃基交响乐团
Senior year, I took you on a date to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra

在公园里演奏Alan Silvestri的音乐
performing the music of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

演奏到<火山＞中的插曲
At this point in the song from “Volcano,”

情节是汤米 李 琼斯和电工们
when Tommy Lee Jones and the utility workers

正用车把岩浆引入一条死巷
are using cars to guide the lava into a cul-de-sac,

我感到手心满是汗水
I realized my palms were so sweaty,

没胆去牵你的手
I would never get to hold your hand.

但又极想触碰到你
But I was desperate to touch you,

于是 我在旁边的草地上擦擦手掌
so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me.

但是 士力架的包装纸黏住了我的手
But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it,

我就开始抖掉它
so I started kind of jiggling it,

又怕动作太大
whipping it without moving too much.

但你开始往那儿看 我就想
But you started looking over, and I thought,

"完了 她就要发现我是一个蠢蛋了"
“Well, this is it. She’s going to see that I’m a loser,

我永远也碰不到她了
and I’ll never get to touch her.

"但我还有时间碰她"
But I still have time to touch her.

但是我手上还粘着士力架
But my hand had Snickers on it,

铜管乐组的演奏激荡人心
and the brass section was swelling

因为那一幕里一个人葬身岩浆
because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava.

我就想 "去他妈的 嘴唇没有流汗"
And I just thought, “Fuck it. Lips don’t sweat.”

哇 是的
Wow. Yeah.

我永远不会忘记那种感觉
I’ll never forget that feeling.

你是Beth本人
You’re the real thing.

那就解决了
Then that settles it,

因为我讨厌那一晚的记忆
because my memory is of hating that night.

但如今 重温一遍 我全身心地感到幸运
But now, reliving it, all I can feel is how lucky I am

因为被这样一个单纯 诚实 单纯的男人爱着
to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man.

你用了两次单纯
Simple twice.

这不是你娶的女人 Jerry
This isn’t the woman you married, Jerry,

因为这个女人深爱着你
because this woman loves you.

差别万岁
Uh. . .well, vive la difference.

好吧 那句真蹩脚
[Chuckles] Okay. That was lame.

听着 我 话语
Listen, I -- Words.

Don Cheadle
Don Cheadle.

你有权他妈的滚出我的办公室
You have the right to get the fuck out ot my ottice!

你有权亲吻我的鸡巴
You have the right to kiss my dick!

把家伙给我
Give me the thing.

啊
Ugh!

哦
Oh! Ugh!

啊
Ugh!

啊 啊
-Ooh! -Ooh!

哦
Ohh!

屈服吧 屈服于自拍照
Submit! Submit for the selfie!

我投降 我投降 拍自拍吧
I yield! I yield! Take the selfie!

好的 Morty 到这边 说"茄子"
Okay. Morty, get in there and say, “Cheese.”

Morty
Morty?

Morty 快点
Morty, come on!

该死的
[Sighs] God damn it!

Rick 别生气 但是 我 我偷了你的传送枪
Rick, don’t get mad, but I-I stole your portal gun.

他妈的在搞啥 Morty
RICK: What the tuck, Morty?!

我跟你讲了八百遍了 我不想要那破自拍
I told you I didn’t want the damn selfie 800 times!

听着 不管你跟总统之间是他妈的怎么回事
Look, whatever the hell is going on between you

跟我一点关系也没有
and the president, it’s got nothing to do with me.

- 所以你跑哪去了 - 我不能告诉你
-So where did you go? -MORTY: I can’t tell you.

Rick 你是不是跟我妈说她可能是个克隆体
Rick, did you tell my mom she might be a clone?

不 我告诉她她不是
No! I told her she wasn’t!

这不就是你会说给克隆体的话吗
Well, isn’t that what you’d tell a clone?

天哪 真他妈够了
RICK: Oh, for Christ’s sake.

Rick 我妈和我爸要复合了
Rick, my mom and dad are getting back together.

啥 不 她不是克隆体
What? No! She’s not a clone!

她说她是不是都无所谓
Well, she says it doesn’t matter if she is or isn’t

因为她现在爱我爸
because now she loves my dad,

她想让我和Summer都回家
and she wanted me and Summer to come home,

我们现在正躲着你
and we’re hiding from you

所以你不能杀了她 如果她是克隆体的话
so you don’t kill her if she’s a clone

我挑了一个你永远不会发现我们的地方
in a place I picked that you will never find.

所以不要来找我们
-So don’t look for us. -[ Beep]

来呀 贱人
Come on, bitch!

你自己来吧 贱人
Oh, you come on, bitch.

我退出 我不来了
I’m out. I’m done.

我得 我得走了
I got to -- I got to go.

那么我赢了 现在我说了算 你不准走
So I win. Then I’m in charge, and you can’t leave.

你这个恐怖分子 你是国家的敌人
You’re a terrorist. You’re an enemy of the state,

而且你十分钟前还踢了我的蛋
and you kicked me in the balls 10 minutes ago!

总统职权不能与一个
The office of the President can’t coexist

不肯臣服的活神共存
with a living god that won’t submit to it --

我是说 除了波塞冬
I mean, besides Poseidon.

但是他已经被锁在51区了
But he’s locked up in Area 51 already,

所以那不算
so that doesn’t really count.

总统先生 我跟你做个交易
Mr. President, I’ll make you a deal.

如果你让我用一下你那个破烂 杂牌
If you let me use your ghetto-ass off-brand

把赤字给翻了三倍的传送门
deficit-tripling teleporter,

我去处理点事 你就再也不会见到我了
I can go take care of something, and you’ll never see me again.

好的 成交 隐形部队 解散
Yes. Deal. Invisi-troopers, stand down.

我不想听见这些
-[ All groan ] -Yeah, yeah. - I don’t want to hear it.

你知道我一直都能看见他们的吧
You know I could see them this whole time, right?

别太过了 Sanchez
Don’t push it, Sanchez.

他发现我们了
He found us!

我告诉过你们我们不该来
I told you we shouldn’t have gone

上次来过的这个木屋
to the same cabin as last time!

我们哪儿也不会去 现在该结束了
Oh, we’re not going anywhere. This ends now.

爸 如果你是我爸的话
Dad, if you’re my dad.

当然 你不是我爸
Of course, you’re not my dad.

你拿着枪过来是因为我是个克隆体
You’re here with a gun because I am a clone.

我想我拥有你女儿的所有记忆
I guess I have all your daughter’s memories.

所以我觉得我过去的确是她 这是我与她的联系
So I guess I was her, which makes me related to her.

但是我不能认同她
But I don’t relate to her.

她丢下了她的家人和我 这代表着我相系于他们
She left her family and me, which means I relate to them.

所以如果你要杀了我 行
So if you kill me, fine.

你不是在杀她
You’re not killing her.

你是在毁掉一个真正的家
But you’re killing a real family.

所以 你能不能不要这样做 离开就好
And instead of doing that, will you just go away?

不是有无限的时间线吗
Aren’t there, like, infinite timelines?

你就不能去到一个我不知道我是克隆体的世界
Can’t you just move to one where I don’t know I’m a clone

—个完全一致的另一个版本的
and where a different but identical version

你真正的反社会的疯女儿
of your authentic sociopathic crazy bitch

能让你继续为之骄傲
of a daughter can keep making you proud

因为她愿意漂泊天际
by being somewhere else?

Beth 你个疯子 你就是我女儿
Beth, you crazy bitch. You’re my daughter.

我带枪来是要杀Jerry
I brought this here to kill Jerry.

- 老天爷 - 我的天
-Oh, my God! -Jesus Christ!

是 你赢了 Jerry 你赢了
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You win, Jerry. You win!

再多的才智也不能阻止你的那些愚蠢庸碌和空虚
No amount of genius can sTop your dumb mediocre vacuous roots

把根扎进你周围所有的人和事
from digging into everything and everyone around you

抽干他们所有躲掉你的能力
and draining them of any ability to fend you off.

要在过去让你说出这些可不容易
Well, it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.

我很感激
I appreciate it.

Morty 我的传送枪呢
Morty, where’s my portal gun?

我们离开这儿吧
Let’s get out of here.

我要待在这儿 Rick
I’m staying here, Rick.

你是 啊
Are you -- Ugh!

没人明白
Nobody gets it.

一切你认为重要的事情都不重要
Nothing you think matters matters.

这没什么特殊的
This isn’t special.

这些发生了无数次
This -- This is happening infinite times

在无数个现实当中
across infinite realities.

包括这个吗
Including this? [Farts]

对
Yes!

我不是说我主观上觉得你这招不好笑
Which is not to say that, subjectively, it wasn’t funny.

你要留在这儿吗
Are you going to stay?

有无数条时间线 Morty
There’s infinite timelines, Morty.

我为什么还要待在这里 我在这儿把白宫闹了个底朝天
Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House,

变成了美国公敌
became an enemy of America

还成了我的呆子家庭里地位最底下的人
and the lowest-status character in my idiot family?

为了那个屁可以吗
Because of the fart?

那儿还有点碎砖块
There’s still some rubble over there.

我认为你从没弄明白
I don’t think you’ve ever understood

内务部长到底是干什么的
what “Secretary of the Interior” means!

嗨 总统先生 我是Rick Sanchez
Hi, Mr. President. I’m Rick Sanchez,

但不是这次捣乱的那个
but not the one that did this.

我们Rick游历于无穷宇宙中 而且会和彼此交换位置
We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other

就像寄居蟹 我觉得
like hermit crabs, I think.

我是飞钓Rick
I’m Fly Fishing Rick.

您可以把我
You can distinguish me from the Rick

和那个跟您打了一架的Rick区分开来
that you had a falling-out with

通过我对飞钓的热爱和我戴的帽子
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm and accompanying hat.

我希望我能出一份力
I hope I can be of service

如果 呃 你发现这颗星球处于危险中的话
if, uh, you ever find the planet to be in danger.

交个朋友
Friends?

听起来不错
Sounds good to me.

孩子们 晚餐来了
Kids, dinner!

我点了熊猫中餐外卖
I got Panda Express!

你买了香甜鸡吗
Did you get sugar chicken?

他们差不多只有这个吧
That’s kind of the only thing they have.

我爱熊猫中餐外卖 多谢老妈
I love Panda E! Thanks, Mom!

我希望待会儿能尝尝你的香甜鸡
I’m hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later.

讨厌
[ Laughs] STop it.

给你的脑残帽子 傻逼
Here’s your [burps] stupid hat, dipshit.

爸 你不能再那样和Jerry说话了
Dad, you can’t talk to Jerry that way anymore.

我们现在是个真正的家庭了
We’re a real family now.

从很多意义上来讲 事情会变得和第一季一样
In many ways, things will be like Season 1

但是更精简流畅
but more streamlined.

现在Jerry和我是幸福的已婚父母
Now Jerry and I are happily married parents,

还有我因为对你离开的恐惧而激发的想法
and the idea that I was motivated

都烟消云散了
by a fear of you leaving can be eschewed.

烟消云散 你从来没用过这个词
Eschewed? You’ve never used that word.

可能你真是个克隆人
Maybe you are a clone.

Rick又不会告诉我们
[ Laughs] lit’s not like Rick would tell us.

噢咦 真是精彩的一季
Ooh-wee! What a season!

不好意思我再没出场 但是我结婚了
Sorry I never showed up, but I got married.

有了小孩儿
I had a baby.

我回到了学校 拿到了我的高中同等学学学历
I went back to school and got my G-E-E-E-D.

你在等待的时候做了什么呢
What did you do while you were waiting?

希望你不只是到处乱搞 浪费生命
Hopefully you didn’t just fuck around and waste your life.

噢咦
Ooh-wee!

第四季见 大概要很长的时间
See you for Season 4 in, like, a really long time!

我可能会长出圣诞老人那样的大白胡子
I might even have a big white Santa Claus beard

还有 还有 还有一
and -- and -- and a --

还有一群孙子
and a couple of grandkids

之类之类的
and all that kind of stuff.

我也不知道什么时间能见 先再见吧
See you -- See you then!
