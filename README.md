  We become defensive
       when criticised,
    and apply negative stereotypes
      to others
         to boost our own esteem.

  Devoted
      concertgoers
        who reply
       that recordings
        are no substitute
         for live performance
    are missing the point.

  Ants keep
      predatory insects
          away from
             where their aphids
    feed;
     Gmail
      keeps
         the spammers out
           of our inboxes.

  At the same time,
    people
      continue
        to treat fire
      as an event
       that needs
        to be wholly controlled
      and unleashed only out
         of necessity.

  As boards
    scrutinize succession plans
      in response
        to shareholder pressure,
    executives who
        don't get
            the nod
    also may wish
      to move on.

  Everyone
    needs
     to find
       their extra
      —their unique value contribution
       that makes them
        stand out
         in whatever is
           their field
             of employment.

  It is also
    the reason why
      when we
        try
             to describe
            music
             with words,
    all we can do
      is articulate
        our reactions
         to it,
    and not grasp music itself.

  Scientists
      jumped
          to the rescue
              with some distinctly
         shaky evidence
              to the effect that insects
    would eat us up
     if birds
      failed
             to control them.

  A moralist,
        satirist,
          and social reformer,
         Dickens
      crafted complex plots
       and
         striking characters that
        capture
         the panorama
           of English society.

  Half a century
      of town and country planning
    has enabled it
      to retain
         an enviable rural coherence,
    while still permitting
        low-density urban living.

  Integrity
      had collapsed,
            she argued,
              because
          of a collective acceptance
           that
             the only "sorting mechanism"
               in society
            should be
              profit and the market.

  We need them
      to imagine
         the United States
      as a place
          where they
           can be productive
             for a while
              without committing themselves
                to staying forever.

  The issue
         of voluntary part-time
        relates
             to Obamacare because one
         of the main purposes
    was to allow people
      to get insurance outside
         of employment.

  Firms
      are now studying
   how genes interact,
    looking for
      correlations
          that might be used
    to determine
      the causes
         of disease
       or predict a drug's efficacy.

  Dead markets partly
    reflect
        the paralysis
             of banks which
    will not sell assets
      for fear of booking losses,
    yet are reluctant
      to buy all those
   supposed bargains.

  He adds humbly
      that perhaps
   he was
      "superior
          to the common run
              of men in noticing
                things
                   which easily escape attention,
    and in observing them
      carefully".

  Many
      leading American universities
    want
     their undergraduates
      to have a grounding
         in the basic canon
           of ideas
          that every educated person
    should possess.

  Buying gifts
       or giving
          to charity
    is often more pleasurable
      than purchasing things
         for oneself,
    and
   luxuries are most enjoyable
     when they
   are consumed sparingly.

  These benefactors
    have succeeded
         in their chosen fields,
            they say,
              and
           they want
          to use
             their wealth
          to draw attention
             to those who
            have succeeded
             in science.

  Perhaps faintly,
    they hint
     that people
    should look
      to intangible qualities
          like character and intellect
              rather than dieting
                their way
                    to size zero
                     or wasp-waist physiques.

  The Navy Department
      moved into the east wing
         in 1879,
    where elaborate wall
       and ceiling
          stenciling
                 and marquetry floors
              decorated
                 the office
                  of the Secretary.

  The researchers
      mapped
           not only
              the city's vast
                  and ornate ceremonial areas,
    but also
      hundreds of
        simpler apartment complexes
          where common people lived.

  It may be said
        that
         the measure
             of the worth
    of any
       social institution
          is its effect
      in enlarging
           and improving experience,
    but this effect
        is not a part
         of its original motive.

  Our mental health
    doesn't really go anywhere;
     like the sun
      behind a cloud,
        it can be temporarily hidden
         from view,
             but it
           is fully capable
              of being restored
                  in an instant.

  No boy
   who went
      to a grammar school
    could be ignorant
      that
        the drama
    was a form
         of literature which
    gave glory
      to Greece and Rome
        and might yet bring honor
          to England.

  The most loyal customers
    would still get
        the product
      they favor,
            the idea
              goes,
            and they'd feel like
           they were helping
            sustain
             the quality of something
            they believe in.

  But policymakers
        who refocus efforts on improving
      well-being
          rather than simply worrying
              about GDP figures
    could avoid
     the forecasted doom
      and may even see progress.

  Indeed,
    there is
      something
       a little absurd
          in the state
    getting involved
      in the planning
          of
              such a fundamentally
      "grassroots" concept
          as community sports associations.

  While few craftsmen or farmers,
    let alone dependents
      and servants,
        left literary compositions
            to be analyzed,
             it is obvious
               that
                 their views
            were less fully intellectualized.

  While comment
         and
       reaction
         from lawyers
        may enhance stories,
    it is preferable
         for journalists
      to rely on
        their own notions
         of significance
          and make
             their own judgments.

  Social media
    allows users
      to experience news events
          more intimately
      and immediately while
          also permitting them
            to re-share news
              as a projection
                 of their values
      and interests.

  According
        to research
         from Princeton University,
    people
      assess your competence,
        trustworthiness,
          and likeability
      in just a tenth
         of a second,
        solely based
         on the way
      you look.

  Some
      attributed virtually
          every
         important cultural achievement
          to the inventions
              of a few,
    especially gifted peoples that,
        according
      to diffusionists,
        then spread
      to other cultures.

  The upside
    is
     the possibilities
   contained
      in knowing
        that everything
    is up to us;
     where before we were experts
         in the array
           of limitations,
    now we become authorities
         of what
    is possible.

  If people
      in the network
          just two degrees
            removed
             from the initial influential
    prove resistant,
        for example,
          the cascade
         of change
       won't propagate very far
      or affect many people.

  In a workplace
    that's fundamentally indifferent
      to your life
         and its meaning,
    office
      speak
        can help
   you figure out how
     you relate
         to your work
      —and
         how your work
          defines
              who you are.

  Conversations
      are links,
    which means
     when you have
    a conversation with
      a new person
        a link gets formed
         and every conversation
    you have
       after that moment
          will strengthen the link.

  Researchers
      measured people's cortisol,
    which is a stress marker,
        while they
            were
          at work
         and
       while they
         were at home
          and found it higher
             at what
              is supposed
                to be a place
                 of refuge.

  While Washington
         and Jefferson
      privately expressed distaste
         for slavery,
    they also understood
      that it
    was part
     of the political
      and economic bedrock
     of the country
      they helped
             to create.

  When younger kids
    learn computer science,
      they learn
        that
          it's not just a confusing,
    endless string of letters
      and numbers
        —but a tool
          to build apps,
                or create artwork,
                  or test hypotheses.

  The Industrial Revolution
    didn't go so well
      for Luddites whose jobs
    were displaced
         by mechanized looms,
    but it
   eventually raised
      living standards
        and created
      more jobs
         than it destroyed.

  That ruling produced an explosion
         in business-method patent filings,
    initially by emerging
      internet companies
        trying
          to stake out exclusive rights
            to specific types
             of online transactions.

  Even though
      there is plenty of evidence
       that
         the quality
           of the teachers
        is the most important variable,
    teachers' unions
      have fought
        against getting rid
          of bad ones
           and promoting good ones.

  Yet most ancestry
      testing only
    considers a single lineage,
      either the Y chromosome
        inherited through men
         in a father's line
            or mitochondrial DNA,
             which
          is passed down only
             from mothers.

  Moreover,
    even though humans
   have been upright for millions
         of years,
        our feet
          and back
        continue
            to struggle with bipedal posture
      and cannot easily withstand
          repeated strain
              imposed by
        oversize limbs.

  While the researchers
      assumed
        that
         the well-structured daily plans
    would be
        most effective
       when it came
             to the execution
         of tasks,
    they were wrong:
     the detailed daily plans
      demotivated students.

  While fossil fuels
      —coal,
            oil,
             gas—
         still generate roughly 85 percent
             of the world's energy supply,
    it's clearer
        than ever that
         the future
    belongs
      to renewable sources such
          as wind
         and solar.

  Only
     if the jobless
    arrive at the jobcentre
      with a CV,
    register
     for online job search,
        and start
          looking for work
            will
           they be eligible
             for benefit
      —and then they
        should report weekly
           rather than fortnightly.

  It is not
        that pink
    is intrinsically bad,
      but it is
        such
         a tiny slice
      of the rainbow
             and,
    though it
   may celebrate girlhood
      in one way,
        it also repeatedly
      and firmly fuses girls' identity
          to appearance.

  Here,
    Darwinism
      seems
     to offer justification,
    for
     if all humans
       share common origins,
    it seems reasonable
      to suppose
        that cultural diversity
    could also be traced
      to more constrained beginnings.

  If you are
      working
          on a word processor,
    you can take advantage
      of its capacity
        to make additions
         and deletions
          as well as
             move entire paragraphs
          by making
              just
                  a few simple keyboard commands.

  This success,
    coupled with later research
      showing
        that memory itself
      is not genetically determined,
        led Ericsson
          to conclude that
             the act
          of memorizing
        is more
         of a cognitive exercise
             than an intuitive one.

  That's
   because Congress
     has always envisioned joint
       federal-state
         immigration enforcement
      and explicitly encourages
           state officers
          to share information
      and cooperate
         with federal colleagues.

  Ministers
    should also look
      at creating greater certainty
          in the rental environment,
    which would have
     a significant impact
       on the ability
      of registered providers
     to
       fund new developments
         from revenues.

  Such hijacked media
    are
     the opposite
         of earned media:
     an asset
       or campaign
    becomes hostage
      to consumers,
            other stakeholders,
              or activists who make
            negative
          allegations
            about a brand
                 or product.

  The policy
    follows similar efforts
         from other journals,
    after widespread concern
       that basic
          mistakes
         in data analysis
    are contributing
      to the irreproducibility
         of many published
          research findings.

  They should exhibit
      strong interest
        and respect for whatever
    currently interests
     their fledgling adult
         ï¼ˆas naive
           or ill
          conceived as it
    may seemï¼‰
      while becoming a partner
          in exploring options
              for the future.

  In other words,
    at a time
     when the working class
      has turned
         the country
           on its political head,
    frustrated
        that
          the opportunity
             that once defined America
      is vanishing,
        one obvious solution
          is staring us
            in the face.

  Brain researchers
      have discovered
        that
       when we
        consciously develop new habits,
    we create
      parallel synaptic paths,
        and even entirely
            new brain cells,
             that can jump
            our trains
              of thought
                 onto new,
                   innovative tracks.

  This type
     of integrity
    requires well-enforced laws
         in government transparency,
    such
         as records
           of official meetings,
            rules
          on lobbying,
            and information
          about each elected
            leader's source
             of wealth.

  In the past couple of weeks
       a quarrel
          has illustrated
             the value
          to advertisers
              of such fine-grained information:
     Should advertisers
    assume
     that people
    are happy
      to be tracked
          and sent behavioural ads?

  Last year,
    the Transportation Security
         Administration ï¼ˆTSAï¼‰
      found
         in a secret check
    that
      undercover investigators
    were able
      to sneak weapons
        —both fake
             and real—
         past airport security
           nearly every
         time
          they tried.

  California
    has asked
         the justices
        to refrain
      from a sweeping ruling,
    particularly one
      that upsets
    the old
      assumptions
           that authorities
              may search
                  through the possessions
                      of suspects
         at the time
           of their arrest.

  Priestly
    explains
       how
         the deep blue color
           of the assistant's sweater
    descended over the years
         from fashion shows
      to department stores
          and to the bargain bin
              in which
         the poor girl doubtless
      found her garment.

  If the district
    is essentially giving
        a pass
          to students
            who do not do their homework
       because
         of complicated family lives,
    it is going riskily close
      to the implication
           that standards need
            to be lowered
         for poor children.

  The findings
         of a research institution
        have consistently shown that
       workers
         in all countries
    can be trained
      on the job
    to achieve radically
     higher productivity
         and,
        as a result,
          radically higher standards
      of living.

  Their analysis
      ruled out
        the possibility
       that it
        was firms' political influence,
    rather than their CSR stand,
        that accounted for the leniency:
     Companies that
      contributed
          more
              to political campaigns
    did not receive lower fines.

  The potential evolution
         of today's technology,
            and its social consequences,
              is dazzlingly complicated,
             and it's perhaps best
          left
             to science fiction writers
               and futurologists
          to explore
            the many possibilities
           we can envisage.

  The company,
    a major energy supplier
         in New England,
    provoked justified outrage
      in Vermont last week
        when it announced
       it was reneging
         on a longstanding commitment
        to abide
          by the strict
         nuclear regulations.

  Of all
         the changes
       that have taken place
          in English-language newspapers
              during the past quarter-century,
    perhaps the most far-reaching
      has been
     the inexorable decline
      in the scope
         and seriousness
          of their arts coverage.

  Infants
      are wired
        to look at parents' faces
          to try
      to understand their world,
    and
     if those faces
    are blank
     and unresponsive
      —as they often are
           when absorbed
              in a device—
         it can be extremely disconcerting
          for the children.

  Scientists
      have found that
       although we
         are prone
      to snap overreactions,
    if we
   take a moment
    and think about how
   we are likely
     to react,
    we can reduce
      or even eliminate
          the negative effects
         of our quick,
        hard-wired responses.

  Further arrangements
      —and there may be many—
         between the NHS and DeepMind
        will be carefully scrutinised
          to ensure
             that all necessary permissions
        have been asked of patients
         and all unnecessary data
        has been cleaned.

  Studies of both animals
    and
   humans have shown
        that sex hormones
    somehow affect
        the stress response,
    causing
      females under stress
        to produce more
          of the trigger chemicals than
    do males
         under the same conditions.

  "Carry a book
         with you at all times"
     can actually work,
        too
      —providing
       you dip
         in often enough, so that
          reading
        becomes
            the default state
           from which you
            temporarily surface
                to take care
                 of business,
    before dropping
      back down.

  Today,
    widespread social pressure
      to immediately go
          to college
              in conjunction
                  with increasingly
                      high expectations
              in a fast-moving world
                  often causes students
                    to completely overlook
                     the possibility
                      of taking a gap year.

  It could be
   that we
        are evolving two communities
         of social scientists:
     one that is discipline-oriented
      and publishing
         in highly specialized journals,
    and one
        that is problem-oriented
      and publishing elsewhere,
    such
      as policy briefs.

  Steelworkers,
        airline employees,
          and now
       those
             in the auto industry
        are joining
      millions of families who
        must worry
         about interest rates,
        stock market fluctuation,
          and
         the harsh reality
       that they
      may outlive
        their retirement money.

  After all,
    four decades
     of evidence
        has now shown that
      corporations in
          Europe
              as well as the US
    are evading
         the meritocratic hiring
          and promotion
             of women
               to top position
      —no matter how much
          "soft pressure"
             is put
              upon them.

  His analysis
    should
       therefore end
         any self-contentedness
           among those who
        may believe that
           the global position
             of English
    is so stable
      that
     the young generation
         of the United Kingdom
   do not need additional
      language capabilities.

  The Internet
      —and pressure
         from funding agencies,
        who are questioning
          why commercial publishers
        are making money
          from government-funded research
            by restricting access
             to it—
         is making access
          to scientific results
             a reality.

  There is pressure
      for change
          from
             within the profession,
    but opponents
      of change
         among the regulators
    insist that
      keeping
          outsiders
              out of a law firm
    isolates
      lawyers from
          the pressure
                 to make money
               rather than serve
              clients ethically.

  The force
      of geographic conditions peculiar
        to America,
    the interplay
         of the varied
      national groups upon one another,
    and
     the sheer difficulty
      of maintaining old-world ways
        in a raw,
    new continent
      caused significant changes.

  Yet,
    when one looks
       at the photographs
         of the garden
        created
             by the homeless,
    it strikes
      one that,
    for all
     their diversity
         of styles,
    these gardens
      speak
        of various other
          fundamental urges,
    beyond that
      of decoration
          and creative expression.

  Under the plan,
        for example,
          the agency
      said
       it would not prosecute
        landowner or businesses
      that
        unintentionally kill,
          harm,
        or disturb the bird,
         as long as
        they had signed
         a range-wide management plan
      to restore
         prairie chicken habitat.

  In his article
      "How Intelligent Is
          Intelligence Testing?",
    Sternberg
      notes that
        traditional tests best
    assess analytical
         and verbal skills
      but fail
         to measure creativity
          and practical knowledge,
    components also critical
      to problem solving
         and life success.

  At a time
      when Thomas Piketty
          and other economists
    are warning
         of rising inequality
          and the increasing power
             of inherited wealth,
    it is bizarre
       that wealthy aristocratic
          families
            should still be
             the symbolic heart
               of modern democratic states.

  Calls to disassemble
      all telescopes on Mauna Kea
         or
           to ban future development
    there ignore
      the reality
        that astronomy
             and Hawaiian
    culture
      both
        seek to answer big questions
          about who we are,
    where we come from
     and
       where we are going.

  Humans
      are unique
         in their capacity
           to not only make tools
      but then turn around
        and use them
          to create superfluous
         material goods
      —paintings,
        sculpture and architecture—
         and superfluous experiences
      —music,
            literature,
             religion and philosophy.

  As a discovery claim
    works its way
      through the community,
    the interaction and confrontation
      between shared
         and competing beliefs
          about the science
             and
               the technology
      involved
    transforms
     an individual's
         discovery claim
      into the community's
         credible discovery.

  But
     in her new book
    Join the Club,
      Tina Rosenberg
    contends
        that peer pressure
    can also be a positive force
      through what she
        calls the social cure,
    in which organizations
      and officials
    use
     the power
         of group dynamics
           to help individuals
         improve
      their lives
         and possibly
           the world.

  Fundamentally,
    the USPS
      is in a historic squeeze
         between technological change
       that
          has permanently decreased
        demand
         for its bread-and-butter product,
            first-class mail,
              and a regulatory structure
           that denies
          management
             the flexibility
          to adjust its operations
             to the new reality.

  Unhappy parents rarely
    are provoked
        to wonder
         if they
           shouldn't have had kids,
    but unhappy childless folks
      are bothered
        with the message
       that children
        are
         the single most
          important thing
         in the world:
     obviously their misery
    must be a direct result
         of the gaping
           baby-size holes
         in their lives.

  To encourage innovation
      and competition,
    the report
      calls for
   increased investment
     in research,
    the crafting
         of coherent curricula
      that
          improve students' ability
              to solve problems
               and communicate effectively
                  in the 21st century,
    increased
      funding
         for teachers
          and the encouragement
             of scholars
          to bring
             their learning
               to bear
             on the great challenges
                 of the day.

  Moreover,
    average overall margins
      are higher in wholesale than
         in retail;
     wholesale
    demand
      from the food service sector
    is growing quickly
         as more Europeans
    eat
     out more often;
       and changes
      in the competitive dynamics
         of this
      fragmented industry
    are at last making it feasible
         for wholesalers
        to consolidate.

  Just
         as bosses
      and boards
    have finally sorted out
      their worst accounting
         and compliance troubles,
    and improved
        their
         feeble corporation governance,
        a new problem
          threatens
             to earn them
      —especially in America—
         the sort
          of nasty headlines
              that inevitably lead
          to heads
              rolling
                  in the executive suite:
     data insecurity.

  The article
    is actually quite optimistic,
      as it outlines
       a potential solution
         to this problem,
        suggesting that

  Precisely because readers
      from different historical periods,
    places
      and social
             experiences
                 produce
                   different
      but overlapping
        readings
         of the same words
             on the page
      —including
         for texts
       that engage
          with fundamental human concerns—
         debates
           about texts
        can play
         an important role
           in social discussion of
         beliefs
          and values.

  At Tulane University's Tear
     Analysis Laboratory,
    Dr. Peter Kastl
      and his colleagues
        report
            that
              they can use tears
    to detect drug abuse
         and exposure
          to medication,
    to determine
     whether a contact lens
    fits properly
         or
       why it
         may be uncomfortable,
    to study
      the causes
          of "dry eye" syndrome
              and the effects
         of eye surgery,
    and perhaps even
      to measure exposure
          to environmental pollutants.

  Young people
   who are still getting started
         in life
    were more likely
         than older adults
        to prioritize
          personal fulfillment
         in their work,
    to believe
   they will advance
      their careers most
        by regularly changing jobs,
          to favor communities
         with more public services
          and a faster pace
             of life,
               to agree
           that couples
            should be financially secure
              before getting married
                   or having children,
    and to maintain that
   children

          by two parents

  Sarah,
    who has taken part
      in shows
          along with top models wants
      to prove
       that she has brains
         as well as beauty.

  The set
      worked so beautifully
           when I first
    got it
      home that
        I would keep
    it on
     until stations
      signed off
          for the night.

  This is where kids
    can discover
     the past
      from dinosaur models
          to rock collections
      and pictures of stars
          in the sky.

  If you work
      out
         in the mornings,
    then you will be getting
       the calorie burning benefits
         for the whole day,
        not
         in your sleep.

  His presence
      meant
           that I had
               an unexpected teaching assistant
         in class
        whose creativity
    would infect other students.

  It was only after he had read
      the papers
       that Mr. Gross
    realized the task before
       him was extremely difficult
        to complete.

  Forty-two percent of people
      asked admitted
    they turned
      to the back
          of the book
            to read
             the end
              before finishing the story.

  Knowledgeable guides

  Students
      are being dared
         to draw a picture,
            write an article,
              take a photo
            or write
              a poem
           that shows
             what they
           are curious about.

  Each year,
    world-famous artists
      are invited
        to design
       and produce works of art
          from the ice,
        many of which
          can be found
            in the rooms.

  Animals that
    don't have clean
   and unfrozen water
      may drink dirty water outside,
    which
      may contain something unhealthy
        for them.

  One of those bad
      life's experiences
         for Shelley
            happened
          three years ago when
   her brother Brad
      was killed
        in a drunk driving accident.

  Most businesses
    seek
     to make a profit
      —that is,
    they aim
      to achieve
    income
      that is
          more than the costs
              of operating
        the business.

  The yellow and orange
    stone fruits such
     as peaches
    are high
         in the carotenoids
        we turn
      into vitamin A
         and which
        are antioxidants.

  A build-it-yourself solar
    still is one
      of the best ways
        to obtain drinking water
          in areas
             where the liquid
          is not readily available.

  This has led
      to the growth
          of a leisure industry
             in the capital's suburbs which
      until the late-1990s
    were unreachable
      to ordinary people.

  Since it was hot
      in the studio,
    it came as a surprise
      to us
          to see one of the actors
              put
                 on a heavy overcoat
               and start
                  walking
                      along the path.

  Any training
    you do
      to become more effective
         at public speaking
    should always focus
      on the positive aspects
       of what you already do well.

  In all,
    from the time
     the stem cells
      are harvested from a donor
        to the time
       they can be implanted
          in the patient,
    we've
      got 72 hours
         at most.

  In parts
     of Africa,
        though,
          people and animals
      looking for honey
        have a strange
      and unexpected helper
        —a little bird
          called a honey guide.

  On the other hand,
    a growth mindset
      believes that no talent
    is entirely heaven-sent
         and
           that effort
      and learning
             make
               everything
                 possible.

  What
      I'm hoping
        to accomplish
    is that
         my generation
          and the younger start
      to reconsider and understand
       that jazz
         is not black and white anymore.

  When your child
    grows a bit older
      and understands
         the basic function
           of money,
    you can start
      explaining more complex ways
          of using money.

  It is important
    to give
      your child
        the space he needs to grow
          while gently letting him
    know
       that you'll still be there
      for him
         when he needs you.

  The person
    leaves it
      in a public place,
    hoping that
     the book
    will have an adventure,
      traveling
        far and wide
         with each new reader
   who finds it.

  Dismissing
   small talk
     as unimportant
   is easy,
    but we
        can't forget that
   deep relationships
      wouldn't even exist
       if it weren't
         for casual conversation.

  Only humans,
    and
   some intelligent animals
        like apes and dolphins,
          have been shown
            to recognize that
             the image
               in the mirror
            is
             of themselves.

  Sure,
    it's great
      to write
        about a tourist attraction,
          but you'd better
        get
          the local museum hours correct
         or
       you could really ruin
        someone's vacation.

  While small
    may be beautiful,
      tall is just plain uncomfortable
   it seems,
    particularly when it
   comes to staying in hotels
       and eating
         in restaurants.

  When the container
    is full,
      you can suck
        the refreshment out
     through the tube,
        and won't have to break down
         the still every time
       you need a drink.

  It starts
      with looking inside yourself
        and understanding who you
      are with respect
        to the natural world
         and
       how you
        approach
         the gardening process.

  When the world
    was still populated
         by hunter-gatherers,
            small,
              tightly knit groups
          developed
             their own patterns
               of speech independent
             of each other.

  Bradford
      sold
         the building
          and land
              to a local development firm,
    which plans
      to build a shopping complex
        on the land
         where the theater
    is located.

  Ma Shwe
      had crossed
         the river
      and got up
         the bank
      and was making her way
         back
          as fast as
           she could,
                roaring all the time,
                  but
              to her calf
               it was music.

  No one
    can say
        which brand
    will work best for you
   or feel best
      on your feet,
    so you
      have to rely on your experience
         and
             on the feel
          of each pair as you shop.

  Computer programmer David Jones
    earns $35,000 a year
      designing new computer games,
    yet he
        cannot find
            a bank ready
                to let him
    have a credit card.

  The damage
    is usually more serious
      on the first plant,
            but the neighbors,
              relatively speaking,
             stay safer
            because they
           heard
             the alarm
          and knew
            what to do.

  The popularity
         of au pairs
           from China
    has been strengthened
      by the increasing numbers
          of American parents
    who want
     their children
      to learn Chinese.

  I was not afraid
      of being caught,
    because
      there was
          clearly no policeman around,
        and there certainly
         would have been
           no danger
          in going through the light.

  The fact that members
         of one culture
        do not express
            their emotions
                 as openly as
    do
   members
     of another
      does not mean
           that they
             do not experience
            emotions.

  The Lucy
         on exhibition
      at the Ethiopian National Museum
          in the capital,
                Addis Ababa,
                  is a replica while
               the real remains
              are usually locked
                in a secret storeroom.

  This morning we
   drove over
     to Baccarat
      and toured
        its museum and the church,
    which has
        this unbelievable lamp
   that is going on
      a world tour
         the next day.

  The Yellowstone wolf project
    has been
        a valuable experiment
          to help biologists
    decide
     whether to reintroduce wolves
      to other parts
         of the country
           as well.

  It further requires
       that
         when opinions
        are
             from the opposite,
    the doctor
      doesn't overreact,
        which
          might prevent fellow doctors
            from voicing opinions again.

  Because
      of our efforts,
    our daughter Georgia
      did decide
    to donate a large bag
         of toys
     to a little girl
      whose mother
    was unable
      to pay
         for her holiday
             due to illness.

  Eight theatre
    groups
   turned up uninvited
     in 1947,
    in the belief
     that everyone
      should have
        the right
             to perform,
    and
   they did so
      in a public house disused
         for years.

  The company
      said Monday
           that its new flying car
    has completed its first flight,
      bringing
     the company closer
      to its goal
          of selling
             the flying car
               within the next year.

  You can't be successful
    when there's
      a lack of trust
        in a relationship that
    results
      from an action
       where the wrongdoer
          takes no responsibility
             to fix
               the mistake.

  In addition
      to their simple beauty,
    what makes
      the adobe dwellings admirable
    is
     their ability to
      "air condition"
         a house
          without using electric equipment.

  The walls
   that were
      once ugly with graffiti
        are now covered
      with beautiful pictures
         of historical heroes
           and modern art,
    thanks
      to the
         Mural Arts Program (MAP).

  Frank Hurley,
    a confident
      and gifted Australian
         photographer
   who knew
      the Antarctic,
        was hired
         to make
           the images,
             most of which have never
              before been published.

  Readers
      also tended
          to share articles that
    were exciting
         or funny,
    or
   that inspired negative feelings
      like anger or anxiety,
        but
         not articles
          that
        left them merely sad.

  I myself
    went through this
      searching process
        and found
    something
        that has changed
          my experience at college
         for the better:
     I discovered ASL
      —American Sign Language.

  They are
      among the growing number
          of Americans who,
    driven
         by higher living costs
          and a falling economy,
        have taken up vegetable
          gardening
              for the first time.

  Her popular 1962 book
         Silent Spring
      raised awareness of the dangers
         of pollution
          and the harmful effects
         of chemicals on humans
          and
             on the world's lakes
               and oceans.

  Almost every grandparent
      wants
         to be
          with his or her grandchildren
      and
          is willing
        to make sacrifices,
    but sometimes
   it is wiser
      to say no
       and visit frequently instead.

  Dark environments
    are more likely
      to encourage
        overeating,
    for people
      are often less self-conscious
    when they're in
      poorly lit places
        —and so more likely
          to eat lots
         of food.

  Some gift companies
       such
             as Presents
         for Purpose
    allow you
     to pay
      it
    forward this Mother's Day
      by picking gifts
       in which 10 percent
          of the price
      you pay
    goes
     to a charity.

  I've discovered
        I possess
         a large number
           of different talents
         and skills
      that
          I never would have thought
    were
     within me
      had it not been
          for my being open
            to trying new opportunities.

  If someone knocks
      and it's
         not an important matter,
    excuse yourself and let
        the person
      know
    you're busy so they
      can get
    the hint
      that
         when the door
    is closed,
      you're not
         to be disturbed.

  Newspaper companies
    are losing
         advertisers,
            readers,
          market value,
            and in some cases,
              their sense of purpose
             at a speed
           that would not have been
          imaginable just
            several years ago.

  When you
   have bought a fish
      and arrive home,
    you'd better
      store
     the fish in
      the refrigerator
    if you
   don't cook it immediately,
    but fresh fish
      should be stored
        in your fridge
         for only a day or two.

  The lessons they learned
   may not be different
         from what they
        would have gotten
         in school,
    but are certainly more personal
         and meaningful,
    because they
   had to work them out
         on their own.

  When a person
         from one of these
           cultures
    is speaking
      and suddenly stops,
    what maybe implied
      is that
     the person
    wants
     the listener
    to consider
      what
          has been said
            before continuing.

  A fish
       that lives in mangrove swamps
         across the Americas
    can live
      out of water
         for months at a time,
    similar to
      how animals
   adapted
      to land millions
          of years ago,
    a new study
      shows.

  One
         of the very best varieties
      for eating
        quality
          is Orleans Reinette,
    but you'll need a warm,
        sheltered place
          with perfect soil
            to grow it,
    so
      it's a pipe dream
         for most apple lovers
       who fall
         for it.

  The older collections
         of the gallery
    are reached
      through the main entrance
         while the more
      modern works
          in the
   East Wing
    are most easily reached
      from Trafalgar Square
         by a ground floor entrance.

  Another place
      where unplanned short
          sleep
    goes on
      is
     in the lecture hall
       where a student
    will start
      snoring so loudly

  The freezing Northeast
    hasn't been a terribly
     fun place
    to spend time this winter,
      so
     when the chance
    came for a weekend
      to Sarasota,
            Florida,
              my bags
            were packed
           before you
            could say "sunshine".

  This upsets me
     to no end
    because
     while all
      the experts
    are busy debating about which
      option
    is best,
      the people
    who want
      to improve
        their lives
    are left
      confused by all
          of the conflicting information.

  The city
    was crowded
      with disappointed people
          with no interest
            in settling down,
    and
   when they
     heard there
    were new gold discoveries
         in Alaska,
    they left Dawson City
      as quickly as
   they had come.

  The Pompidou Centre
     in Paris
    is showing
      its respect
         and admiration
      for the artist
             and
    his powerful personality
      with an exhibition
   bringing together
         over 200 paintings,
            sculptures,
              drawings and more.

  Clearly they
        knew
         at what
           time
         the train
      passed
         their homes
       and
         they made it
           their business
        to stand
             along the railway,
    wave
     to complete strangers
      and cheer them up
         as they rushed
           towards Penang.

  The multiplication tables
    are an exception
      to the general rule
           that we
        forget rather quickly
         the things that we
        learn
         in school,
    because they
   are another
      of the things
       we overlearn
         in childhood.

  From cities
      to villages,
    from mountains
      to beaches,
        from water sports
          to wooden artworks,
             Fiji can give you
              more adventures
                 and special experiences
                  than you
            could find almost
              anywhere in the world.

  UNESCO
      (United Nations Educational,
    Scientific
      and Cultural Organization)
         recently set April 30
          as a day
        to raise awareness
         of jazz music,
            its significance,
              and its potential
             as a unifying voice
               across cultures.

  In the coming months,
    we are bringing together
      artists from
     all over the globe,
        to enjoy
          speaking Shakespeare's plays
         in their own language,
             in our Globe,
               within the architecture
             Shakespeare
            wrote for.

  Along the river banks
      of the Amazon
         and
       the Orinoco
        there lives
            a bird
       that swims
         before it can fly,
    flies
      like a fat chicken,
            eats green leaves,
             has
               the stomach
          of a cow
            and has
          claws on
            its wings
             when young.

  Given that
     many people's moods
    are regulated
      by the chemical action
         of chocolate,
    it was probably only
         a matter of time
       before somebody
        made
         the chocolate shop similar
           to a drugstore
         of Chinese medicine.

  The friendship
      that grew out of
          the experience of making
        that film
         and The Sting four years later
    had its root
     in the fact
      that
    although there was
        an age difference,
    we
      both
        came
      from a tradition
             of theater
         and live TV.

  Babies
   who were repeatedly shown
       two spots
    became more excited
      when they
   then heard three drumbeats
        than when they
          heard just two;
     likewise
       when the researchers
      started with drumbeats
          and moved
              to spots.

  At the University

         which
          had remained unstudied
      and were badly
         in need of care
          and protection.

  When monkey-pox,
    a disease
      usually found
          in the African rain forest,
        suddenly turns up in children
          in the American Midwest,
             it's hard
              not
                     to wonder
              if the disease
               that comes
                 from foreign animals
            is homing in on human beings.

  He reported
     the case
      to the police

  This trend,
    which
      was started
        by the medical community
          as a method of fighting
            heart disease,
    has had
      some unintended side effects
          such as overweight
             and heart disease
      —the very thing
         the medical community
        was trying
         to fight.

  The Intelligent Transport team

      named "DriveLAB" in order
    to understand
        the challenges

    and to discover
      where the key stress points
          are.

        from conversations
      overheard
        on a bus.

  The team's data
    only went up
         to 2007,
    but the researchers
      also explored
          what

             if consumers
              replaced
    old products

  Science
    can't explain
     the power
         of pets,
    but many studies
      have shown that
   the company
     of pets
   can help lower blood pressure
      and raise chances
          of recovering
              from a heart attack,
    reduce loneliness
      and spread
         all-round good cheer.

  Data shows that

  Words
      become filled
          with meaning
              for us
                 by experience;
     and the longer

    the more certain words
      bring back
        to us
          the happy and sad events
         of our past;
     and the more

    the more
   the number

  It was calculated
        that

    they were
       more than
          3 billion passenger pigeons

          24 to 40 percent
            of the total bird population
             in the United States,

  The two world wars,

      interrupted
         the supply

        also stifled
            the European silk industry.

  Migration
    is a complex issue,
      and
   biologists define it differently,

      they study.

  One way
    is by organising backstage tours,
      so people

  What I'm afraid

         of computers.

  The psychological laboratory
    has
     a strong claim

    who perform there.

  The displays
     of art museums

  It was not
       until 1500 BC,
            however,
              that
          the first hollow

  Many theorists believe
        the ideal boss
    should lead from behind,

       is due.

  Though we
   might think of film
         as an essentially
          visual experience,
    we really cannot afford

         the importance
             of film sound.

  As far as goods transport
    is concerned,
      growth
    is due to a large extent

           of production.

  In order
      to track temporal hours
          during the day,
                inventors
              created sundials,
                which indicate time
              by the length

                   of the sun's shadow.

    was done in a lot
         of detail
      —very impressive.

  While the Inuit
    may not actually starve
      if hunting
           and trapping
    are curtailed
         by climate change,
    there has certainly been
      an impact
         on people's health.

  It would seem
       that
         the brain
          sees
             these images
         as puzzles,
    and the harder
   it is
         to decipher the meaning,
    the more rewarding
      is
     the moment
         of recognition.

  Such material,
    even
   where it

       if it falls
          into the wrong hands.

  If the glass
      were kept hot enough,
    it would flow
      over the molten tin

      horizontal
        and perfectly parallel
          to the bottom surface.

  It was once assumed
       that improvements
         in telecommunications
        would lead
             to more dispersal

  Compared
      to language,
    all other inventions pale
         in significance,

      on language
        and originates
         from it.

  It's true
    there are
      new regulations
          for mercury emissions
         from power plants,
    but these
         will need
           billions of dollars
      to implement
       and increase costs
         for everyone.

  The teacher's task
    is to assist
     the students

             in a conflict
    sees human resources

    then an external mediator
      might be able
        to help.

  Summer leaves
    are green
   because they
     are full
         of chlorophyll,
    the molecule
   that captures
      sunlight
        and converts
         that energy
          into new
             building materials
               for the tree.

  If clothing

        and then rate
            how much
           they liked each one.

  If identical twins
    are more similar
      to each other with respect
          to an ailment
             than fraternal twins
    are,
      then vulnerability to the disease
    must be rooted
       at least
         in part in heredity.

  Finally,
    perhaps
         the most graphic expressions
      of self-awareness
         in general
    can be seen
      in the displays
          of rage which
    are most common
         from 18 months to 3 years
           of age.

  If we
      can understand
     how geography
    affects our health no matter
       where
      in the world
       we are located,
    we can better treat
      disease,
            prevent illness,
              and keep
          people safe
             and well.

  Similarly,
    people
      who collect dolls
    may go
      beyond simply enlarging
        their collection,
    and develop an interest
      in the way that dolls
    are made,
      or the materials
   that are used.

  He wanted
    to give
      people a feeling
         of suspense
             as they see the building first
         from a distance,
            and then close-up,
              and
             the shape
          of the building
             as a whole
            was that
          of a box.

  The reason
      often given
         for the low regard
           in which smell
    is held
      is that,
    in comparison
         with its importance
             among animals,
        the human sense
         of smell
       is feeble and undeveloped.

  Some of you
      suggested an Italian restaurant,
    but I
        must confess that I
            decided
             to book a Lebanese one,
        as we have plenty
         of opportunities
            to go
              to an Italian restaurant
             at home.

  As these ancestral tortoises
      settled
         on the individual islands,
    the different populations
      adapted
         to their unique environments,
        giving rise
         to at least
          14 different subspecies.

  The continuous and reckless use
      of synthetic chemicals
          for the control
             of pests which pose
    a threat
      to agricultural crops
             and
   human health
      is proving
        to be counter-productive.

  Both social
     and cognitive types
      of laughter tap
        into the same
          expressive machinery
         in our brains,
    the emotion
      and motor
          circuits
              that
    produce smiles
      and excited vocalisations.

  Opinion polls
      suggest that many people
    nurture
     the belief
       that environmental standards
    are declining
         and four factors
    seem
     to cause
        this disjunction
          between perception and reality.

  Natural soil fertility
    is dropping in
      many areas
           because
              of continuous industrial
                 fertilizer
         and pesticide use,
    while the growth
     of algae
        is increasing
         in lakes
          because
              of the fertilizer run-off.

  Within the span
         of several centuries,
    the Lapita
      stretched
          the boundaries
              of their world
                 from the jungle-clad volcanoes
                     of Papua New Guinea
          to the loneliest coral outliers
             of Tonga.

  Multiplan
     insurance
      may not cover
          all
             pre-existing medical conditions
      —so
         before you leave
        be sure
          to check
            with them
              about any long-term illnesses
                  or disabilities
          that you have.

  As the medical world
      continues
        to grapple
         with what's acceptable
          and what's not,
    it is clear that companies
      must continue
        to be heavily scrutinized
      for their sales
         and marketing strategies.

  The reasoning
    is
      that
   if you
     replenish
       the ice sheets
      and frozen waters
         of the high latitudes,
    more light
      will be reflected back
         into space,
    so reducing
     the warming
         of oceans and atmosphere.

  A final theory
    is related
     to group behaviour,
    and suggests that
   sea mammals
      cannot distinguish
         between sick and healthy leaders
      and will follow sick leaders,
    even to an inevitable death.

  From earliest childhood
      we are
    so bound up
      with our system of numeration
        that it
       is a fear of imagination
          to consider
            the problems
             faced
         by early humans
       who had not yet developed
        this facility.

  One
         of my purposes
      in writing
        this book
    is to give
      readers
       who haven't had
         the opportunity
          to
            see
              and enjoy real mathematics
                 the chance
          to appreciate
         the mathematical way of thinking.

  We have also
         negotiated a range
           of benefits for staff
       such as discounted private
         healthcare
           and a car purchase scheme,
    along with a number
         of one-off
        deals with
            hotels and amusement parks.

  For many enthusiasts,
    the ultimate flight fantasy
      is the jet pack,
    a small piece
         of equipment
      on your back which
    enables you
         to climb vertically
      into the air
        and fly forwards,
    backwards
   and turn.

  The typical way
      of talking
             to a baby
      —high-pitched,
        exaggerated
             and repetitious—
         is a source
             of fascination
                 for linguists
        who hope
          to understand
         how "baby talk" impacts
          on learning.

  Psychologists
      have long held
        that a person's character
    cannot undergo a transformation
         in any meaningful way
           and
       that
         the key traits
           of personality
        are determined
          at a very young age.

  It was only
       when the hull
          was hanging freely
         from the lifting frame,
    clear
      of the seabed
         and
           the suction effect
             of the surrounding mud,
    that
     the salvage operation
      progressed
         to the second stage.

  They think
        the population
         of Rapa Nui
    grew rapidly
      and then remained
          more or less
             stable
      until the arrival
         of the Europeans,
    who introduced
      deadly diseases
          to which islanders
    had no immunity.

  Anyway,
    even though these noise maps
      are fairly crude,
    they've been useful
      in providing information
           and raising awareness
              that noise matters,
        we need to deal with
          it
             and so
        it's a political matter.

  Travel
    has existed
         since the beginning
           of time,
    when primitive
   man set out,
        often traversing
            great distances in search
             of game,
               which
              provided
                 the food
                  and clothing necessary
                      for his survival.

  This is
     why composers
    often introduce a key note
         in the beginning
             of a song,
    spend most
         of the rest
             of the piece
                 in the studious avoidance
         of the pattern,
        and then finally
         repeat it only
          at the end.

  In its most general sense,
    prescriptivism
      is
     the view
   that one variety
         of language
        has an inherently higher value
             than others,
    and that this
      ought to be imposed on the whole
        of the speech community.

  What
      we've decided
     to present
      today
          is information
             about just three species
      —because we
       felt
         these
          gave a good indication
             of the processes
               at work
             in rural and urban settings
         as a whole.

  The results
         of a 14-year study
        to be announced
          later this month
         reveal
            that
             the diseases
      associated
         with old age
    are afflicting
      fewer and fewer people
         and
   when they do strike,
    it is much later in life.

  Memory consolidation,
    the next step
     in forming
        an episodic memory,
          is
         the process
          by which memories
         of encoded information
        are strengthened,
    stabilised
      and stored
        to facilitate later retrieval.

  In the course
      of conducting research
          in a number of industries
           and working directly
             with companies,
    we have discovered that
      managers
          often fail
              to recognize
                 the less obvious
                  but profound ways
           these trends
              are influencing
                consumers' aspirations,
                    attitudes,
                      and behaviours.

  The conviction
    that
      historical relics
    provide
        infallible testimony
         about the past
    is rooted
      in the nineteenth
         and early twentieth centuries,
    when science
   was regarded
      as objective
        and value free.

  After this,
    many researchers
      switched
          to autoganzfeld tests
      —an automated variant
          of the technique
         which used computers
              to perform many of the key
        tasks
           such as the random selection
             of images.

  Unless
        there are
          no purchase facilities available
         at the station
      where you
    began your journey,
      you will be required
    to pay
      the full fare
   if you
     are unable
      to produce
         a valid ticket
           for inspection
         during a journey.

  Although population,
    industrial output
      and economic productivity
        have continued
            to soar
             in developed nations,
        the rate
          at which people
        withdraw water
         from aquifers,
    rivers and lakes
      has slowed.

  High achievers have been found
    to use
      self-regulatory
         learning strategies
          more often
         and more
          effectively than lower achievers,
    and are better able
      to transfer
        these strategies
          to deal with unfamiliar tasks.

  Research
    also indicates
        that bilingual experience
    may help
      to keep
         the cognitive mechanisms sharp
      by recruiting alternate
    brain networks
         to compensate
           for those
      that
    become damaged
      during aging.

  Not
      only was a monopoly
         of cinnamon
        becoming
          impossible,
    but the spice trade overall
      was diminishing
         in economic potential,
    and was eventually superseded
      by the rise
         of trade
             in coffee,
                tea,
              chocolate,
                and sugar.

  Another feature
      that
          attracted
            a lot
             of attention
    was an interactive journey
         through a number
             of the locations
   chosen
      for blockbuster films
           which
              had made use
                     of New Zealand's stunning
                 scenery
      as a backdrop.

  As researchers
      on aging
          noted recently,
    no treatment
         on the market today
        has been proved
         to slow human aging
      —the build-up
          of molecular and cellular damage
               that
        increase vulnerability
          to infirmity as
        we grow older.

  We tend
        to think
         of climate
      —as opposed
             to weather—
         as something unchanging,
    yet humanity
      has been
        at the mercy
          of climate change
             for its entire existence,
    with at least
       eight glacial episodes
         in the past 730,000 years.

  In common
     with all mammals,
        reptiles and birds,
          the remote ancestors
         of tortoises
        were marine fish
         and
           before that
      various more or less
         worm-like creatures
           stretching back,
        still
      in the sea,
        to the primeval bacteria.

  It is finished
        manufactured products
   that dominate
     the flow
         of trade,
            and,
              thanks
          to technological advances such
             as lightweight components,
               manufactured goods themselves
            have tended
              to become lighter
             and less bulky.

  It's true
      that
         the actual construction
           of the house
       was harmful
          to the environment,
    mainly because they
        had to use massive amounts
         of concrete
      —one
             of the biggest sources
          of carbon dioxide
            in manufacturing.

  The difficulty with the evidence
        produced
         by these studies,
    fascinating
      as they
          are in collecting together
        anecdotes
          and apparent similarities
              and exceptions,
        is that
       they are not
         what we
       would today call norm-referenced.

  Businesses
      are finding
        that ethnography
    can offer them deeper insight
         into the possible needs
             of customers,
                either present
                  or future,
                 as well as providing
              valuable information
                 about their attitudes
                   towards existing products.

                   towards existing products.

  Education
    is a hiring requirement
         for 60%
           of employment opportunities,
    but 40%
         of human resources staff
    say
      that
   if they
     do not know a lot
         about the value
             of documents attained elsewhere,
    they will not recognise them.

  The impression
    is that
     the logical nature
      of the textbooks
         and
           their comprehensive coverage
          of different types
             of examples,
    combined
      with the relative homogeneity
        of the class,
          renders
        work sheets unnecessary.

  Most tickets
    may be used for travel
         by Sleeper,
            subject to availability,
              and
           a reservation
             in a two-berth cabin
            can be made
             for £25,
               except in the case
          of Solo and Special tickets,
            which include
          Sleeper reservations
            in the fare.

  Operating on the same principle
         as wind turbines,
    the power
         in sea turbines
    comes
      from tidal currents
         which turn blades similar
      to ships' propellers,
            but,
              unlike wind,
             the tides
            are predictable
             and
           the power input
            is constant.

  These discoveries
    have led
      to the field
          known
             as neuroeconomics,
    which studies
       the brain's secrets
          to success
              in an economic environment
   that demands
      innovation
        and being able
          to do things
         differently from competitors.

  While the detrimental effects
      of noise
         in classroom situations
    are not limited
      to children
          experiencing disability,
    those
         with a disability
   that affects
      their processing
         of speech
          and verbal communication
   could be extremely vulnerable.

  By timing
     the transit
      from two
          widely-separated locations,
    teams
     of astronomers
    could calculate the parallax angle
      —the apparent difference
          in position
              of an astronomical body
                 due to a difference
                     in the observer's position.

  Victimised
      pupils
    are more likely
      to experience difficulties
          with interpersonal relationships
             as adults,
    while children
      who persistently bully
    are more likely to grow up
      to be physically violent,
    and convicted
         of anti-social offences.

  On the negative side,
    this type
     of organisation
    doesn't always act effectively,
      because it
   depends too much
      on one or two people
          at the top,
        and
         when these people
          make
       poor decisions
          there's no-one else
       who can influence them.

  Researchers
     from nine countries
   are working together
      to create
        a map
      linked
             to a database
       that can be fed measurements
          from field surveys,
                drone surveys,
                  satellite imagery,
                 lab analyses
              and so on
                to provide
              real-time data
                 on the state
                   of soil.

  As the fire
      continued
         to rage,
    the National Trust's conservators
      were being mobilised,
        and that evening local stationers
          were especially opened
              to provide
                the bulk supplies
                 of blotting paper
          so desperately needed
              in the salvage operation.

  Her contribution
         to physics
   had been immense,
    not only in her own work,
        the importance
           of which
            had been demonstrated
             by her two Nobel Prizes,
    but
     because
       of her influence
         on subsequent generations
             of nuclear physicists
         and chemists.

  The taxonomist
    sometimes overlooks
      whole species
          in favour of those
            groups currently
         under study,
    while the ecologist
      often collects
        only
         a limited number
           of specimens
         of each species,
    thus reducing
     their value
         for taxonomic investigations.

  Many CEOs
      combine two
          opposing characteristics:
     confidence
      —that is,
    the belief
   that they're capable
         of great achievements—
           with a high level
             of anxiety,
    a fear
      of missing targets,
        whether set by themselves
         or by the directors
             of the company.

  A radical solution,
    which
      may work
        for some very large companies
      whose businesses
    are extensive
         and complex,
    is the professional board,
        whose members
          would work up
            to three
              or four days a week,
    supported
      by their own dedicated staff
         and advisers.

  This approach
        is summarised
             in the statement
   that it
     is
       the task of the grammarian
        to describe,
    not to prescribe
      —to record
         the facts
           of linguistic diversity,
        and
         not
          to attempt
              the impossible tasks
          of evaluating language variation
           or halting language change.

  Some recent
      interdisciplinary research
    has come out
      with results that
          at first sight
    seem contradictory
      —a city
          needs
            to have a sense
             of activity,
    so it needs to be lively,
      with sounds
    like the clack
         of high heels
      on a pavement
         or
           the hiss
          of a coffee machine,
    but these
      mustn't
    be too intrusive,
      because at the same time
    we need
      to be able
        to relax.

  Another strange feature
         of the Japanese pagoda
        is that,
    because the building
      tapers,
        with each successive floor plan
          being smaller
             than the one below,
               none
             of the vertical pillars
           that carry
            the weight
             of the building
           is connected
              to its corresponding pillar
                  above.

  An accident
      that
    occurred
      in the skies
          over the Grand Canyon in 1956
              resulted in the establishment
      of the
         Federal Aviation Administration
           (FAA)
          to regulate
            and oversee
             the operation
               of aircraft in the skies
             over the United States,
    which
      were becoming quite
   congested.

  Tourists
      flock
        to wells
          in far-flung corners
              of north-western India
            to gaze
              in wonder
                 at these architectural marvels
                   from hundreds of years ago,
    which serve
      as a reminder
          of both
             the ingenuity and artistry
              of ancient civilisations
         and
             of the value
          of water
             to human existence.

  The antiseptic properties
         of tannin,
    the active ingredient
     in tea,
        and
         of hops
           in beer
      —plus the fact
       that both
          are made
         with boiled water—
           allowed urban communities
        to flourish
          at close quarters
            without succumbing
              to water-borne diseases
         such
                 as dysentery.

  As recently as 1993,
    engineers
      made a major breakthrough
          by discovering
            so-called turbo codes
      —which come
          very close
              to Shannon's ultimate limit
                  for the maximum rate
                     that data
        can be transmitted reliably,
    and now play a key role
      in the mobile videophone revolution.

  If a life span
    is a genetically
         determined biological
           characteristic,
    it is
     logically necessary
      to propose
         the existence
           of an internal clock,
        which
             in some way measures
          and controls
             the ageing process
               and which
            finally determines death
             as the last step
                 in a fixed programme.

  Participants
     in the online debate
        argued that
      our biggest challenge
    is to address
      the underlying causes
        of the
         agricultural system's
           inability
          to ensure inability food
             for all,
    and
   they identified
      as drivers
          of this problem our dependency
         on fossil fuels
          and unsupportive
         government policies.

  Already in laboratory trials
    they have tested strategies
      for neutralising
         the power
           of thunderstorms,
    and this
      winter they
    will brave real storms,
      equipped
        with an armoury
             of lasers
    that
      they will be pointing
        towards the heavens
      to discharge thunderclouds
         before lightning
    can strike.

  Eliminating
     the secrecy surrounding pay
      by openly communicating
        everyone's remuneration,
    publicizing performance bonuses
       and allocating annual salary
    increases
      in a lump sum
        rather than spreading them out
          over an entire year
    are examples
     of actions
      that will make
          rewards more visible
         and potentially more motivating.
