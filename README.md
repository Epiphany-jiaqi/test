(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry</i>

<i>He's a family guy</i>

ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) <i>We now return</i>
<i>to the extended director's cut</i>

<i>of</i> Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

Charlie, don't forget
what happened to the boy

who got everything he ever wanted.

-What?
-He lived happily ever after.

But he did have to earn it.

Hint, hint.

Do it, Charlie!

I'm not going back to that four-person
bed.

Hell, I'll do it if you want!

No, it has to be a child!

What did he just say?

Brian, this does not seem appropriate
to watch in front of the baby.

Not appropriate?

You took me to see<i> Magic Mike XXL.</i>

Nope, this one's wet.

Ugh, this one too.

Also wet.

Huh! This one's dry,

but the back of the seat
and front of it is wet.

Let's put on something more
child-friendly.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Time to Too-Tootie-Too</i>
<i>with</i> The Turtlenecks.

Oh, God, no! These guys are horrible.

(SINGING) <i>Do you kazoo?</i>
<i>I often do</i>

<i>When I am blue</i>
<i>I do kazoo</i>

<i>Toot-tootie-too</i>

<i>Goes my kazoo</i>

<i>I will kazoo</i>

<i>Hey, how about you?</i>

Ugh, all they're doing is announcing
that they play the kazoo

and then asking
if others also play the kazoo.

This doesn't seem so bad.

And after all, it's a song for babies.

Yeah, but that's the thing.

Baby songs never tackle real baby issues.

You know, like loud noises or teething,

or when Dad uses me as a lumbar pillow.

-(GRUNTS)
-Ow.

-(GRUNTING)
-Ow. Ow. Ow.

-(GRUNTS)
-Ow.

This things works better in the car.

Well, how could they address baby issues?

Children songs are written by adults.

And, dollars to donuts, white adults.

I... Who you mad at, Brian?

Ugh, how much time you got?

Not enough for that, but you're right.

If you want a song a baby'll like,
you've gotta get a baby to write it.

Well, call John Mayer,
he's a big fat baby.

No, I'll do it and you could help.

Well, I... I did write a musical
about Alexander Hamilton.

Not... Not that one. But sure, I'm in.

Ooh, I'm excited! This will be great!

And those guys back at the factory
can suck it!

I'm gonna get out of this place one day.

Hey, Butch, get a load of Stewie!

He says he's gonna get out of here.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

You don't know me, man.
I'm different. I got ideas.

Hey, Butch, you hear that?

Stewie's got ideas.

Shut up! I'm gonna go across that river

and make it to the city on the other side.

I'm gonna be a singer.

Bublé over here says he's gonna
be a singer.

Hey, Bublé, I got a tune for you to sing.

It's called, "Get your ass back
on the forklift. Lunch is over."

Hey, Stewie, don't listen to those guys,

follow your heart.

Shut up, Butch.
You're the loser of this crew.

Hey, guys, you hear that?

Butch told me to follow my heart.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Dad, can I have 50 bucks
for a shamrock tattoo? It's time.

All right, but make sure you get it
where everyone can see.

Hold on, Peter,
if Chris wants money for something,

maybe it's time he got a part-time job.

He could mow lawns or babysit.

I can't work, I'm too young.

Oh, Will Smith's little kid
works as a movie star,

even though he looks like
a wet baby horse.

All right, I suppose I could get a job.

Or maybe even my old job
as the guy racing through an airport

at the end of a romantic comedy.

Taxi! Taxi!

(TIRES SCREECH)

Hey, are you crazy?

Crazy for love!

The most amazing girl I've ever met
leaves on a plane in five minutes.

Get in!

(SINGING) <i>I get knocked down</i>

<i>But I get up again</i>

<i>I get knocked down</i>

<i>But I get up again</i>

<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

(SIREN WAILING)

What the hell's going on?

-This guy's in love.
-Is she worth it?

She's a once-in-a-lifetime girl.

We'll give you an escort.

<i>He drinks a whiskey drink</i>
<i>He drinks a vodka drink</i>

MAN: (ON PA) <i>Final boarding call</i>

<i>for Ashley's flight</i>
<i>to Stuffy New England College.</i>

<i>Final boarding.</i>

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, child!
What's the hurry?

The love of my life, that's what!

We got a Code Romeo, repeat Code Romeo.

(BEEPING)

If we get there on time,
there's an extra $50 in it for ya.

I love this job!

<i>I get knocked down</i>
<i>But I get up again</i>

<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

CHRIS: Ashley, wait!

(PANTING)

I wouldn't miss this
for all the rush-hour fares in big town!

Chris, you came!

Oh, my God! Let me get my grandma.

-Chris?
-Ashley, I love you!

(SMOOCHING NOISILY)

ALL: Ew!

Oh, you're groaning at me?

You paid $19 to fly Spirit Air.

You get what you get.

All right, Brian.
I've written a few songs.

All about stuff babies actually
care about.

No more rainbows and unicorns.

Real baby issues!

Right, like heartworm and parvo?

No, baby stuff!

Oh, oh, human babies! (CHUCKLES)

I didn't... I didn't realize
there was an agenda.

Okay, look, just pay attention.

(SINGING) <i>Mama liked to party</i>
<i>when you were in her belly</i>

<i>Drinkin', she did some</i>

<i>Mama liked to party</i>
<i>when you were in her belly</i>

<i>That's why you are dumb</i>

I call that, "Mama Liked to Party,"
parenthesis, "Chris' Song."

Stewie, that's good!

-Hey, can I write one?
-Yeah, we need as many as we can.

Our first gig is Saturday.
It's a birthday party.

Wow, already?
How did you book a gig so fast?

Easy, I figured out the perfect way
to get the word out

to middle-aged moms.

Musical entertainment,
available for parties!

Musical entertainment,
available for parties!

Hey, where are you
drinking that Chardonnay?

Oh, hey, Chris, how's your job hunt going?

Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere.

A lot of people seem to be turned off
by my dishonorable discharge.

-What, from the army?
-No, it's a euphemism.

Oh, yucky.

Uh, you guys,
I need help unloading the groceries.

My undiagnosed mom injury is flaring up.

These little things of apple sauce
better not be for desserts.

WOMAN: Go to hell, Glenn Quagmire!

I'm sorry, but Mondays are Asian only.

Why is your last name Wong?

It's my married name.

Now I see why you're here.

Geez, what was that about?

Ah. Little scheduling mix-up.

I'm just so busy.

I don't have any time
to organize my own life.

Wait a minute. What if you had someone
to help keep you organized?

Chris is looking for work,
maybe he can help you out.

Be your assistant.

Huh, maybe.

You have any references?

Uh, "cowabunga," "Schwing,"
"yada-yada-yada."

Those are pretty good references.
You're hired!

Look at that. Look at the cake.

"Happy birthday, Charlie and Uncle Craig."

And "Uncle Craig"
is written in a different color.

Oh, poor Uncle Craig.

Hey, is that your ex-girlfriend Olivia?

God, what's she doing here?

She was always such a nightmare.

(CAMERAS CLICKING)

Olivia! Oh, my God! Do I look okay?

I hate this shirt!
Switch shirts! Switch shirts!

Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you!

Hey, Olivia... Hey, what brings you here?

(CHUCKLING) Oh. The birthday boy and I
met at Burt Reynolds' acting camp

in Jupiter, Florida.

Well, I'm glad to hear you're
still acting.

You know, the last time
I saw you, you were...

-Burning in a cardboard house.
-Yeah, burning in a cardboard house, yeah.

Uh, hey, listen, I don't know if you've
heard, but we're the entertainment.

Aw, that's good.

-Good for you!
-Okay, great to see ya.

Come on, Stewie, it's not about her.

It's about those six children watching

and the spazzy kid
who is just waiting for the snakes.

SPAZZY KID: Bring out the snakes!

It's a hot crowd. Have fun out there!

I'm gonna go feed
everything in my van to each other.

Okay, kids, if everyone's done
washing their hands from the snakes,

we have some fun music...

No climbing on the boat!

Okay, now, please welcome
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

All right, we are Red Shirt Blue Shirt,

and here's a song we call,
"Mommy and Daddy's Room."

And we think it's one you can
all relate to.

(SINGING) <i>When everybody's gone to sleep</i>

<i>And you've said, "Good night, moon"</i>

<i>There's plenty of noise still comin'</i>
<i>from Mommy and Daddy's room</i>

<i>Oh, Daddy says, "Please"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "No"</i>

<i>Daddy says, "Come on"</i>
<i>Mommy says, "Whoa"</i>

<i>Daddy goes, "Ungh!"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Ow!"</i>

<i>Daddy says, "I'm done"</i>
<i>Mommy goes, "Wow"</i>

<i>Daddy rolls over and falls asleep</i>

<i>Mommy drinks wine in the dark</i>

(BABIES CHEERING)

My God, did you hear them, Stewie?
We're a hit!

We gotta go out and celebrate.

Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.
He's got a date with me.

Really? Awesome!

Brian, I can't go. I'm not feeling well.

Stewie, I've been standing here
the whole time.

But, you know, you know what? That's fine.

I'll just go have a dog-style
celebration by myself.

Yeah! Awesome time!

This is very fun for me!

-Hey!
-Oh, hey!

-This is fun, right?
-The best!

And me, too!

-Great crowd, babe.
-What is... What is this?

Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.

She's also doing half the band.

You even know what that means?

Uh, let's just say
I couldn't toddle right for a week.

Okay, you don't.

All right, if you'll excuse me,
I have a poo-poo diaper.

You really think this Olivia thing
is a good idea?

Why wouldn't it be?

I don't know. It just seems like
it always ends badly for you two.

And it can be tricky, working with an ex.

Look at Kermit and Miss Piggy.

How you feeling, Miss Piggy?
I heard you called in sick yesterday.

Yeah, I had a frog in my throat.

(LAUGHS) Right, Kermit? Huh? Right?

Please stop drinking.

Okay, Chris, I think
you're gonna be a great assistant.

Your paperwork appears to be in order,
but before we get started,

do you own a pair of rubber boots

that you'd have to wear
if you worked on a fishing boat?

Uh, no, I don't think so.

All right, I guess it'll be a light
day today,

but tomorrow
you should come wearing those.

Okay, got it.

Now, the first thing
I need you to do every morning

is punch me in the stomach,
because I'm a bad person.

Is this a trick?

It's the furthest thing from a trick.
Go ahead.

And it should be pretty hard.
I'm a worse person than you think.

(GRUNTS)

(STRAINED) Okay, that's really good.

Now I need you to call Time Warner
about my cable bill.

All right, this one
is for all the mommies out there.

This is what we're really saying
when we're crying.

(SINGING) <i>Please put some butt paste</i>
<i>on my button</i>

<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

<i>Smear it on my button</i>

(BOTH VOCALIZING)

<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

<i>Butt paste on my button</i>

<i>Need it on my button</i>
<i>'cause it cools and quells me so</i>

(SINGING) <i>Stay away, stay away</i>

<i>From the big kid in the baby swing</i>

(SINGING) <i>There's a little metal box</i>

<i>At the top of the stairs</i>

<i>In the back of the closet</i>

<i>And a tiny little key</i>

<i>That's hidden in the book</i>

<i>In the drawer with the socks</i>

<i>And I know how to use it</i>

<i>To open up the box</i>

<i>And that's where the gun is</i>

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

You know, I talk a lot of smack,

but at the end of the day,
these guys are pros.

Even broken arm coyote with washboard.

Hey, let's keep this party rolling.

I'll go get us another badly-scratched
plastic pitcher of soda.

Ugh, finally he's doing something useful.

-What? What do you mean?
-Nothing.

It's just, you write all the songs,
you've got a better voice,

you've got the sweet bod.

Oh, my God! Babe!

Plus, you've got all the cool
catchphrases like, "Damn you all"

or "What the dude" or whatever.

Uh, it's "deuce". But yeah, you're right.

I do... Does it sound through the mike
like I'm saying "dude"?

Should it be "dude"?

Meanwhile, everyone thinks
Brian is the star of the group.

-Who thinks that?
-I don't know.

I'm just saying, after every show,

the fans are always petting Brian
and not you.

No one's allowed to pet me, it's illegal.

I just hate to see Brian

getting all the attention
that you deserve.

You should really watch your back.

Wow, it's hard to believe
Brian would betray me.

I mean, he was there for me
when I hit rock bottom.

See, Brian, that's a rock bottom.

Thanks for being here for that.

Now get out of here.
We're about to drink some Chardonnay.

Chris, could you please get Hannah
a thank-you basket

and schedule her next appointment?
I'd like to see her again in two weeks.

Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you
at 3:00 a week from Thursday.

That works.

-And you know to fast the night before?
-Yep.

And would you like to leave
your panties in the fish bowl

for a chance to win a free lunch?

Good luck!

When are you gonna do
that drawing anyway?

Oh, there's no drawing.
I just like smelling the bowl.

You know, you're doing a great job, Chris.

Why don't you jerk the rest
of the day off?

Man, this is the best job ever.

And to think I almost took
that pop-up restaurant gig.

Hi! You hungry?

-(SCREAMS)
-(TIRES SCREECH)

(GUITAR STRUMMING)

<i>Check, check. Malia, check,</i>

<i>Obama, check, check, check. Malia Obama.</i>

All right, that's a creepy mike check.

Let's just do a quick
run-through of "Little Brother."

(SINGING) <i>I want a little brother</i>

(BRIAN HUMMING)

<i>On second thought</i>

<i>I think I'd kill him dead</i>

<i>Could we just cut Brian's mike?</i>

<i>His humming sounds like</i>
<i>my table's ready at Chili's.</i>

-Stewie, what the hell is your problem?
-I'll tell you what my problem is.

I'm doing all the work
and you're just riding my coattails.

What are you taking about?

I'm just as big a part of this group
as you are.

Oh, really? You're writing about
all your authentic baby experiences?

You asked me to do this with you.
Why are you being such a dick?

Because I lost the baby!

What was that?

I don't know, he saw that
in a movie or something.

Brian, this seems a good as time as any.

I think it's time to talk about
your future with the band.

Are you serious?

You're actually kicking me
out of the band?

Not at all. In fact, I think
you and I should kick Stewie out.

-And I'll take his place.
-What?

SPAZZY KID: Bring out the snakes!

Does he just come to all of our shows?

So, you wanna fire Stewie,
and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?

Absolutely! You're the whole reason
the fans even like the band.

Kids love dogs!

Besides, we've both seen
what Stewie's become.

An impossible diva.

Yeah, but he's my friend.

Yeah, well, your <i>friend</i> has been talking
about kicking you out of the band.

Wait, what? He has?

And I don't know if you considered this,

but the clock is ticking
on Stewie's cuteness.

Huh, I guess you're right.

And I wouldn't be surprised
if he ends up looking like

an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.

(LAUGHING LIKE PETER)

Groceries.

Hey, I had a thought
about our costumes for today's show.

I could wear a shirt that's both
red and blue,

and you can do spin art
with all the wussie kids

who are afraid to go on rides.

Yeah? Well, how about this, Stewie?
You're fired!

-Pardon?
-That's right.

Olivia's takin' your place in the band.

You are looking at the new
Red Shirt Blue Shirt.

What the dude! Ah, you know what?
"Deuce" was right.

Come on, Brian,
you and I should probably rehearse.

We've got a show in 20 minutes.

Fine! Go ahead! It's not gonna
be the same!

Like <i>Cheers</i> wasn't the same
when they brought in Kirstie Alley.

ALL: Norm!

No, I'm... I'm Rebecca.

Meg, do you know
how to use Microsoft Excel?

Yeah, I'm actually pretty good.

Yeah, you would! Dork!

But, I do need to make that spreadsheet
or I'm fired.

Oh, my God!

Peter, our dishwasher is full of sex toys.

Oh, yeah. Chris put those in there.
It's for his job.

He's working for Quagmire now.

He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?

Not just that, he also takes pictures
of Quagmire's genitals

to track sore growth.

So, brace yourself when you open iPhoto.

It's on the Griffin family account.

Peter, my parents have access to that.

What's wrong with this worm?

And you knew about this?

How could you let him
do this disgusting stuff?

What? You're the one
who wanted Chris to get a job.

Yeah, like mowing lawns
or trimming bushes.

Oh, he's doing one of those.

That's it!

I'm calling Quagmire right now
and puttin' an end to this.

(LINE RINGING)

CHRIS: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
<i>You have reached Glenn Quagmire.</i>

<i>Neither he nor his assistant is available.</i>

<i>To schedule a liaison, press one.</i>

<i>To cancel a liaison, press two.</i>

<i>If you're calling to report a pregnancy,</i>

<i>please fill out our online form</i>

<i>Mommy drinks wine in the dark</i>

-(CROWD CHEERING)
<i>-Thank you, Quahog!</i>

That was great! They loved us!

Yeah, I guess, but, did you
see what I saw?

That kid with the cane? Yeah.
What do you think is wrong with him?

No, Stewie was out there.

-So?
-So...

We're singing a song he wrote.

This whole thing was his idea.

Brian, don't mess this up.

We've got a good thing going.

I hate to tell you this,

but I'm afraid Red Shirt Blue Shirt
is done.

I can't do this. I'm out.

I don't care. I don't need you!

I can get 100 dogs
to fit that stupid blue shirt.

You're a monster!

Like Frankenstein
when he became a loan officer.

So, I'm looking for money
to open a small business.

-We plan to sell antique lamps.
-Mmm.

-Handmade blankets.
-Mmm!

And pitchforks.

(GROWLING)

Chris, there you are. We need to talk.

What, are you walking a horse?

Did Quagmire get a horse?

Oh, no, here we go.

I want a horse!

Peter, it's not a horse.

Chris, what the hell is that?

Oh, this is Mr. Quagmire's horse gimp.

What is a horse gimp?

It's a sexual fetishist

who derives erotic pleasure

from dressing in horse-themed
leather gear.

You wanna see me feed him a carrot?

-Absolutely not.
-Hell yes.

Chris, this is no job for a teenage boy.

You have to quit right now.

I can't quit.
I'm actually good at this job.

Plus, I'm making decent money.

HORSE GIMP: You could
work at the pharmacy.

-Quite, Triscuit!
-Ooh!

Hook me to the plow.

Chris, I have $1,100
in a pink can in the garage.

Just take that
and we'll never speak of this again.

-Okay.
-Great, now let's all go home.

HORSE GIMP: Well, that's what I get
for horsing around.

Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.

-Stewie?
-Oh, hello, Brian.

I'm here to apologize,
and to let you know I quit the band.

You did?

Yes. It's nothing without you.

You were the band.

Those were your songs.

And I'm sorry if I let Olivia
manipulate me.

(SIGHS) I guess she manipulated
both of us.

There's just something
about her flat chest and muscular legs.

Look, I never should have
treated you the way I did.

I suppose I didn't treat you
so well either.

So what do you say?

Can we put this all behind us
and go back to the way things were?

Of course we can.

Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep
the band going.

Probably. She told me she was just
gonna replace me with another dog.

-Yes, but who?
-I don't know.

Probably some dog
neither you or I have ever met.

The Feast of San Gennaro.

Every child here has seen a relative
murdered in a barber chair.

Step right up!

Teach an old Italian lady how
to use an iPad.

Oh, that sounds like fun.
I'll give it a try.

Hey, how are you? Look what I got for you.

-What is it?
-It's a tablet computer.

I don't want it.

-But, you don't even know what it is.
-I don't want it!

But you can watch movies on it.

My eyes hurt.

I'm trying to do something nice here.

For the last time, I don't want it.

I bet you if Joey was givin' it to you,
you'd take it!

Don't you bring him into this.
Joey was a good boy.

Oh, yeah, yeah! Joey was a good boy?

You thought he was making
100 grand a year hauling lumber?

-Don't you start with this!
-He was dirty, Ma!

I can't hear this. I won't hear it!

-He was an angel!
-Oh, that's right! Angel Joey!

Great Joey! Perfect Joey!

I got to go to the church.

Oh, yeah, sure. Light another candle.
That'll bring him back!

-You watch your tongue!
-Admit it!

You wish it was me in that car
instead of him!

Just take your little TV and go!

It's an iPad, you dumb cow!

(GROANS)

I guess I don't have any sons now.

Ma!

I'm sorry, Ma!

Ma!

Ma!

Hey, Brian. Look over there.

That guy looks like Frank Sinatra Jr.

Stewie, this is Federal Hill.
Everybody looks like Frank Sinatra Jr.

Well, then, who's that guy
who looks like a young Frank Sinatra?

Oh, that's Woody Allen's son,
but you're right,

that other guy behind him
is Frank Sinatra Jr.

Stewie, Elliot.

It... It's actually Brian.
We've... We've met many times before.

Then who's Elliot?

I... I really wouldn't know.

This is a bad start to whatever
we're doing.

Well, now, what brings you fellas
to the festival?

My dad will drive long distances
for ice with colored liquid in it.

PETER: They got blue!

And we all love the Italian food.

Oh, you like Italian food?

Want a meatball?

Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.

But it's a shame we can't get
good Italian food like this in Quahog.

Well, maybe the three of us
ought to open an Italian restaurant there.

Open our own Italian restaurant?

I say, that sounds fun.

You, uh...

You keep meatballs in your jacket?

Oh, yeah. All my pockets
are lined with Reynolds Wrap.

I'd learned that from my old buddies,
Dean Martin Jr.,

Joey Bishop Jr., and Sammy Davis III.

Hey, where's Chris?

He's over there,
playing that carnival game.

Step right up.

Everybody take a chance
on Whack A-Big Pussy!

-Hey, Tone.
-Hey, Tone.

-Hey, Tone.
-Hey, Tone.

This is not what I thought it was!

(ROARING)

Oh, my God! Chris is out of control.

I know.

It must be all the violence in movies
and sex on TV.

Oh!

-See, I listen.
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Peter, we need to talk about
what happened at the street fair.

Lois, it's an Italian festival.

You're supposed to yell, <i>"Bella, bella,"</i>

and grab as much fat ass as you can.

No, I'm talking about Chris.

I had no idea he had
so much pent-up aggression.

We have to deal with his anger issues
before he hurts himself.

Yeah, that's good thinking, Lois.

I've seen what happens when people
hold in their aggression for too long.

Don't forget,
I was in that elevator with Jay-Z.

Hey, could you have your guy hit two?

I got to get down to the business center
to print out my boarding pass.

Oh! Hey! That's gonna leave a mark.

(CHUCKLES) That's from a movie.

So you girls traveling with your dad here?

Hey, don't kick him, muddy shoes.
He's got a white suit on.

Hey, look, I don't know if you guys
are really staying here,

but you can't get into the pool
without a room key.

Okay, Chris,
your mom and I want to help you

get out some of that aggression,

so I thought you and me could
huck rotten apples at passing cars.

Oh, I didn't know we had
brown apple in the forecast.

Well, we needed it.

Wow! Can I have a turn?

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Hey! Which one of you
threw that apple at my car?

He did it! He dragged me out here.
I wanted to be in school, sir.

Where'd you get a cannon like that, kid?

I work out my right arm three times a day.

Hmm. Free weights?

No, mostly JPEGs of Helen Hunt
on my hard drive.

Well, I'm Coach Doyle and I head up
the baseball team at James Woods High.

What fake class
do they also make you teach?

-Driver's ed, right?
-No, wood shop.

Ah, that was my second guess.

Tell me, son. How would you like
to pitch for the high school team?

Baseball's the sport
people play while eating, right?

Oh, yeah. Sometimes,
I even watch a whole <i>Blacklist.</i>

I don't know.
I've never played baseball before.

Aw, come on, Chris. You gotta do it.

If you don't, you'll regret it.

Just like Jesus' friend, Evan,
who bailed on the Last Supper.

Aw, they did a paintin'?

I would've gone if I knew
they were gonna do a paintin'.

Here we are, fellas.

The future site
of Quahog's newest Italian restaurant.

Wow! This is a great location.
Can we afford this?

Sure, we can.
I set up one of those Kickstarters.

Then I realized how stupid that is,

and I went to the bank for a loan
like an adult.

Now, fellas, the tables should all be
bolted to the floor to prevent theft.

You know, most restaurants
go out of business

because people are stealing the tables.

The toilets should also
be bolted to the floor.

I think that's pretty standard,
Frank, but okay.

Great. Now let's go find
some chump's restaurant

and steal his tables and toilets.

All right, Chris!

Wow! I've never seen him
run onto a baseball field

when he wasn't chasing a duck
or being chased by a duck.

Is that a duck over there?

Ah, come on!
What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking

bringing in that fat slob?

You know what?

I bet you 100 bucks that fat slob

Ha! You're on.

(GASPS) Oh, my God! A duck!

It was a trap!

(DUCKS QUACKING)

Guys, tonight, the drinks are on me.

I just won 100 bucks
off Chris' baseball game.

Really? How'd you do that?

This dad took one look at Chris
and thought he'd suck,

but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.

I'm so proud of the money
I won bettin' on him.

You know, I'd bet there are plenty
of other baseball dads

who'd also assume Chris stinks.

Peter, we could make a lot of money.

Yeah, we could make Toni Braxton money.

Is that... Is that a lot?

It's a lot.

And then nothing.

And then a record whose proceeds
go directly to creditors.

I'll tell you what the problem is.

Every successful restaurant

That's what we're lacking.

(GASPS) No, we're not.

Frank, you're the hook!

That's right. We just need to make you

Stewie, can I talk to you?

Look, Brian, I affectionately pat
all the waiters on the arse.

(LOUDLY) And if anyone has a problem with
it, they should come to me directly!

No, no, it's not that.
I've been going through our receipts,

and we're actually losing money.

Well, yeah, duh.

Frank comps every meal.
Look, he's doing it again.

Little-known secret about Charlton Heston.

Never used toilet paper. Just drop and go.

Here, let me get that check for you.

(SIGHS)

Well, it's official.

Nobody wants to bet against Chris now.

Damn it! I can't believe my kid
isn't making money for us anymore.

I feel like Jessica Simpson's dad.

Well, there are plenty of guys willing
to bet on James Woods High to win,

I'll tell you that.

The only way we can ever
make money now is if Chris lost.

Wait a minute, Joe! That's it!

All we got to do is take those bets
and get Chris to take a dive.

(STAMMERS) Hold on, Peter.

You're gonna ask your own son
to lose on purpose?

Damn, Quagmire, your fridge
gives you water from the door?

Hey, champ, what you doin'?

My Spanish homework.

Oh, well, then maybe
I'll just say this to you in Spanish.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Chris, what the hell are you doing?

Calm down.
This is how they package Snapple now.

They're trying to trick kids
into drinking it.

You may not believe this,
but there was a time

when Snapple ruled the nation.

Preposterous!

It's true. Even Jerry Seinfeld drank it.

And he was the president of the '90s.

But why are you so down?

Dad told me I have to lose
the championship game on purpose.

He what?

Peter! Get in here right now!

Wow! Someone's day-horny.

Oh, hey, Chris.

Did you tell Chris he had to lose
the district championship?

Let me just get a garbage bag. Hold on.

Okay, now that I'm decent,

yes, I did tell Chris to throw the game,

but it's okay, it's for gambling.

What? You're betting
on Chris' baseball team?

Technically, against Chris' baseball team.

-Are you crazy?
-Do I look crazy?

What do you think
puts the food on our table

and the garbage bags on our backs?

Chris, your father's a jackass.

When you get on that field,
you try your very best and play to win.

You understand me?

Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

But, Lois, if Chris wins that game,
I'll be out a ton of money,

and I'll have to kiss a fella.

I take all kinds of bets.

Hey, Frank, we have to talk.

You've got to stop giving away
all the food for free.

Yeah, otherwise, there's no way
we're gonna make a profit.

Oh, we don't have to worry about money.

I might be doing a duets thing
with that Lady Goo-Ga.

Uh-huh. That's wrong.

Anyway, the restaurant's gonna go under
if you keep giving away food.

All right, all right.

Thank you, Frank.

I appreciate you trying it my way.

Thank you.

What was that?

Oh, I get 40 bucks every time
somebody says, "My Way."

Nancy gets $60.

What do you mean Chris won't take a dive?

We already took a ton of bets.

Look, I'm sorry, you guys,
but my hot-piece-of-ass wife says no way.

That's a weird time to brag
about your wife, Peter.

I don't know. I've just been
so horny today.

Oh, man. I don't need to know that.

Well, pull it together, Peter,
'cause we're about to lose a lot of money!

(SIGHS) I know.

We're screwed once Chris takes the mound
with that awesome arm of his.

Wait, so what you're saying is...

Chris isn't the problem, his arm is.

Yeah, I guess.

Okay, we hear you, Peter.

Loud and clear.

Yeah, we'll fix this problem.

Wait, you guys are creeping me out.

All right, I'm gonna exit
while discreetly checking out

the hot chick by the door.

You guys heard what I heard, right?

Peter just asked us to break Chris' arm.

Well, he intimated.

I don't know what that means,

but let's go rough up a teenager
for beer money!

Oh, I call biting.

Okay, there's the baseball team's
locker room right there.

Perfect.

And we look like
regular high school students,

so we'll fit right in.

Joe, are you sure about these clothes?

Trust me.

I bought the absolute latest issue
of <i>Archie Comics,</i>

and this is what the kids are wearing.

Oh, hey, fellow teens.

Wait a minute.
Teenagers don't have wheelchairs!

Ow! Ow! (SOBBING)

Okay, guys, we've served our
last free meal.

Here I go with the check.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Last time we ate here,
Mr. Sinatra's son said it was free.

Okay, uh, everyone. New policy.

As is the case with many restaurants,

you're going to have to pay for your food.

What? This food ain't worth paying for.

Yeah, the only reason we eat here
is 'cause it's free.

Look whose restaurant thinks it's so good.

Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's restaurant,
you would have paid.

(SOBBING)

Ma! I'm sorry, Ma!

Ma!

I can't believe it.

They hated us.

Well, fellas, we gave it our best shot.

If you need me,
I'll be back in Palm Springs,

which has been
completely taken over by the gays.

So, want to grab whatever wine is left
and then burn the place down?

Maybe.

But first, let's have an unearned
end-of-the-series moment,

where we turn out the lights
on our own place.

Sorry, pal. We're closed.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Peter, we've got great news.

Chris isn't playing!

He's not? Why?

Because we broke his arm
like you told us to.

Shattered. We shattered his arm.

You what? I never told you do that!

You didn't? That's what I thought I heard.

Quagmire, this is humbling.

But it may be time for all of us
to talk about hearing aids.

I feel terrible!

I gotta go find my son!

-Chris!
-Dad!

My arm's broke, and look, a Camaro!

Aw, that guy must be so boss.

But listen, Chris,
I had no idea this was gonna happen.

Look, I was wrong to bet on your games.

And it's even worse that I told
you to lose.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, that's okay, Dad.

I just feel bad that my arm is broken
in so many places and hurts so much.

Oh, Chris. I've been
a terrible dad lately.

You found something you were great at,
and instead of being happy for you,

I tried to use it to make money.

And now your arm is broken,
and your baseball career is over.

Not necessarily.

What? What are you talking about?

Well, for the last few weeks

since my right arm's
been exhausted from pitching,

my left arm's had to, uh,
pick up the slack in the bathroom.

(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

You see the pitcher? That's my kid.

Ah! Son of a bitch!

CHRIS: Oh, my God! Sorry, Mr. Quagmire.

I heard that bone break.

My ears are fine.

Well, Chris, we are very proud of you

for making it to the district
championship.

Thanks, Mom.

Ah, he was really something, Lois.

The next pitch Chris threw
hit his coach in the head,

so there was no one
to take him out of the game.

Chris walked the next 46 batters.
State record.

Wow, Chris! State record.

Yeah, they got crushed.

But at least I didn't have to pay out
all those bets and kiss a guy.

But I saw you kissing
the driver of that Camaro.

That... That... That was something else.

This doesn't feel right today.

-Yes.
-There's a rat trap in that cabinet.

With a foot in it. And somewhere
in this house there's a footless rat.

Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News
in front of the old boob tube.

(SINGING)
<i>Tommy used to work on the docks</i>

<i>Union's been on strike</i>
<i>He's down on his luck</i>

<i>It's tough, so tough</i>

-Hey.
-No.

-I wasn't sure.
-I'm sure.

-Okay.
-Well, got to go.

Got to do some more picketing.

Seriously? It's like,
nine o'clock at night.

Yeah, well... It's...

Cleveland's stealing shot glasses.

I don't like drinking Nyquil
out of 'em little cups.

Where the hell's Quagmire going?
The airport's that way.

He doesn't know we're following him, Joe.

You don't have to duck down.

I'm not. You took a pretty hard
right turn back there.

I've been like this for a while.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

What's he doing?

This is one of them places
where women go to see male strippers.

Some bisexual men go as well.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

I don't see him.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

-Ladies, this is your pilot speaking.
-(WOMEN CHEERING)

I am in the full, upright,
and locked position.

Oh, my.

Oh, my God. What are you guys doing here?

PETER: Crap. Our disguises didn't work.

Quagmire, I didn't know
you were a male stripper.

I wasn't. Not until the strike, anyway.

I've been out of work for three weeks.
I'm out of money.

I had to do something.
God, I'm so embarrassed.

Why? Stripping is a very
respectable profession.

If it weren't respectable,

why would real-estate agents
go to strip clubs for lunch?

He's right. This is tremendous.

Are you banging all these chicks?

Hey, hey. That is offensive.

I am a dancer, not a gigolo.

Captain Cockpit,
my friend is about to get married,

and we were wondering if you'd have
sex with her for $500?

I'm a gigolo.

Oh, hey, it's that guy.

Are you gonna say,
"Who else but Quagmire"?

(CLEARS THROAT)

No, I...

Wanted to know if Quagmire
was available tomorrow evening?

(STUTTERS) Are you gay?

Of course not. No. I...

But I am unable to properly
have sex with my wife,

so, I figured, you know...

Who else but Quagmire.

Hey, awesome cameo.

Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.
Had to stop at the dry cleaner.

The dry cleaner?
Wow, somebody's struck it rich.

You know, I got to tell you.
I was sweating that pilot strike.

But now that I'm a gigolo,
I'm making money by the fistful.

-Is that a giggity?
-That is a giggity.

Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice

you got some dry cleaning hanging up
in the backseat of your car.

-Did you win the lottery?
-No.

Well, I hope you're not
actually doing that gigolo thing.

You know, prostitution is illegal.

No, no. It's something else.

Quagmire is selling
online Internet cyber stuff.

Well, good for you, Quagmire.

(LAUGHS)

You and Gates, huh?

(MOBILE VIBRATES)

Jeez, I got to go home
and change into my Tarzan costume.

(STUTTERS) For the web.

Huh. I got to get a computer.

Excuse me.
How many BTUs does this grill have?

Oh, man, that puppy,
more than you need, less than I want.

Excuse me, do you
have a small grocery cart

I could put this
boat-sized hunk of lumber in?

Probably out in the parking lot.

Can you tell me
where I can find extension cords?

-Aisle 25.
-I was just there.

-Twenty-six.
-There is no 26.

Fifteen.

-So, Gobi gets up on the lift.
-Don't mind me.

Just grabbing myself a cup of mud.
I like mine black.

Black as night.

Black as sin.
Know what I'm sayin'? (CHUCKLES)

Haven't introduced myself.
Guys in my crew call me "the Ratchet."

Brian, it's not your break.
Get out there and help the customers.

"Brian"? Who are you, my father? This guy.

-Get out there.
-Yes, sir.

That guy's got no idea
how hard I'm working...

Bird! A bird got in. Awesome.

(CELLO PLAYS)

(MOBILE RINGING)

PETER: Hello? Hey, Quagmire.
What's going on?

Oh, you need a ride? Yeah, sure.

I can come and get you.
I'm not doing anything.

-(FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING)
-(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

Meg, that was the last guy.
So, just lock up when you are done.

Thanks for the ride.

One of my tricks drove
me here from the Clam,

and I didn't have any money for a cab.

Why not? Didn't she just pay you for sex?

No. After it was over,
she said she wasn't gonna pay.

Well, that ain't fair.

You can't let these women
take advantage of you like that.

What apartment is she in?
I'll go talk to her.

She's in Unit 17.

You know, if you're going back in
anyway, can you grab my belt?

It's reversible, so I'd hate to lose it.

PETER: Hey. You didn't pay my friend.

So, I'm gonna play with your doorbell
until you pay up.

(DOORBELL RINGING CONTINUOUSLY)

WOMAN: Stop it!

PETER: I can do this all day.
I love buttons.

WOMAN: Fine! Here's your money!

Here you go.

Peter, this is amazing. Thank you.

Hey, you know what?

Here's a little something
for your trouble.

You're giving me a cut?

-Wow! Thanks.
-No problem.

It's just too bad you're not here
every time.

Well, I could be.
I mean, my days are pretty open.

And I don't sleep a lot at night
'cause of health stuff.

Huh, that'd be kind of nice, actually.

Maybe you could drive me around
and help me out

and I could even pay you
a little something for your time.

Sure. That sounds great.

You know what, it'll be nice to have a

little extra cash to bet on college
football.

Yeah, I'd like to bet 100 bucks.

-You wanna pick a team?
-No, just take it.

-I thought you had the day off.
-Maybe from the store.

But it's not like things take
a day off from

needing repairs. Am I right? (CHUCKLES)

Oh, looks like this cabinet door
is a good place to start.

Yep. She's off-kilter.
I'm gonna have to plane her down.

Lois, what year was this house built?

I don't know. Maybe 1945?

Good. It's grandfathered in.
I thought I'd need a variance.

Don't want to get a code vi. (CHUCKLES)

"Vi" is violation. Code is just code.

I don't know, Brian.
It looks straight to me.

-What?
-It's straight.

I don't know what that means.
"It's straight?"

Oh, you mean "plum."
You're saying the door is plum.

Wow, Brian. You do know all the lingo.

Oh, come on.
It's just stuff you pick up on the side.

I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig

a shim-jam strap hinge,
quarter-round-saw off

a two-by-six
dowel cherry picker flimflam.

You know, Rupert, Brian's douchiness
should infuriate me,

but the truth is, he seems happy.

So I guess I'll just do nothing
and that's that.

Can't do it. Let's get him fired.

Oh, hey, Peter. Listen,
I can't work tonight. I'm spent.

That last trick was like trying to use
an empty bottle of hand soap.

PETER: <i>But you got to work.</i>
<i>I set up five appointments.</i>

<i>-That's a lot of money.</i>
-Sorry, I can't do it.

You're just gonna have to cancel them.

What the hell did you say to me?

-Peter, what are you doing?
-You tripping, boy?

You're going out
if I tell you you're going out, bitch.

Okay. But what's in your pimp cup?

It's actually a wheatgrass-ginger mixture.

I was in the middle of a cleanse.

I didn't know we'd be doing
this pimp thing

but I made a promise to my body.

(SLURPS) Ahhh!

Not great.

Peter, what you doing all dressed
up for church? This ain't Easter.

Oh, Cleveland.
These are my work clothes.

-You're hosting <i>Family Feud?</i>
-No, I'm a pimp.

Big Pete, if we're gonna be sitting,
may I use my penis donut?

Bitch, I don't care.

Dang, Quagmire. You're lucky.
He take care of you?

Yeah. No, no. It's great.

I'm making a lot of money.
I'm actually really happy.

I'm actually very hungry.

Nobody is gonna want you if you're fat.

You wanna eat, get up to that bar
and earn your keep.

What should I ask for, 500?

You're not worth that much.
You're trash. Ask for two.

You know I hit you and whore you out
because I love you, right?

Hi there. You wanna party?

And can I have some of your bread?

Hi, handsome. You can't have my bread.

But you can have something
of mine that smells like bread.

(GASPS)

-Okay, let's go.
-Just so you know,

it takes me a long time.

All right, Rupert. If we're going
to teach Brian a lesson,

we're going to need some muscle.

You, you, and you, 20 bucks

No.

(SINGING) <i>You raise me up</i>

Okay, if you had a friend
who worked at Mega Hardware,

how would you get him fired?

You ask him for papers.

Okay, good. That, unfortunately,
won't work in this instance.

But I like your effort, Luis.
Any other ideas?

You could kill a guy.

You know what, Carlos,
you stay quiet for a while.

I really only need two of you.

-You'll still be paid.
-You ask for papers.

Okay, is there any idea out there

besides killing a guy
or getting someone deported?

We do good job, we live with you?

Well, you just offered to kill a guy,

so you're not exactly number one
on my roommate list.

Now, let's go. I paid good money
for you. I need answers.

I want your best and I won't stand
for even one more stupid idea.

You shake a boss's soda, and give to him.

When he open it, it explode.

This is why I pushed you.

Huh, I guess that Brian Griffin
is a good egg after all.

would you want your son to be a hooker?

My answer is always, "Hey, lady,
are we talking or am I beefing you?"

PETER: I kinda wanna see
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

but I also kind of feel like
there might be scary parts.

Hey, honey. You're shopping for groceries?

You know what that means?

Shopping for groceries is what I say
instead of, "Do you wanna pay me for sex?"

So, I can't get arrested.

Stewie, did you hire three Mexican guys

to shake a soda can and give
it to my boss?

What?

One's Guatemalan.

-Damn it, Stewie. You got me fired.
-Who you kidding? You got yourself fired,

parading around there, pretending
you know the first thing about tools.

You know what, you're going down there
with me right now

to tell them what you did.

Get your hands off me.
I'll go floppy dead weight on you.

(GRUNTS)

Oh, crap. My stomach.
I think my hernia ruptured.

-Oh, my God.
-Damn it, it's bad. It's bad.

I'll get Lois.
She can take you to the hospital.

No, she can't. Thanks to you,
I don't have insurance anymore.

What are we gonna do?
I'll get the gun.

-No, Stewie. You have to fix me.
-What? I'm not a doctor.

Just look it up on your phone
or something.

(SCOFFS) Hold on. I have gotta update iOS.

Stewie!

Okay, okay. Got it.

It says I have to make an incision,
retract the hernia sac

and then suture the abdominal lining.
How am I supposed to do that?

Grab my tool belt. Use the
self-sharpening linoleum blade.

(BRIAN SCREAMS)

And then hold the incision
open with a vice grip.

And use the slip joint pliers
to get the muscle back in position.

Okay. Okay, now it's saying
I have to suture it.

I've got some monofilament
line you can use.

It's from aisle eight,
above the chains and cables.

Monofilament lines? Slip joint pliers?
I got to say, Brian,

it seems like you really did learn
something on that job.

You're right. I guess I did.

But please, stitch me up.

Just be careful and take your time.

-This is the delicate part, because...
-Yeah. I'm gonna just use the staple gun.

(SCREAMS) Damn it!

You know what, that was really easy.

That guy who killed Joan Rivers
must be terrible at this.

Hey, there. Oh. What are you doing here?

(STUTTERS) Quagmire? I have a hobby
that takes me this way.

Hey, I'm freezing.
You got a blanket in there or something?

I got a towel. But it's wet
because I'm eating peaches.

I lied about the hobby. I was sinning.

I'm going to drive away backwards now.

-Hey, baby. You wanna party?
-Get in.

You guys having a good night?

I like that it's getting dark earlier.

What are you guys gonna be for Halloween?

Big Pete, help.
She want to do German things.

German things!

What? No! He hasn't eaten anything
in days. It's not gonna work.

(WOMAN GRUNTS)

<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

(ALL GRUNTING)

She's got us both.
Help us, pimps and hos!

Help us, HBO camera crew!

God, Quagmire, most of that was horrible.

I know. Eventually,
I might want to try it again.

Hey, listen, buddy.
I'm sorry about all this.

I guess I just got caught up
in the money and...

And assumed you were okay
with it because of the sex.

I don't know. Peter.
I think you're just mad

I didn't come to see
your Pretenders cover band.

Yes, well, that may be.

Speaking of which, the Pretend-Pretenders
are playing again this weekend.

Much like the real band,
we have been described as "meh".

Still, I'm really sorry.

Can you find it in yourself to forgive me

and maybe we can just
go back to being friends?

I'd like that.

Hopefully the pilots' strike will end soon
and I can get my old job back.

Oh, the strike ended a month ago.

-What? Why didn't you tell me?
-I did.

Are you still GlenQten-at-aol.com?

-No!
-Ah. Well, there you go.

Well, I'm glad Quagmire's
back to work for the airline

and that whole gigolo
and pimping thing is over.

You knew about that?

You know what, you were sticking
to your cleanse, so I didn't really care.

I got to hand it to you, Brian.

You are a better blue-collar
guy than I expected.

-You finally earned this nice, cold beer.
-Thanks, Stewie.

Nice work, Pedro.

Let us know if you want us to kill a guy.

-Okay.
-It could be anyone.

Got it. You have no idea
how hard they tried to pierce my ears.

We've got to return to the 21st century.

Uh, we can't go into the time machine
right now.

But they're going to kill us all!

All right, all right. Just one second.

So, how was your weekend?

(STAMMERS) Is it your line?

I don't... Uh, no, I don't think so.

-(STAMMERS) I'm sorry. Whose line is it?
-MAN: Cut!

That was Peter's line. Where's Peter?

Sorry, I was in my trailer
eatin' fancy nuts and smokin'.

(SIGHS) All right, everybody, take five.

Okay. I'll be in my dressing room,
playing online poker.

That's me asking for help.

Hi, I'm James Woods.

You might know me from
banging your niece

on the pile of your
brother's pool equipment.

Or from <i>Salvador.</i>

But tonight, I'm here to take you

behind the scenes on the set
of <i>Family Guy.</i>

For the first time ever, you'll see
what a typical production week is like

for TV's 11th favorite family.

So, please join me
as we go <i>Inside Family Guy.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, it's certainly not easy
being a family

that also happens to star
in a sitcom together.

Especially last year,
when I discovered those naked pictures

of that 18-year-old intern
on Peter's phone.

But he explained that his phone number

was the old number of...
Of her ex-boyfriend, so...

What was it again?
Oh, the cloud. That's right.

So, the photos were on the cloud
and that the cloud pulled the pictures.

I mean, even if the pictures
had not been sent directly to him

and that's why he has them,

and we both called the Apple Store
and they said they can't disprove

that it doesn't happen, so, here we are.

Still married. Still on the show.

(STUTTERS) And it's happened
five times since then,

and some of the pictures had
both Peter and the girl in them.

Being on this show reminds me
of one of my favorite quotes from <i>Macbeth.</i>

-JAMES WOODS: What's the quote?
-(CHUCKLES) Whoa.

I didn't realize this was a trial.
Objection, Your Honor.

Oh, yeah, it's great. You know,
doing a show with your family.

'Cause what guy doesn't wanna go
to his office and have his family there?

You know, and then you go home after work
and catch up with the family.

And then, uh, next day, same thing.

Just trying to make it to the weekend,

so you can, uh,
spend some time with the family.

Isn't that the dream?

JAMES WOODS: Now, I, I understand

the show was quite different
when it started.

Yeah, in the original pilot,
I was actually the star.

It was called Chris Griffin, Teen Doctor.

-Sir, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
-(MONITOR BEEPING)

Well, it can't be any worse
than what's in here.

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

I ad-libbed that line.
I wasn't even supposed to talk.

What they didn't know is that

I'd been privately doing jokes
about the newspaper for years.

But, you know, it's not just
the Griffins who work hard

to make <i>Family Guy</i> what it is.

Here in the props department,

some sweaty guy is working
on the Petercopter.

That's right. You know,
a lot of people don't realize

SEAL Team Six actually
completed their mission in this puppy.

Oh, cool! <i>Family Guy!</i>
Over here! I'm down here!

Knock-knock.

-Yeah?
-Hi, Stewie.

(STUTTERS) I was just showing the viewers
around <i>Family Guy,</i>

and we thought we'd drop in
and talk to you about the show.

You wanna talk about the show?

I'll talk about the show. The show sucks.

The only reason I stay here
is to maintain my profile

for my start-up business,
Discreetcrepe.com.

Hi, are you a straight adult male
who likes to eat crepes

without people making unwanted
assumptions about your private life?

Go to Discreetcrepe.com.

Place your order, and within 30 minutes...

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Very masculine pizza delivery
for Stewie Griffin.

Oh, thank you.

Mmm, strawberry-banana Nutella
with raspberry drizzle.

Now I just need a guy's butt to eat
this off of, and I got myself a night.

But of course, every episode
of <i>Family Guy</i> starts with the writing.

And here we are,
the <i>Family Guy</i> writers' room.

Where the writers are hard at work
with the show's talented cast.

Look don't get me wrong, guys,
I, I think it's hilarious,

and I totally get that the sex thing
is what made me popular, but...

Would it kill us to just once
tell a joke that brings glory to God?

Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant

where he was spying on ladies
peeing in the bathroom.

As part of the class-action settlement,

he entered rehab
and that's where he found Jesus.

The restaurant was called Sprinklers.
That should have been a tip off.

He still runs Dumpies,
but I'm pretty sure that one's legit.

JAMES WOODS: <i>As the star of the show,</i>

<i>Peter likes to stay involved</i>
<i>in the writing process.</i>

All right, butthorns.
Which one of you idiots wrote this script?

Uh, I did.

Oh, what'd you write it, like,
on a computer?

Yeah.

-So, you know a lot about computers?
-(STUTTERS) Yeah.

Can you show me how to turn off
the flashlight on my phone?

-(BEEPS)
-Don't touch my phone!

And another thing,
I read this piece of garbage script.

It's only one page.
That's never gonna cut it!

Uh, that's just the cover.
You can turn the page, like this.

Well, why are you hiding all these pages
behind the first page?

What's wrong with them?

Stand by your work or get out!
Now, spit in each other's mouths.

You know I'm only tough on you
'cause I hate you, right?

Yeah, over the years,
Peter's become just a total nightmare.

I mean, you know, he's not Jim Belushi.

He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set,
which is, like, a totally real thing.

(STUTTERS) But he's pretty bad.

Dad refuses to interact
with any actors on set.

He'll only rehearse with helium balloons
with crudely drawn faces on them.

I'm sorry, Meg, but you're grounded.

MEG: <i>But, Dad, the prom is tonight. Over.</i>

-(STATIC)
-LOIS: <i>You heard your father, Meg. Over.</i>

-(STATIC)
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

JOE: <i>Peter, are you ready to hit</i>
<i>The Drunken Clam?</i>

<i>-Over.</i>
-(STATIC)

It's difficult having to give up
my chair for the balloon.

Well, that's the business we call show.

MAN: Excuse me, Joe.

The fat man's behavior has been
deteriorating for quite some time,

and I think someone may have placed

an anonymous phone call
to the network about it.

(STEWIE SPEAKING IN FALSETTO)

Word around the stage is,
they've decided to finally fire Peter

and replace him with another actor.

And this time, it's permanent.

Not like when we killed off
Brian for a few episodes,

so he could shoot that crappy movie.
What was it?

It was a remake of <i>Old Yeller,</i>

where the dog gets the drop on him
and kills him first.

I'm sorry.

No. I'm sorry.

(GRUNTING)

They miscalculated the number of dogs
who buy movie tickets.

It's actually pretty awkward.

I mean, Dad's the only one
in the whole production

who doesn't know he's being fired.

But he'll find out tomorrow
at the table read.

This is how we did that.
Bet you didn't know.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

The table read is where
the <i>Family Guy</i> cast reads aloud

that week's script, to see how
the story and the jokes are working.

And where Peter will learn
he's being written off the show.

Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read
for this week's episode

entitled, "Peter Dies,
We're Really Serious,

"No Joke,
He's Dead and Never Coming Back."

Oh, and there's other pages,
you gotta turn them.

Here, let me show you.

"Interior: Griffin's living room.
Day. Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.

"Lois enters upset."

"You guys, I have terrible news.
Your father is dead.

"He was shot in the head
while killing himself.

"I suppose he had his demons
and his enemies."

Wait, I'm... I'm what?

Oh, oh, I know. Stewie's gonna fire up
his time machine and undo this.

-DIRECTOR: "Stewie enters."
-"Brian, bad news.

"My time machine got a virus that causes
Dad to die again if it's ever used."

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Oh, well, you know what,

-I bet this is all Chris' dream.
-"Wow, I am wide awake."

(STUTTERS)
Okay, but there's no way this is real.

They'd have to bring in someone
to replace me.

"Uncle Ricky, played by
sitcom buzzard David Spade, enters."

-"Hi, everybody."
-ALL: "Uncle Ricky!"

"Hey, guys. The time period called,
they want an object back."

(ALL LAUGH)

"Aw, do we have to go to Dad's funeral?

"Let's just play with Uncle Ricky
instead."

"The family cheers.
They do not miss Peter."

I'm sorry, Peter,

but the production just can't deal
with all your nonsense anymore.

-We're letting you go.
-Oh, please don't do this.

I'm begging you,
just give me one more chance.

(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

-(BLEEP)
-All right. That's it. You're fired!

And you guys are all okay with this?

I'm sorry, sweetheart.

This is painful for all of us,
but we just don't see another option.

(STAMMERS) Yeah, Peter, we love you
and you're still part of the family.

Just not part of the show.

Look, I don't know who brought this on,
but maybe it's for the best.

All right, fine! You bastards can fire me,
but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.

Have a good life, Mr. G.
Your penis is out.

Welcome back to <i>Inside Family Guy.</i>

I'm your host and angel investor
to The Fappening, James Woods.

Boy, we picked quite a week to document
the production of a <i>Family Guy</i> episode.

Yesterday, Peter Griffin
was fired from the show

and replaced by David Spade.

Given the surprising development,
we decided to follow Peter

and see if our cameras
could capture his story as well.

<i>We caught up with Peter at Hollywood's</i>
<i>legendary Chateau Marmont Hotel,</i>

<i>where I once engaged in the consensual</i>
<i>murder of an underage prostitute.</i>

So, what's your plan? Are you going
to be staying here for a while?

Yeah, well, I figured if my family
doesn't want me on the show,

there's no reason
I should keep living with them.

I... I mean, there's no hard feelings.
Um, I just feel like this is best for me

and this is best for those cancerous
dicks.

JAMES WOODS: And what's next
for Peter Griffin?

Well, starting tomorrow,
I'm getting back out there.

I already got an audition to be
the caring dad for a Cheerios commercial.

-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah, bud?

When you were a kid, what did you
want to be when you grew up?

Well, I wanted to be a rockstar.

Why didn't you become one?

'Cause of you, bud.

I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store

and now, here I am,
stuck eating cereal for dinner with a kid.

You'll always be a rockstar to me, Dad.

You ruined my life.

I'm going to bed.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Wednesdays are rehearsal days
here at <i>Family Guy.</i>

And the first rehearsal with David Spade
appears to be going very well.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

"Uncle Ricky, what are all these
strippers doing in our house?"

"Uh, each other."

Hmm?

(LAUGHS)

Oh, my God! I'm sorry, I just...
(LAUGHING)

Did you see the way he smirked?
He's like a naughty 53-year-old boy!

Who is this guy?
I'm not familiar with him.

-That's David Spade from <i>Just Shoot Me.</i>
-I don't know that one.

He was in <i>Grown Ups, Joe Dirt,</i>
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

-Saturday what how?
-(BEEPS)

He was also in some movie
called <i>Senseless.</i>

With Marlon Wayans? Oh, yeah!
He played Scott Thorpe!

-(BEEPING)
-Donna, I'm here with Scott Thorpe!

That's right! From <i>Senseless.</i>

Yeah, I gotta be honest.
I'm having a blast.

You know, now that
I'm not tied down by the show,

it's given me more time
to pursue my true passion.

Weaving sexually explicit tapestries
featuring the Minions.

Did you have any questions
about the artist?

Thursdays at <i>Family Guy</i> are reserved
for shooting all those flashbacks

and cutaway gags we love so much.

And what most people don't know

is that all these gags
are directed by James Cameron.

What's that? I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)

Apparently, I misread the cue card.

They're directed by James, the cameraman.

Tell us, how did you get the gig?

I sold Vicodin to some of the producers.

What a wonderful Hollywood story.

You know, many viewers think
our cutaways are just whipped together,

but they actually go through
a rigorous testing process before filming.

This is the planet Jew-piter
and he could say,

"Next year is my star mitzvah."

(LAUGHS)

They love it. Tell the director.
Where is he?

It says don't take it with alcohol.
But you should take it with alcohol.

Yeah, duh. I also need a couple
for the girl I'm babysitting.

<i>Meanwhile, David Spade</i>
<i>is making lots of friends on set.</i>

Yeah, I'll definitely talk to the writers.

I agree, there's a lot about
your character that's still untapped.

Okay, thank you. Because like, yes,
I'm greased up and, yes, I'm deaf.

-But what else am I?
-Totally.

-Thanks, man.
-DIRECTOR: Okay, we're ready for you.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I'll be right there.

Who's the new kid?

Hot chihuahua!

Unfortunately, things aren't going
quite so well for Peter.

-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-(BEEPS)

Yeah, it's an '09, fully loaded,
extra cool AC. Great.

(CHUCKLES)
I just made 500 flippin' a Honda.

All I did was Armor All the dash. Boom.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

Hey, any mail for me?

Yes, your death threats to Grimace
have all been returned.

Well, has the Shamrock Shake
period been extended?

I believe that's still seasonal,

but while I have you,
your bill remains unpaid.

And we saw you selling our robes on eBay.

I'm afraid we're evicting you
from the hotel.

What's your home address?

I'm sorry, sir. Now, do you
wanna leave the regular way

or do you want our Uncle Phil
to throw you out?

I think you know what I want.

-(SHOUTS)
-(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGH)

(SIRENS WAILING IN THE DISTANCE)

(HINGES CREAKING)

Door was unlocked. I'm sure that's fine.

Well, this seems like
a really cheery place, and...

Looks like some guy
named Brooks was here

and I think this is gonna
work out just great.

JAMES WOODS: You don't miss your show
or your family at all?

Of course I miss my family.

But everything comes to an end eventually,
and you just...

You just gotta keep moving forward.

-Are you gonna be all right?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

In fact, I was just about to melt
some cheese on chips

if you wanna stay for a sad,
single guy dinner.

You're going oven or microwave?

Uh, microwave. I don't know
how to turn on the oven.

Those, uh, chips are gonna
be chewy, Peter.

Friday night is tape night here
at <i>Family Guy.</i>

But tonight, they'll be filming
the show without Peter Griffin.

I have to admit, it's a little strange
taping a show without Peter.

It, it just doesn't feel right.

I'm especially going to miss
the fat man's bit with the audience,

where he fires the T-shirt cannon
at his own head.

You know he once tried to hold up
a store with that thing?

(BELL JINGLES)

All right, everybody on the floor.
Empty the register!

-Please don't do this.
-Oh, yeah? You wanna be a hero?

Here's what happens to heroes.

Anybody else want to be a hero?

Ooh, me, me, me! Over here! Over here!

And with regard to Peter's replacement,

well, as his parents
and previous co-stars have learned,

a little of David Spade goes a long way.

David, the line is,
"What's for dinner?" Go again.

What's for dinner? Hmm?

(SIGHS) Okay, we can trim that in editing.

He's getting on people's nerves.

I mean, there's only so many jars
I can open for one man.

DAVID: Lois, I want pickles!

Coming!

He has tiny hands.

But when one of my rings went
down the drain, he got it right out.

JAMES WOODS: <i>Meanwhile, Peter has</i>
<i>wound up here at the Chinese theater</i>

<i>where panhandlers dress up</i>
<i>like iconic movie characters</i>

<i>and charge tourists for photos.</i>

<i>It's even seedier than it sounds.</i>

Step right up, get your picture taken
with beloved comic icon,

Little Lotta, just two dollars.

-Who are you?
-Uh, Little Lotta.

-She was friends with Audrey and Dot.
-Never heard of her.

(SIGHS)

(BRAKES SCREECHING)

That's it. Screw this.

I am taking back my TV show
and my family.

Ah, we just missed her.

Hey, Smitty. I'm here to get my show back.

I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin,
but we have specific orders

-not to let you onto the lot.
-Seriously?

Well, I suppose you could come inside
if you had an idea for a show

the heads of the network wanted to buy.

<i>Bumbler with a Tumblr.</i>

So, you see, he's got a Tumblr account
and he's clumsy.

We really like the idea
that the words rhyme.

Absolutely, but just a thought.

What if he doesn't bumble?

Um, I... I guess so.

And are we married to the Tumblr account?

The bought the pitch,
but, um, after a series of network notes,

Bumbler with a Tumblr eventually
aired as <i>Bamblr with a Famblr.</i>

Which made sense to nobody
and is now in its third season.

It did also get me on the lot.

All right, stop the show!

-Dad!
-That's right, I'm back.

And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt

of Kermit the Frog acting like
a hip-hop guy.

That's so dope.

Don't put it on. It'll fall apart.

But listen, everybody,
I realized something.

I've been a real jerk.

To you guys and to all the union fat asses

that I assume do something
to keep this thing going.

The fact is, I got too big
for my britches.

But I know now
that I'm nothing without all of you.

Oh, that's nice of you to say.

Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand.

And if you guys can find it
in your hearts to take me back,

well, then I promise that every day,
I'll prove to you how much the show

and how much my family means to me.

Aw, Peter. Of course we'll take you back.

-Oh, welcome back, buddy.
-We missed you so much.

My online poker problem
is burning like a wildfire.

-Well, there's only one problem.
-What's that?

What are we gonna do about David Spade?

Don't worry, I already took care of that.

I got Sofia Vergara deported.

-(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)
-Hey, everyone, cuchi, cuchi.

I'm your mother now.

So, all right. Let's do a show.

Oh, wait, if my character's still alive,

that means we don't have
a script to shoot.

Oh, look at this.

We just happen to have
a whole extra script right here.

"Pete, Don't Fail Me Now."

(GASPS) Sounds like I might be a teacher.

Oh, I have a goatee up till

the first commercial, and then
I'm a teacher.

Every week Peter becomes a diva.

So, the writers
write a fake script killing him off.

He storms out, then by Friday's taping

comes crawling back
and we shoot the real script.

Of course, he always forgets by Monday

and then he becomes
a pain in the ass again.

Does it bother me
that he does this every week?

Uh, why don't you ask my Camaro?

(ALL CHEERING)

JAMES WOODS: <i>So, I guess this actually</i>
<i>was a very typical week</i>

<i>on the set of</i> Family Guy.

<i>Thanks for joining us.</i>

<i>I'm James Woods,</i>

<i>and we'll close tonight with a supercut</i>
<i>of every time in the show's history</i>

<i>with a bag of nickels.</i>

Ow!

Damn it!

(GRUNTS) Oh!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Why?

Hey, Lois, you should do that thing
that I like... (SCREAMS)

Hey, kids, have you seen my wallet?
Oh, nickels!

Son of a bitch!

<i>Uh, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have now reached our cruising...</i>

-(NICKELS SMASH)
<i>-Ah, damn it!</i>

Boy, can't beat this weather...
(SHOUTS) Who is that kid?

-(MACHINE BEEPS)
-(GRUNTS)

Hello? Uh, hang on, I'll check.

Phone call for a bag of nickels...
(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)

At least he was alone.
They usually travel in threes.

Ow! Crap!

(VOCALIZING)

Ah, nickels!

(GRUNTS)

(GROANING)

Oh, damn it!

Do you think I'm ever gonna be
able to have... (GRUNTS)

Peter, I need you
to take Chris and Meg to school.

Today's the day I finally kill
that squirrel

that's been eating our tomatoes.

Try to get like eight of them this time,
I wanna make bruschetta.

Oh, can't the kids just walk?

You know I like to watch
two full movies before I go to work.

No, Peter, they can't walk.
It's three miles.

(SIGHS) Fine, I'll take 'em.

But you better keep those goggles

'cause I'm gonna put them
to good use tonight.

Once the floor is full of saw dust,
we can eat peanuts in here.

Dad, are you sure it's okay
that we took Brian's car?

Yeah, it's his own fault.

He's the one who keeps his key
in the visor

like a carefree hillbilly.

Okay, everybody out. I don't want
the cool kids to know I'm your dad.

Hey, Chris, guess who I just scored
as my date to the homecoming dance?

Vice Principal McGuire.

-Really?
-Yeah, her husband just died of ALS.

So, she is ready to get at it.

-Hey there, strong guy.
-Not now, Brenda.

She says I have the body of
a 50-year-old before it gets ALS.

So, who you gonna go with?

I was thinking of asking Cara Morris.

Why don't you ask her now?
Her locker's right over there.

Um, yeah, okay.

Hi, Cara.

I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go
to the homecoming dance with me.

Oh, hi, Robot from <i>Big Hero 6.</i>
No, but thank you.

His name is Baymax, you gorgeous moron!

All right, red light. Time to text and
shave and whittle and floss.

Thanks for getting here so quickly.

-What?
-I'm sorry, you're in a Prius.

I just assumed you're my Uber.

I don't know what that is
on account of being dull.

Uber. It's like a cab except it feels like
a game 'cause it's from your phone.

Anyway, I'm late for a meeting.

Can I just give you 20 bucks
to drop me off?

Wow, 20 bucks
just to drive you across town?

Maybe I should be an Uber driver.
I mean, I could use the extra money.

And it's gotta be an easier
than when I was delivering pizzas.

All right, push, push, come on.
Come on, almost there.

Almost there, just one more push.
Here it is.

Oh, it's half Hawaiian.

-I believe that's ours.
-You poor fool.

(STRAINING)

-Hey, Stewie.
-What's up, big guy?

None of the girls in school
want to go to homecoming with me.

Probably 'cause everyone calls me names

like big nips and fat nips
and big fat nips.

Oh, don't listen to them, big fat nips,
they're just being haters.

What's a hater?

Oh, it's just something people say instead
of working to change their own flaws.

Anyway, you just gotta do what
Taylor Swift does and <i>Shake It Off.</i>

Who is Taylor Swift?

Oh, my God.

Am I about to introduce you
to Taylor Swift?

What is she? A singer?

She's much more
than a singer, Chris. She's...

Uh, she's, she's the queen.

A goddess, a gazelle
in a high waisted swimsuit.

Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane
nor clowns nor a posse,

-I'm not interested.
-I have an idea.

You should ask Taylor Swift
to the homecoming dance.

What? Why would she go
to a dance with me?

I'm telling you, this is exactly
the kind of thing she would do.

She's such a sweetheart.
Oh, I'm going limp.

Oh, I'm just gonna lie here, moaning.
Thinking about Taylor Swift.

(MOANING)

Tay-Tay.

How would I even ask her?

It's easy.
You and I will just make a video

about how sad you are and put it online.

She's very interactive with all her fans.

I guess it's worth a shot.

Of course it is.
If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone.

Just like you did on New Year's eve.

Three, two, one.

Some animals give me boners.

<i>(AULD LANG SYNE</i> PLAYING)

Hi, I'd like to be an Uber driver.

Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.

Don't I... Don't I need to fill out
a form?

Oh, right, yeah, of course.

"Name." Peter Griffin. "Criminal history."

"This section is optional,"
I will skip this. And done.

-Here you go.
-Yeah, none of this really matters.

All I need to know is,
do you have a car, a phone, and a face?

It's my dog's car.

Oh, and I know you didn't ask,
but I am quick to anger.

Okay, great. Now, get out there and
try to kiss as many ladies as you can.

The record is 60 in a month.
You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.

(PHONE RINGING)

(TALKING GIBBERISH)

(WHIMSICAL MONTAGE MUSIC PLAYING)

This is some good stuff, Chris.
I think it's ready to post.

Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.
I made my own video and posted it.

What? How could you do that?

Stewie, I didn't wanna do
all that fancy stuff.

So, I just did a video of me
speaking from the heart.

You know, telling her
how much it would mean

if a girl like her went
to homecoming with a guy like me.

I couldn't even stay awake
during that description.

(PHONE BUZZING)

-Hey, she already posted a response.
-What?

<i>Hey, Chris Griffin.</i>

<i>I just saw your video</i>

<i>All right, I gotta go eat an ice cream</i>

Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

Uh-oh. This means
I have an awkward phone call to make.

What? No, it was stupid.
What two guys going to homecoming?

I, I assumed it was a goof
this whole time.

Wow, Chris. I'm so excited.

You actually have a date

Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?
Can I wear grandpa's jacket now?

I don't know why you always ask for that.
That's, that's not a thing in our family.

Oh, Rupert. I can't believe Taylor Swift
is actually going to be at our house.

I haven't been this excited
since I abused those caffeine pills

to get ready for the big show.

Everything will be fine
as long as I take one of these.

Pills! You actually are taking drugs?

-Stewie, give me those.
-I can't, Zack, I need them to sing.

Hi, Peter Griffin, leering dad.
Quick question, in <i>Shake It Off,</i>

you invite us to get down
to, quote, "This sick beat."

Yet the beat you then provide
is rather mild.

My question is this. May I lick your legs?

Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin.
I'm your biggest fan.

I don't mean it like a psycho. I just...
I'm not, I'm not a psycho.

Oh, you're a cutie.

Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.
Now, you don't have to say anything.

I'm just gonna slowly pull out
this tape measure

and you indicate when I should stop.

Okay, here I go.

Still going.

Still going.

Oh, my God. You bitch, seriously?

Taylor, this is my sister, Meg,
and our dog, Brian.

Nice to meet you both.

We're not all so impressed.
I've met Dan Aykroyd.

I'm sorry, uh, which cast member
of <i>Hee Haw</i> are you?

Will you be nice?

Okay, well, we should probably go.

It was so nice to meet you all
except for the girl and the dog.

Sorry about my family.

Don't apologize. They seem nice.

Well, you wouldn't say that
if you ever saw us in the movies.

All right, we got our popcorn from home,

our soda from home,
a snacks from home, and <i>Braveheart.</i>

(MUSIC BLARING FROM LAPTOP)

-Where ya headed?
-The airport.

Great, just a couple of errands
and we'll get you there.

(INAUDIBLE)

That was one bitch of a class.

-Anyways, what time's your flight?
-It's in 20 minutes.

Oh, boy, I can't make it in 20 minutes.
I better call you a Lyft.

Come on, hurry up. Get in.

I hope you like <i>The Offspring.</i>

Let's go.

(SOFT '80s MUSIC PLAYING)

-Oh, my God. Taylor Swift.
-She's here with him?

You guys, Mr. Bule is taking
a door-open duke in the bathroom.

I hope this isn't too boring for you.

No, this is so cool.

I always sing about high school

but I've never actually seen
one in person.

(FASTER MUSIC PLAYS)

Would you like to dance?

Sure, but you're gonna have to
stand back like five and a half feet.

Cool, you dance like
an unattended fire hose.

Wow, it's like your dance
tells a whole story.

Right? You're the only one
who's ever gotten that.

Usually people just shove a wallet
in my mouth and call 911.

You know, Chris, I'm having a great time.

You're so cool and down to earth.

I like you, too, Taylor.

I was scared meeting a celebrity,
but you're so nice and normal.

I feel totally comfortable around you.

Well, why don't you just kiss her,
Griffin?

Sorry, I just smoked a joint
with the pickup truck kids.

That was really fun, Chris.

I hope you don't mind
I made the band pay me a royalty

-for each of my songs they played.
-Of course not.

And I hope you didn't mind I showed you
who every locker belongs to.

No, I thought that was nice.
I've never had a locker.

I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.

-Can I finger you?
-Sure.

"Hi, I'm Taylor Swift.
I'm famous but I'm really nice."

Aw. That's one of the best fingerings
I've ever had.

What are you working on there, Chris?

Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor
of some of her favorite things.

Here's flowers and crop tops

and pictures of Kanye West
with his mouth shut.

Wow, you two seem to have
a wonderful connection.

We do, Mom. You know, she's the first girl
to ever really understand me.

Uh, you guys, you might want to see
this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.

Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?

'Cause she's a fucking smoke show.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(SINGING) <i>'Cause I know you're just</i>
<i>blubber</i><i>In a dress shirt</i>

<i>Oh, oh</i>

<i>Oh, oh, blubber, blubber</i>

Oh, and some animals give him boners.

<i>(AULD LANG SYNE</i> PLAYING)

What the hell? Why would she do this?

Oh, wait, wait, wait,
what's that next video?

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, Daughtry.

I'm a mom, so I love this.

Chris, what happened?

I thought you said Taylor
had a good time the other night.

We did. She even let me grab the part of
her body which on others would be a butt.

Wow, look at these comments.
Everyone hates you, Chris.

She's right.
Check it out, you're already a meme.

Aw, man, Chris, this computer
is telling me that you done swifted it up.

Why would she do something like this?

Because this is what Taylor Swift does.

She gets into relationships with guys,
sabotages them,

and then writes angry songs about it.

I just wish I could talk to her.

Well, why can't we? She has a house
in Rhode Island. We could go today.

(GASPS) Oh, my God. We can go today.
My schedule is wide-ass open.

Well, we can't just show up there.

Why not? We've done crazier things before.
Remember when we sent that tweet?

All right, you ready?

Freeze, we're the internet police.
You guys are going away for a long time.

Hey, what are you in for?

I said, "Caitlyn Jenner
wasn't brave and beautiful."

Brian, there's some bad people in here.

Hey, what's up?
I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.

Okay, would you like the AC on
or the windows down?

-How about both?
-(GASPS)

-Pretty great, right?
-It is. It really is.

Thank you, genius person.

No problem. Hey, you ever go in
a hot tub when it's snowing outside?

Uh, what?

Miss Swift, your song writing team
is here.

We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.
Hit it, Marty.

(PLAYING RAGTIME MUSIC)

(SINGING) <i>Lox and bagels</i>
<i>and bagels and lox</i>

<i>I like being a girl</i>

Okay, one thought.

What if we change lox to boys
and bagels to problems?

Oh, that's perfect.

Like when you changed <i>Pickle it Good</i>
to <i>Shake It Off.</i>

All right, we got our homework.

-Hi, Taylor.
-Chris? What are you guys doing here?

I wanted to talk to you.

Your house is way nicer than
Anne Murray's. We broke in there, too.

Taylor, why'd you write
that song about me?

I thought we had a real connection.

We do. I really like you, Chris. I just...

I'm sorry. I always do this.

I ruin relationships
with nice guys and John Mayer,

just so I can write songs
about heartbreak and moving on.

But don't you think that's unhealthy?

You're never gonna find a real
relationship if you keep doing this.

Listen, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
Chris.

Let me make it up to you.

Why don't you guys all come
to my show tonight as my guests?

Are you serious?
Backstage with Taylor Swift?

That'll be even cooler than when I was in
that remake of <i>The Princess Bride</i>

with Bill Cosby.

Now, one of these has the iocane powder,

you see, and one of them makes you go
sleepy-bye with your mouth open.

-Hey, pal, where we heading again?
-Just go down this dark alley.

What the hell's going on?

This is what we do
to Uber drivers in this town.

(GROANING)

Stop, stop, please stop!

The sound of your leather jackets
is excruciating.

You can't just buy a phone
and become a cab driver.

Please, I have two families.

-Stay back.
-Where, where did you get that?

Judd Hirsch himself.

I was a boy. No more than 11 or 12,
was on the side of the road.

Man with a hat pulled up next to me.

Said I reminded of him
when he was my age.

I was just a boy, husking corn,
didn't know what it meant.

'Course we were all husking corn back
then, just to keep the lights on.

And you burned my car while I was
telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

God, I hate everybody who's not backstage.

This next song is a new one.
It's about my boyfriend, Chris.

(SINGING) <i>I'm pretty and I'm rich</i>
<i>and I'm in love</i>

<i>Me, Taylor</i>

<i>I've met the guy that</i>
<i>I've been dreaming of</i>

<i>Me, Taylor</i>

CROWD: Boo!

Wow, they hate it.

-This stinks.
-We like you when you're miserable.

You guys, Mr. Bule is taking
a door-open duke in the bathroom.

Why were they being so mean to you?

Well, I guess they are just used to me
being sad and hurt by men.

But I don't care if they like it, Chris.
I'm happy with you.

I'm happy with you, too.

But it doesn't seem like your fans
like this new happy Taylor.

Are you willing to risk losing them

and jeopardize your career
and your art just for us?

I think I am.

(CROWD BOOING)

-Well, I don't know if I am.
-What? What are you saying?

I'm saying that, Taylor Swift,

you are a spoiled, ostrich-legged,
no-talent, big-footed freak.

You pretend to relate to your fans

but you make your bodyguards
carry your purse.

All your songs sound the same.
And your cats aren't that cute.

Thank you, Chris.

This next song
is about my dumb ex-boyfriend

who either mistreated me, cheated on me,

or went to massage parlors
when I was out of town.

(CHEERING)

Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.

Yeah, I guess.

Don't worry.
They'll be plenty of girls for you.

No one will ever be close to as good
as her but we'll find you someone.

What about like a motorcycle lady?
You know, like an old gal.

Her grandchildren call her
by her first name.

Now, let's get out of here.
I called us an Uber.

How many tooths is not enough tooths?

Well, kids, your father
may have gotten beat up,

but Uber's still a great job
for anyone afraid to sell their blood.

And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't
work out with you and Taylor Swift.

I think we're all sorry about that, Brian.
But I'm afraid we're out of time.

I would like to thank our guests
Taylor Swift,

Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,

Cleveland Brown
and his band of Brown Renown.

Hey, we'll see you down
in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?

Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.

(PLAYS MOCKING NOTE ON BASS)

We apologize to the Greased-Up Deaf Guy,
didn't have time for him tonight.

But let's see if we can get him back
next week when Amanda Peet will be here

with standup Dom Irrera.
Good night, everybody.(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

<i>He's a family guy</i>

Peter, I need you
to take Chris and Meg to school.

Today's the day I finally kill
that squirrel

that's been eating our tomatoes.

Try to get like eight of them this time,
I wanna make bruschetta.

Oh, can't the kids just walk?

You know I like to watch
two full movies before I go to work.

No, Peter, they can't walk.
It's three miles.

(SIGHS) Fine, I'll take 'em.

But you better keep those goggles

'cause I'm gonna put them
to good use tonight.

Once the floor is full of saw dust,
we can eat peanuts in here.

Dad, are you sure it's okay
that we took Brian's car?

Yeah, it's his own fault.

He's the one who keeps his key
in the visor

like a carefree hillbilly.

Okay, everybody out. I don't want
the cool kids to know I'm your dad.

Hey, Chris, guess who I just scored
as my date to the homecoming dance?

Vice Principal McGuire.

-Really?
-Yeah, her husband just died of ALS.

So, she is ready to get at it.

-Hey there, strong guy.
-Not now, Brenda.

She says I have the body of
a 50-year-old before it gets ALS.

So, who you gonna go with?

I was thinking of asking Cara Morris.

Why don't you ask her now?
Her locker's right over there.

Um, yeah, okay.

Hi, Cara.

I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go
to the homecoming dance with me.

Oh, hi, Robot from <i>Big Hero 6.</i>
No, but thank you.

His name is Baymax, you gorgeous moron!

All right, red light. Time to text and
shave and whittle and floss.

Thanks for getting here so quickly.

-What?
-I'm sorry, you're in a Prius.

I just assumed you're my Uber.

I don't know what that is
on account of being dull.

Uber. It's like a cab except it feels like
a game 'cause it's from your phone.

Anyway, I'm late for a meeting.

Can I just give you 20 bucks
to drop me off?

Wow, 20 bucks
just to drive you across town?

Maybe I should be an Uber driver.
I mean, I could use the extra money.

And it's gotta be an easier
than when I was delivering pizzas.

All right, push, push, come on.
Come on, almost there.

Almost there, just one more push.
Here it is.

Oh, it's half Hawaiian.

-I believe that's ours.
-You poor fool.

(STRAINING)

-Hey, Stewie.
-What's up, big guy?

None of the girls in school
want to go to homecoming with me.

Probably 'cause everyone calls me names

like big nips and fat nips
and big fat nips.

Oh, don't listen to them, big fat nips,
they're just being haters.

What's a hater?

Oh, it's just something people say instead
of working to change their own flaws.

Anyway, you just gotta do what
Taylor Swift does and <i>Shake It Off.</i>

Who is Taylor Swift?

Oh, my God.

Am I about to introduce you
to Taylor Swift?

What is she? A singer?

She's much more
than a singer, Chris. She's...

Uh, she's, she's the queen.

A goddess, a gazelle
in a high waisted swimsuit.

Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane
nor clowns nor a posse,

-I'm not interested.
-I have an idea.

You should ask Taylor Swift
to the homecoming dance.

What? Why would she go
to a dance with me?

I'm telling you, this is exactly
the kind of thing she would do.

She's such a sweetheart.
Oh, I'm going limp.

Oh, I'm just gonna lie here, moaning.
Thinking about Taylor Swift.

(MOANING)

Tay-Tay.

How would I even ask her?

It's easy.
You and I will just make a video

about how sad you are and put it online.

She's very interactive with all her fans.

I guess it's worth a shot.

Of course it is.
If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone.

Just like you did on New Year's eve.

Three, two, one.

Some animals give me boners.

<i>(AULD LANG SYNE</i> PLAYING)

Hi, I'd like to be an Uber driver.

Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.

Don't I... Don't I need to fill out
a form?

Oh, right, yeah, of course.

"Name." Peter Griffin. "Criminal history."

"This section is optional,"
I will skip this. And done.

-Here you go.
-Yeah, none of this really matters.

All I need to know is,
do you have a car, a phone, and a face?

It's my dog's car.

Oh, and I know you didn't ask,
but I am quick to anger.

Okay, great. Now, get out there and
try to kiss as many ladies as you can.

The record is 60 in a month.
You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.

(PHONE RINGING)

(TALKING GIBBERISH)

(WHIMSICAL MONTAGE MUSIC PLAYING)

This is some good stuff, Chris.
I think it's ready to post.

Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.
I made my own video and posted it.

What? How could you do that?

Stewie, I didn't wanna do
all that fancy stuff.

So, I just did a video of me
speaking from the heart.

You know, telling her
how much it would mean

if a girl like her went
to homecoming with a guy like me.

I couldn't even stay awake
during that description.

(PHONE BUZZING)

-Hey, she already posted a response.
-What?

<i>Hey, Chris Griffin.</i>

<i>I just saw your video</i>
<i>and I'd love to go to your dance with you.</i>

<i>All right, I gotta go eat an ice cream</i>
<i>cone</i><i>'cause us stars are just like you.</i>

Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

Uh-oh. This means
I have an awkward phone call to make.

What? No, it was stupid.
What two guys going to homecoming?

I, I assumed it was a goof
this whole time.

Take it out. I'm ugly and unlovable.

Wow, Chris. I'm so excited.

You actually have a date
with Taylor Swift.

Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?
Can I wear grandpa's jacket now?

I don't know why you always ask for that.
That's, that's not a thing in our family.

Oh, Rupert. I can't believe Taylor Swift
is actually going to be at our house.

I haven't been this excited
since I abused those caffeine pills

to get ready for the big show.

Everything will be fine
as long as I take one of these.

Pills! You actually are taking drugs?

-Stewie, give me those.
-I can't, Zack, I need them to sing.

-Oh, that must be her.

Ah!

Hi, you must be Chris. I'm Taylor.

-What's up?
-(LAUGHS)

It's so nice to finally meet you.
Your video was so sweet

and I can't wait to go to the dance
tonight.

Me, too. Would you like to come in?

Hi, Peter Griffin, leering dad.
Quick question, in <i>Shake It Off,</i>

you invite us to get down
to, quote, "This sick beat."

Yet the beat you then provide
is rather mild.

My question is this. May I lick your legs?

Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin.
I'm your biggest fan.

I don't mean it like a psycho. I just...
I'm not, I'm not a psycho.

Oh, you're a cutie.

Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.
Now, you don't have to say anything.

I'm just gonna slowly pull out
this tape measure

Okay, here I go.

Still going.

Still going.

Oh, my God. You bitch, seriously?

Taylor, this is my sister, Meg,
and our dog, Brian.

Nice to meet you both.

We're not all so impressed.
I've met Dan Aykroyd.

I'm sorry, uh, which cast member
of <i>Hee Haw</i> are you?

Will you be nice?

Okay, well, we should probably go.

It was so nice to meet you all
except for the girl and the dog.

Sorry about my family.

Don't apologize. They seem nice.

Well, you wouldn't say that

I feel totally comfortable around you.

Well, why don't you just kiss her,
Griffin?

Sorry, I just smoked a joint
with the pickup truck kids.

That was really fun, Chris.

I hope you don't mind
I made the band pay me a royalty

-for each of my songs they played.
-Of course not.

And I hope you didn't mind I showed you
who every locker belongs to.

No, I thought that was nice.
I've never had a locker.

I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.

-Can I finger you?
-Sure.

"Hi, I'm Taylor Swift.
I'm famous but I'm really nice."

Aw. That's one of the best fingerings
I've ever had.

What are you working on there, Chris?

Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor
of some of her favorite things.

Here's flowers and crop tops

with his mouth shut.

Wow, you two seem to have

She gets into relationships with guys,
sabotages them,

and then writes angry songs about it.

I just wish I could talk to her.

Well, why can't we? She has a house
in Rhode Island. We could go today.

(GASPS) Oh, my God. We can go today.
My schedule is wide-ass open.

Well, we can't just show up there.

Why not? We've done crazier things before.
Remember when we sent that tweet?

All right, you ready?

Freeze, we're the internet police.
You guys are going away for a long time.

Hey, what are you in for?

I said, "Caitlyn Jenner
wasn't brave and beautiful."

Brian, there's some bad people in here.

Hey, what's up?
I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.

Okay, would you like the AC on
or the windows down?

-How about both?
-(GASPS)

-Pretty great, right?
-It is. It really is.

Thank you, genius person.

No problem. Hey, you ever go in
a hot tub when it's snowing outside?

Uh, what?

Miss Swift, your song writing team
is here.

We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.
Hit it, Marty.

(PLAYING RAGTIME MUSIC)

(SINGING) <i>Lox and bagels</i>
<i>and bagels and lox</i>

<i>I like being a girl</i>

Okay, one thought.

What if we change lox to boys
and bagels to problems?

Oh, that's perfect.

Like when you changed <i>Pickle it Good</i>
to <i>Shake It Off.</i>

All right, we got our homework.

-Hi, Taylor.
-Chris? What are you guys doing here?

I wanted to talk to you.

Your house is way nicer than
Anne Murray's. We broke in there, too.

Taylor, why'd you write
that song about me?

I thought we had a real connection.

We do. I really like you, Chris. I just...

I'm sorry. I always do this.

I ruin relationships
with nice guys and John Mayer,

just so I can write songs
about heartbreak and moving on.

But don't you think that's unhealthy?

You're never gonna find a real
relationship if you keep doing this.

Listen, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
Chris.

Let me make it up to you.

Why don't you guys all come
to my show tonight as my guests?

Are you serious?
Backstage with Taylor Swift?

That'll be even cooler than when I was in
that remake of <i>The Princess Bride</i>

with Bill Cosby.

Now, one of these has the iocane powder,

you see, and one of them makes you go
sleepy-bye with your mouth open.

-Hey, pal, where we heading again?
-Just go down this dark alley.

What the hell's going on?

This is what we do
to Uber drivers in this town.

(GROANING)

Stop, stop, please stop!

The sound of your leather jackets
is excruciating.

You can't just buy a phone
and become a cab driver.

Please, I have two families.

-Stay back.
-Where, where did you get that?

Judd Hirsch himself.

I was a boy. No more than 11 or 12,
was on the side of the road.

Man with a hat pulled up next to me.

Said I reminded of him
when he was my age.

I was just a boy, husking corn,
didn't know what it meant.

'Course we were all husking corn back
then, just to keep the lights on.

And you burned my car while I was
telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

God, I hate everybody who's not backstage.

This next song is a new one.
It's about my boyfriend, Chris.

(SINGING) <i>I'm pretty and I'm rich</i>
<i>and I'm in love</i>

<i>Me, Taylor</i>

<i>I've met the guy that</i>
<i>I've been dreaming of</i>

<i>Me, Taylor</i>

CROWD: Boo!

Wow, they hate it.

-This stinks.
-We like you when you're miserable.

You guys, Mr. Bule is taking
a door-open duke in the bathroom.

Why were they being so mean to you?

Well, I guess they are just used to me
being sad and hurt by men.

But I don't care if they like it, Chris.
I'm happy with you.

I'm happy with you, too.

But it doesn't seem like your fans
like this new happy Taylor.

Are you willing to risk losing them

and jeopardize your career
and your art just for us?

I think I am.

(CROWD BOOING)

-Well, I don't know if I am.
-What? What are you saying?

I'm saying that, Taylor Swift,

you are a spoiled, ostrich-legged,
no-talent, big-footed freak.

You pretend to relate to your fans

but you make your bodyguards
carry your purse.

All your songs sound the same.
And your cats aren't that cute.

Thank you, Chris.

This next song
is about my dumb ex-boyfriend

who either mistreated me, cheated on me,

or went to massage parlors
when I was out of town.

(CHEERING)

Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.

Yeah, I guess.

Don't worry.
They'll be plenty of girls for you.

No one will ever be close to as good
as her but we'll find you someone.

What about like a motorcycle lady?
You know, like an old gal.

Her grandchildren call her
by her first name.

Now, let's get out of here.
I called us an Uber.

How many tooths is not enough tooths?

Well, kids, your father
may have gotten beat up,

but Uber's still a great job
for anyone afraid to sell their blood.

And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't
work out with you and Taylor Swift.

I think we're all sorry about that, Brian.
But I'm afraid we're out of time.

I would like to thank our guests
Taylor Swift,

Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,

Cleveland Brown
and his band of Brown Renown.

Hey, we'll see you down
in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?

Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.

(PLAYS MOCKING NOTE ON BASS)

We apologize to the Greased-Up Deaf Guy,
didn't have time for him tonight.

But let's see if we can get him back
next week when Amanda Peet will be here

with standup Dom Irrera.
Good night, everybody.

(SCREAMS) Mom! Dad! A bat! A bat!

Oh, my God! There's a bat in the house!

Okay, all right. Everybody just calm down.
It might just be Grandpa Munster.

Somebody set him up for a funny joke.

Hey, Grandpa, how did you
sleep last night?

Yeah, see, if it was him,
he would have said,

"Like I do every night, upside down."

(LAUGHS)

Okay. But, Peter, we can't have
a bat flying around the house,

we got to do something.

Don't worry, Lois, I'll get rid of it.
It'll be a piece of cake.

Just like my penis enhancement.

I want it to hang down to my knees.

They moved up my knees.

Everybody, I've come up with
the perfect plan to catch the bat.

I bought this remote control
toy helicopter

to which I've attached this handgun.

And I tell you, this thing is not
easy to fly.

-Peter, that doesn't seem very...
-Here it goes.

Now I don't have anything
to control the trigger with,

so I put it on a timer.

I don't remember how long I set it...

Ah! We're all gonna die.

(BAT SCREECHING)

Okay, so now the bat has a gun
and the knives I gave him.

What? Why would you give it knives?

I didn't think it would matter,

I was counting on this
helicopter thing working.

Peter, where are you? What's going on?

PETER: In order to understand the bat,
we must first understand the vampire.

So I watched <i>Interview with the Vampire.</i>

Cast your gaze upon Lestat.

-Peter, you're not a vampire.
-Oh?

Then why am I clad in velvet pants
tucked into soft leather boots?

And why does my shirt bellow so
in the wind of that rotating fan?

Peter, what's really going on?

I'm just trying to reinvent my look.
A guy at work said I dress like crap.

Well, you show him tomorrow, Peter.

How'd it go?

I was sent home early
and labeled a distraction.

They're having a meeting
about me tomorrow.

(ALARM BEEPING)

Wha... What's wrong?

Are we taking a terrible 7:00 a.m. flight?

No, no. I realized, to catch a bat,
I need to live like a bat.

So I got to be up at night.
It's a nocturnal mission, Lois.

Okay, but what are you gonna do?

Well, as everyone knows, bats watch
a ton of Cinemax soft-core porn,

so that seems like the place to start.

(WOMAN GIGGLING ON TV)

Ah!

Ow!

You can beat me, but I am who I am.

Peter, what the hell
did you do to Stewie's hand?

It could be broken.

I didn't mean to.

It's just, sometimes,
I don't think before I act.

Oh, hey! High five!

Hey! Did you just high five that sign?

-Yeah.
-You think differently. Get in.

<i>But she's what Derek calls</i>
<i>"an oppressing doubter."</i>

<i>May the light of Derek's invincible</i>
<i>diamond shine through you.</i>

Oh, thank you so much
for coming in early, Dr. Hartman.

Oh, no problem. Hell, I used to work here.

-What?
-Good news.

Stewie's hand looks fine.

-Oh, hey! High five.
-Huh.

As long as you're here, I see Stewie
hasn't had his vaccinations yet.

-Should we take care of that?
-Well, I suppose so.

But first, I'm required
to have you read this pamphlet

about the risks of vaccinations.

God, you're aging so rapidly.

Possible side effects.
Fever, severe allergic reaction,

muscle, and joint pain?
Wait, this can't be right.

They actually put some
of the disease in the shot?

Hey, man.
How many questions your lady ask?

Uh, like a million.

I don't remember having
to read any of this

when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.

Well, that was before Internet chat
rooms made everybody an expert.

It's a better world now.

I don't know about this, Dr. Hartman.

We might need a little bit
of time to think this over.

Yeah, 'cause we don't wanna
make a big mistake.

Like when I peed next to the chatty guy.

(FIRE ALARM RINGS)

Hey, man. We should get out of here.
The building's on fire.

Hey, pal. Not now. I'm busy.

Anyway, I'll tell you what's on fire.
My urethra.

That's the last time I go to a water park,
I'll tell you that much.

Well, that's not completely true

'cause I have a Groupon
and I'd hate to waste it.

Plus the truth is the kids...

Oh, my God. I was the chatty guy.

Hey, you guys. Is that my laptop?

Yeah, sorry.
We were looking something up.

We were gonna get Stewie vaccinated,

but now, after our research,
we're definitely not.

Oh, now, Lois. Don't tell me you
fell for all that anti-vaxxer crap.

It's not crap, Brian.
There's a lot of evidence to suggest

there's a link
between vaccinations and autism.

Lois, all that so-called evidence
has been debunked.

Listen to some of these ingredients.

Mercury, thimerosal,
aluminum, formaldehyde.

Lois, deciding not to vaccinate Stewie
is something that affects all of us.

The only reason they work
is that if a critical mass of society

gets immunized,
then the diseases won't spread.

Look, Brian, I was skeptical too,
but then I did some research.

And I found some very interesting things

from the leader
of the anti-vaccination movement,

Jenny McCarthy.

See. Proof.

Hard to argue with that.
And look at this one.

Glasses. Case closed.

I can't believe you guys.

Don't you realize you're contributing
to a potential public health disaster

by not vaccinating your child?

That's exactly the point.
My child. He's my child.

And nothing matters
more than his well-being.

Oh, God. This is gonna be
a Lois story, isn't it?

<i>Game of Thrones</i> is on. Just a reminder.

Yeah, we made this mistake before.

We got the other kids vaccinated,
but Meg's still got chicken pox.

-Dad, this is acne.
-Girl, you nasty.

You realize the vast majority
of people think that you're wrong.

Well, maybe that's the problem.
We just got to change their minds.

We're getting this town to change
its mind about vaccinations.

Yeah, I'm with you.

Just as soon as I finish getting the word
out about the one thing more important.

The brothers who made <i>The Matrix</i>
are ladies now! They're ladies!

-Just one of them?
-That's the thing!

It's both of them! What are the chances?
What are the chances?

The brothers who made
<i>The Matrix</i> are ladies now!

All right. Come on, Peter.

I've got all the stuff
for our anti-vaccination rally.

I don't believe this.

It's bad enough you guys
aren't vaccinating Stewie.

Now, you're trying to convince other
people to make the same reckless choice?

I'm also gonna pat
a bunch of dogs without asking.

Don't do that. We don't like that.

Then I'm gonna try and look
at their teeth.

Brian, all we want
is for parents to have the choice.

Because parents know
what's best for their kids.

I hear Sansa finally shows
boob in this one.

You do realize they're
putting your life in danger

by not getting you immunized.

You could get measles, mumps,
rubella, whooping cough.

-Oh, my God! Are you serious?
-Very serious.

Even the tiniest germ could make you
very ill and left untreated kill you.

Really? I'd expect this kind of thing
from the fat man, but not Lois.

Although, she did act like a nut case

that time she went shopping
right before Thanksgiving.

Ready for Turkey Day?

-(LAUGHS) Clever.
-Don't eat too much turkey tomorrow.

(LAUGHS) Oh, I won't.

Now if only the meal
would cook itself, huh?

(CLINKING RHYTHMICALLY)

-Yeah, that's enough of that.
-What the hell?

Oh, yeah. That's my anti-vaccination PSA.

<i>Hi. I'm a medical guy.</i>

<i>And I'm here to give you</i>
<i>the facts about vax.</i>

Fact! Vaccinations cause autism,
paralysis,

and even death, death, death, death...

Fact! Vaccinate rhymes
with masturbate.

Would you let a doctor do
that to your kid?

Fact!

I still think Michelle Williams
is Carey Mulligan.

Fact!

Oh, yes, those must be

Speaking of which, do you have any idea

the germs you routinely
track into this house?

From now on, I'm going to ask that
you wear these shoes while indoors.

-Where did you get those?
-Put them on and lick your lips!

Stewie, you might be taking this too far.

Proper hygiene depends

I'm a gas station sandwich.

Do you even realize
the harm you've caused?

Harm? What are you talking about?
I'm making the world a better place.

Wait a minute, where are all
the other kids?

Haven't you heard?
There's been an outbreak of measles.

It's because everyone stopped
vaccinating their kids.

Thanks, Swanson, we'll take it from here.
It's a state matter now.

No way. This is my town.

Thanks, guys,
the feds will take it from here.

Oh, no. This is my state.

Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk,
so I've jurisdiction over all of you.

Must be serious.
They brought in the big guns.

You happy now, Lois?

Because of you,
there's a measles epidemic,

and the whole town is quarantined.

Speak for yourself, Brian.

I, for one, am enjoying
the indoor family time.

Who's up for another game of
Hot Breath Telephone?

(WHISPERING)

We're all gonna die!

Chris, you're supposed to whisper
that to the next person.

Peter, Brian's right.
We were wrong about everything.

We've got to get to the hospital
and get Stewie vaccinated.

It might be a little too late for that.

I kind of destroyed all the vaccines
in town.

All right, what else did I have
to do today?

Oh, yes. Overdose in my apartment.
I better get home.

You destroyed all the vaccines?

Yeah, but it is fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

Is anyone else feeling feverish, achy,
and acutely sensitive to light?

Oh, my God, Peter. You've got measles.

Now, hold on, hold on.
Before we all freak out...

It might just be full body herpes.

Wait, you guys.
Dad might not have been vaccinated.

Didn't grandma say he was born in Mexico?

Nobody remembers that, Meg.

We got to keep you away from Stewie.
You'll get him sick.

Oh, my little guy's gonna be fine.

All he needs is a good old fashioned
game of Hot Breath Telephone.

-(WHISPERS) Measles.

-I've got your EKG here.
-How does it look?

-Well, it spells out pancakes.
-Oh. Okay. So, same as last time.

I'm recommending you go
on a strict diet immediately.

Nope. Horses that make it look
like I can walk,

take me to Hollywood.

All right, I'm almost done packing.

I got it down to four bags and a hat box.

I'm gonna need some help, Rupert.
Rupert?

Ew. That's the tushie thermometer.

Dear God, you're burning up.
I have to get out of here.

I'm sorry, Rupert. But the situation here
has become unbearable.

Like talking to someone with adult braces.

So, yeah, last weekend Sheila
and I took the kids up to the lake,

it was great. We had great weather,
we fired up the barbecue,

Sheila's parents came up
towards the end of the...

When are you gonna get those off?

Meg, you must carry on my legacy.

Promise me, you'll crop the chaches.

Crop them, Meg. Crop them all.

Peter! Stewie's gone!
I've looked everywhere!

Oh, Lois. I'm feeling a little better.

I think I could keep down deviled eggs.

Lois, what's wrong?

I can't find Stewie.
He must have gotten out of the house.

God knows how far he's gone.

Well, look.
There's a family circus dotted path.

It'll lead us right to him.

Oh, it's just Billy. He died of measles.

And here come Marmaduke
to lick up the vomit.

Lucky.

If I can just escape this quarantine
and make it to the next town,

I'll be able to get that vaccine I need.

Stewie, I'm you from the future.

You've got to get the hell out of town
before you get sick.

Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.

Okay, I'm really here
because I know you have glue.

Give me the glue.

(INHALES)

Oh.

Stewie, listen to me.
Never ever do this great thing I love.

There's the bridge out of town.

So, we're all there at The Clam,
just kinda making music together,

and then Peter, of course,
had to join in and clap his hands,

and I said, "That's enough of that!"
(CHUCKLES)

Yeah, I kinda run the group.

I'll just have to go around them.

Good lord!

I hope my shoe doesn't fall to
make me realize how far the drop is.

Oh. My orthotic was in there.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

-Stewie!
-Where are you?

Lois, what's going on?

That's one of my sidekick's wives.

He says he's in charge of the group.
Is that true?

No, not in the slightest.
But, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.

We can't find him anywhere.

Lois, look!

(STRAINING)

I don't know if he can hold on
much longer.

We got to get him down.

Stewie, hang on! Mommy's coming.

(TRAIN HOOTING)

Oh, no! Upside down train!

(SCREAMING)

-Stewie!
-Oh, no!

Sean Penn?

That's right.
Two-time Oscar winner, Sean Penn.

What are you doing here?

I'm bringing vaccines
into your quarantined town.

Any time there's a public health crisis
in the third world land, I'm there.

Third world? This is Rhode Island.

Oh, really? Have you seen
some of the delis on Federal Hill?

(LAUGHS) Rhode Island slam!

I like you, Sean Penn.

Oh, my God.

You saved my baby. Thank you so mu...

Oh. Sean Penn.

You're the one who played
that homosexual?

-Yeah.
-All right, well,

I'll take my son now.

I've brought enough vaccines
for your whole town.

I hope you've realized

that vaccinations are not
a freedom of choice issue,

they're a public health issue.

Thanks to them,
countless serious diseases,

mumps, polio, small pox, and rubella
have been all but eradicated.

Like clean water and functional schools,
vaccinations are a human right.

Great. Just what I needed.
A lecture from liberal Hollywood.

This whole thing has been
a lecture from liberal Hollywood.

Well, it's a relief
that everyone's been vaccinated

and the quarantine has been lifted.

I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy
and only 150 people died,

but not anyone we knew personally.

Yeah, I know I sure learned something.

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

Hey, do you like apples?

Yeah.

Well, I got her number.
How do you like them apples?

Oh, Bat Damon!
You got the best of me again!

<i>He's a family guy</i>

Hi, it's me, Peter.

You may be wondering what I'm doing
in a library.

Well, I actually drove my car
into this rich guy's house

and he locked me in here
until the police come.

Don't believe me?

I don't know, I just locked him
in the library.

Seems like he's on something.

He's got crazy eyes and keeps screaming,
"I don't care."

I don't care!

Anyway, I've got some time to kill

before this room is filled with tear gas.

So, I thought why not finally read

some of the classics I never read
in high school?

Here's one right here, <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

A book by the only respected guy
in the world named Scott.

STEWIE: <i>It was my first summer staying</i>
<i>at the shore.</i>

<i>But I had a feeling that, I,</i>
<i>Nick "The Situation" Carraway,</i>

<i>would fit right in.</i>

Hey, it's Nick from <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

I just checked in and somebody left
their teeth here.

I don't know, it's just a set of teeth.

I guess men's.

No, I'm not putting them anywhere,
you come and get them.

(SCOFFS) The neighbors are having a party
with loud jazz music.

Well, at least annoyingly scatting
over jazz hasn't been invented yet.

(MAN SCATTING)

Oh, that must've been invented today!

Hey, whose party is this?

I'm not sure, women aren't allowed
to ask questions yet.

So, what's your name?

Madam, you forget yourself.

<i>That's when I first laid eyes</i>
<i>on him, Jay Gatsby.</i>

<i>He was clearly playing with himself</i>
<i>through his pocket,</i>

<i>but I pretended not to see.</i>

Hello, welcome to my party. Name's Gatsby.

Good to meet you, old sport.

Yeah, just a wave is fine.

I'm your new neighbor, Nick Carraway.

Oh, I hope we weren't too loud, old sport.

Yeah, this "old sport" thing,
is this something you're trying out,

or is this a keeper?

I just met you, so I wanna
tell you something very private.

Let's go out to the dock.

I come down here to think every night
and gaze at that green light.

It's where the love of my life lives.

Daisy Buchanan.

Um, I hate to break it you,
but that light you've been looking at,

is a gay gym called The Pump House.

I only know that because I saw a coupon
that came with my rental. Um...

Anyway, Daisy's house is over there.
She's my cousin.

Daisy's your cousin?

Yeah, lot of weird coincidences
for an American classic, huh?

What? I have to see her.

Well, I can set that up.
Only thing is, she's married.

Yeah, and I hear her husband's
a real heel.

Whoa! Language!

But, yeah, I'll set it up.

Tea, tomorrow at my house, 2:00 p.m.

Great.

She's gonna be there, right?

Yeah, why wouldn't she be there?

I don't know.
I'm just getting a funny vibe from you.

You asked me down to the docks alone

and <i>you're</i> getting a funny vibe from <i>me?</i>

Wow, what an ugly little house.

Oh, yeah, it's not that palace
of domestic abuse you live in.

What's up?

Oh, my God! Is it really you?

(SIGHS) I've missed you, Daisy.

You're as beautiful as ever.

You know what else is beautiful?
My bank account.

Boom! Rich guy.

You're rich now? Oh, my God, I love that.

I know, right?
Come on, I'll show you my place.

Oh, you're leaving?
But I made all these deviled eggs.

-You made?
-You know what I meant.

Yeah, you made them. Great job.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

You know, one of the best parts about
having an enormous mansion

is being able to come out here
and get some fresh air.

You know, sometimes,
I just want to jump off this balcony

and into that pool down there.

-So, do it.
-Yeah, I know, right? (CHUCKLES) Do it.

Yeah, do it.

I know, I totally should, right?
Here I go.

One, two, three... Whoa!

(CHUCKLES) Can you imagine?

Yeah, I can imagine.
It would be fun, you should do it.

If only it were that easy, right?

It is, it looks deep enough,
it's your pool, it's your house,

you can do whatever you want.

I know, right?

You know what?
I can't right now,

my pool guy's cleaning it.

Are you going to bone her?

This is amazing.

I've never seen so many shirts.

Do you have enough to, you know, throw?

Yeah, you know, they're actually
kind of expensive.

Oh, there she goes.

Shirt, shirt, shirt...

Okay, five is good, five is probably good.

Shirt, shirt.

(CHUCKLES) Were you this crazy
when we dated before?

Hmm. Gatsby, is it?

I've been hearing about your vast,
newly acquired wealth

and your attentions to my wife.

So, I thought I would have you over to
my equally large and fancy

but imperceptibly more classy mansion
for an awkward dinner.

And, Nick, have you met Jordan?

She plays golf and is what kids
will someday call a duff.

Hey, yeah, nice tam o'shanter.

I'll drink your finger bowl,
if you don't want it.

STEWIE: <i>In the book, I actually go</i>
<i>on a few dates with Jordan.</i>

<i>We're gonna skip all that.</i>

Anyway, like I was saying, you're a trash

'cause you earned your money
a little bit more recently than me.

What are you getting at?

I'm saying I invited you over
and sat you next to my wife

to say, "Stay away from my wife."

You know what we should do?

Let's all drunk drive into Manhattan
and get a hotel room

and have the same conversation
we're having here.

I'm starting to think this isn't a very
good book.

I'd like to add another bit of
pointless confusion

that will make sense later,

let's everyone drive somebody else's car.

Someone can take my Coupe.

I'm riding with Gatsby,
I don't care which car.

I'll take someone in Daisy's car.

I don't think Daisy said
you could drive her car.

Tom, why don't you take Jay's car?

-Who's Jay?
-Gatsby.

Okay, I've never heard anyone
call him that.

Look, if you're in your own car,
you're in the wrong car.

All right, you guys get gas.

I got to talk to this random mechanic's

horny wife about some business.

Wilson, gonna need to fill her up.

Wilson's wife, fill her up. Get it?

(CHUCKLES)

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

I don't know what they do up there,

but they sure do listen
to Def Leppard pretty loud.

So, have you seen any good movies lately?

We just saw
<i>Woman Tied to Railroad Tracks 5.</i>

Pretty similar to 4.

Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

Well, looks like you guys are getting
a head start on the depression here.

(PETER MOANING)

Thanks for stopping by, Mr. Buchanan.

Yeah, sure.
Don't tell anyone how bad I look naked.

Have fun raising my bastard.

All right, let's head out.

Wait, but first.

I wanna see if we're in the funny
horn era.

(HORN HONKS)

Aha! We are!

All right, Gatsby, you think
you're so hot?

Let me show you how a classy guy
does classy stuff.

Hello, room service?

I'd like a bottle of your
second most expensive champagne.

And I'd like your most expensive bottle.

Wow, walked right into that one.

Okay, fine.
Let's see who has higher socks.

(SCOFFS)

Whatever, Tom, none of that matters.

Daisy's in love with me.

In fact, she's never loved you.

Oh, is that so?

Well, I hear Gatsby didn't even fight
in World War I.

Wait, why is he calling it that?
Is there gonna be another big war?

I'm sorry, Tom.

That's right. I'm in love with Daisy,
and she loves me, old sport.

Would anyone like a deviled egg
from a tea I had several days ago?

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Well, that was awful.

But I sure do enjoy driving your car,
instead of you driving it,

even though we came in a different car.

Drunk, don't forget, drunk.
You're drunk driving my car.

Gas and sandwiches,
get your gas and sandwiches.

(GASPS)

That must be Tom since I saw him
in that car earlier.

Tom, Tom, it's me.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Oh, no, Myrtle.

Where will I ever find another woman
with a hotter name than Myrtle?

All right, pool, do your thing.

You hungover?

Uh, a little bit, yeah.

Okay, we're sort of racing
to the end here,

and with that,
I shall step slightly out of range.

All right, I'm just gonna take
a quick swim.

Oh, my God, where are the stairs?

There's no stairs,
I'm never gonna make it.

You were standing earlier in the day
next to the car that hit my wife.

(GROANS)

STEWIE: <i>I would soon return to New York</i>
<i>a changed man.</i>

<i>Because for me,</i>
<i>that will always be the summer</i>

<i>that I finally put my head under water.</i>

(GASPS) I did it, I did it.

I wish somebody had seen that.

Hi, me again.

I'm not in that guy's library anymore.

I snuck up to the attic just before
the cops busted in.

They're down there now, look.

Only problem is, I really want to get to

that trunk of costumes in the corner.

On the one hand,
I don't want to give away my location.

On the other hand,
there might be a pirate hat.

(FLOOR CREAKS)

Hmm, no pirate hat, but I'll make it work.

Ar! I'm a chef aboard a pirate ship.
Now, who be wanting pancakes?

POLICEMAN: <i>I think I hear</i>
<i>something in the attic.</i>

Oh, crap.

While I figure out my options,
here's <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

Hi, Huckleberry Finn.

Hi, Tom Sawyer.

You're Tom, I'm Huck.

Everybody good? Yup?
All right, let's do this.

Huckleberry Finn, you get inside
this house this minute.

It's Tuesday morning,
it's time for church.

Oh, Widow Douglas, I already been
to church three times today.

I want to stay home and play <i>Angry Birds.</i>

(SQUAWKING)

(GRUNTS)

(CHUCKLES) This is addictive.

Hey, I'm your abusive dad

and I've been drinking all day
from this here jug.

Oh, my God, is that a jug full of porn?

Hey, Widow Douglas,
I wanna live with my dad.

Shut your hole.

Now, come on, I need to use your pee.

I'm taking a wagon test in the morning.

I wish you wouldn't drink so much.

Stop counting my drinks.

Now, get over here so I can whip you.

Ow! Dad, no.

Yeah, that's right, bitch.

Now, it's your turn.

(SNORING)

Gee, this is worse than
the Widow Douglas' house.

I got to get out of here.

I know, I'll fake my own death.

I just need enough blood
to make it look real.

Hey, there, you must be Huck.
Great to finally meet you.

I hope you like it here.

I'm gonna stab you for your blood.

Oh, come on, I just got shot
in the pool in the last...

(GRUNTS)

I can't remember why I needed the blood.

Lord, I'm gonna tell you.

Being a slave is a much worse job
than the temp agency made it sound.

You gonna eat all that possum?

I am. My name is Huck Finn.
What's half of your name?

Jim. Nice to meet you.
I'm a runaway slave.

I'm running away 'cause people want me
to wear shoes and comb my hair.

So, I guess we got the exact same problem.

Hey, what's that sound?

Oh, no, it sounds like...

A waterfall!

Hold on!

We died.

So, wait, we didn't die?

I don't know, it's all just jokes.

-Oh! Did you see that?
-What?

I just skipped that rock six times.
That's a once-in-a-lifetime skip.

That's nice.

You don't believe me, do you?

I believe we've been out here a long time,

and a man's mind begins
to play tricks on him.

It happened for real,
I can't believe you didn't see it!

JIM: <i>Of course, I saw it.</i>

<i>Most amazing damn thing</i>
<i>I ever did witness.</i>

<i>But I wasn't gonna tell Huck,</i>

<i>'cause he claimed he didn't see me</i>
<i>hook shot that apple core</i>

<i>into the garbage from way far away.</i>

Hello, friends.

Why are you so friendly? You con man?

No, we're business men.
We're fake selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

Don't say, "Fake Selling."

We're real selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

Stop qualifying the selling,
we're just selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

-I'll buy it.
-Hold on, now, Huck.

These fellows are con men.

Push off, you grifters.

We don't want to ever see you again.

Fine, we're going.

It's a river,
we can't control how fast it goes,

we can barely steer.

Sorry.

Hey, what if it's spelled with an "A"
at the end of it? Is that okay?

Jim?

Jim.

If you're looking for a gym,
ye old Pump House is that way.

Can't miss it. Green light on the dock.

Tom Sawyer.
What are you doing so far from home?

Rush is playing here tonight.
They wrote a song about me.

Oh. Well, I'm looking for my friend, Jim.

Huck, great news, I'm free.

You are?
That's awesome, when did that happen?

It's just being revealed now but it
happened hundreds of pages ago.

Oh, wow. Weird.

So, uh, what's left to do?

I'll tell you what. Rush concert.

(SINGING) <i>A modern day warrior</i>

Hey, I'm Mark Twain.

Pretty cool book, huh?

Well, while I'm being booked
and processed downtown,

we have time for one more classic
of American literature.

This one's about idiots choking rodents.

I give you <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

Read him his rights.

You know what?
I'd like to read them myself.

Chapter one, Eat My Ass, Pigs.

(YELLS) The bones in my nose!

Wow, I remember when this used to be
all orange groves.

It's currently all orange groves.

Tell me again about our dream, George.

All right, all right.

We're going to open a bed and breakfast
in the country.

And we won't be afraid
to let our guests know

that we are Steelers fans in this house.

What about the rabbits?

Yeah, we'll have rabbits, too.

But we'll also have a sign
in the front that says,

"Steelers fan parking only."

And sometimes we'll give our guests
a fake hard time.

Like if they're Jets fans,
we'll be all like,

"Okay, I hope you don't get towed."

But, obviously, you know, of course,
we're not gonna tow them.

Hey there, strangers,
welcome to Phelps Ranch.

People call me Slim.

Ironically, I assume.

Listen, we're looking for field work,
if you need any extra hands.

Well, three of our guys
did just get squished,

so we just might. Come on in.

So, have you done this kind
of work before?

Have we pulled an object off a plant
and placed it in a burlap bag?

Yes, I think we understand
the nuances of this profession.

Good, good. And how about you?
Tell me about yourself.

I like to kill animals and then a lady.

I got a good feeling about you guys.

All right, you guys are doing great.

Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies,
and I thought,

since you're covered with feces
and I barely know you,

I'd give you a delicate snow white
newborn puppy.

Okay, just don't give me to dead eyes
over there,

'cause I've already been killed twice
in the other two stories

-and I don't want to...
-Puppy!

Oh, fuck!

-(BONES CREAKING)
-(GRUNTS)

This puppy doesn't work.

Well, well, well.

As you can tell by the,
"Well, well, well," he's the bad guy.

Looks like we got us some new employees.

That's right, Curley,
I hired them this morning.

Well, tell them to get out.

This is where I practice my karate
'cause I'm a dick.

I understand you like to pick fruit.

You ever pick something bruised
and pear shaped?

Fruit has seeds you can pull out.

Hey, Hodor,
stop coming on to my slutty wife.

Look, I can tell by the fact that you wear

a single Vaseline-filled leather glove
that you're a reasonable man.

So, let's all take a deep breath
and calm down.

No, karate chop.

(EXCLAIMS)

(CRUNCHES)

(SCREAMS) Damn it!

I tuck my jeans into my boots.

I'll get you, you stupid giant moron.

Not great timing, I know,

but can I leave early for
a dentist appointment?

So, I should be home by 10:00.

It's just this piano bar/cabaret place
called Tinkles.

Rory told me about it.

Who's Rory?

You remember him,

the field hand who gave me
a shoulder ride back to the house,

that was Rory.

Anyway, it sounds like it's just a hoot.

Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady
to get married to there.

Yeah, well, that's the idea.

While you're gone, can I touch myself?

Again, you don't have to
schedule that with me.

But, remember, if there's any trouble,

we meet by the big tree
on the edge of town.

Everything in my head is screaming.

All right, then I am off.

Well, hello there.

If it isn't the sexy imbecile.

Oh, hi. Sorry about what I did
to your husband earlier.

Yes, that was quite a hand job
you did on him.

You know, I'm not so bad at those myself.

I'm not gonna lie to you,

you're wasting your double entendres
on me.

I want you to destroy me.

Okay.

Oh, I just love a song that explains
what it just said.

(WHISPERS)

(SIGHS) All right, evidently, I have to go
to the big tree on the edge of town

to take care of something.

This shouldn't take too long,
do not take my songs off the list.

I'm sorry, George,
I didn't mean to kill the girl,

and now the whole town's
gonna hang me by a rope.

Oh, I would never let that happen.

Thanks.

Tell me about the rabbits, George.

Yeah, sure thing. But while I do that,
why don't you face away from me

and count the stars?

Okay.

All right, so the B&B will have a rack
of single-gear bikes for every guest,

and, yes, next to that, of course,

is going to be the big giant rabbit hutch.

Bye-bye, Lennie.

Good night, kids.
Good luck with those book reports.

-It's where you work, Peter.

Why the hell would Daddy
buy the brewery?

Well, there's children in the room,
watch your swearing.

But apparently, he's looking
to diversify his holdings.

Wow, Dad, I guess that means
Grandpa is your new boss.

Oh, crap. I don't want to work for him.

I'd rather work for Dr. Frankenstein.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

(GROANS)

Igor, I did it!

Hold on, you discovered the power
to create new life

and you created a guy?

So, I should have made a woman,
so I could have sex with a corpse?

I don't know, man.
You just shouldn't have made a guy.

All right, now that I'm in charge
of this brewery,

there's gonna be
some changes around here.

For one thing, no more T-shirts
or dungarees in the work place.

Dungarees are jeans.

Griffin, what are you doing here?

I... I work here.

You do? No way.

Oh, this is gonna be fun.

Effective immediately, you're the guy
at the office with the weird ski-tan,

but you can't talk about it.

Hey, did you go skiing this weekend?

I'm not allowed to talk about it.

(HUMMING)

(SINGING) <i>Dog driving a car</i>

-(HUMMING)
-(SIREN BLARES)

Oh, damn it.

Morning, Brian.
I'm afraid you ran a red light.

-Your license, please.
-(SIGHS)

I swear, Joe, the light was still gray
when I went through it.

Mmm-hmm.

-Are you aware this has expired?
-What?

Brian, step out of the vehicle.

Why? Why? Why? What's going on?

Well, the law is clear.
I have to confiscate your license

and you're gonna have to walk home.

-Can't you at least give me a ride?
-No can do, <i>amigo.</i>

(SIGHS) All right,
I guess I'll just call an Uber.

(PHONE VIBRATING)

Are you Brian?

Oh, Griffin, there you are.

I've decided that as your new boss,

I'm gonna require you
to have a standing desk.

-Oh, but I'll look like such an ass.
-And that's not all.

You've gotta constantly tell everybody
what a good idea it is

and how important it is,

and how wrong they are
for having traditional desks.

Can't I just work at it
and mind my own business?

No! You have to be a freak about it.

Maybe it can just be
my own personal choice,

and I'm not judging others
for their choices.

No, you being right means
everyone else is wrong.

That's what your standing desk
is saying to the chair people.

From now on,
you call them chair people.

Oh, and three times a day,
you have to say,

"Sitting is the biggest killer
in America."

(SIGHS)

Good night, Peter.

Good night,
gender-transitioned co-worker

we had a whole meeting about.

ANGELA: Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what you're ordering is illegal.

I don't care about that.

I want our beer cans made
from the cheapest material possible.

-But, sir...
-What about those metal toilets

where prisoners make wine?
Use those.

But, sir, if word got out about this,

it would be one of the most notorious
developments in beer history.

Second only to
Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach.

Peter, are you sure you heard
Mr. Pewterschmidt correctly?

He actually said he wanted
cheap, toxic materials

inserted into the brewery supply stream?

Well, his eyes looked different
how he said it, but that was the gist.

Also, some of the brewery workers
say very hurtful things

if a co-worker wears shorts.
Follow the money.

Mr. Griffin, it sounds like
you've brought me an interesting story.

-What should I do with it, Ollie?
-Make it news!

-Oh, you got a standing desk, too?
-Sitting's bad.

I know. They don't want
to hear it, though.

SECRETARY: <i>Sir, there's a reporter here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

Is it Kermit the Frog
when he's wearing a trench coat?

That tells you he's a reporter.

(JAPANESE SONG PLAYING)

Sir, an anonymous whistle blower
in the brewery

says you've personally ordered
the sourcing of cut-rate,

potentially toxic canning materials.

God, you're gorgeous.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, I remind you,
this is on the record.

You ever been with a man
who's got a prostate

the size of a beef-steak tomato?

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Oh, crap, it's Carter.

I bet he's mad
I told the News about him.

I'll just do what Superman does.

Oh, hey, Carter.

Hello, citizen. Have you seen Peter?

Aw, he was just here.

Daddy, what's this about?
Did Peter screw something up at work?

No, I'm here
because I've got important news.

Lois, everyone, I've left your mother,

and Tricia Takanawa
is moving in with me.

-Holy crap!
-What?

I wanted you to know.

I'm in love.

Well, good for you
for being honest, Carter.

It's never good to keep something
that matters to you a secret.

<i>Tell her about the surf camp</i>
<i>in Belize, Peter.</i>

<i>Tell her you're going.</i>

<i>Tell her it's your dream</i>
<i>and you deserve it.</i>

<i>Tell her it will make you a better father.</i>

What's that, Peter?

Uh, nothing. Just something stupid.

You're leaving Babs for Tricia Takanawa.

And I've never been happier.

What about Mom?

-Where is Mom?
-The sanitarium.

-The sanitarium?
-Yeah.

I told her I was leaving her
and she freaked out for no reason.

And I'll tell you, I don't know why
they call it a sanitarium.

That place is a filthy hellhole.

Oh, my God, that's awful.

Uh, sorry, what did you say?
I was texting Tricia.

She just sent me a picture
of her smoothie.

Looks good, babe.

All right, class, let's get started.

Stewie, what are you doing?
And why are you dressed like that?

Because I'm your
driver's aid instructor, Brian.

-You're what?
-That's right.

I heard you lost your license.
And I'm gonna help you get it back.

-Uh, okay.
-Now, we've got a lot to cover.

But first, let's watch a safety video
designed to terrorize you

into being a responsible motorist.

<i>Come on, kid with a bright future,</i>

<i>I'll give you a no-seatbelt car ride</i>
<i>after this team kegger party.</i>

<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm going to Harvard Yale tomorrow.</i>

<i>I'd hate to lose it all</i>
<i>because of making poor choices.</i>

<i>Oh, come on, man.</i>
<i>I just had a couple of alcohol beers.</i>

<i>And I'm his girlfriend</i>
<i>'cause he has great genitals.</i>

<i>And I'm impressed with reckless behavior.</i>

<i>So, I'm going to reward him</i>
<i>with my mouth while he's driving.</i>

<i>Now, let's smoke a marijuana cigarette</i>
<i>while I'm speeding because of a dare.</i>

<i>Hey, careful. I'd hate for you</i>
<i>to be unresponsive to my pleasuring</i>

<i>while you're driving</i>
<i>because of intoxication.</i>

BRIAN: Stewie is this about anything
but oral stuff while you're driving?

STEWIE: It's about all facets
of driving safety, yes.

BRIAN: I'm gonna fast-forward.

<i>What a waste.</i>

<i>I'm a grizzled, seen-it-all veteran cop,</i>

<i>and I'm shaking my head</i>
<i>at the senseless waste.</i>

<i>Sir, we've done our police tests.</i>

<i>The driver was being mouth-pleased</i>
<i>at the moment of impact.</i>

Lois, fat-ass, family,
I want you to meet Tricia Takanawa.

Hello, everyone. So happy you came.

Yep. Food's on the table.

And if anyone needs some dirty underpants,
the vending machine's right over there.

How nice. Right where
my mother's china cabinet used to be.

Lois, can I please have a dollar
for the vending machine?

No, Peter. I'm getting our coats.
We're leaving.

(WOMAN GIGGLES)

<i>No. Bill too crinkly. Try again.</i>

<i>Bill too crinkly. Your dollar funny.</i>

This must be so difficult for you.

It is. There's a lot of choices here.

But I ain't talking to you.

I thought you were supposed to be
doing a news story on Carter,

not shacking up with him.

The truth is, all I ever wanted was to
someday have a family of my own.

And I realized
Carter could give me all of that.

A family all your own?

Yes. A family just like this.

In fact, with a fine son
just like you, Peter.

A son to whom I could, one day,
give a piece of sour plum candy.

(GASPS) Thank you, Mama Tricia.

But a lazy son
who does not make me proud,

Peter, that son deserves no candy.

(WHINING) I swear, Mama Tricia,

I'm gonna make you
the proudest tiger mom of all.

Not like how Jesus feels about his kid.

Dad, I got bullied at school.
They flipped up my lunch tray.

Oh, that sucks.

I wonder if that's the worst thing
that ever happened to a guy.

Whoa. Whoa!

Billy, this guy in this book here,
he's really getting the business.

Yikes. Okay, I'm sorry.
What happened at school today?

-You're kind of a dick, Dad.
-Huh.

I wonder if there is anyone in here
whose dad was a bigger dick.

Wow, crazy.

Uh, Mom, why is Dad over there
playing chess with Tricia Takanawa?

Because, Chris, your idiot father
thinks she's his new tiger mom,

and he's trying to impress her.

All right, Peter,
it's time to master the game of chess.

-Okay, that shouldn't be too hard.
-No.

You will do it
in a traditional Japanese way.

On a wacky game show
while a beautiful woman

beats your scrotum with a reed.

Ow! I don't know
which way the horse goes.

-(YELLS)
-(LAUGHING)

Why is that guy laughing at me?

-And where is he?
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

There was a time limit?
Nobody told me that.

(YELLS)

Time for Good Door, Bad Door.

Wait. How bad is the bad door?

Grandpa-san, how bad was the bad door?

Not too bad. But shortly afterwards,
I was almost eaten alive by an escalator.

-(BUZZER SOUNDS)
-The game is still going on?

(LAUGHING)

You lose chess.

(YELLING)

Peter, another way
to impress your Asian tiger mom

is to put on
this old-fashioned baseball hat

and assist Indiana Jones
on his next adventure.

You got it, Mama Tricia.

Okay, nice and slow, Dr. Jones.

More alcohol and pot.

Yeah, let's get you
out of the tub first, Dr. Jones.

I wanna fly an old plane.

-I'm not sure that's a great idea.
-Not a new, safe one.

Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got that.

(SCREAMS) There's a skeleton
in my bedroom.

That's your wife, Dr. Jones.

Now, maybe today,
we don't do the earring.

No, earring every day.

-All right, Brian. Let's begin.
-Great. Let's do it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Demerit.

-What the hell?
-Where are your hands, Brian?

-Uh, on the steering wheel?
-Ten and two.

All right. Commence.

-IPDE, Brian, IPDE.
-What?

IPDE. Identify, Predict, Decide, Execute.

You've got to constantly be IPDE-ing
everything in your target zone.

I... I don't know what you're saying.

-IPDE. Identify, Predict...
-Yeah, you said that.

-But it doesn't mean...
-IPDE that.

-Uh, it's a child with a ball.
-Very good.

Identified. Now predict.

-Predict what?
-IPDE.

Yeah, you keep saying
that like it's a word.

Those four letters don't make a word.

It's not helping me remember anything.

Oh, now you've got an oncoming vehicle.

Pay attention to your
four to six-second zone.

What... What is that?
Four to six second?

-IPDE the car, Brian, IPDE the car.
-What does that mean?

Now check your gauges with one eye
while keeping your other eye on the road.

My eyes go in the same direction.

-What's your tire pressure?
-(STAMMERS) I don't... I'm in the car.

Stop! Demerit.

Stewie, I know how to drive.
I've been driving for years.

(HORN HONKING)

Ever hear of IPDE, jackass?

I had a great day with the fat son.

He started to respond positively to
the caning of his buttocks and knuckles.

Speaking of buttocks and knuckles,
let's fool around.

Ooh, sounds good.

I wonder if I can tell you
one of my deepest sexual fantasies.

All right. Let me just burp
through my nose for a second.

I've been drinking Seltzer.

Okay, what do you got?

Well, you're going to think this is silly,

but I love it when a man confesses
to manufacturing improprieties.

Oh, yeah?
Well, then you're gonna love this.

I ordered the brewery

to start making beer cans
out of toxic, unsafe metal

just to save a few bucks.

Exactly what I wanted to hear.
Thank you, Carter.

And there you have it,
Channel Five news audience.

This has been Tricia Takanawa
with my undercover exposé

of Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.

Up next, is Papa John dyeing his eyebrows?

I sleep with him to find out,

though I'm fairly confident
the answer is yes.

And we're clear.

What? What's going on?

I finished my investigation.

But I don't understand. I...

-I thought we were in love.
-I only let you think that.

I'm sorry, it's time for me to go.

-Chris?
-Hi, Grandpa.

I got an internship.

You mean you've been working for Tricia?

Hang on. I got to get
20 seconds of room tone.

-What's room tone?
-Oh, we got to start again.

I miss her so much, Griffin.

Of all the women
I've institutionalized Babs over,

she's the one
who meant the most to me.

I know.

It's like one day she's my tiger mom,
and the next day she isn't.

And the day before that first day,
she also wasn't.

But the point is, she hurt us, Carter.

We got to get her back.

We need revenge.

<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Coming up next, Nicki Minaj is a bear?</i>

<i>But first, congratulations</i>
<i>to our very own Tricia Takanawa.</i>

<i>That's right, Tom.</i>

<i>Tricia's recent exposé</i>
<i>on the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery</i>

<i>has been nominated for a local Emmy.</i>

<i>Hmm. The local really hurts that.</i>

That's it, Griffin.
That's how we'll get our revenge.

You and I will go to the Local Emmy's

and we'll embarrass Tricia
on her big night

in front of all her peers.

That's a great idea,

'cause people need to know
that she's an even bigger fraud

than Robert Baden Powell,
the founder of the Boy Scouts.

Ma'am, I'd like to take your son
into the woods.

What? That sounds suspicious.

Well, what if I said we'd both
be wearing shorts and neckerchiefs,

and I'd give him little patches
for doing what I say?

So, how'd we do?
Did you pass your driver's test?

-Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so.
-You brought up IPDE?

-As a matter of fact, I did.
-He was impressed?

No. He had no idea
what I was talking about.

He tried to Google it on his phone

and ended up spilling hot coffee
on his balls.

I took him to the ER,

and he said he'd pass me
if I picked him up in an hour.

So it did work.

Well, congratulations.
You're getting your license back.

I know. It's great.

Now I'll be able to go
to those dog parties again.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

There's Tricia.

-Sweet. What's our plan?
-We put this in her drink.

It'll make her instantly triple herself.

A tripling is when you vomit, defecate,
and orgasm all at the same time.

What? I don't...
Why would that medicine even exist?

Cosby. Now all we need is a distraction
so we can spike her cocktail.

A-ha, you leave that to me.

I know something that might distract
all these news people.

Maybe if one of us just chuckles
for no apparent reason,

everyone else will start chucking.

Worth a shot.

(CHUCKLING)

(ALL CHUCKLING)

All right, they're all "news chuckling."
Go, go, go.

(CHUCKLING)

Okay. All Tricia's got to do now
is take one sip

and she will blow it out of all three
holes right here in front of everyone.

And that will make us feel better
about our life choices.

Hello, Mother, I'm so happy
you could be here tonight.

Why happy?
You no work for Channel Ten.

Just Channel Five. Only half as good.

Mother, please.
I'm being honored tonight.

What honor? Connie Chung marry
Maury Povich for media super team.

Where your Povich? You have no Povich.

Wow, Tricia's mom is
really coming down hard on her.

Yeah. And with
really outdated references.

You know, it's no wonder
Mama Tricia was so tough on me.

It's the only thing she knows.

And where grand children?

Who take care of me when I 121 year old?
Who take care of Irene?

No one. No one take care of Irene.

I guess her name is Irene.

Carter, I'm starting to feel bad
for Tricia.

Maybe what she did to us was wrong,

but sheesh, look at
what her own life has been like.

I don't think I can do this.

Well, this stuff's already in her drink.

(SLOW MOTION) Mama Tricia!

No!

Where'd you get these?

Oh, I see the guy.

-You're a weird guy, Griffin.
-Uh, I don't know.

You know, I've just been thinking,

the way you and me fell
so fast for this lady and for no reason,

maybe the problem ain't Tricia, you know.

-Maybe it's us.
-What do you mean?

Well, with my real mom gone,

I guess, maybe I just needed
someone in my life to fill that role.

Someone who loves me enough
to call me fat, and lazy, and stupid.

Hmm, maybe you're right.

And maybe I was just looking for a way
to feel young again.

Hey, Carter, we're gonna be okay.

(MOANING)

(FARTS)

Oh, crap, this thing was a rental.

Here's your tux back. Bye.

Well, I'm just glad all this nonsense
with Tricia Takanawa is over.

Hey, whatever happened with Grandma?

Yeah, that's what everybody
was thinking about, Meg.

Trust me, she'll come back if we need her.

Hey, Stewie, seriously,

thanks for everything you did
to help me get my license back.

My pleasure. But now, you owe me.

That means one day I'm gonna
come to you and ask for a favor.

But I need to know something.

I need to know that you're gonna
say yes when that day comes.

-Uh, okay.
-Can we go for ice cream?

(MUFFLED) Come on.

(RATTLING)

Hello, I got you a present.
It's a thumb.

(EXCLAIMS)

Don't look away,
let the fear wash over you.

-I don't understand.
-That's the whole point.

Now, did you leave a plate
of black coffee out for me?

-No.
-In the future,

please leave a plate of black coffee
out for me.

Also in the past.

You guys,
what are you doing watching TV?

-It's snowing.
-Really?

-Wow, it's so beautiful.
-Isn't it?

And you know what's a miracle, kids?

Every single snow flake is exactly alike.

I don't think that's right.

No, it's true. Just like finger prints.

All right, you guys ready for church?

Church? What are you, an idiot?

It's the first snow of the season.
We're going sledding.

Please, can we, Mom?

-Well, I mean, it's Sunday.
-Come on, Lois.

After all, sledding was
the second passion of the Christ.

Eat this, for this is my dust.

My sled has "Dora" on it 'cause
my parents got it at a yard sale.

It's still for boys, though.

She's about language acquisition,
not gender.

Sorry, fun seekers.
This hill is closed to sledding.

What? What are you talking about?

Too many pansy-assed parents sue the city

when their kids sprain a finger
or crush their skull on a bumper.

I'm afraid sledding has been banned
in Quahog.

You can't do that.

The last time I check this was
still the <i>United States of Tara.</i>

-Obscure reference.
-And I'm not gonna let anybody tell me

where I can and cannot sled.

Yeah, you're right.
Power to the people.

The whole world is watching.

The whole world is watching.

What... What just happened?

-Who cares. Last one down the hill...
-(CRASHES)

Oh, my God!

WEST: Call my mom.
I crushed my skull on a bumper.

(ALL CHEERING)

You serious all this white stuff
used to be water?

Mmm. My word.

-Joe, what are you riding on?
-Oh, it's a bed pan.

I got a ton of these at home.

You make every activity incredibly sad.

(PANTING)

There you are. Where have you been?

I just ran home to get
the big sled out of our dining room.

What are you talking about?

We don't have a sled in our dining room.

Everybody on.

Peter, that dining room table
is an antique.

It's been in my family for
six generations.

It's fine. Okay, now, since we're
white guys doing something stupid,

everybody grab a GoPro.

(ALL CHEERING)

PETER: Yeah, this is awesome.

Oh, we're drifting, we're turning,
we're turning.

-Dad, I'm scared.
-CHRIS: We're backwards!

PETER: Am I the only one who thinks
that now we're at an alarming speed?

-(CRASHING)

Peter, are you insane?

You could have killed the entire family!

Sorry, Lois, I honestly thought
this was going to be fun.

Like, when I won that sex contest.

PETER: First again!
Wasn't even close, was it?

LOIS: No, Peter.
It wasn't even close.

PETER: Yeah, you are terrible at this.

Now, why don't you clean up
and go get the champ a Gatorade, huh?

You wearing pants always amuses me.

Yeah, I know.

It's just that I got roped in
to go to some

stupid office Christmas party
with this girl I'm dating.

Really? I thought you just went
to an office Christmas party

with her last week?

What? Oh, no.

Um, no, that was this other girl
I was dating.

Um, her name was Couch.

Did you just say couch,

but pronounce it strangely
so it sounded like a name?

What's going on, Brian?

(SIGHS) All right, look.

I've been crashing office
Christmas parties

for the free booze and drunk women

who don't want to spend
the holidays alone.

Oh, so, you're a Christmas party creep.

Just like the fat man
is a pool party creep.

Now, Chris, you're getting older.
So it's time for you to learn

the classic pool party game,

"Talk to somebody's wife in a bikini
until they cover up uncomfortably."

So, Bonnie, how are things going?

Oh, things are fine.

Been kind of busy lately.

What with Susie starting to...

Okay, bye.

I had her for two seconds.

Hey, Peter. What have you been
watching on TV lately?

Oh, you know, this and that.

There's a show called <i>Shipping Wars</i>
that's actually kinda...

Okay, bye.

Oh, boy.
The Marshals is now a Nordstrom.

I feel like our days at this mall
are numbered.

Well, we have $60.

Let's see what kind of Chinese
press board garbage we can get

to replace my grandmother's
priceless mahogany table.

Dad, look. Santa's here.

I want to sit on his lap.

Jeez, Christ. Come on.
You're in high school.

I'm gonna ask him for a family trampoline.

Holy crap. Get your ass up there.

(SIGHS) You know what, Peter,
I'll get the table myself.

And then I might just sit in that car
in the middle of the mall and cry.

Sheesh, look at this line.

Yeah, no kidding.
And it's not moving.

Me and my adopted son
have been waiting quite a while.

But... Why did you...

-I didn't even ask.
-So, is your son a biolog?

What? I'm not...

I don't watch <i>Modern Family,</i> sorry.

Chris, wait here.
I'm gonna see what's going on.

Hey, muscles, what's taking so long?

I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you,

but it turns out the seasonal Santa
we hired has a drinking problem.

And I don't where to find
a replacement on such short notice.

Hey, you're a hefty guy.

I called you "muscles".

Would you mind putting on the suit
and playing Santa?

Just until the shift ends.
I'd pay you for your time.

All right, fine.

It's not the first time
I pretended to be someone else.

I once dressed as a farmer
to get a date on farmersonly.com.

-Are you Peter?
-Yeah.

Are you the gross lady who lives
in the converted horse trailer?

(SINGING) <i>You don't have to be lonely</i>

<i>At farmersonly.com</i>

It doesn't say whites only, but, yeah...

'Sup? Slammin' pantsuit.

Hey, I'm Scott Fitzgerald.

You probably don't recognize me
'cause I'm in corporate.

So am I. This is corporate.

(CHUCKLES)
Little too much so if you ask me.

I try to have fun, right. I mean...

(STAMMERS) We're not landing planes here.

Our company manufactures
aircraft landing gear systems.

Yep. Mmm-hmm.

Well, I am gonna fly us over
a few more drinks.

(IMITATES PLANE ENGINE)

-Stewie, what are you doing here?
-I followed you.

I had to see for myself just how
desperate and pathetic you really are.

And don't worry, I'm not
sticking around this sad little...

Ooh, is that rolled up ham for everyone?

-Yeah.
-Okay.

Well, I'll see you at home...

WOMAN: Okay, everyone,
karaoke's starting.

Well, I can watch and make fun
for just a few...

Oh, my God.
They have a photo booth with funny props.

Oh, I call the big funny glasses!

MAN: (SINGING)
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock</i>

<i>Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring</i>

...and I want a tricycle, and a pony,

and an American girl doll,

and a drone with a camera,
and a gun that fires.

Ho, ho, ho. Yeah, sure. All of it.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

All right, now go pick up your picture.

And before you go crying to your mom,
that's my cellphone you're feeling.

Hey, Santa Claus.
You going home soon?

Oh, well, depending on how traffic is
at the North Pole.

(CHUCKLES)

So, what can I get for you today?
Milk and cookies?

(CHUCKLES) Okay, sorry I started this.
Chicken Burrito, please.

There you go. Merry Christmas!

Now, how much do I...

Oh, come on.
I'm not charging Santa Claus.

It's on the house.

This is free
because I'm dressed as Santa?

That's right. Anything for Santa.

Anything?

Holy crap! This is awesome.
I'm Santa Claus.

In this suit I'm like a god!

(SOBBING)

I got a free burrito.

(SIGHS) Look at these two lumps.

(SINGING) <i>Hop on the house top</i>
<i>Click, click, click</i>

<i>Slipped on the chimney</i>
<i>And broke his...</i>

Morning! Penis.

Dad, why are you
still wearing that Santa suit?

Well, the guy at the mall
asked me to stay on till Christmas

and I said yes,
because being Santa's awesome.

You wear this suit,
it's like a free pass.

-People let you do anything you want.
-What are you talking about?

Oh, it's the stuff of dreams, Lois.

Free burritos, free orange chicken,
free pretzels.

Did you make it out of the food court?

I made it to the border.

I got a free iPhone case
and a tiny license plate.

-It says Corey.
-Yep. Cost me zilch.

So, who's this Mary Christmas
everybody keeps talking about?

(LAUGHING)

That's very clever.

Yeah, I don't recognize you.
Which department are you in?

Well, right now I'm in boob assessment.

Ew.

Hey, you were right about office
Christmas parties. They're fantastic.

Uh-huh. Okay. I'm gonna keep looking
around the room while you talk.

Yes, it's like watching a soap opera.

What with all the drunken misbehavior
and ill-advised hookups.

And down the hall,
they're doing a white elephant.

Oh, that gift exchange thing?

No, there's a fat secretary
taking on all comers.

Where... Which office is that in?

Oh, you won't miss her.
She's still wearing the felt antlers.

Absolute freak show in there.

Hey, what the hell's going on?

Oh, Santa. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was your car.

That's right.
Now crumple up that ticket.

Now, eat it.

(GULPS)

All right, now we're gonna go
to your home and wait for you to pass it

and then you're gonna eat it again.

Hey, honey. This is Santa.

He's gonna come in
and watch me in the bathroom.

-Oh, just like the Easter bunny did.
-Exactly.

I got a lot of guys coming through here.

I lost my virginity to this song.

-Ugh, this party's a dud.
-Yeah, no kidding.

That lady turned off a Hall & Oates
song because it was too provocative.

WOMAN: Everyone, let's remember,
this is still a work place.

-MAN: Sorry, Barb.
-You know what? I got an idea.

I'm gonna stir up some drama,
make this party interesting.

(CLINKING)

Excuse me, uh,
can I have your attention please?

Hi, hi, I'm Chadwick Redmain
from the regional office.

Unfortunately, since people
only use printers now

to print out boarding passes
for their grandparents,

40 percent of you will be laid off
as of Monday.

Oh, and whoever drinks
the most shots keeps their job.

(ALL GASPING)

See, that's how you get a party started.

Mr. Redmain,
I don't know who you are,

but I've been in charge of this office
for 16 years.

-Sad.
-And I wanna thank you.

I've been trying to reduce our
staff costs for months,

but just didn't have the guts to do it,
much less before Christmas.

Yeah, well, that's why they send in
Channing Redwick or Chadmain or...

I don't even remember what I said.

We could use someone like you
around here.

Welcome aboard, see you Monday.

Wow, a paying grown up job!
I haven't been this excited about

anything since the night
<i>Wicked</i> premiered in Quahog.

All right, Brian,
let's rob these gay guys.

-What if they're home?
-They're not gonna be home.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

-WOMEN: Bye, Santa!
-Bye, strippers.

You can all take your clothes off now.

I was just coming in for the spaghetti.

(GRUNTS)

Bitch! Oh, that hurts!

I'm drunk, heart's beating fast.

(SQUELCHING)

Spaghetti Angel!
I'm making a spaghetti angel.

When Italian guys die, they turn into...
(MUMBLING)

(SNORING)

SANTA: Peter, Peter Griffin.

Peter, we need to talk.

-Who are you?
-I'm the real Santa Claus.

Awesome! Okay, my first wish
is for a thousand wishes. Yes!

That's not me, that's a genie.

Okay, then my first wish is for a genie.

Again, you'd need a genie.
How wasted are you?

-Don't judge me, you live in a bottle.
-It's a lamp.

And I'm not a genie!

All right, come on now, pal.
Seriously, who are you really?

I already told you, I'm Santa Claus.

Oh, yeah? Well, if you are Santa
then what did I ask for,

for Christmas when I was 12?

Nothing. Because it was the year
you found that <i>Penthouse</i> in the woods.

(GASPS) You really are Santa!

Am I really heavier than you?
I gotta take control.

Look, I'm not very happy with you.
You can't go around in that suit,

pretending you're me
and acting like a complete jackass.

What are you talking about?

People love me, they give me free stuff.

No, they love me.
You're just exploiting my brand

for personal gain
and destroying my reputation.

So there's like no toilet on the sleigh,

so you're just crapping
in people's houses, right?

You're not hearing me!

-Stop wearing that suit, or else...
-Or else, what?

Or else I will put you
at the top of my naughty list.

You know, you're not talking
to a little kid any more,

so get the hell out of my face, Santa.

I like this suit and I'm keeping it.

Now if you'll excuse me,

you're standing in my strip club
spaghetti.

I gotta get this home to my family
for supper.

You better watch out.

Gail, Gail! Is your Internet working?
Mine is slow.

(SOBBING)

Oh, my God, Gail, what happened?

I just found out I'm part of
the downsizing you announced.

Oh, no!

So your Internet, is it... is it slow?

Gail, you were supposed to be gone
an hour ago.

Hey, give her a break, man,
this is Gail Devereux Slansky.

Oh, it's just Gail Devereux now.

-Ugh, tough week.
-Why don't you stop rubber necking

and finish that payroll report
I asked for?

I can't believe I got fired.
And right before the holidays.

Oh, God, I've ruined Christmas.

Like the little drummer boy
when he got really into Neil Peart.

(ALL GASP)

Christmas is gonna be sick!

So, Dad, now that you made Santa mad,

aren't you scared that
he's gonna do something bad to you?

Ah, Santa's all talk.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

-Hey Peter, ready to go to Build-A-Bear?
-What? What're you talking about?

I got your text, it says, "Hey, Joe,

"cancel your plans,
let's go to Build-A-Bear."

I didn't send you a...

Oh, son of a bitch! Santa.
Joe, I did not send you a text.

Well, you sent another text that says,
"Hey, Joe, it's definitely me, Peter,

-"who sent the text".
-Damn it! He covered all bases.

What do you think, Peter?
Maybe a little sun hat for Cindy?

Whatever, I'm done with my bear.
Let's get out of here.

Well, the text you sent earlier
would disagree.

You said, "No matter what I say,
I wanna build multiple bears."

Joe, I swear to you
I do not wanna do that.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

News flash, Peter, looks like you do.

Would anyone like to lead the family
in a holiday prayer?

I'll tell ya who should be
saying his prayers, Santa!

He messes with me, I mess with him.

That's why I replaced
one of his flying reindeer with

an ordinary non magical one.

(GRUNTING)

Cut it off, cut it off!

(SQUEALING)

You know, I think this year
is gonna be the best...

Yay, free horse!

(DOOR BELL RINGS)

What the hell?
Hey, Chris, get in here!

This is impossible, right?
All of Meg's farts here in this box.

I would think that's impossible.

Yeah, right? That's impossible!

-Is this the box?
-Yeah, that's it.

-Yeah, that's impossible.
-I know, it's impossible.

Okay, all right, I'm opening it.

Unless whoever sent it was magic.

Oh, well, that's interesting.

Chad, we gotta talk about this report.

Why do you write
all your twos backwards?

Well, you know it's a two,
so why are we talking?

Fix it or you're fired.

You know what?
I thought working in a cubicle

at a midsized printing company
would be the adventure of a lifetime.

Instead, it's been nothing
but tedium and cruelty.

It's time to set things right.

Here you go, Warren, Merry Christmas.

Eleven thousand dollars?

Yes, it's the maximum check amount
I am authorized to cut. Cash it fast.

Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
Merry Christmas, cash it fast.

-Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
-Thanks, Chadwick.

-This is awesome!
-I think you mean "Happy holidays".

You gotta be kidding me.

(LAUGHS) This is too good.

(CHUCKLES)

Point Griffin.
Let's see you top... (GRUNTS)

Now you gonna listen?
Now you gonna listen, you little bitch?

-Whose suit are you wearing?
-Your suit!

-Whose suit?
-Your suit, it's your suit!

(PANTING AND SCREAMING)

Okay, okay, I'll never wear
that Santa suit again!

Just stop terrorizing me
and take me off the naughty list!

-You promise?
-Yes.

Thank you. I've always known you were
a good boy deep inside, Peter.

And just so you know, there are
no hard feelings. This is for you.

It's that <i>Penthouse</i> you found
in the woods.

(GASPS) With Vanessa Williams
and George Burns on the cover!

I'm glad you like it!

I had to buy it from
a really creepy guy on the Internet.

Look, Santa, I owe you an apology.

I'm sorry I took advantage
of your good name.

You spread so much joy and wonder
to kids everywhere,

and I just used that to get stuff
for myself.

Apology accepted, and truth is,
you weren't the worst Santa.

This was the worst Santa.

(LAUGHS) Oh, ho, ho, ho.

Oh, and that's another thing. It's...
"Ho, ho, ho."

Everybody pronounces it wrong,
it's very irritating.

(WHISTLES)

So long, Peter.
Glad to have you back on the nice list.

Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

How was marching band practice?

this is a pilot's uniform.

-(EXCLAIMING) Too far! Too far!
-MAN: Hold still.

Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.
You've earned your nickel this week.

-Where you coming from, Quagmire?
-I had to fly to Aruba,

so I brought my mom along
with my "friends and family" discount.

-Did you...
-Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.

Where do you even put
all those magnets, Joe?

You know I have that fridge in the garage
with bags of blood in my blood type.

What's "friends and family"?

Oh, airline employees can get discounted
tickets for family and close friends.

What? How come you've never
done that for us?

If I'm being honest, I've also got
a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.

I don't know. I guess I just figured
you guys always have to work

or you're with your kids,
but sure, I could take you somewhere.

I'm going to San Francisco next week.
You guys wanna come?

San Francisco?

That city from
<i>And the Band Played On</i> and <i>Milk?</i>

-I'm in.
-Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.

Oh, wow, this will be great.

Hey, can you make us X-Men?

What a surprise.

Well, I'm off to San Francisco
with the guys.

Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head
with the girls.

You what?

Peter, I told you about this
a month ago.

I'm going with Bonnie and Donna
to Donna's sister's timeshare.

We can't both go on a trip
at the same time.

I'm sorry, Peter,
but I already have a taxi waiting.

(SIGHS) All right, I'll go tell the guys
I'm not going.

Why is he taking his suitcase
to tell the guys?

You guys, come on, we gotta go now!
Let's go, move it!

QUAGMIRE: I'm in the shower!

It doesn't matter.
We're stealing Lois' cab.

Son of a... (SIGHS)

And the idiot took my suitcase.

Aw, he was taking me with him.

Ah, San Francisco.

(SCREAMS) San Francisco!

-So what are we gonna do first?
-I wanna see the Golden Gate Bridge.

-I wanna see Lombard Street.
-I wanna see Ghirardelli Square.

Guys, guys, let's get lesbian haircuts
and see 'em all!

All right, the gay jokes are out of

Okay, guys. "This is the original
Levi jeans factory

-Peter, Peter, calm down. It's okay.

Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan!

Hey, I know we just met
but can I sit on your lap

during your next post-game
press conference?

Sure. I don't see why not.

This is exciting
for the whole Bay area

to be just four games away
from the Championship.

Dad, I duked.

The other team's
not just gonna go away, though.

We've gotta stay focused,
keep doing what we've been doing.

Fat lady. Dad, Dad, a fat lady.

Yeah, I see her, Peter.

-Make her go.
-That's not how we talk to people.

-Make her go!
-WOMAN: I'll leave.

Yay! I'm learning bad lessons!

Wow. So that was San Francisco.

I didn't realize how hilly
it was gonna be.

Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.

Hey, no problem.
You know, we're here early.

-You guys want a little tour of the plane?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

Normally, I just go to Hudson News

and pretend to be
the most important guy there.

Can I help you?

Yes, I will have eight Dasanis
and a J.D. Power and Associates.

(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

Wow, this place is cool.

Yeah, what do all these buttons do?
Like, what's this red one?

That's a voice filter,
so the passengers always think

the pilot is a 60-year-old
Midwestern white man.

What? That's impossible.

Hi, y'all. This is Cleveland.

<i>Good afternoon, folks.</i>

<i>This is Captain Darrell Clarke</i>
<i>up here on the flight deck.</i>

We're way up in the air.

<i>We've reached our cruising altitude</i>
<i>of 37,000 feet.</i>

Y'all get ready to watch
<i>Big Momma's House.</i>

<i>Our in-flight entertainment today</i>
<i>will be</i> Under the Tuscan Sun.

-Oh, I like that.
-I hear it's good.

Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?

Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself
when I need a break.

What do you mean "a break"?
You don't have to fly the plane?

Of course, I do. I just take
a short break sometimes.

"Short break"? It looks like you had
time to put together

the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.

You don't have to touch it, Joe.
You can just say you noticed it.

-And what's this booth over here?
-Oh, that's my "back in time" box.

I go inside,
magically go back in time,

and then come out and react
to the fact that we're flying.

My God, we're levitating!

-That's just a box full of costumes.
-It's my "back in time" box!

What the hell, Quagmire?

So basically, your job
is just goofing off.

-That's not true.
-I broke Gandalf in half.

It's Dumbledore.

Screw you guys!
You know, being a pilot is hard work.

Look, I tried to be nice
and take you fellas on a free trip.

And all you could do
is crap all over my job!

I was a Navy Pilot, you jerks.
Get the hell out of my cockpit!

Joke's on him. I farted
just before he kicked us out.

QUAGMIRE: Oh... Oh, God!

All right, let's see what's in

All right, time to use the potty.

Don't say "potty." You're an adult.

Okay, nobody move!

Oh, my God,

Cleveland, just be happy with what
you have. Don't envy people.

No, Peter, we're being hijacked.
Close the cockpit door!

This plane now belongs to us.

You move, you're dead.
So nobody try to get smart.

Hmm, page 100. Hmm.

Control tower, this is flight 364.

We have a hijacking in progress.
Our flight has been...

(RADIO STATIC)

Damn it, they jammed the transmission.

I'm gonna have to go
to the backup communication system.

QUAGMIRE: <i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

<i>This is flight 364.</i>
<i>We're being hijacked.</i>

I can hear you... (GRUNTS)

This is your last chance.
Open the door or your copilot gets it.

No! I'm landing
at the closest airfield

which is less than an hour away.

So just let him go, 'cause you're
not getting control of this plane!

-(GROANS)
-(ALL GASP)

QUAGMIRE: Jimmy! Oh, my God!

Why are you doing this?

America needs to be punished

for supporting the other side
of my country's civil war.

-Which country?
-Do you really wanna know

or are you just asking because
we're gonna be on the plane for a while

and you think
you should make small talk.

The second thing.

Open the door
or I'll start executing passengers!

(ALL GASPING)

Man, coming on this trip
was a terrible idea.

What's it gonna be?

Are you going to open this door
or am I going to start killing people?

QUAGMIRE: I'm not opening it.

Excuse me, I'd just like to ask
the mom behind me

who told me to stop watching
<i>Game of Thrones</i> on my laptop,

if I'm still the worst person
on this plane?

You, fat guy, get up here!

(EXCLAIMS)

(GRUNTS)

Last chance. Open the door
or this idiot gets it.

Don't open it, Quagmire.
It's not worth it.

-QUAGMIRE: Okay.
-Wait... Wait, what? That was quick.

I'm sorry, Peter, but I have
to think about the whole plane.

There's over 150 passengers
back there,

several of whom
are in our commander's club,

and to them, I'd like to issue
a special welcome.

Oh, man, we gotta help Peter.

Those crazy European guys
are gonna kill him.

You know, I have a gun
in the bag I checked.

If we can get to the galley,

we can take the elevator down
to the cargo hold.

Good idea, Joe.

Oh, man, it feels like we're in
one of those hijacking movies.

You're right, it does.

There's even an impatient businessman
who really wants to reach his destination,

so he can conduct more business.

Can't you see how important I am?

My shirt is blue
but the collar is white.

It's the same shirt!

Quick. He's distracted.

Get off my plane.

Get off my plane.

-What's that now?
-Hmm? Nothing.

Always bet on black.

Always bet on black.

-Did you say something?
-I don't think so.

BOTH: Double trouble!

That's it, we found it.

What the hell? Hey!

Two of the passengers are missing.

Okay, you guys watch the main cabin.
I'll go find them.

I'll take this fat guy
as a human shield.

Oh, nice. Last guy picked for dodgeball,
first guy for human shield.

Everybody be quiet.
There's another update.

(ALL CHEERING)

Oh, my God. You guys did it.
We're saved!

Yep. We wrapped this up quicker
than the treaty-signing at Appomattox.

So if I sign this, the war is over,

we surrender and we still
get to be dicks forever?

(LAUGHS) Okay, you win.

You can all relax now, everybody.

We're ten minutes away from landing
in an airfield in Nevada.

Looks like you'll make
that business meeting after all.

Great. Thanks for keeping us
in the sky, boys.

Now, reach for it.

-You're one of the hijackers, too?
-Yes.

I was in reserve
in case the plan went awry.

And now I can finally get into
the cockpit and execute our plan,

crashing this plane into the ultimate
symbol of American materialism,

Las Vegas.

You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas

but I never thought
I'd lose my life there.

-Did you just think of that?
-Yeah, just now.

You know, you are
seriously funny, man.

I know I crap on you a lot
but sometimes when I'm driving,

I think about
stuff you say and I laugh.

-Thank you, Peter.
-No, thank you.

Very good. We are less than 20 minutes
from Las Vegas.

Get ready to say goodbye
to your precious Rita Rudner.

Is your plan just to kill Rita Rudner?

No, we're going to crash
into the biggest hotel on the Strip.

Killing Rita Rudner will just be
the custard on the dumpling.

You know, we never quite nailed down
what region you guys are from.

Oh, look, there's one guy
who slept through this whole thing.

Hey, buddy, wake up.
We're all about to die.

What? What are you talking about?

Yeah, I thought I should wake you up.
Nobody wants to die in their sleep.

Oh, my God. No! I have a family!

There you go.

Only a few more minutes
until your country pays

for its imperialistic sins.

Us? What about you?

Like, how come you Eastern European
guys can't be quieter in pornos?

I mean, nobody's ever been, like,
"Yeah, yeah, more guy noises."

They ask us to do that to cover up
the sound of children playing nearby.

Now shut up and get ready to die!

So, uh...

-You ever been to Vegas before?
-No.

Well, I think you're gonna
flip for it!

Yeah!

Attention, passengers, the plane...

(ALL GROANING)

Oh, come on! Doesn't anybody
pay attention to the sign?

That was some quick thinking, Glenn.

And look, even that plane
with all the missiles is impressed.

Missiles? That's a military fighter jet.

He's here to shoot us down!

-Or she.
-What?

They must think the hijackers
still control the plane.

And our communications are jammed,

so we can't even tell them
everything's okay.

Don't worry, I'll signal to him.

Hey, we knocked out all the bad guys.

See, we don't need your help.

We kicked their asses
and we have their guns.

Wow, Quagmire,
thanks for saving all of our lives.

We're sorry for saying
your job was easy.

Yeah, you're the best damn pilot
in the world.

He's right.
What you did up there was amazing.

Thanks, guys. That means a lot.

-That was quite a trip, wasn't it?
-It sure was.

And we learned a lot about blue jeans,
didn't we, guys?

-Yes, yes, we did.
-That's right, Peter.

Thank you for planning
a wonderful day.

No, it's a serious problem.

Nowadays any moron
can just order a drone online.

-Oh.
-There's no regulation.

Oh!

And most of them have cameras so
people can spy on whoever they want

-and invade their privacy.
-Oh!

Peter, are you ordering a drone right now?

You bet your ass I am.
Ownin' a drone is gonna be a blast.

Even more fun
than when I had breakfast in bread.

Hi, Lois, it's a great morning.
No matter how you slice it.

I don't know what this is, Peter,

but we're four months behind
on our mortgage.

Well, that's odd.
It's not like we're short on dough.

I'm taking the kids and I'm staying
at my parents for a while.

That's the yeast of my concerns.

Oh, Brian, you finally made it.
I'm having a tea party, sit down.

Yeah, you texted me, like, 80 times.

Look, Stewie, I don't have time to sip air

and pretend to eat
a wooden hamburger patty.

Yeah? Tell me why you don't have time.

All right, I have time.

And there's nothing pretend about this.

Real tea, real milk, and the best honey

you'll ever taste in your whole life.

Wow, this is good.

-Where'd you buy the honey?
-I didn't, I'm raising bees.

You're raising bees? Like a beekeeper?

Yup. Mom missed soccer registration,
so this is my weekends.

Mmm. I gotta say, you're good at it.

You know,
you could probably sell this stuff.

Really? You think it's that good?

Yeah, plus it's local,
it's straight from the hive.

People at farmers' markets
would go nuts for this.

You know, you could
probably charge, like, $20-30 a jar.

Now I'm excited about this, Brian.

I feel like an eighth grader who
just had sex.

-So, you go all the way?
-Oh, yeah.

I'm gonna need some proof.

Hmm. How can I prove it?

So, Brian, this is my hive.

Now how many bees
do you think are in here?

I don't know, a million?

No, it's 4,000.

Now that seems like nothing
because of your idiot million guess.

All right, now, if you're going
to sell honey at the farmers' market,

you need to practice.

So you be the salesman
and I'll be the customer.

Ooh, what do we have here?

Uh, honey, like the sign says.

I find your attitude cavalier.
May I speak to your manager?

Stewie, come on.

I'm sorry, is there a problem here?

I was just in the back
and I heard a commotion.

How do we have a back?

I simply came here to inquire about honey

and your employee spoke to me loudly
and with profanity.

Stewie, this is ridiculous.

Brian, please. I trust that
this handsome young customer knows

what he's talking about.

Oh, my. And I thought
only bees pour on the honey.

I'm goin' inside.

So, are you from around here?

No, I'm just in town
for the John Singer Sargent exhibit

at the museum.

(GASPS) Really? I've been looking

Well, you were right.
The farmers' market is wonderful.

You've got your yoga-pants moms,

you've got your mixed-race kids

riding a pony, a confused Jerome.

What is this, a vegetable parking lot?

Now remember to tell customers
that this honey is farm-to-table.

We're not a restaurant,
that doesn't make any sense.

Doesn't have to.
Say "anything-to-anything,"

people lose their minds.

Just so you know,
this is all grass-to-bottle.

-Ooh.
-I know, right? That'll be $68.

-Is this a super food?
-Total super food. Full of GMOs.

-GMOs are bad.
-No GMOs whatsoever.

Amazing.

Wow, this is great.
We've only been here an hour

and we're almost totally sold out.

Yes, I didn't see that coming.

Just like Dan Cortese
didn't see the end of the '90s coming.

ALL: Three, two, one!

Happy New Year!

-(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Grovers, you made it. Here, have a beer.

Thanks. Hey, Gronk,

you know, there's something
I always wanted to ask you.

When you know you have single coverage,

do you give a hand signal to Brady
or is it just eye contact?

I don't know, wanna see me dance?

Well, I ask, because sometimes
you're being covered by a little guy,

and then you and Brady
will look at each other, and...

Am I... Am I supposed to touch you?

What am I... What am I doing here?

Oh, I'm sorry, bro, what was the question?

I just want to know if you and Brady

have, like, a secret hand signal
or something?

Whoa, that is top secret,
but lean in, and I'll tell you.

(BURPS)

How rude.

Hey, wanna meet my family?
These are my brothers.

Actually, one of them is my dad.
I'm not sure which.

Probably the gray-haired one
with the whiskey face sunburn.

Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.
You must be very proud.

Hell yeah. I think every dad's dream
is takin' his son's sloppy seconds.

Is your mom here too?

They don't have a mom.

My ex-wife raised them, God bless her.

But genetically, they're a product
of me blammin' on to a side of beef.

All right, since we sold out so fast,

we gotta make
these bees more productive.

-Get them to make more honey.
-How're we gonna do that?

Steroids, Brian.

This here is the same stuff

that turned Barry Bonds' head
into a prize-winning squash.

Okay, well, how much
are we supposed to give them?

Hmm. It says this is enough for a horse.
So...

I don't know, how many bees is a horse?

Boy, you can't fit a horse in this box,
so I'd just use the whole thing.

That makes sense.

Barry Bonds says that's too much steroids.

Time for bed, Barry.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(ALL CHEERING)

God, they're still goin'?

Peter, this is exactly
what I told you would happen.

-Not so much fun anymore, is it?
-(APPLAUSE)

Loud noise, noise, and a Civil War cannon.

Hey, Grover, catch.

-(MUSIC PLAYING)

Uh, listen, Gronk, um,
it's gettin' kind of late.

Don't you think
maybe it's time to call it a night?

Yeah, sure.
Hey, you ever seen a nard explode?

A what? A "nard"?

I don't... Is that something
on the Internet? 'Cause I...

-Oh, damn it, what the hell!
-(ALL LAUGHING)

MAN: Nice shot there.

Come on, don't get mad, bro.
I was just kidding.

You were kidding? What was the joke?

-This was.
-Oh, damn it, you hit the seam.

-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Oh! Yeah.

You know what? You're a jerk, Gronk.

That's it. I'm getting rid
of that bastard.

Just like I helped
kick the British out of America.

This tyranny shall not stand.

For without liberty...

Oh, crap, he's even in the cutaways.

(GROANS)

Just... Just go to commercial.

I'm gonna squat here
and hold on to this bench.

-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Peter, you gotta figure somethin' out.

They haven't stopped partying
the whole night.

MAN 1: Yeah!
MAN 2: Gronk!

MAN 3: Party!
MAN 4: On the deck.

I'm sorry, you were right all along.
But don't worry, I'll take care of it.

Well, you better do something soon.
I can't live like this.

I know. That guy's more annoying
than going to an Italian restaurant

with someone who's been to Italy.

They call this a trattoria?
More like a <i>ristorante</i> to me.

Look at that fresco.
Supposed to be the hills of Elba.

Not once you've seen 'em.

-Are you ready to order?
<i>-Si.</i>

Let me handle this, Peter.
Two spaghettis and a chicken fingers.

God, look at all the honey the bees made.

Those steroids were a great idea, Stewie.

Hey, look, that bee's trying
to get our honey.

Okay, Mr. Bee, we'll give you
the employee discount.

After all you... Oh!

Holy crap, that thing
just lifted a whole jar of honey.

Oh, God. Do you think
that's one of our steroid bees?

Well, this one's wearing
a hoodie as a shirt,

so, yeah, I think these are ours.

Stewie, I have a bad feeling about...

Oh, God, it just ate the other bee!

Okay, so a few of them
had a bad reaction to... Oh, crap.

(BEES BUZZING)

Oh, my God. Brian, run!

I think, maybe giving
those bees steroids was a bad idea.

-(GASPS)
-Turn on the wipers.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

-You're sure this is gonna work, Peter?
-Absolutely.

Gronk went to the University of Arizona.

And everyone who went
to the University of Arizona

believes leprechauns are real.

And since Cleveland already owns
a green suit and a top hat...

This is my Easter clothes.

Whoa! A leprechaun.

Say the thing.

(IN IRISH ACCENT) Top of the morning
to you, Mr. Gronkowski.

Have you any interest in a pot of gold?

All you have to do is move to Tallahassee.

Wait a minute, this is just a disguise.

(SCREAMS) Son of a bitch!

What's goin' on here?
Are you guys tryin' to get rid of me?

-Yeah, we're tryin' to get rid of you!
-Why?

'Cause you're a pain in the ass
to live next to.

I mean, what the hell, Gronk,
why you gotta be like this?

You're a millionaire.

You've the sweetest job in the world.
You could do whatever you want.

Why you gotta act like
such an idiot all the time?

It's not a choice, Grover,
but rather, an obligation.

You see, I've been groomed for this
my entire life.

Scoring touchdowns, making people laugh.

Punishing my body, enduring the pain.

All in the name of entertainment.

Don't you understand? I'm a commodity.
A product, a modern-day gladiator.

You ask about the whys
and the wherefores

behind the boorish facade.

The answer is simple.

I play the jester
because society deems it necessary.

Also, I'm fuckin' insane.

(LAUGHING)

Eat a butt, fatty.
Gronk ain't going nowhere.

-Oh, that's it!
-(ALL GRUNTING)

Oh, cool, we're partyin'?

You guys mind if I eat while
I beat you up?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

What the hell are we supposed to do?
We're surrounded.

Hang on, I've got this.

"Meg, come outside. We have Pinkberry."

(SCREAMING) Ow, ow. Stop. Stop it!

All right, they're distracted. Let's go!

Quick! We just have to get rid
of the queen.

-She's in the hive.
-What's that gonna do?

The bees instinctively stay
with the queen.

So if she's gone, they'll follow her.

Okay, great, but how are we gonna do it?

You guys are bad fighters.

That's his third sub.

Oh, cool. Honey rain.

Ah! Oh my God, is that a bee?
You have bees here?

Uh, yeah, it's the world.

(BEES BUZZING)

Holy crap, there's a ton of them.

Dad, start up the party bus. We're moving.

-MAN: Bees?
-Yeah, bees.

And they're showing blitz.
We gotta leave on two.

You think their Wi-Fi is "Badge down"?

Yeah, that's probably them.

Look at that, no password.

Thank goodness, we finally
have our neighborhood back.

Yeah, now maybe Wilson can move back in

and give me homespun wisdom
over the fence.

Peter, that was <i>Home Improvement.</i>

Probably.
But I don't wanna think about it.

I know for a fact they do.

I spend most of my day
breaking up in-progress homeless sex.

Oh, it stank all right.

Why do they got to be so big?

Yeah, and why does their menu have ads?

I go there for dinner,
not to shop for appliances.

Hey, you know what, guys?

This right here,
this rambling boring conversation

containing already-made-before
observations,

this could be a podcast.

Ah. It's actually not a bad idea.

Really? A podcast?

Don't you have to be
some sort of whiz kid to do those?

Uh, definitely not.
Anyone with a computer can make one.

Well, that's it. We're anyone.

Let's do a podcast
from right here in the booth.

-Who's in?
-Yeah, sure.

-Let's do it!
-Is it happening?

-Are we doing it now?
-Awesome.

We haven't done anything as a group
since we went bird-watching.

PETER: (IN A LOW VOICE) Guys, look.
It's the yellow-headed puffin face.

GUYS: Ooh!

PETER: It's a solitary creature.

Its feathered crown is designed
to scare away mates.

QUAGMIRE: It's known to swell its face
to assert dominance when threatened.

CLEVELAND: What does it eat, Peter?

PETER: Gin and whatever is in the bowl
at the airport bar.

I said, damn, what a wild couple of days.

Anyways, 'sup with you guys?

Sorry, <i>amigo,</i> not interested.

This is what happens
when you lick your spilled latte

off the steering wheel.

Lois, are you okay?

(THROUGH BLOCKED NOSE)
Ugh, yeah, it's just my allergies.

They've been awful.

(SNIFFLES) I can't figure out what it is.

(SNEEZES)

Maybe it's Brian.
He practically sleeps on top of you.

You could be allergic to him.

Hey, here's an idea, Chris.
Why don't you mind your own business?

You know, I did read that people
could develop allergies to their pets.

Brian, maybe you shouldn't sleep
in our bedroom for a little while.

What? Well, then where
am I supposed to sleep?

How about in your own apartment
like a grown-up?

Do you have a problem with me, Chris?

Why don't you sleep in Stewie's room?
There's plenty of space.

Roomies? Dude, this'll be so ill!

-Who are you?
-I'll tell you who.

Your new roommate.

(SNEEZES) Ugh.

I'm gonna go take a shower,
so I can blow my nose into my hands.

(GRUNTS) Damn it! I hate this house.

-Morning, honey.
-LOIS: Go to hell.

All right, you guys. Podcast time.

We got the equipment
and the perfect business plan.

Give our show away for free,
and tell no one how to find it.

Ready?

Hey there, the Net.

Welcome to the first episode
of <i>Thanks for the Clammeries.</i>

-I'm here with Glenn Quagmire.
-Hi.

Cleveland Brown.

-And...
-Hello.

-(SIGHS) And Joe Swanson.
-Yowzaa!

All right, Quagmire, what've
you got for us?

Let's make a clammery.

Okay, this is "Yes or no."
Are you ready, Peter? Yes or no.

-French toast.
-Yes.

-French fries.
-Yes.

-French kissing.
-I don't know.

These questions are weird.
Okay, okay, someone else.

Cleveland, yes or no?

-Velcro shoes.
-Hmm. Velcro shoes.

Ooh-wee, that's a tough one.

I remember the first time
I saw me a pair of 'cros.

They were on the feet of Spunkytessie.
Man, they was dandies.

Every time we played touch football,

Spunky would step in a pile of dog poo.

You can wash a shoe,
but you can't really wash a lace.

That's why Spunky made the change...

That's the thing about Velcro shoes.

Quiet going on, noisy coming off.

That rip! Monkey's mama thought
he was an intruder.

Shot him right in the face.

Had an open casket at the funeral,

but only open on the middle part.

To this day,
every time I see a pile of dog doo,

I take a step in it just for Spunky.

So to answer the question,
I'm gonna have to say both yes and no.

(SIGHS) All right,
that's all the time we got.

I'd like to thank our sponsor,
the US Postal Service.

When you want something expensive
thrown on your porch and stolen,

you want the US Postal Service.

What the hell was that?

I know. Cleveland,
you ruined the whole podcast.

Yeah, if I wanted to hear
a black guy ramble like a lunatic,

I'd watch <i>Family Feud.</i>

Yeah, I mean,
that was worse than an Italian guy

describing someone's sexuality.

Anyway, my brother Louie, he's a...

He's a little off to the side, you know?

Uh, foofie. Uh, up to the knuckle.
He's a... He's a backwards mechanic.

-Likes to play in the dirt.
-You mean gay?

-(SOBS) No!
-Mama! <i>Marone,</i> Peter!

Mama, Louie's not gay.
He's... He's creative.

Hey, Stewie, thanks for letting me
stay in your room.

Oh, Brian, please. It's our room now.

Hey, what are we gonna do tonight?

Maybe we should watch that movie
about Freud where Michael Fassbender

repeatedly spanks
Keira Knightley to orgasm.

-You saw that movie?
-I saw that scene.

(WHISTLES)

So, I was thinking this could
be your area.

Okay, yeah. Yeah, this is great.

And, fair warning,
some of the books are pop-up.

-So don't be alarmed.
-Argh! Son of a bitch!

Freaking bird came out of nowhere.

You know, I have a good feeling
about this, Brian.

After all, you certainly can't be any
worse than the last roommate I had.

-What the...
-Please don't cry.

She's already very angry at me.

LOIS: Peter, where are you?

You will wash your hands after you poop.

(SHUSHING)

I won't.

You know, this is exciting.
Our second podcast.

All right, but listen up, Cleveland.

No more of your long stories, all right?

Yeah, people aren't used to boring
podcasts.

Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose
they ought to call me "jelly."

'Cause sometimes, I get on a roll.

That.
(STUTTERS) None of that.

Welcome once again
to <i>Thanks for the Clammeries.</i>

Okay, common question
that everybody thinks about.

How many fourth graders
you think you could take at once?

What?

I mean, obviously,
if you had to fight against

a million fourth graders, you'd lose.

So, like, what's the real number?

Like, what's the legitimate number
of fourth graders

that you could successfully take on?

Let's say 100. That sounds reasonable.

Oh, no way. One hundred and you're dead.

-Why are we fightin' now?
-'Cause they're idiots.

-Did they say something about my mother?
-What...

Yes. Okay, yeah. We'll say yes.

Oh, then a baker's dozen.

What kind of weapons?

Only what's available in the schoolyard.

You can really mess up some kids
with the chain from a swing.

Just... Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

I'll tell you what I'd do?

I'd back into a bathroom stall
and just start kickin'.

Dead, dead, dead! Keep comin'. Dead.

Give 'em a narrow entry point.
Make 'em come in single file.

Dead! Anyway, I guess
I'm trying to say 800 fourth graders.

Why are we talkin' about killing kids?

People are gonna hate this.
Peter, do something else quick.

(STUTTERS) Uh...

What if I play some kickass music?

<i>You got to know when to hold her</i>

"Kickass"? This is not kickass.

Hang on, hang on. I'll find something.

(TWO SONGS PLAYING SIMULTANEOUSLY)

You're playing two songs at once.
What even is this?

I don't know. I'm just pressing buttons.

I gotta admit, it does have a groove.

Look, those people are even dancin' to it.

<i>Every gambler knows</i>
<i>that the secret to survivin'</i>

Oh, great. I accidentally started
Chris's birth video.

LOIS: <i>Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!</i>

<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

<i>Help me!</i>

Hey, what's that song you're playing?

I don't know, it's just random garbage
from my computer.

-Oh, you're a DJ. That's perfect.
-(MUSIC STOPS)

I own a nightclub
for cocaine people and Armenians.

I need noise. You available?

-We're in!
-Great.

I'll see you guys Wednesday at 2:00 a.m.

What the hell was that?
We're supposed to be doing a podcast.

Peter, I don't know if you'd noticed,
but the podcast was a disaster.

Yeah, and we were looking
for something to do as a foursome.

But how can I be a DJ?

I'm just a guy with a laptop
and an inflated self-image.

Trust me, you're perfect.

All right, sounds good. Let's do this.

Okay, but hold on.
I got four quarters on Golden Tee.

(GRUNTS) How am I doin'?

Good job, Joe. A hole in one.

-He just keeps switching clubs.
-(BALL WHIRRING)

Kids, time for dinner.
Where's your father?

I think he's getting ready for his DJ gig.

His what?

(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Hmm. Still a trace of melody.

I'll just add some power tools.

-(DRILL WHIRRING)
-(BELL RINGING)

Yeah. Yeah, I'd drink
vodka and Gatorade to that.

Peter, since when are you a DJ?

Since some guy came in The Clam
and heard my awesome jams and beats.

Well, he's got the lingo down.

Thanks, Chris. Now scream!

(SCREAMS)

Hey, you are good at this, Dad.

Peter, knock it off.
You're a middle-aged man.

You can't be a DJ.

Why not? I could totally be a DJ.

For God's sake, John Travolta is a pilot.

JOHN TRAVOLTA:

Whoa, what's all this?

Just some stuff I got out of my
storage unit.

Check this out, you'll love this.

Do I look like a <i>Terminator</i> dog?

-No.
-Yeah, I do.

Look, I even brought
Tom Sizemore's <i>Game of Life.</i>

(SPINNER RATTLES)

"Sell rights to <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>
residuals

"to buy a case of Coors Light."

"Steal your son's wallet
while he's in the shower."

"Miss audition."

"Scoop someone's urine

"to pass drug test."

moving these pieces backwards.

into a compliment about yourself.

Well, I'm on cocaine.

My kid's baseball team
came in second place.

I don't care about that.

But listen, there's a big

You've got some mad DJ skills.
You could be our headliner.

"Electric Clam Festival"?

Yeah, it's gonna be awesome.
So, what do you say?

I don't know. I should probably check
with the guys and see what they...

What? You don't need the guys.

I didn't see their fingers
press three buttons.

Ah. I guess I do have a gift.

-So, are you in?
-Yeah, that'd be amazing.

-Can I kiss you?
-Excuse me?

I don't know. Someone gave me a pill,

and now all I want to do is feel
your jacket.

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Ah.

No, no! Stay here, stay here.

You can't hear that on the CD.
Only the vinyl, man.

I'm glad we hung out
after you struck out with my mom.

You know, I could have used some help
folding these fitted sheets.

-Who's this turd?
-Oh, this is Georgie.

Brian, I never said you could have guests.

Hey, don't touch that!

Okay, red flags flying.
Look, I need him out of here.

You can't kick him out, he's my friend,

and I live here too.

Not anymore! I want you out of my room.

Well, it's not your room anymore.
It's our room.

Lois said so. And I'm not leaving.

I can't believe I ever wanted you here
in the first place.

You're messy, you're loud,

and thanks to you,
we've got a recurring Flea problem.

(SLAP BASS PLAYING)

Hey, Bri! You wanna hang out?

Go away, Flea! You're not welcome here!

And put on a shirt. You're 50!

Actually, 54.

(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Peter, I was plowing
this college chick last night,

and I saw this flyer on her mini-fridge.

I thought we were all in this together.

Well, yeah, that's the thing.

A guy on cocaine told me I am the talent.

So, what, you just droppin' us?

Yeah, how could you just ditch us?

All right, you know what?
You guys were riding my coattails.

I carried you as long as I could.

But Rob Kardashian
is gonna be at this thing.

So I gotta be at my best.

Now, get out of here. I gotta practice.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Damn it, Peter, that's too loud!
Turn it down!

That isn't loud. This is!

(MUSIC CONTINUES LOUDLY)

It's not loud until you can feel
your head bones.

If you can't hack it, take a hike.

Why is he being such a jerk?

I don't know. We've always had
each other's backs.

Like when we used to rob banks
in lesser-known presidents' masks.

All right, remember to tell everyone
who did this!

Um, who are you guys supposed to be?

Oh, come on. I'm James K. Polk.

He's Millard Fillmore,
he's William Henry Harrison.

JOE: First president to die in office.

You should have been FDR.

-Why?
-'Cause of the...

-You know.
-The wheelchair doesn't define me!

And I'm Grover Cleveland.
It's funny 'cause my name's Cleveland.

Oh, damn it, Cleveland.
Now we gotta kill 'em all.

This guy gets it first.

(ALARM BEEPING)

Ugh. Didn't you hear the alarm?

Peter, wake up!
We're gonna be late for church.

Are you even listening to me?

You've got to stop coming home so late
if you can't get up in the morning...

Oh, God! I can't hear Garfield!

I've gone deaf!

All right, now, how long
has your husband smelled like this?

Oh, no, that's just from riding here
in a hot car.

But, Dr. Hartman, what about his hearing?

"Hearing"?
This is a hospital, I'm not a lawyer.

Oh, for God's sake, is my husband deaf?

Well, there's only one way
to find out definitively.

Hey, stupid deaf guy!

Well, I've gotten the results back.
He's deaf.

This is horrible. This must be
because of all that loud blaring music

he's been playing in those nightclubs.

(LOUDLY) What's going on?

Can he fix it in time for me
to DJ at the music festival?

-No.
-What?

-No!
-What?

-Are you sure?
-Yes!

What?

(CHUCKLES) Have a good life.

Hey, guys. I don't know
if you've heard, but I've gone deaf.

-You what?
-What?

Oh, you're ear-crippled?

I can't hear you, Joe.
Here's a bag of Alpha-Bits.

Please spell out what you're sayin'.

There's no Ls.

By the way, I ate all the Ls.

They're delicious.
They're my favorite ones.

What're you talking about?
They all taste the same.

-What?
-Why don't you just text it to him?

You know, that's a good idea.

"What the hell do you want?

"You told us you were a big-shot DJ,

"and didn't want anything to do with us."

-(SENT MESSAGE CHIMES)
-(PETER'S CELL PHONE CHIMES)

I don't think he can hear it.

Oh, son of a bitch! Look at your phone!

Oh, what do I want?

Um, the Electric Clam Festival
is coming up and I need your help.

Now that I'm deaf,
I can't do it without you guys.

Forget it! You told us to go to hell.

Well, now, you can go to hell.

Oh, great. Thanks.
I knew I could count on you guys.

-No, we said no!
-What?

One, two, thr... Ah, crap.

One, two... Come on.

All right, this time for the world record.

(SNARLING)

Ew! What the hell is that?

It's a ferret. Look at it, Brian.

It's like a long rat.

Like a living tail. Look at its feet.

Ew, they're gross.
Why did you get a ferret?

All the worst roommates have ferrets.

You want to pet it? It bites.

I can't sleep with that monster in here.

That's the idea. I want you out.

This room belongs to me
and the ferret now.

Why are you being such a dick about this?

Because you're a pain in the ass
to live with!

What did you just do?

I just pushed a little bitch baby.

-STEWIE: Argh!
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

Brian, there you are. I wanted to tell you

that you can come back
and sleep in our room.

What? I can?

Yeah, it turns out it was Peter
who was causing my allergies.

He stuffed all our pillows with hay

because he thought
it looked comfortable in cartoons.

Well, then, I guess I'm moving out.

I guess you are.

(SIGHS) Look, Stewie, I probably
got a little carried away.

I'm sorry I wasn't the best roommate.

Hey, Brian?

You know, maybe I wasn't
such a great guy either.

I'm sorry.

Ah, that's okay.

You know, even if we were bad roommates,

we'll always be good friends.

I hope you and your ferret
are happy in here together.

Well, now that you're moving out,

I'll probably just drown it in the tub.

-(SNARLS)
-Argh!

Brian! Brian!

It bit my nose!

-He's latching on!
-Stop moving. I almost got him.

Fill the tub! Fill the tub!

Hey, Stella, can I ask you something?

When you went deaf,
did your other senses get better?

No, that's a common myth.

Chances are you'll be hit by a bus
in the first three months.

What?

Oh, damn it, being deaf sucks!

I'd rather be stuck on a Disney cruise.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

Don't eat the shrimp. Ho-ho!

(SIGHS) You know, the worst part
of all of this is I lost my friends.

I was a complete jerk to 'em.

I don't blame them
for not wanting to help me.

What?

QUAGMIRE: We heard you, Peter.

Hey, Peter! We're over here.

You gotta throw something at him.

(STRAINING) <i>Yup.</i>

Well, bad news.

'Cause of that audiobook fiasco,
I got fired from the club.

Hey, what's with your voice?
Did you get your hearing back?

Oh, yeah, turns out
it wasn't the loud music at the clubs

that made me go deaf.

It was the fistfuls of OxyContin.

Well, that stinks about your DJ job.

Sorry it didn't work out for you.

Yeah, it's okay.

I just appreciate that
you guys were there for me,

and tried to help me out.

Especially after I'd been such
a jerk to you.

Well, it's good to have you
back to normal, Peter.

Hey! Jessica Chastain.

I'm glad you finally agreed to have
the cataract surgery, Daddy.

I wish I hadn't, I can't see
anything now. This is terrible.

Well, that... That's why
the whole family came to support you.

Oh, really?

Oh, wow, that's so kind. Who's here?

Oh, uh, well, as you know, I'm here.

-Who else?
-Stewie and Brian.

Hey, hope you feel better soon.

That doesn't sound like the whole family.

(MIMICS PETER) Hey, hope those eyes
get better soon, Pop.

It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.

-Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.
-(MIMICS CHRIS) I'm here too, Grandpa.

And, uh... And Meg went down
to, to put money in the meter.

Ah, I don't care.

Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
your vision will be impaired

for a few weeks while you recover.

I recommend you and your wife
have someone around

to help you during this time.

Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy,

but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.

-He's constantly crying for no reason.
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

Ow! Bitch!

(SOBS) She does this a lot.

You know? Maybe Brian could help you.

He could be your service dog.

Come on, Lois, I don't want to do that.

Your father and I have nothing in common.

Brian, please.

If you do this for me,
you'll be a hero just like King Arthur

when he pulled the sword from the stone.

(STONE FARTS)

Oh, yeah.

Whoo! Oh, God, this is embarrassing.

I'm so sorry, it's been, like, 500 years.

Ah, this is your big moment
and I'm ruining it.

(PLAYING DISCORDANT NOTES)

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

I'm learning violin.
It's kind of like my new hobby.

Well, if we're talking
about new hobbies...

-What is it?
-It's a mason jar

filled with layered sand.

You can put it in your bathroom
or anywhere you want to feel peaceful.

Now it's nothing.

I always liked the violin

'cause it kind of has curves like a lady.

Hey, you know what? Maybe you guys
can learn an instrument too,

and then we could all play together.

Really? That sounds like a lot of work.

Yeah, no offense, <i>muchacho,</i>

but I don't know
if I have time for that, <i>muchacho.</i>

Yeah, you're doing <i>muchacho</i> wrong.

Come on, guys, it could be cool.

I did play the oboe in high school
and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.

Girls do like guys in a band.

I'm in, giggity.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, Quagmire,
you are so predictable,

and that's why I love you, <i>muchacho.</i>

See, that's how you do <i>muchacho.</i>

And you know? There's four of us,
we could be a string quartet.

All right, I'll do it,

but first, you guys gotta do
one thing for me.

Sure, Joe, what is it?

I want you to put me in the booth.

I want to feel like a person for a second.

Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.

All right, Quagmire, you do upper,
I'll do lower.

Sure, let's do it.

(BOTH STRAINING)

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
your service dog has arrived.

-Hey, Carter.
-Brian.

You have a butler?

Then why am I here?
Why can't he help you?

What? That's stupid.
Who would announce him?

See, this, right here, this is the
one percenter crap I can't stand.

Yes, it is.
Now sit your 99 percenter ass down

and read me the comics.

Ugh.

Okay. <i>The Wizard of Id</i>
is addressing his subjects.

Is he up on that balcony?

-Yes.
-Ha-ha! Then it's a good one.

(PETER PLAYING OFF-KEY)

Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

Peter, what note are you playing?

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar. "Note"?

Haven't you been practicing?

All right, fine. I haven't.

But I've been doing other violin stuff,

like, I bought this jacket,

like what Bugs Bunny wears
when he's with that opera guy.

Wow, that looks sharp.

Yeah, I've been practicing
how to sit down in it.

(SPLASHES)

Ew! Peter, those tails are soaking wet.

They may have been in the toilet.

-Brian! Get in here.
-What's up? What do you need?

I'm done with my bath.

Put on this lady wig
and help me out of the tub.

-What? Why do I have to wear a wig?
-Otherwise it's weird.

Thank you, Penelope.

Hey, it's 4:30, time for dinner.

But first, grab that Gold Bond
and powder my speed bag.

(PUFFING)

Ah, there's the tingle.

(HORNS HONKING)

Wow! So you could just bypass
all that gridlock?

Having a helicopter is amazing.

And that's not all.

I also use it to throw boxes of frogs
down on that church.

They go bananas.

Well, I could really get used to this
rich guy stuff.

Some skank I used to bang
is getting married,

and they need someone to play
at the ceremony.

-We got our first gig.
-Wow, a weddin'. That's awesome!

All right, then we should probably
practice our piece.

(PETER PLAYS OFF-KEY)

Hold on, hold on. Peter...
That's terrible!

You're sounding
like you were strangling a cat.

Well, I was.
That's how I got revved up to perform.

No, just now.

Look, it's clear that you still
haven't practiced at all.

Yeah, this was your idea
in the first place.

But you're the only one
who's done no work.

"No work"?

I stared in the mirror for hours

playing air violin to the song
<i>Bitter Sweet Symphony.</i>

-Peter, you're out of the group.
-What?

Well, fine. Screw you, guys.

(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)

Wow, he seemed pretty angry.

Yeah, I haven't seen him this upset

since he got caught using that fake ID.

Can I see your ID, please?

Give me one second.

Uh, sir, that lady who came in
and ate all the pies is back.

Okay, let's see how those eyes are doing.

See if you can tell me where Waldo is.

He's right there buying an ice cream cone.

Damn it, I've been stuck on that page
for two days.

Oh, and your eyes are fine.

Hey, that's terrific, Carter.

Seems like it's time to go home

and pour some of that scotch of yours
to celebrate.

That sounds like a great idea.

-See you later.
-Wait, wait. What are you talking about?

I meant, like... Like both of us.

Didn't you hear him? I'm all healed.
I don't need a service dog anymore.

-What are you saying?
-I'm saying, "I'm done with you."

Now, before I go, I'm just going to
old man drink this glass of water.

Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.

We're having sloppy joes.

-Eh. What else you got?
-How about a knuckle sandwich?

If Peter said that, you all would
have lost your minds laughing.

It's just that at Carter's house,

if you don't want something heavy,
Etienne will whip you up an egg dish

with some shallots and chanterelles
or whatever's fresh.

Yeah, I know all about Etienne.

He climbed into my bed when I was 11.

I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri,

but now you're back in the real world

where our poop stinks
and we all eat garbage.

Yeah, guess I got used to being
a little pampered over at Carter's.

Well, I'd be careful with
your uptown ways.

Some of the other kids don't like it.

(BOTH CHOMPING)

He thinks he's better than us.

What time you going to bed, fancy boy?

-I don't know, 9:00.

Look, it's not even about the stuff.

Carter and I became friends.

Wait a minute, of course.

Whatever you're going to say next,
I bet it's wrong.

I offended Carter
by offering to work for him.

I mean, once it became a friendship,

he didn't want me working for him,
he wanted a pal.

Brian, you're not kidding anyone.

We all know you don't care about Carter.

You only care about his money.

No, no. No. He knows I'm his friend.

Yeah, right. That's what Woody
thought about Buzz Lightyear.

-(GASPS)
-(MOANS)

Bo Peep! What's going on here?

Um... You've got a friend in me.

What are you doing here? I thought
you were rehearsing with the guys.

Ah, the bastards kicked me out
'cause I'm not good enough.

Oh, and they also taught me that
if your hand is bigger than your face,

you have cancer.

So maybe you should, uh,
you know, do the test.

I had cancer, Peter, remember?

I was in the hospital,
you weren't there for it.

Well, maybe you have it again.

Peter, I'm not falling for your trick.

But if you're upset about the guys
kicking you out of the group,

you can't really blame them.

The violin takes
discipline and dedication.

You never even practiced.

They probably thought
you were just wasting their time.

Maybe you're right, I guess...

I guess, I could have been
a little more serious about it.

Well, it's not too late.

Maybe you could find a teacher
who could help you learn.

And if you work at it
and get a little better,

they'll see you care about them.

You know what? That's a great idea.
I'll take some lessons.

I'm going to work really hard
just like my deodorant.

How does a guy like me stay fresh?

I use Fat Guys deodorant.

Whether you're sitting, leaning,
lying down, or sitting,

Fat Guys keeps you dry.

Apply every five minutes
and you're good for five minutes.

And now for the confusing
commercial back story.

-Ready for the fund-raiser, Dad?
-Yeah, I'll be right there, buddy.

We're going to a fund-raiser
and we share a bedroom.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, you have a visitor.

Hey, buddy, looking good.

So what are we drinking? Or better yet,

why aren't we drinking? (CHUCKLES)

Get the hell out of here!
I told you I'm done with you.

And besides, I'm off to the spa
down at the club.

How's the temp? Good and hot?

Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

Hey, did you also not wash your ass
before getting in?

Yeah. Fuck that sign.

-There you go, Mr. Glenn.
-Thanks.

Hey, can I get a couple of extras
of these plastic bags?

Let me just test this out quickly.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

-Yeah, that works.
-Okay, now you go.

I have to get back to
teaching violin lesson.

(PLAYING OFF-KEY)

Those scales sound terrible!
You fat and lazy.

-You leave now!
-No, please.

I got to get better
so I can be as good as my friends.

I really let them down.

You fingers no bleeding,
you no try hard enough.

You want me press iron
on your back again?

-I'm trying! I'm trying!
-Try harder.

Play better!

(WHIMPERS AND SOBS)

-Argh!
-(HISSING)

Is somebody making a Cuban sandwich?

Lousy, no good, rotten... (MUTTERING)

Brian, what's up? Why are you
engaging in cartoon profanity?

Carter wants nothing to do with me.

-I'm just so mad.
-Don't you mean sad?

You know, about the friendship?

Oh, no. Of course,
you mean mad about the money.

All right. Fine, it was about the money.
I miss the money.

Yes, I know. I saw all your
Instagrams on his helicopter,

like it was your helicopter.

-I never said it was my helicopter.
-Yeah, you never said it wasn't.

The implication was that it was
a regular part of your life.

Anyway, I know this makes me sound awful

but I almost wish Carter was still
blind so he'd still need me.

Yeah, but he's not.

But he could be.

-But he isn't.
-But he should be.

Oh, no.

Come on, it'd be temporary.

Just until he realizes I'm a great hang.

But you're not,
so I don't want any part of this.

Okay, I get it, I get it.
You wouldn't want to help me out.

What was I thinking?
He's your grandfather...

Even though
he did say that thing about you.

What? What did he say about me?

Oh, I... I'm sorry,
I thought I told you. Um...

He said, you couldn't cut it
as a member of One Direction.

What? But they have an opening.

Zayn is gone.
He does know Zayn is gone, right?

Oh, he definitely knows.

Yeah, he thinks you could be
in O-Town but not One Direction.

Okay, I'm pretty sure
you're manipulating me,

but let's go blind that old bastard.

Listen, Peter, we know you've been
working hard on the violin,

but more importantly, you're our pal.

We'd like you to be back in the group.

Really? But what if I'm not good enough?

Well, that's the thing.

We decided we'd rather be lousy
with you than great without you.

Joe, no offense, but I'd prefer
to hear it from someone else.

-That's fair.
-So what do you say, Peter?

Will you come and play the wedding
with us?

Oh, you bet I will.

Thanks, you guys won't regret this.

And don't you worry, I'll be ready,

unlike Lois getting dressed
for a night out.

-Tell them the truth.
-(GROANING) It's me. It's me.

I'm the one who takes
too long to get ready.

It's 'cause I don't have any nice clothes.

-Peter!
-All right.

It's 'cause I don't like the way I look.

(SHOWER RUNNING)

Okay, Brian. Carter's in the shower.

As soon as he comes out,
we spray this right in his eyes.

What did you put in there, again?

Oh, it's just tap water
from Flint, Michigan.

(GRUNTS)

(SINGING) <i>And that's how</i>
<i>the penis song goes...</i>

Ah! Son of a bitch, my eyes!

-You're up.
-Carter,

what happened?
You look like you could use some help.

Argh! My face!

(SCREAMS)

Oh, my God.

What did I let money do to me?

-Who did this? Who are you?
-Carter,

it's me, Brian. I did this.

And it's made me realize

that I was blinded by luxury and comfort

but now I see that none
of that matters. If I don't...

Brian, Brian, hold on.

(MUSIC PLAYS)

Looks like we've learned a lot,
and my face is better.

(CROWD CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

God, I'm so nervous.

You sure
you guys want me to play with you?

Yes, Peter, you play away.

We're a quartet. Just do the best you can.

You may kiss the bride.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

(PLAYING WEDDING MARCH)

(PETER PLAYING SOLO)

(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

MAN: Mmm.

Peter, that was amazing.

I know. Those lessons really paid off.

I'll say. The way you play, we'll have
more gigs than we can handle.

Not a chance. Mr. Washee Washee
took all the joy out of this.

I hate the violin.
I hate music. I hate life

and I'm never doing this again.

All right, guys,
let's go drink a bunch of free booze

and be a huge presence
in the wedding photos.

I did not.

Medieval Castle? I love that place.

My sister almost got a job there once.

Guys, we should go
to that auction tomorrow and buy it.

I mean, can you imagine if we had
our own medieval castle?

I bet it'd be even more fun
than when I went to White Castle.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Huh. Name's a little deceiving.

(GROANING)

-What's wrong with you?
-Oh, it's my back. It's killing me.

Yeah, I'm not falling for that
hot oil massage bit again.

No, this time it's not a bit.
I'm really hurt.

I must've jacked it up playing sports,
and not trying to dance like Beyoncé.

If you're in that much pain,
I better tell Lois.

(EXCLAIMS) Please don't.

Then she'll drive me to the doctor
and I hate being in the car with her.

-(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
-(BOTH VOCALIZING)

(SINGING) <i>Shut the door, baby</i>
<i>Don't say a word</i>

Okay, I guess that's not my part.

Here it is, guys.

Oh, this is gonna be awesome!

We just got to win this auction
and then we'll have our own castle.

Oh, yeah? Over my dead tooth!

Good afternoon and welcome
to today's auction.

I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's
Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing

Tubeman Warehouse and Emporium.

Due to the presence of black mold,
discarded half-eaten turkey legs

and an undulating rat king
that no one dares approach,

I have been advised
to move these proceedings along

as quickly as possible.

Do I hear an opening bid? Anyone?

Do I hear an opening bid for this
majestic fiberglass castle facade

masking what was once
a Midas muffler shop?

-Two bits.
-Two bits!

That's 25 cents in the Old West.

We have 25 cents.
Do I hear higher than 25 cents?

This paper bag, which could be
full of money or my socks.

You take the chance.

We have an intriguing mystery bag!

Do I hear more than the mystery bag?

Two bits and a cardboard box!

Which may or may
not contain a mystery bag.

Already, the most challenging auction
I have ever been a part of!

Do I hear a higher bid from that
James Bond villain over there?

Fifty krone.

Which, converted to
American currency, is $7.40!

Do I hear a much higher bid
followed by shocked murmuring?

-$10,000!
-(ALL GASPING)

MAN 1: I'm shocked.

WOMAN: That's shocking!
MAN 2: We're all shocked!

-We can't afford that.
-Peter, do something.

I can't.
There's only $9,000 in the mystery bag.

Due to my 12 noon court appointment

as part of a crippling
child custody battle

with my horrific ex-wife,

I am saying, "Going once, going twice,"

and awarding this condemned
building to you!

Damn it, we lost.

I guess the castle was a
crazy idea anyway.

I should probably just invest
this money in a 401-gay.

And how long before
I can take this out?

Man, those losers
don't deserve that castle.

I would call my sister about this
if she were able to answer the phone.

Poor thing.

Poor, poor thing.

Well, you know,

in castle times, if you wanted
something, you just took it.

What are you talking about?

I'm saying the four of us
should storm that castle

and take it for ourselves.

Should we do it with careful planning
or have another couple beers

and then just go for it?

Well, let's make that decision
after another couple beers.

I checked with my mom
and she said it was cool with her

if we wanted
to sleep here tonight.

-I'm pretty sure I can.
-Count me in.

Well, I'm gonna have to go home
and get my pillow.

(ALL YELLING)

Yes, you heard me right.

Cancel my insurance.

I've been in this location for 40 years
and never once have I broken a lamp.

Good day, sir.

-God, I hope he's got insurance.
-Of course he's got insurance.

He's been at this
location for 40 years.

(GROANS AND GASPS)

Yes, you heard me right.

Cancel my husband's life insurance.

He's been in perfect health
for 40 years.

We're selling the lamp store
and going to travel.

We need this after
losing both our children.

Good day, sir.

All right, Plan B.

We'll shoot flaming
arrows like in <i>Robin Hood.</i>

So, should I be aiming
for an open window

or just arcing it over the wall?

I don't know.
I've never seen the movie.

Just the Bryan Adams video.

Oh, such a good song.

-Archers!
-Yeah?

Oh, yeah.
He's that guy, too.

Prepare to fire!

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

I wonder what they're gonna put here.

Trader Joe's?

Oh, I would love a Trader Joe's.

Sorry to keep you.

I was reading this <i>Highlights</i>
magazine in the waiting room.

You see any differences
between these two pictures?

Oh, the pie has a wedge removed.
Yes. Yes.

Dr. Hartman, were you able to tell
anything from Stewie's X-rays?

Oh, yeah. Little guy's got scoliosis.

Oh, my God!

Oh, no! Am I gonna be a big shoe,
small shoe guy?

But don't worry, he'll be fine.

He just needs to wear
this brace for a while to correct it.

Oh, dear.

Now, does he have
any school pictures coming up?

Yeah, he actually does.

Well, then, this will not
be a refrigerator door year.

All right,
this says if we don't get arrested

for the next six months,

the arson and mayhem
charges will be dropped.

Hey, sorry again, you guys.

-Ah, no harm done.
-Yeah, no hard feelings, fellas.

I've already forgotten about it.

I'm too busy thinking
about my hot date tonight.

Yeah, right. Hot date.

With your left hand
or your right hand?

Well, actually, I use both
and do like an Indian burn.

But that's not what this is.

Tonight, I'm getting lucky.

Hi, are you Mort?

Why, yes, I am.

What the hell was that?

Mort's getting laid?

Yeah, thanks to Tinder, he's had a
different girl every night this week.

-What's Tinder?
-It's an app for your phone

where two strangers
can hook up for a dirty liaison.

-What, like hookers?
-No.

Just two horny people with phones.

Wait. I don't get it.

So, you hit 'em on the head
with your phone and knock 'em out?

No, you just swipe someone's picture,
they come over and you plow 'em.

Wow! I gotta try this.

I mean, easy sex on the Internet?

-Did you know about this, Scott Baio?
-Uh, yeah.

And you, Scott Caan?

Did you also know
about easy sex on the Internet?

Yes.

And how about you,
douchebag music producer, Scott Storch?

Quagmire,
all the Scotts know about it.

Okay, let's get me set up
on this Tinder thing.

I can't wait to start getting laid
at the push of a button.

Well, first you gotta set up your profile.

Oh, yeah, I've been working on that.

I wrote several long
paragraphs describing my interests,

some pet peeves, choice of wine,
couple of inspirational quotes,

things I've learned from my cats.

No, no, no, no, none of that.

You want a naked bathroom selfie,

covering your stuff
with a fistful of $100 bills.

That shows you like sex
and you got money.

Well, that seems a bit crude.

-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Oh, she's cute.

And wearing a yin-yang necklace.
That's interesting.

-Wonder what beach that is.
-Oh, no, no, gimme that.

Here, you see this?
You see what I'm doing?

Not even looking.
I'm swiping "Yes. Yes, yes, yes."

Casting a wide net.

-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Look at this. You already got a hit.

-And she sent a message.
-She did?

What am I looking at here?
It's mostly small, colorful pictures.

Those are emojis. Read 'em.

Okay, it says "Hey"
and then a kissy face

and then like a saucy, smirking face,
three balloons and a locomotive.

What the hell is all this?

It means she likes you.
Send something back.

Okay. "Dearest Teresa,
I hope this finds you well.

"I so appreciated
your last communication."

No, stop! Stop! God, stop! Stop!

Just send her an eggplant
and the erupting volcano.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

All right, take a gander.
Gawk at the Elephant Man.

Let's get it all out.

There's our brave guy.

-Brave?
-And just for being such a trouper,

I thought maybe you could be
the first in line for snack today.

Really? On pretzel day?

And after that,
you can hold the bunny.

Yeah, I'll pass on that but the pretzel
thing sounds up my alley.

Now, if I could just find someone
to wear this hero hat.

(GASPS) I think I found him.

Well, I say,
that was a pleasant surprise.

You know, like, when a woman

in a Porsche Cayenne
isn't a complete bitch.

Huh. Whoa, I did not expect that.

I wasn't telling you to go.
I was trying to smell my own fart.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, are you Courtney from Tinder?

-You must be Glenn.
-I got you these.

A lovely bouquet for a lovely...

Yeah, take off your pants
and sit on the coffee table.

Okay.

That was great.

And we can still
make our reservation.

What? Why? We already had sex.

Wait, so I don't have
to make small talk with you

-or spend any money?
-Of course not.

Here, wipe yourself off
with this West Elm catalog.

My God! This app is amazing!

Thank you, cellphone Jesus.

Huh?

Oh, yeah. Fine.

People giving you a hard time?

Quite the contrary, Brian.

Apparently, people love the wretched.

Thanks to this thing,
I was offered seats

directly behind home plate at Fenway.

I passed.

Wow, that patient next door is fat.

MAN: I can hear you!

Uh, that wasn't me,
that was Mrs. Griffin.

So, I've got Stewie's results here.

Um, it appears the back brace
has corrected the spine very nicely.

That's wonderful. Stewie doesn't
have to wear the brace anymore.

What? No, I can't give this thing up.

What do you mean?
You wanna keep wearing the brace?

Of course I do. It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

When I wear this brace, I get pampered
like the Queen of England.

So, I have the most
money in the world, right?

Yes, Your Majesty.

Great! Can you make sure my hair
looks like anyone in a nursing home?

All right! Hittin' the links.

Joe, golf shorts may
not be the right look for you.

-It's gonna be a nice day.
-Not for us if you wear those.

Well, that seems a little hurtful.

Hey, where's Quagmire?
Our tee time's in 20 minutes.

I don't know. I haven't seen much
of him since he discovered Tinder.

QUAGMIRE: Tinder?

Quagmire, come on. It's time for golf.

I swipe "No" on golf.

(SNIFFS) Smells kinda gamey in here.

Swipe "Yes" on Betsy.
Swipe "Yes" on Jennifer.

Swipe "Yes" on Andrea.
Swipe "Yes" on all the lady faces.

Swipe, swipe, swipe,
swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.

Let's, uh... Let's get a little
light in here, huh, buddy?

(EXCLAIMS) The yellow face!
It burns my Tinder!

Oh, my God. He's lost it.

That app's turned Quagmire
into some kind of sex ghoul.

The way he's crouching,
there's a teste peeking out.

Hey, listen. Quagmire,
you're our friend, all right.

We hate to
see you like this.

I don't have any friends.

Only sex people from the phone.

You gotta stop this. It looks like
you haven't left this room in weeks.

No need to leave.
They all come here.

Sometimes they bring
burgers and cheese.

Hey, come on, Quagmire.
Let's go for a walk, huh?

Get some fresh air.
Oh, for God's sake.

You're gonna have
a baby in your butt, man.

Can't leave.
"Heather within five miles" is coming.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Are you "Glenn within five miles"?

I can take my glass eye out
if you wanna try something different.

I got a good feeling about her.

Maybe she's the one.

Let's do it in the garage.

It's kinda cold but we can do
sweaters on, pants off.

Look, he left his phone!

I'm just gonna nudge it with
my knee into this empty pizza box.

And it's stuck to my knee.
Let's, uh... Let's just go.

All right. We gotta just throw that phone
away and end this once and for all.

Yeah, no kidding.
Quagmire's in bad shape.

He looks worse than I did
after that day at the beach.

I spanked somebody else's kid.

-Sorry I was late.
-You're still wearing that back brace?

That can't be good for you. Dr. Hartman
said you were done with that thing.

I'm not gonna listen to that bozo.
Of course I'm still wearing it.

Watch me jump this line.

Excuse me, I have scoliosis.
Excuse me, scoliosis coming through.

Hey, pal. Polio.

A thousand apologies.

Swipe, swipe, swipe.

Come on, I'm not getting any matches!

All right, Quagmire, we gotta talk.

This whole thing's
out of control, Quagmire.

You gotta get off Tinder.

Yeah, there's plenty of nice women
out in the real world

to meet the old-fashioned way.

And on top of that,
Tinder makes you gross.

<i>Leather gimps who do</i>

<i>These are the weirdos</i>

ALL: <i>Gonorrhea, HPV, ah</i>

<i>You will catch a dose</i>

PETER: <i>Of blisters and itching</i>
<i>and genital warts</i>

<i>'Cause Tinder makes you so gross</i>

<i>And for kids it's kind of tragic</i>
<i>Sex for them has lost its magic</i>

You guys can just forget it.
I'm not quitting Tinder.

Guys, I've been to the doctor's.

I do have a baby in my butt.

Mmm, you're still here.

Did we...

(GRUNTS)
What the deuce?

Brian! Brian!

Yes, is it possible to get Showtime
for free for the next, like, two hours

-to see if I like it?
-STEWIE: Brian!

(GRUNTING)

What is this?
What's happening to me?

Oh, my God! Stewie!

It's gotta be from wearing
that damn brace all the time.

Your neck must've atrophied so much
it can no longer support your head.

You've gotta take me to the hospital!

Absolutely! Let me just
watch <i>Jennifer's Body</i>

and we'll go right there.

Brian, there's no nudity in
that movie. Take me to the hospital!

What, so it's rated R for curses?

God, this country.

Is it... Is it noticeable?

Nothing that can't be fixed

with a string of chili pepper
Christmas lights.

STEWIE: <i>I wore that brace for</i>
<i>the next five years of my life.</i>

<i>The kids stopped cheering</i>
<i>the second day.</i>

<i>Then it was just, "Get off the swing,</i>
<i>you Christmas turd."</i>

I'll have another one, Jerome.

You sure you haven't had too many?

Just gimme a drink!

Sir, is everything all right?

I'm fine! I'm fine! Oh, hey.

-Are you on Tinder?
-What? That gross dating thing?

No.
Look, I'm not trying to pick you up.

It just seemed like
you were upset about something.

And I know when I'm upset,
it's nice to let someone else in.

Giggity.

What did you just say?

I don't know.
I think I said... I said "Giggity."

Okay...

Come on, Quagmire.
This is a real girl right in front of you.

Just pick her up and take her home.
You don't need your phone.

Don't listen to him.
I'm all you need.

Are you really gonna
listen to a phone over me?

God, I don't know why
I do this anymore!

Don't give up, miniature Quagmire.

This is exactly why you got into
the over-the-shoulder advice business.

Ignore him, miniature Quagmire!

Give up on your attempt
to convince real Quagmire

to not use Tinder and to instead have sex

with this woman who's
right in front of him.

-Wait, what's going on?
-I'm just saying,

you used to have skills
that no one else had.

That took you years to hone.
You were an artist.

Ah, damn, I think I was too wordy.

I'm still an artist.

What was that?

I was just saying,
I am upset about something.

I thought you were.
Do you wanna talk about it?

I do. I buried my twin brother today.

We were very close.
We used to finish each other's...

Um...

Sentences?

Oh, oh, I just got chills.

-I'm Sandra.
-I'm Glenn.

You know, I just... I just feel like
my penis shouldn't be alone tonight.

All right!

Well, looks like Quagmire's back.

Yep. He's scumming it up
in the real world again.

And all it took was for us to hire
that $200 dirty prostitute

to pretend to be a nice lady in a bar.

I'm just glad she's a prostitute

and not that lady murderer
that's been all over the news.

Hi, I'm that prostitute
you guys hired to seduce your friend.

Oh, boy. Well, deal's off. He's dead.

But perhaps we can
make other arrangements.

(GRUNTING)

Hey, do you think
I could try to kick one?

No, you're all-time goalie!

Peter, it's me,

Anyway, sorry I'm late.

The pantry down at the station
needed new shelf paper.

That's what they got you doin' down there?

Well, that and I'm also in charge
of the office gerbil.

And let me tell you,
Lieutenant Nibbles is quite a handful.

He'll only eat real cheese, not processed.

You buy special cheese for a gerbil?

Yeah, I have to. He outranks me.

Jeez, Joe, what the hell happened?

You used to be this badass cop
out there on the street,

bustin' heads and keepin' us safe.

Well, it may not sound exciting,
but I play an important role.

I go through all the body cam footage

and take out all the parts
where the cops go pee-pee.

So, you're just erasin'
cop wieners all day?

Eh, not erasing,
sort of cuttin' them together

into a funny montage
we show on birthdays.

Speakin' of which,

Flannigan's got the big four-oh
comin' up. Gotta go.

Man, you guys think Joe's
as happy as he says he is

just doin' all that desk work?

No way. He's just puttin'
lipstick on a pig.

This is called Crimson Sky.
What do you think?

Hmm.

-WIFE: Harold?
-Get this off of me!

What are you doing
in the women's department?

Eh... Waiting for you.

Well, I'm ready. Let's go.

Who are you?

Ugh, she just put her tampons
on top of the bread.

Take the groceries out.
We gotta start over.

Mom, can I go bare-hand raisins
from the bulk aisle?

Okay, but if you get caught, just say,
"Oopsie-poopsie" like a simpleton.

Hey, watch your fat arms.

Excuse me, ma'am,

your little girl dropped her teddy bear.

What? Little girl?

(LAUGHS) Yeah, she hates it
when she drops that.

He's actually a little boy
but thank you very much.

Did she just think I was a girl?
Why would she think that?

I don't know.
Maybe she saw you try to throw

that feather in the yard yesterday.

Hey, don't watch me when I'm doin' stuff.

Those aren't free.

-Ah! Son of a bitch, Joe,

didn't even hear you comin'.

Yeah, I'm kind of quiet on grass.

Thanks for givin' me a ride, Joe.

Hey, since we're in a cop car,

let's talk about our hunches
and how somethin' doesn't add up.

All right.

I have a hunch Madea's not really a girl.

Yeah, somethin' doesn't add up about that.

DISPATCHER 1: <i>Sorry, guys.</i>

Fifth and Maple?
That's right near here. We gotta go.

No can do. I gotta go to the station
and tidy up the bulletin board.

No one's bitin' on those guitar lessons.

What are you talkin' about?
There's a drug deal goin' down.

Peter, there's a lot you don't
understand about police work.

What's to understand? I watch TV.

Come on, Joe. Let's put this '70s siren

on your car and go.

Did you just wipe a booger on my roof?

Let's go! Let's go!

-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-Oh, crap! Cops!

That's the house.

Hold on, Peter. We can't go in there.
We gotta wait for backup.

The hell we do.

Peter!

(GRUNTS) Reach for the stars.

What?

I think he's telling us
to follow our dreams.

-Where are the drugs?
-What are you doin'?

You're violatin' all kinds of procedures.

There's no drugs here, pig.

(LOUD THUD)

A-ha! No drugs, huh?
What do you call this?

And I bet there's more
where that came from?

-(TOILET FLUSHING)
-They're tryin' to flush their stash.

Nice try, scumbag,

but I got your squishy drugs right here.

Oh-oh!

Peter, hand me my gun and get out of here.

I could get fired for this.

And I can't go back to my job
as a magician's assistant.

And now to pull the two sides apart.

-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-And wiggle your toes.

I said wiggle your toes.

JOE: Yeah, that's why I wanted
to talk to you before the show.

-What's up, dudes?
-Stewie, what the hell is all this?

Oh, only the most manly thing ever.

A little somethin' called
American football.

Is that a Michael Sam jersey?

Yep, two boy names. Doubly masculine.

-Like, George Michael?
-Shut up!

Come on, Stewie.
You still hung up about the woman

at the grocery store
thinkin' you were a girl?

Elton John is another.

It has nothing to do with that, Brian.

I just thought it'd be good
to take up a sport.

You know, like boys do.

You don't have to play football
to prove you're a boy.

Barney Frank is yet another one.

Chris, please.

Actually, you know what? Ricky Martin.

There's a bunch of these.

Anyway, they're not gonna let
you play football, Stewie.

-You're too little.
-Oh, don't worry.

I'm gonna be bad news for the other team.

And nobody likes bad news.

Except for Larry the Self-Loathing Idiot.

Larry, I'm afraid you only have
three months to live.

(LAUGHS)

Swanson! I need to see you right now.

Captain. Lieutenant.

You had no business participating
in that raid at Fifth and Maple.

I know that, Captain. I'm sorry that I...

But I'm glad you did.

Excuse me?

You brought down one of the biggest
drug rings in Quahog.

Above and beyond, Swanson.

Well, sir, I'm just like any other cop.

My wife puts on my pants
one leg at a time.

I appreciate your modesty, but nice work.

It's hard to believe
you did that all by yourself.

Yep, did it all by myself, I did.

I did. My little lonesome, says I.

That's weird phrasing,
but I'll tell you this, Swanson,

you keep up this kind of work,

there'll be no more grocery runs for you.

You'll be back on the street full time.

Thank you, Captain.

(SQUEAKS)

-Sir.
-(SQUEAKS)

Thank you, sir.

(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

Hey, Peter. You know,
I was just thinkin' about

how much fun we had the other day

and wondered if you'd wanna join me
for another ride along.

Well, yeah, but I thought
you said I couldn't do that

'cause you'd get in trouble.

It'll be our little secret.

All right. Hey, can I drive the car?

Yeah, I guess I can let you drive.

Awesome! Hey, and can we go slow
up to a homeless guy

and go, "Yip, yip" and see what he does?

That's half the job!

So what do you say?
You think you're up to it?

You bet I am.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

I've been workin'
my Dave Matthews punchin' bag.

Thank you very much for using me today.

(VOCALIZES)

This isn't annoying enough.
I need my David Lee Roth bag.

(VOCALIZES)

(WHISTLING)

Wow! So these are
the wife beaters of tomorrow.

Which team is Stewie gonna to be on?

He's not gonna be on any team.

He's just overcompensating
because he was called a girl.

But once he sees how big
the other kids are, he'll back out.

Ooh, my shoes have 12 little heels.

COACH HERRERA:
They're cleats.

Okay, kids, let's start practice.

Yeah, football. Boy stuff.

Hittin' the shower. Gettin' embarrassed.

Goin' home to shower.

Okay, Stewie, enough is enough.
All right, let's get you out of here.

Yeah, you probably
should get him out of there

'cause he's just a little shrimp.

Um, okay, thank you.

I mean, look at him.
My Tyler would kill him out there.

Okay, well, believe me,
there's more to him than you think.

-Come on, Stewie.
-You know, ballet is great exercise.

Maybe you should put
short stack in a tutu.

No, you know what, Stewie?
Get the hell out on that field.

And if you see that Tyler,
take his knee out.

All right, let's do it. Football game.

Then reminder, showering at home.

Okay, I guess we'll see
who's got the toughest kid here.

Yeah, I guess we will.

Well, it's not my car, but I don't care.

All right, Griffin, get in there.

somethin' to post on Facebook.

Somethin' to post on Facebook. Let's go.

(WHISTLES)

All right! And nobody's blocking...

(GROANS)

-Oh, my God, Stewie!

Are you okay?

A concussion?

You do me an honor, lieutenant,
but my dance card is full.

Officer Swanson, as requested,

here's a big stack of the
cases you cracked.

Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead
and brood over a photo of the girl

whose case was the one I couldn't solve.

PETER:
Well, hello, Officer Swanson.

Peter, what are you doin'?
You're not supposed to be here.

I saw you on TV,

hoggin' all the credit for my police work.

Look, I told you I need you
to be a silent partner on this.

The truth is,
I could get into a lot of trouble.

Oh, I see. You need me to be
the bad cop who kicks all the ass,

and then I'm supposed to be
quiet about it?

Well, my silence is gonna cost you.

What are you sayin'?

I'm sayin' you get stuff, I want stuff.

I've seen that evidence locker.
I know you've got Discmans in there.

I want a murdered jogger's Discman.

Peter, you know I can't do that.

Yeah, well, maybe I accidentally reveal

that you're not the hero
everyone thinks you are

and that you've been lettin' your neighbor
do all kinds of cop stuff.

You wouldn't do that, would you?

You bet I would. And one more thing.

Peter asked me to do this.
He said it's somethin' from before.

I don't know. I hope it's funny.

All right, I'm here,
but why did you want me to bring this?

I'll tell you why.

You're gettin' all the credit
for my police work,

so I want stuff from you.

I want a minute in your house
with this shopping cart

like <i>Supermarket Sweep.</i> Here, time me.

Peter, you expect me
to let you ransack my house?

Well, unless you'd rather
I spill the beans to the chief

about who's been doin' your dirty work.

Okay, go.

PETER:
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

Get out of Susie's room!

Your stuff sucks.
I didn't need the full minute.

Hey, Stewie,
how's our little concussion guy?

Oh, my God. Can you... Can you see me?

Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

Is... Is anybody gonna
answer that telephone?

He keeps thinking
the phone is ringing, Brian.

Well, at least he's talking again.

I think that means he's getting better.

Is it day or night?

I don't... I don't care.
I just wanna know.

Lois, answer the bloody phone!

No, no, we don't need Lois.

Chris, pretend to answer the phone.

(STUTTERS) Hello. Okay. Yes, one second.

Mom, it's for you.

What? No, damn it, Chris.

I'll... I'll take that.
Hello, this is Brian Griffin.

Actually, I already receive

You're bragging to nobody?

Phone's still ringin'.

Crap, Chris,
he's worse off than I thought.

We have to do something.

Well, on TV if somebody
gets hit on the head,

you hit him a second time,
and that gets him back to normal.

No, no, Chris, this is very serious.

You see, what a concussion is,
is the impact of brain matter

on the inside of the skull.

That's why you
sometimes hear this nonsense

about, "Oh, let's just give
'em better helmets."

But you can't make a helmet
for the inside...

(KISSES)

I want these.

Rechargeable heated mittens.
Write it down.

Forget it, Peter.

I'm done being blackmailed by you.

Oh, yeah? Well, fine.

But remember,
you're nothin' without your muscle.

DISPATCHER: (OVER RADIO)
<i>Any available unit.</i>

<i>We have a report</i>
<i>of an armed robbery in progress.</i>

Go on, hero cop. You don't need me.

Well, maybe you and I can do
one last bust for old time's sake.

Yes! All right, let's do it.

Let's go be heroes,
like the designated driver.

Is there a skeleton with a wig
that can drive me home?

I can.

Look at this mess.
Where is the housekeeper?

Well, you already look better.
The doctor should be in any minute.

-(BABY CRYING)
-Chris, what the hell?

There is a room where you can
go in and just get free people.

Yeah, you should give that back.

Look, I'm really sorry
I let you get hurt, Stewie.

I never should have pushed you
into that game.

Well, it's not your fault.

I just have to accept that I'm not a man,

and I'm never going to be one.

That's ridiculous.
You can't let what one woman

says in a grocery store
define who you are.

Mom and Dad said it, too.
I heard it through a vent in the wall.

Hey, knock knock.

Coach Herrera? You came to see Stewie?

Yeah, I wanted to check in
on this tough little guy.

Tough little guy?

It takes a real man to take
a hit like that.

Feel better, sport.

How about that?

Real man.

See, I told you, Stewie.
You're a big, tough boy.

Yes, I guess I am.

That may be, Stewie,

but if I were you, I'd stay off the field.

Concussions are the number one problem
in football today.

Recent brain scan studies have shown...

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

That brain injuries are directly linked

to dementia and suicides
in former players.

-Yet the league...

You can play the music louder,

(SIRENS WAILING)

Peter, slow down.

No can do, Joe. I'm all hopped up
'cause I Vicks Vapo'd my sack.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

I also got some of it in my eyes.

Am I getting 'em?
Am I getting the robbers?

Peter, put the gun down.

On the floor, punks. Everybody dies.

(GROANS) My already irritated eyes.

Oh, damn it, Peter.

This is Officer Swanson.
I need backup at...

PETER: (GROANS)

They're beatin' me with
vapin' accessories.

Forget it. There's no time.

Freeze! Police!

Too late, Joe. I already identify
with my captors.

Don't hurt Max and Ken.

(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)

(GROANS)

Holy crap, Joe, that was freakin' amazin'.

You kicked their ass.

You're right. I guess I did.

And without my help.
See, this is the Joe I remember.

You know,
maybe you had it in you all along.

Wow. I guess I just got ground down

by years of people
treatin' me like an errand boy,

and I just let 'em walk all over me.

You know, you were a real pain
in the butt as a partner

but you helped me find myself again.

-Thanks, Peter.
-You're welcome, Joe.

Excuse me.

Do you have any TaB soda
I can bring back to the sex dungeon

where I've been held captive for decades?

Ma'am, this is a crime scene.

I'm gonna have to ask you to move along.

You're right, Peter.
I'm a pretty good cop.

Ah! Look what came.
The free DVD from my PBS pledge.

Whatever it is, we're not watching it.

Peter, trust me, you of all people
could really learn something from this.

It's a documentary about the food industry
called <i>Food Kills.</i>

Huh. Says here that <i>Colon Health Magazine</i>
gave it two thumbs in.

Hi, I'm Matt Lauer's cousin,
Steven McCormick.

Our moms are sisters.

America is gorging itself on
processed food,

creating an obesity epidemic.

We've abandoned natural foods

for chemicals, additives
and refined sugars.

At this rate, this is what the future
will look like.

<i>Those are flying cars.</i>

<i>But the people in them are too fat.</i>

Oh, no, I left my baby in there!

Without drastic changes in our diet,

Americans are headed
for a health catastrophe.

That's "www dot" the word
"double-u" three times,

the word "dot," "PBS,"
the word "dot" again,

the word "com," dot com.

There was a miscommunication
when we registered our website.

Well, that's it. From now on,
we're eating healthy around here.

We're gonna feel better
and we're gonna look better.

Well, looking better didn't always
solve your problems, Lois.

Sure didn't work for Droopy Dog
when he got that face-lift.

Contrary to my appearance,
I'm still not happy.

Please, study my brain so that others
don't suffer as I have.

(GUNSHOT)

Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, you guys.

And, Esther, I'm so sorry you ripped
your perineum doing the Hokey Pokey.

That's okay. I got free curly fries.

Okay, let's see what Meg got me.

A Crock-Pot?

(GASPS) Things about to get crazy!

You can cook a pork tenderloin
under your bed.

Excuse me, girls.

We're about to start
roller derby in a minute.

Wait, wait, you.

-What's your name?
-Me?

-Meg Griffin.
-Would you mind standing up?

Whoa!
(STUTTERS) What are you doing?

-My God. The magic ratio.
-What's that?

It means your ankles, calves and thighs
are all the same thickness.

How would you like to try out
for the roller derby team?

Really?

-Do it, Meg.
-Yeah, Meg, you should totally do it.

Meg's talking to a boy!

Okay. Sure. What the heck?

Here, take my card.

-"I am a registered sex offender."
-Flip it over.

-"Important, see other side."
-Give me that.

I'm the roller derby coach.
See you at tryouts.

I can't believe it, you guys.

This is the biggest surprise since
the last M. Night Shyamalan movie.

Two tickets for the
M. Night Shyamalan movie.

Wow. Really?

Hope you guys are ready
for a healthy dinner.

I went to Whole Foods today
and got this recipe

from an extremely thin man
with a giant Adam's apple.

I hate that place.
None of the cereals are advertised on TV.

-What's this stuff that looks like sand?
-It's quinoa.

Nope, I don't eat foods
that sound like karate words.

Well, according to <i>Food Kills,</i>
quinoa is a superfood.

It's very nutritious,
and it even helps keep you regular.

Lois, I have a system.
I poop once a week for an hour and a half.

I wear a headband and it's soaked
when I'm all done.

Mmm. Wow, Lois, you know,
this is actually pretty good.

-Peter, you should try it.
-Ugh, fine.

(GAGGING)

Peter, knock it off.

I can't help it. My body's rejecting it.
(GAGGING)

-Name?
-Quinoa.

Mmm-hmm. Sorry, sir, we're full.

Come on in, Gummy Bears.

Oh, you are looking fine tonight.

Mmm!

Thanks again for coming
and supporting me, Chris.

No problem.

And I'm gonna take some pictures
of the other athletes, if you don't mind.

You might not know this about me,
but I am a bit of a shutterbug.

Okay, that's... That's all okay.

All right, ladies, line up.

How about we start with some warm-ups?

Bend down and touch your toes.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING RAPIDLY)

CHRIS: Memory card full? Come on!

Okay, now, last year we were tricked
by a couch on a dolly with wheels.

So, if any of you is a couch
on a dolly with wheels,

I'm gonna ask you to please leave now.

Well, we need five for a team,
and there's five of you here.

So, congratulations.

Wow! This is awesome!

I can't believe I'm a Quahog Thug.

When do we start skating?

Here, look at the schedule.

This is just a list
of Sexaholic Anonymous meetings.

Flip it over.

It says,
"Remember to attend your meetings."

I'm gonna stop handing you stuff.

(GROANING)

(GASPS)

It's the middle of the night.
Where are you going?

I'm sick of all this healthy crap.

I'm going downstairs
to find something good to eat.

And then I'm gonna fall asleep watching
transvaginal mesh lawsuit commercials.

-There's nothing.
-Thank you, son.

What's going on, man? Are you pregnant?

No, my wife watched
that food documentary.

And you should never ask that
unless you're sure, by the way.

Oh, yeah.

Peanut-butter-cup-
Dorito-sausage-car panini.

And let's crack a Cadbury Egg
over the whole thing.

I'm just gonna use my spare
glove compartment underwear as a napkin.

I can't believe Randy Quaid gets
to eat like this every day.

-Peter, is that you?
-Cleveland?

-Are you cooking in your car?
-I am.

-Is this because of <i>Food Kills?</i>
-Oh, you saw that movie too, huh?

We watched Tyler Perry's <i>Food Kills,</i>
which is the same movie

except it stars black folks
you've never heard of

and white folks
you don't hear from anymore.

But, yeah, now Donna is forcing me
to eat healthy.

I always get confused.
Is Donna the wife or is Roberta the wife?

I don't know, man.
Can I have some of that sandwich?

Oh, our hands just touched.

Mmm. Wow, Peter, that's good.

That's real good.

-I'm not sure what we're doing now.
-Excuse me.

Whatever you've got in there
smells incredible.

Man, my wife won't let me eat
any of that stuff.

Tell you what, I'll give you
10 bucks for that thing.

-Yeah, me too.
-Wow.

Huh. If I sell two sandwiches
for $10 each, that equals...

Money.

Peter, you just made $20
from two sandwiches.

Wow, you're right.

Hey, maybe I can
turn this into a business.

You know, selling sandwiches
from a car.

Wonder how much I could make.

<i>Mad world...</i>

Whoops, I stopped thinking about math
and started thinking about baby-man

Billy Corgan being sad at Disneyland.

(PETER VOCALIZING OVER SPEAKERS)

-Peter, what the hell is this?
-This, Lois, is my new food truck.

Specializing in all the delicious,
unhealthy foods that you won't let me eat.

'Cause you don't let me eat
what I wanna eat.

And... I am super dizzy.

And there might be
a gas leak in this thing.

(PETER VOCALIZING OVER SPEAKERS)

I can't believe
you'd buy a food truck.

What are you even selling?

First of all, believe it, baby.

Second, uh, mostly hamburgers
where the buns is jelly donuts.

And drinks where hot dogs
is the straws.

Mmm. Another milkshake, please.

Look, I'm happy for the business,
but drinking that on your knees is...

It's putting a hat on a hat.

Look at this food.
It's gross and unhealthy.

It's exactly the stuff I'm trying
to get you not to eat.

Yeah, but people like this food.
It makes them happy.

I mean, you can eat sprouts
and vegan crap your entire life

and still get devoured by gremlins
and none of it matters.

So, you're saying
you shouldn't take care of yourself

because you might get devoured
by gremlins?

Get a clue, Mama.

Think of what you're doing
to your body, Peter.

Oh, there we go.

-You think I'm overweight?
-I know you're overweight.

Hey, I'll have the Swedish fish taco.

You want the can of chili
dumped on top or on the side?

What does the chef recommend?

Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard,

the chili flies into my mouth like Popeye.

Do it up.

You got it!
Let me put on my bandanna,

fire up my very loud watt generator
and get cookin'.

(GENERATOR POWERS ON)

-Peter, this isn't over.
-What?

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome</i>

Boy, that was rough.

This sport is even more dangerous
than skeet shooting.

Pull!

I got in the wrong line!

That'll be $16.

Sixteen dollars?
That's expensive.

Yes, sir, everything is very expensive

because you're paying
for it on an iPad.

Now, if you'll just select a gratuity.

Options are 60%, 90% and 200%.

Uh, I guess 60%?

Okay, great, and just sign
by dragging your bare finger

across this thing I use to masturbate.

Uh, okay.

Thank you. Please make sure to bang
your head on that low hanging thing.

What are you... (GROANS)

Oh, you spilled something.
You want a napkin?

Yes, please.

All right, here's 40
blown by the wind.

(PANTING)

Oh, Chris, I'm glad you're here.
Swing that lamp at me.

But you'll get hurt.

No, I won't.
I'm gonna dodge it.

(GROANS)

-Oh, my God! Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

This roller derby
has really toughened me up.

I gotta say, I've never felt better.

Really? 'Cause I watched how rough
it was out there the other day

and I got a little worried for you.

I mean, all it would take is
one bad hit to do permanent damage.

-I think you should quit.
-What? No.

No, I love roller derby.

It's the first thing
I'm really good at.

Plus, I love making
other women bleed.

You know,
in ways besides the way...

You know,
they normally bleed.

-STEWIE: She means periods.
-Yeah, I got it, Stewie.

But I'm telling you, Meg,
something bad is going to happen.

Like, when you give a young athlete
too much money.

Uh... I gotta murder somebody.

Peter, kids, dinner.

Kids? Peter?

It's time for a healthy veggie dinner.

Come on, I spent the whole day
making the house smell like farts.

Where the hell is everybody?

All right, I got a bowl of cereal.
That's M&M's and Dr. Pepper.

Over here.

Chris, put that down.

You kids get in the house
and eat the healthy dinner I prepared.

And Peter, you too.
Shut down that truck and get inside.

Lois, I already told you
I don't wanna eat your garbage food.

All right? Now can you go inside
and get me some Pop Rocks?

I'm making a paella.

You know what?
Enough of this nonsense.

You love this truck so much,
stay in it!

'Cause I don't want you
or your food in the house.

Fine! I love this truck.

I got everything I need in here.

Maybe I'll just live here.

I can imagine it now.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Whoops.

I stopped thinking about the truck and
started thinking about Amazon woman

Brigitte Nielsen
drunk in a Burbank park.

-(SNORING)
-(MICROWAVE BEEPING)

All right,
time to greet the day.

Are you living in a truck?

Not bad. I see you got
a Hooters calendar in here.

How do you get anything done with
those rockin' knockers staring at ya?

Hey, who says I get anything done?

Heh. Guy talk, guy talk, eh. Guy talk.

-Guy talk, guy talk.
-This is how guys talk.

-Oh, Peter, this is awful.
-Well, I love it.

And I'm not going back in that house
and listen to Lois

tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.

You do look like you put on a few.

Your elbows are starting to pucker.

Yeah, I mean,
are you really happy in here?

You bet I am. I'm happier
than a squash on Halloween.

Dad, are they coming
to take us away too?

No, son, we're fine.

How about on Thanksgiving?

You know what?
Just enjoy the month.

(ALL CHEERING)

(ALL GRUNTING)

You're going down, Griffin.

Like my stepfather's pants.

I guess I see where
some of your anger comes from.

(GRUNTS)

Oh, no, this is bad.

That's it! I have to do something.

Chris, what are you doing?

Saving my...

(YELLS AND GROANS)

(GROANS)

Oh, my God!
Chris, are you okay?

I don't think so.
I'm hurt pretty bad.

Like that time
I was running with scissors.

(LAUGHING)

You run like a girl.

(GROANS)

Run like a man,
you get a suit.

There you go. And if you'd like
to put your email on our sign-up list,

I'd be happy to sell it
to Russian hackers.

Peter! Peter, it's happening.

-What?
-The Bing maps car.

It's three blocks down,
and it's coming this way.

Holy crap! This is the day
we've been waiting for.

We said we're gonna stand
in our front yards

and wave as it goes by
so we're on the street view.

We're gonna be on the Internet.

Mort just called.
It went by his house.

Everybody, places. Start waving.

This is not a drill.

(STRAINING)

Damn it!
I can't fit through the door.

I'm stuck in a truck.

What? What are you talking about?

I knew this would happen.
You're too fat to get out.

I see it! I see the Bing car.

Oh, my God, Bing!
Bing! Over here, Bing.

They can't see you, Peter.
You're facing away from the street.

Stop talking, Quagmire, just smile.

(CAMERAS CLICKING)

This is amazing.

Crap, is it gone?

The driver nodded at me.

I... I think I'm gonna cry.

Damn it!
Can't believe I missed it.

Jeez, I hope I don't end up
stuck in here like Winnie the Pooh.

Uh, Rabbit?

Perhaps you should push
with your shoulder

-and not your fist?
-RABBIT: Don't worry about it.

Hey, did that big boomba-boomba nurse
come in here?

Uh, no.

But Dr. Hartman,
is my brother gonna be okay?

That's her, that's her.

-Hello, Anita.
-Hello, Doctor.

Was that weird?
Was I just weird?

-Kind of.
-You don't know, I was fine.

Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry
you got hurt like this.

Roller derby was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

I finally felt like I was good
at something, I made friends.

But seeing you like this,
I realize you were right.

It's too dangerous.
So, I'm going to quit.

No, Meg.

I got hurt because
I didn't belong out there,

but you do.

I watched you skate.

You found your calling
and I believe in you.

Now get back to that ring
and help your team win

the championship it deserves.

Really? I will.

Thanks, Chris.

Tom, I'm standing here outside
a Spooner Street home

where a local business owner
has apparently eaten himself

into his own food truck.

Oh, it appears they have finally
removed the roof.

Nobody look,
this is a private gross matter.

Mr. Griffin, is this performance art

or some sort of political statement?

Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms
and porn, but this is unrelated.

Oh, hey, Lois.
I guess, you must be happy.

Yeah, it's every girl's dream
to have her husband hoisted

out of a food truck
in a horse harness.

No, look, I'm just saying...

You were right.

I'm a big tub of lard and you have
every reason to be ashamed of me.

Ashamed of you?
Is that really what you think?

Well, yeah, you kept saying
how overweight I am.

Peter, don't you get it?

I only wanted you to eat healthy
because I love you,

and I'm concerned about your health.

I want you around
for as long as I'm around.

Really?

I love you too, Lois.

I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

I guess I could do
without eating so much junk.

But I could never do without you.

Oh, Peter...

Ma'am, please step back.
We have to wash him with a hose.

Guys, look, look,
the Bing car is back.

No, I'm not ready.
I'm not ready!

Hey guys, I didn't know
you were coming to the church raffle.

I will confess a mix-up to you.

I thought Donna said
we were going to the church "waffle."

And we're only here for
the fantasy weekend at Fenway Park.

-Fenway Park?
-Oh, yeah!

The winner and a friend get to hang out
and practice with retired Red Sox players,

and then play in a real game
right on the field at Fenway!

Oh, my God!
That's always been a dream of mine.

Well, that, and tuning a guitar
in front of a live audience.

(TUNING GUITAR)

This was in perfect tune
when they handed it to me.

Next up, our fantasy weekend for two
at Fenway Park.

Oh, man, this is it!

And the winner is...

Peter Griffin.

-Holy crap, I won!
-(MURMURS AND APPLAUSE)

-Wow, good for you!
-Congratulations!

I like it when people
say your name out loud!

How exciting, Peter!
A weekend trip to Boston!

Yeah, and the best part is,
I don't even have to get on a plane.

I always have trouble at the airport.

Sir, you're not allowed
to be on the carousel.

Well, then maybe you shouldn't have
named it such a fun word.

Excuse me, excuse me, I'm not yours.

He's stealing me. I'm being stolen!

Excuse me, I think you've got mine.

Oh, that's a good idea.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

-Oh, hey, Quagmire.
-Hey, Peter!

So, I was just baking a coffee cake
and I figured I'd bring it over,

-cause you like coffee cake.
-Wow, thanks.

Yeah, yeah, no problem.
So, who are you taking to Fenway?

-What?
-Well, I was just thinking,

you have that extra ticket.
Maybe you'd wanna...

Peter, before you answer him.

I've got that murdered jogger's Discman
you wanted last week.

Still bloody!

Hi, Peter.
You know how you like 40 dollars cash,

well, here's almost 40 dollars cash.

Guys, look. I know you all want to go,

but I need a little more time
to figure this out.

I mean, it's a tough decision, like what
to do with that big watermelon I bought.

Griffin, I just wanted to tell you...

That's a great outfit. Keep it up!

I knew it!
I have to start trusting myself more.

Man, I don't envy you.

Whichever one of them
you bring to Fenway,

the other two will be mad at you.

I don't wanna bring any of them.

Those guys are all
way better than me at baseball.

They'd just show me up and ruin it for me.

Why don't you bring Lois?

She doesn't care about baseball, and
that way nobody gets their feelings hurt.

-Brian, that's a great idea!
-Thanks.

Is it "new tennis ball" great?

It's three new tennis balls great.

I'm gonna get 'em all,
I'm gonna get 'em all,

I'm gonna get 'em all!

(PANTS EXCITEDLY)

Mom, you're really going to Boston?
I didn't even think you liked baseball.

Oh, I'm not going for baseball.
I'm going for shopping,

the hotel spa, and two days of
being away from you life-sucking turds.

Anyway, be good.
And while we're gone, Brian's in charge.

Where is Brian?

What's up, bitches?

Oh, come on, Mom, really?

I'm in high school and you're still
putting the dog in charge?

Believe me, Meg, you want me in charge.
Stewie can be a bit of a handful.

He's right, you know. I'm a total Taurus.

Stubborn as they come!

All right, fine. Meg, while we're away,
you can be in charge.

Come on, Lois, time to get to Fenway!

Wow, Dad, you look awesome,

but I thought you
were gonna dress like a baseball player.

I am, Chris. I'm the type of player
who arrives at the stadium in a suit,

with a tie knot as big as an apple.

That's how you know I got money.

-All right, we'll see you guys Sunday.
-(ENGINE STARTS)

Okay, now you heard Mom
say I'm in charge.

-So, I just wanna lay a few ground rules.
-Yup.

I promise we're gonna have fun,

-but there will be a schedule...
-Uh-huh.

...just to keep everything

-running smoothly.
-Gotta have boundaries.

And I may assign a chore or two because...

That's great, Meg.

-... it's more fun if everyone pitches in.
-Sounds like you got it worked out.

-Hey, by the way...
-Ahh!

I'm gonna flush your retainer
down the toilet.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Look at this, Lois.
The Fenway Park locker room.

All right, Peter, I'm gonna go.

You wanna hand me some cash in front of
the other men so you feel powerful?

Instead, why don't you take
my Minions Discover card.

Hey there, sluggers.
Welcome to Red Sox Fantasy weekend.

Well, who's this? We've never had
a lady come out for this before.

Oh, no, that's my wife.
She's just dropping me off.

Yeah, you're nice, but I'm not staying.

I don't know the first thing
about baseball.

Look, your spot's already paid for.

And besides, if you leave,
the teams will be lopsided.

So, as your coach, I insist you stay
and play with us. Right, fellas?

(ALL AGREEING IN UNISON)

Well, I don't know.
What do you think, Peter?

What do I think about sharing
Fantasy Baseball Camp with my wife?

Yeah, come on, let her play!

Wow! 1980s All Star, Wade Boggs!

Hey, would you mind
standing next to a star of today?

Sure.

Man! What happened to our game?

David Ortiz, will you
pick him up like a baby?

It's your weekend!

(LAUGHS)

Now, let me put this baby bonnet
on his head and a cigar in his mouth.

So, what do you say?
Are you gonna let your wife play?

Absolutely. Lois, stay here and play
with us.

(CHUCKLES) I can't say no to baby Boggs.

Cutchi-cutchi...

Ah, he bit me!

Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm here.

Lois, see that wall there?
They call that the green monster.

And over there is where I threw
a D cell battery at Jose Canseco.

All right, let's play ball.

Wow! You must be excited, Peter.

Yep, guess I can cross this one
off my bucket list.

All that's left now
is living the Pueblo lifestyle.

Peter, what the hell
did you do to the house?

I know it seems pretty lame,
until you realize I'm 58.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go lick the foot of

a fleshy, pale woman for <i>Real Sex 34.</i>

Rupert, what do you think
of this fan fiction I wrote?

"Diego pressed Dora against the wall,

"her bosom heaving,
her hot Latina breath on his face.

"For once,
Diego was going to do the exploring."

(EXHALES) Just reading it!

<i>Muy caliente!</i>

Okay, Stewie, time for you to get dressed.

Yeah, close door means "Come in," I guess.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Let's pick out a cute shirt for you.
Then, I thought we can go to the park.

Or, how about this? I press my butt
against the wall and duke on it.

(GASPS) Stewie, don't do that!

You're messing with my schedule,
so I'm giving you wall poop.

-(EXERTING)
-Stop that right now!

You just earned a time-out.

A what? Let go of me!

Don't you walk away!

Hey, don't bruise me.
I'm going dancing later.

You listen to me, you little monster.

I take abuse from everybody around here.
But, I am not gonna take it from you!

Now, sit here until I say you can get up.

And if you move one muscle before,
then I'll smack you in your weird head.

Hey, it's not weird!
Mom says it's distinctive.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

COACH: Griffin, you're up.

It's always the fat one.

-I heard that.
-I said it right to you!

You know what? Let's just
get Lois up to bat. Where's Lois?

I'm right here, coach.

Guess you don't have
a lot of babes out here.

Except for Babe Ruth.

(CHUCKLES)

-Babe Ruth!
-Ha!

That's funny 'cause she's hot.

(ALL CHEERING)

Ah! It's a little like tennis.

Did you see that, Peter? I'm doing it all!

Damn it!
This was supposed to be my weekend.

(ALL LAUGHING)

(STEWIE CRYING)

Stewie, what the hell's going on?

Meg's awful!

She gave me a time-out
and she made me sit in this chair.

My god, she put eye shadow on you, too.

I might have gotten up from the chair.

Brian, Meg's lost her mind.
You've got to talk to her.

Stewie, Lois put Meg in charge.

And honestly, once I knew that,
I ate a pot cookie, so, um...

Yeah.

So, good luck with all that.

-You got any cool DVDs?
-Brian, please, I need help.

(CHUCKLES) Totally! Hey, where's Chris?

I wonder if he'll play Wii Bowling
with me.

All right, that's it.
I'm not just gonna sit here

and see what that psycho does next.

All right, think.

Ah! I shall fashion a makeshift ladder
with my diaper genie entrails,

shimmy down to the yard, and I'm free!

The trick, Chris, is thinking of the wand
as an extension of your arm.

Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling
with a dog on drugs!

(THUMPING)

STEWIE: Ah! Son of a bitch!

-(BRAKES SCREECHING)
-(STEWIE GRUNTS)

Oh, my god! A baby!

My name is Shelly.
I can't have any of my own.

Would you like to come home with me?
I love you so much!

STEWIE: Argh! Everywhere's a nightmare!

(LAUGHING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Wow! It's nice they put on
a banquet for you.

But it looks like I'm the only woman here.

Yeah, they're ex-athletes,
which means they're all divorced.

In fact, their ex-wives are having
a banquet next door with their money.

(R&B MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, they're having fun.
They're doing a lot of "pointing" dancing.

At least somebody's
having fun here tonight.

Oh, you're just nervous
about the big game tomorrow.

Is it 'cause of how pink you turn
when you run?

A couple of guys mentioned that today
on the field.

-What? Who said that?
-I don't know. Nomar-something...

You met Nomar?

Hey! There you are!

We've been saving a spot at the head table
for you with all the hall of famers.

Oh, thanks!
Finally, something's going my way.

-Where should I...
-Not you.

-Lois.
-What?

(ORGAN BASEBALL THEME MUSIC
WINDING DOWN)

This is the one night of the year
they let me out of the scoreboard.

Oh, I don't know if I deserve
to sit at the head table.

No, no! We took a vote.
We all wanna sit next to you.

You're the only one here who doesn't have

a fist full of baseball cards for us
to sign.

I wasn't gonna have 'em sign them.
I was just gonna tell them their stats.

But, this is Peter's weekend.

Ah, don't worry about Peter.

Now, come on, Lois.

We've got you sitting right between

Pedro Martinez and
Ted Williams' severed head.

There's a special place in hell

for whoever's responsible
for me ending up like this.

Hey Meg, is anybody going to eat
this grilled cheese?

No, don't eat that. That's Stewie's lunch.

(GASPS) Oh, my god! Stewie! I forgot,
he's been in a time-out for six hours!

Stewie?

Oh, no! Where is he? He's gone!
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

I tried to tell you
watching Stewie wasn't easy.

(SIGHS)

Oh, man! This is terrible.
Stewie could be anywhere.

(PANTING HEAVILY)

(CROWD GASPS)

Sorry, I forgot my jacket.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, everybody,
we're gonna do some double play drills.

Oh, yeah. Little infield.
Let's flash some leather, huh, guys?

-Who wants to play second?
-I will.

Lois, why don't you take second?

How could he not see that?
I even held up my arm with my other hand!

That is the most noticeable way
to raise your hand.

Okay, Griffin, you go out there
and be the base runner.

All right, Peter, show 'em what you got.

Okay, Lois, catch the ball,

and if your foot comes off the bag,
just tag Peter on any part of his body.

How could I miss, right?
It'll be like tagging a barn!

(ALL LAUGH)

Sorry, Peter. That's baseball.

I'll show you baseball,
you sexually unsatisfied wife.

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh!

(PETER GRUNTING AND PANTING)

(GRUNTS)

(GROANS)

Yeah!

Now that's a big league slide, huh, coach?

Ahh!

Damn it, I think it's broken!

Griffin, what are you, an idiot?

Yeah. An idiot who's gonna
show up on <i>SportsCenter</i> tonight.

Coming up after the break, we'll have
highlights of the playoff game between...

Streaking. Unrelated.

Yep, her leg is fractured.
We should get her to the hospital.

My only medical training
is to say "Walk it off."

-Can you walk it off?
-No!

Oh, well, that's not good. Okay, I'm gonna
go fake-use the phone in the dug out.

Peter, what the hell got into you?

Nothing. I was just trying
to play hard like Pete Rose.

Look, I can even do the Pete Rose haircut.

I bet you a 1000 bucks
I have a drinking problem.

Guys, we gotta get that leg set.

I guess I should ride in the ambulance.

You think I'll be back in time
for the game?

What? You're not playing in the game.

It's supposed to be a fun day out here,
and you go nuts and break your wife's leg.

Well, it's not my fault. I'm all hopped up
on hard baseball card gum.

(CRACKING)

Mmm.

It's like eating a MasterCard.

Let's get her out of here.

And you, you're done.
Clean out your locker!

Kicked out? I'm totally screwed.

Like those poor guys who had to come up
with a new ad campaign for Subway.

Hey, I'm Mike. I like sandwiches
and people my own age.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Subway.</i>
<i>Please don't think of pedophilia.</i>

You know what I'm getting sick of saying?

"My husband did this to me,
but it's not what you think."

Please forgive me, Lois. I'm so stupid.

The reason I didn't bring my friends

is 'cause I didn't want 'em
hogging the spotlight.

And then when I saw everyone
giving you all that attention,

I guess I kinda lost it.

You did a little.

But, of course I forgive you.

I just don't understand
why you went so crazy.

Well, ever since I was little,
I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid

that nobody wanted on their team.

And I was excited,
that for one weekend, if I could just

step on that field
and get a hit at Fenway Park.

I could erase all that and feel like
a champ for the first time in my life.

But, I'm not a champ. I'm a fat loser.

No wonder nobody ever picked me.

I picked you, Peter.

And to me and our kids,
you will always be a winner.

Thanks, Lois. And you know what?

If that's true, I don't need to play
in some stupid Fantasy Baseball game.

Well, guess what?

You're gonna play in that game,

and you're gonna get that hit.

And when you do,
we're all gonna be there to cheer you on.

Really? Well how's that gonna happen?

Peter, these guys have been sexually
harassing me since the second I got here.

Either you play, or every one
of these Red Sox are going to jail.

Even Ted Williams.

Mmm. New meat.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

This is the number one fear
of only being a head.

Brian, do you always listen to
the SiriusXM preview station?

Yeah, I'm thinking about pulling
the trigger,

but they make you sign like a two year...

Guys, who cares about your dumb radio?
We can't find Stewie anywhere!

(CELLPHONE RINGS)

-(BEEPS)
-Hello?

Oh, hi, Mom.

Hi, honey. How you doing? How's Stewie?

Oh, he's great. Not lost or anything.
How's fantasy camp going?

Uh, your father broke my leg out
of jealousy.

But that didn't ruin our honeymoon,
and it's not gonna ruin this.

So listen, I want all you guys to
drive up to Boston this afternoon,

to see your father play in the big game.

(HESITATINGLY) Wow. We'd love to, Mom.

But, we promised Stewie we'd perform
a puppet show for him later today.

Oh, you can perform it
for all of us up here in Boston.

The game's in two hours. Drive safely.

Crap! Now we gotta find Stewie
and write a puppet show.

We could repurpose my one-act farce.

Or, we could write something fresh.

Well, just because it's already been
written doesn't mean it's not fresh.

What did I just say? Shut up!

We're in trouble. I'm in trouble!

Hey, what's this? A dickweed convention?

-Stewie!
-Oh, thank God, you're home!

Where the hell have you been?

As far away from her as possible!

-I forgot her name, honestly.
-Who? Meg?

Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean,

and I don't ever want her
to be in charge of me.

Are you afraid of me, little guy?

Oh, Stewie. I'm really sorry
I left you in that time-out.

I love you very much
and I'm so happy you're home.

You're my little brother.
Can you forgive me?

Well... All right.

-Can I have your baby?
-Don't let her in!

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(CROWD CHATTERING)

We're all proud of you, Peter.
Now don't be nervous.

I ain't nervous, Lois.

I'm just sweating
'cause I was too embarrassed

to get nude in the locker room

so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.

SPORTSCASTER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>Peter Griffin.</i>

-(GRUNTS)
-(CHEERS)

Fair ball. Run, Peter! Run it out!

-(TELEPHONE RINGS)
-Peter's brain.

Yeah, this is the muscle department.
What the hell is he doing?

Uh, apparently he's trying to sprint.

Sprint? He got winded walking
to the plate!

And he's been out
in the blazing sun for two days!

Has he had any water?

No. He told his wife
there's juices in the hot dogs.

Well, I'm sorry. I got no choice but
to call for a complete muscle failure.

(ALARM BLARING)

Honestly, Mom, today was kind of weird.

Every kid in school had to write
a list of five reasons

Principal Shepherd is cool,
and then have their parents sign it.

What? That seems crazy!

One time I saw him pee in a urinal
with his hands on his hips.

That's pretty boss.

Why would the principal
make all the students do that?

I don't know.
I think he's going through a tough time.

He's in the middle of a bad divorce.

What? How do you know that?

He's actually been pretty open about it.

BONNIE: What?

JOE: Listen to this.
Say "It's all been a pack of lies."

BONNIE: What? Why?

JOE: Just do it.
Just say "It's all been a pack of lies."

BONNIE: It's all been a pack of lies.

(DRUMS PLAYING)

BONNIE: That sounded really good!

JOE: Thanks, babe. Do you know
what that song is about?

Phil Collins watching some guy
watch another guy drown.

And then, the next night,
he invited the watching guy

to be in the front row of his concert

so he could sing it right to him
and then could arrest the guy.

BONNIE: Really? Why wouldn't he have
just helped the guy who was drowning?

JOE: I don't know. I think it was
on a bridge or something, like,

he could see it, but,
he couldn't get there in time.

BONNIE: But he let a whole day pass?
Why didn't he call the cops?

JOE: 'Cause he was busy writing the song.

BONNIE: Wait. If he just watched,

doesn't that also make him a
little guilty?

JOE: Look, I'm not saying we wouldn't
bring Phil Collins in for questioning.

BONNIE: I feel like maybe
this story is bogus!

JOE: Now, hang on. Let me check Snopes.

-Yeah, none of that happened.

Hey, what's up?

Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel

It's so damn loud around here.

Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway
used to complain about.

"This Spanish Civil War is just too loud!

"How am I supposed to get anything done?"

No, I mean, it might sound silly, but,

I used to daydream that by now
I would have my own place

by a lake somewhere.

An oasis where I could go to write.

Pay the bills by renting out the rooms.

Like a B and B? That could be fun.

What? What are you talking about?

I'm talking about you and me
opening a B and B!

Are you serious? That'd be great!

-Sure, it will be fun.
-All right, let's give it a try.

Can't be any worse that when I was
on the Night's Watch.

Hey, guys, you all want to say
the oath again?

(GRUNTING)

(GROANS)

For the Watch.

For the Watch!

-For the Watch.
-(GROANING)

-Hi, Brian.
-(GROANS)

I'm the boring storyline of the fat guy
that's watching that girl.

-And I'm <i>Ballers!</i>
-Ow!

(SCREAMING)

I totally get it. You're right to do this.

Well, well, if it isn't Meg Griffin.

Leave me alone, you guys.

Relax. We're taking the day off
from bullying.

Oh. Thank God.

(GASPS)

Very funny.

Who put the Ark of the Covenant in here?

(ALL LAUGHING)

Meg is so stupid.

She couldn't handle the glory
of God's love.

Students, faculty and staff
of James Woods High.

Does anyone know how to push down
the backseat of a Highlander?

I know I can make a bed in there.
I just don't know how.

Oh, my God,
Principal Shepherd, what's wrong?

I just listened to two hours
of butt-dialed sex

between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.

Why didn't you just hang up?

Because I miss the sound of her voice!

(SOBBING)

Oh, my God!

WOMAN: (OVER PA)
<i>Principal Shepherd, </i>

<i>your wife is on the line.</i>

<i>She says...</i>

(MOANS) <i>"Oh, God! Harder!"</i>

Man, I still can't get over
how perfect this place is.

I know. It's going to be
such a darling B and B.

I got the boiler up and running,
Mr. Griffin.

Well, we don't have a boiler,
but I can't wait to see

what you've done in the cellar.

Also, please rub the "H" and the "C"
off all the knobs,

so people won't know
what the hell is going on.

I want the first four minutes
of every shower

to be confusion and anger.

Welcome, members of our
school community.

Let's call to order this emergency meeting
of the school board,

regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.

I know a number of our students
have felt...

(MOCKINGLY)
"Traumatized" by the events of this week.

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
And we take those concerns very seriously.

-Lois, I'm done with my gum.
-I don't want it.

-But I'm done with it!
-Peter, shh!

I'll take it.

So, due to his erratic behavior,
we have placed Principal Shepherd

on indefinite paid leave.

Typically, Vice Principal Maguire
would step in.

However, I was informed earlier today
that she was found dead in her car.

(MAN COUGHS)

Therefore, the board is seeking
a parent volunteer

to serve as interim principal

until a permanent replacement
can be found.

Lois, maybe I should do it.

I've always wanted a job
where I can let my dandruff go wild.

What? No way! I'm not having my dad
be the principal.

How embarrassing!

Yeah, no offense, Peter, but I don't know
if you should be running a school.

What are you talking about?
I'm a natural leader.

That's why I'm so good
at leading "Simon Says."

Simon says "leave the band."

Yeah, I don't know.

You know what? You guys are wrong
and I'm going to prove it to you.

Again, any volunteers?

I'll be your new principal.

Wonderful. Why don't you
come on up and introduce yourself?

All right. James Woods High cheerleaders,
give me a hand.

(CHEERING)

(SINGING) <i>Check him out</i>
<i>Check, check him out</i>

<i>-My name is Peter</i>
<i>-Check</i>

<i>-That ain't no lie</i>
<i>-Check</i>

<i>I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz</i>
<i>Oh, how sweet it is</i>

<i>Check, check</i>

I'm done with this gum now.

-I don't want it.
-But I'm done with it.

Mom, why was this Listerine
in the garbage?

Oh, your father says
he doesn't need it anymore,

now that he's a high school principal.

Oh, my God!
He's not really doing that, is he?

I'm only going to get bullied worse now!

Hello, <i>Breakfast Club.</i> (LAUGHS)

As the principal, I like to start
each morning with a reference

from last century.

Dad, I don't want you to do this!

Too late. I've already been practicing
giving students

awkward and uncoordinated high fives.

Chris, if I may.

Yay! Two fingers inside of the palm
contact!

-Perfect!
-All right, I got to get to work

by 7:40 because that's when
high school starts for some reason.

See you at the way-too-early 10:40 lunch.

(GROANS)

I feel you, Meg.

-Shut up.
-You shut up!

Wow. Look at us. Running a B and B.

Yes, so far, all the guests seem
very happy.

Hi, we're checking out.
Just charge my card.

That's weird. That's the fifth couple
to check out after only an hour.

Hi, we'd like a room, please.

Wait, I'm sorry. Weren't you just here
a moment ago with a different man?

Oh, crap!

Stewie, we have a problem.

The only people checking in are here
to have sex with prostitutes.

What? Nonsense!

Then why are they all signing

the guest book and writing
great things like

"Railed Crystal good"?

Oh...

Damn it, this is awful.
How could I have not noticed sooner?

I mean, it's more obvious
than when George Takei was in the closet.

Hey, George, how are you?

I'm heterosexual.

I love vaginas.

Yum, yum, yum...

So, what are you doing tonight?

Hopefully, choking on some vagina.

Oh, nubbers!

All right, that sounds fun. See you later.

I'm a heterosexual.

Good morning, children.
I am your interim principal, Mr. Griffin.

And to show I'm a fun principal,
I'm going to do the Ice Bucket Challenge.

Three years too late,
but right on time for a principal

and making no less sense
than it did when it was current.

(STUDENTS CHEERING)

You're welcome,
person who is probably already dead.

But, hey!
Now I've got something even more fun.

How about we all do
an expertly choreographed lip-dub

to a popular song?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>This hit, that ice cold</i>
<i>Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold</i>

<i>This one for them hood girls</i>
<i>Them good girls straight masterpieces</i>

<i>Stylin', whilen, livin' it up in the city</i>

(YELLING)

<i>-I'm too hot</i>
<i>-Hot damn</i>

<i>Call the police and a fireman</i>

Ladies, this is my associate.
Brian, bitches. Bitches, Brian.

What? What's all this?

This, Brian, is called "diversification."

You see, if our guests insist
on bringing prostitutes

into our B and B,
we might as well provide the women, too.

What? Stewie,
we're not going to become pimps.

-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

The answer is no, so, don't bother
flashing a wad of money

because there's no way I'm going to
change my answer in the middle

of this sentence... Okay, maybe we can
try it out and see how it goes.

Hey, what are you girls doing
standing around? Get to work.

(LAUGHS)

I'm telling you, that dog is
very easily persuaded.

Now, let's see what's going on
at the old high school.

Ooh... Ooh...

Hey, guys, guys.

When Borat was making announcements
over the P.A. this morning,

that was me.

What? Shut the front door!

(AS BORAT) Taco Tuesday is nice.

MEG: Knock it off! Give me back my lunch.

What have we got here?
Grape juice in a Ziploc bag?

I have to make my own Capri Suns.

(YELLS)

Hey, stupid. What the hell are you doing?
That's my daughter.

Yeah? What are you going to do about it?

What am I going to do about it?
I'll knock your teeth down your throat

-and out your butt, you little bastard.
-(CHUCKLES)

Oh, you think that's funny?
Him spilling juice all over the floor?

This is going to make
people's sneakers sticky.

And then we're going to have to
listen to... (IMITATES SQUEAKING) All day!

Well, I won't have it.
Get on your knees and lick that up.

What? Are you serious?

Yeah, I'm serious. I'm the principal.

(GRUNT)

Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

What are you talking about? That jerk
is finally getting what he deserves.

Yeah, Meg.
Now that your dad is the principal,

you could finally have power
over the bullies.

Now, you little punks get to class.

And if you see Ms. Millikin,
tell her I said, "Hey, what's up?"

Huh. Maybe you're right.

Wow, Dad, that was really something.

-Ms. Millikin is just a friend.
-Oh, I don't mean that.

I mean the way you handled those guys
that were picking on me.

Really? I felt like I kind of lost
my cool there.

Not at all!
That's what you've got to do more of.

-You were like a real principal there.
-I was?

Yeah. In fact,
if you're going to lead this school,

you've got to know
that kids need discipline.

Especially kids like them.
And their friends Jeremy and Bridget.

Oh, really? Where might I find
this Jeremy and Bridget?

I don't know. Study Hall, second floor.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

All right, listen up, maggots. Fun's over.

There's going to be some changes
around here.

And what better way to show you
I'm serious

than to smash a desk with a baseball bat.

Ow!

(GRUNTS) Ow!

Ow!

(GROANS)

(STRAINING)

(GROANS)

Argh!

(BELL RINGING)

Okay, we'll pick this up on Monday.

Do any of you know my wife, Lois?

Tell her I'm on the bats and to come
get me. She'll know what it means.

Let's go. Keep it moving. Get to class.

Hey, you! You salute that flag
when you walk by, kid.

Loads of people fought for that thing,
including yours truly.

You were in the Service?

I may have misunderstood what
"yours truly" means.

Hey, Dad, listen.

The four of us got together last night

and we came up with a list
of 11 students and two teachers

that you need to do something about.

-Maybe you should start with Mark Relich.
-Why? What did he do?

He wouldn't kiss Ruth
at the Sadie Hawkins' Dance,

even though she bought him dinner before
at Walt's Roast Beef.

-I don't see how that's got anything...
-And he called you fat.

-Oh, I'm going to squish him!
-That's right.

Don't take any crap from anyone.

Well, I won't. I'm going to take down
all these punks,

just like I did in my 1980's crime series,

<i>Gary Ratowski: Hockey Cop.</i>

-Give me that purse.
-(WOMAN WHIMPERING)

PETER: Hey, criminals.

Puck you!

Get the puck out of my neighborhood.

-Go puck yourself.
-(SIRENS BLARING)

Uh-oh. Here come the real cops.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Hockey cop, not a cop.</i>

All right, ladies, I'm going to put this
as gently as I can.

But it appears that someone's rectum
fell out on the stairs.

Now, whose is it? Be honest.

All right, that's fine,
but let's just agree on a rule

that if your rectum falls out
on the stairs,

it's on you to pick it up.

Look at that, Brian.

Our day has just begun
and there's a line out the door.

I know. We're raking it in.

This is a hell of a lot easier than
when I delivered pizza in New Orleans.

What the hell?

ALL: (SINGING)
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

Come on, I got to deliver this pizza.

<i>Five trumpets do the job of one</i>
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

I need to be there in 30 minutes.
It's a company promise.

<i>Half a band is a limber band</i>
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

Oh, thank God!

<i>One of us dropped a contact lens</i>
<i>We're going back to block the street</i>

Ah, screw it.

<i>We won't stop blocking the street</i>
<i>Never stop blocking the street</i>

Okay, so I think Lee Blanding
gets detention.

And, for Jason O'Neil,

maybe you could pants him
during an assembly.

Yes, good, I like that.

Oh, hi, you two. What are you working on?

Nothing. I, um... I'm just helping Dad
with his schedule for tomorrow.

You know, he's really doing a great job.

He's actually made the school
a lot better.

Huh. Well, I got to admit,
I was skeptical,

but it sounds like things are
going pretty well down there.

You bet they are.

-They'll go even better after the Purge.
-The what?

Hey, Meg. How about one of these?

(GRUNTING)

One of them things, yeah?

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

Uh... He's just saying
he wants to use his key

to drive me to school tomorrow in his car.

Peter, what exactly are you doing
down at that school?

I'll tell you what I'm doing.
I'm doing a great job.

Like when I was a pro football kicker.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Yay! Now I can fist bump with black guys.

-Nailed it, Peter.
-There you go.

Yeah, we're going to the club tonight?

-Not you.
-Okay!

Hey, Brian, what's a splat job?

I don't know, Stewie.
I'm worried that you're seeing too much.

Good morning, ladies.

Were the paramedics
able to resuscitate Lamar Odom?

They're still working on it.

He's tall, get it?

Okay, show's over. Everybody back to work.

Yeah, about that. We gotta talk.

Oh, uh, sure. What's up?

We just realized we can keep
all the money,

take your house and kill you
if you try to do anything about it.

All right. We're just going to step
outside and figure out a counter.

-(CLICKING)
-And they locked us out.

What about my loaf
of cinnamon-raisin bread?

It's mine! It's not for the whole house.

-(GRUNTING)
-Let's just go. They won.

Oh, we'll see about that.

Hello. I'd like to report a brothel

operating on Route Six
near Round Hill Road.

Thank you.

You want to eat mangled raisin bread
across the street

and watch the cops raid the place?

Yeah, I'd like that.

(SIRENS WAILING)

-(WOMEN SHOUTING)
-(GLASS SHATTERING)

STEWIE: Oh, here comes the UPS guy.

Oh, I bet he's delivering
those marmalade jars we ordered.

Doesn't that feel like a million years
ago?

Yeah, we don't need those anymore.
Sorry, just send them back.

You can just do that?

Oh, yeah, you can just refuse delivery.
You've never done that?

I... I genuinely did not know
you could do that.

Well, you can.

Anything you order, if you don't
sign for it, it has to go back.

Everyone does it.

Most of what America is now
is just boxes going back and forth.

Students, this is a chair without a seat.

Jeff Banfield, I'd like you to please
come down here,

take your pants off and sit.

-Me? What did I do?
-You know what you did, Jeff!

I don't even know what's going on!

Just go, Jeff, or he'll start hitting
that trash can with a spoon again.

That means now, Mr. Banfield.

What is going on here?

Just a little of the three Rs.

Reading, 'riting and rucking
this guy's sack.

The School Board received
a very serious complaint.

Mr. Griffin,
you are hereby relieved of your duties.

(GASPS)

-A promotion?
-No, you're fired.

We've re-instated Principal Shepherd.

Wait, he's back?

But he had that crazy meltdown
about his divorce.

Yes, but then I went on a sex trip
to Thailand

and I banged all the goofy right
out of me.

Wait, Dad is fired? Who did this?
Who turned him in?

I did.

-GIRL: Hi, Mrs. Griffin!
-Hi.

Hi, Patty.

Why, Mom?

Because what you and your father
have been doing is wrong!

We'll talk about this at home.

Well, I guess your mom was
right all along.

I had no business running a school.

Can I be honest with you, Dad?

I thought you were awesome!

You stood up for all the kids
who get picked on.

You stood up for me!

Wow, so, you think I did a good job
being principal?

No. You did a good job being my dad.

Come on, Meg, let's go home.

And next time I want to get back
at your bullies,

I'll do it the old fashioned way.

As a grown man beating up teenagers
in a parking lot.

I'm planning on dying tonight.

What are your plans?

-Uh, where's the slide?
-Just eat this Starburst.

-Wow! Lemons, oranges, cherries. So juicy.

I don't think that was a Starburst.

I think that may have just been acid.

Would you like to ride
the Skittles rainbow now?

Is it also acid?

My friend, I'm an adult
who works at a water park.

If I give you something, it's acid.

-Hey!

BRIAN: Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.

-Ew, Brian, what happened?
-I don't know.

Hey, idiot.
You got to wait till the guy says, "Go."

Excuse me,
do you think you can help me out?

Sure. But just let me do an awkward,

extremely unattractive pool walk
over to you.

(STRAINING)

(GRUNTING)

(PANTS)

-Hey, what's up?
-My top came off on the slide.

I think I may have seen you
put it in your shorts.

Okay. Well, here's my shorts,
just fish out the one that's yours.

Thank you so much.

-I'm Isabella.
-I'm Chris.

And listen, my aunt is waiting for me,
but it was nice to meet you, Chris.

You too. Enjoy the boobs of your
morning...

(GASPS) Afternoon.

Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.

(LAUGHS)

My word, Chris,
that girl was totally into you.

-You should ask her out.
-Really?

But what if she says no?

Hey, if you want something,
you've got to go for it.

Just like the fat man did
when he changed his name.

I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.

-Obviously, that's me.
-Yes.

There's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear
in the mens' room trash.

Who took 'em out of sink?
They were soaking!

Sir, I can't park this.

There's diarrhea all over the front seat
of your PT Cruiser.

Isabella! Listen, I'm not great at this,
but...

Yup!

Told you.

Also, I was wondering
if there's any chance you maybe

want to go out with me sometime?

Oh, Chris, that's sweet.

But I don't think
you'd want to go out with me.

-Why not?
-It's just that... Well, I have kids.

Oh, wow. And a couple of cuties.

Have we got any teeth coming in?

Oh. Oh, I think I feel something.

Please... Please don't do that.

Hey, your aunt is Consuela?

-Hi, Consuela.
-You two know each other?

Oh, yeah. "Lemon Pledge, no, no."
All that stuff.

It's time to go, lemon Pledge, no, no.

(LAUGHS) See? But wait. Isabella,

I don't care that you have kids,
I'd still like to go out with you.

Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.

Okay, you're on. Here's my number.

Oh, boy. I haven't been this excited
since our trip to Philadelphia.

MAN: (OVER PA) <i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

<i>flight 427 to Philadelphia has been</i>
<i>canceled.</i>

Yay!

I saw a <i>Lady and the Tramp,</i>

so I asked if we could
eat spaghetti in the alley,

but they said "no"
because of all the homeless masturbation.

Oh, I love that movie.

Chris, I'm having
a really nice time with you.

You are?

Listen, this is probably lame, but...

I learned a little bit of your language,

and I just wanted to say,

(SPEAKING KOREAN)

What language is that?

-You're Korean, are you not?
-No. (CHUCKLES)

I'm Mexican.

(SPEAKING KOREAN)

Hey, Chris. Where are you off to?

Oh, Isabella's coming by and we're
going to take the kids to the park.

Wow, you two
are spending a lot of time together.

Ah, are you sure
you want to date a girl

who's had so much experience?

What do you mean?

Like, maybe she's got some city miles
on her hoo-hoo.

Not to mention,
a couple of blowouts. (CHUCKLES)

-Hey, Bri...
-Yup. I heard you.

She's talking about her kids, Chris.

Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.

I just want to make sure
you're not getting in over your head.

Well, I'm sure
someone's already been in there

deeper than that, Lois. (CHUCKLES)

Brian.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh. Hello, Isabella.

Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.

Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.

Well, I guess you two have fun.

Okay, bye.

Look, I can see why you're concerned
that Chris's girlfriend has kids

but he's happy,
and she seems like she's into him.

Plus she's... She's hot.

Yeah, she is.

I bit my lip off.

(STONE RATTLING)

(SIGHS)

Go away, Mr. Herbert!

HERBERT: It's not me. I'm in your closet.

Isabella?

Is everything okay?

Chris, I just wanted to say "Goodbye."

What? What do you mean?

I found out that I'm going to be deported.

They're sending me back to Mexico
in the morning.

So in other words,
this could have waited till the morning.

I didn't want to leave
without saying "Goodbye."

But they can't send you away.

-There's got to be something we can do.
-Unfortunately, there's not.

But don't worry, I'm planning on getting
back into the country as soon as I can.

What are you going to do?
Just leave the babies with Consuela?

I wish I could,
but she works seven days a week,

between housekeeping
and being the new CEO of Yahoo!

Maybe we should improve
our business model.

No, no.

-Improve our original content?
-No, no.

So we have no corporate identity?

We secondary email
people use to sign up for porn sites.

So are you taking your boys back with you?

I guess I have no choice.
But I hate having to.

The whole reason I left Mexico
was to give them a better life.

Well, I could take them until you
get back.

I mean, I'm no expert
at this sort of thing, but...

(GRUNTS)

Whoa, you're getting better at that.

But I can't ask you
to take care of my children.

Isabella, I want to do this.

Chris, stop.

You would really look after my kids
for me?

Of course I would.

You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.

Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

I'll be back as soon as I can.

Don't worry,
I'm going to take good care of you.

I'm going to call you "One,"
and I'm going to call you "Two."

Good. He's been reading the book.

Uh, Dad,
you're reading the paper upside down.

Wrong again, idiot.

Chris, what are you doing
with Isabella's babies?

Why are you holding them that way?
You'll hurt them.

-Where's Isabella?
-She got deported this morning.

"Deported"?
And she just left her babies with you?

Well, just until she can come back.

Chris, are you crazy? What makes you think
you can take care of two babies?

I don't know.
I've seen her take care of them.

I see you with Stewie.

Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.

You just shattered her world.

Shattered!

Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.

Look, I made a promise to Isabella
and I'm going to keep it.

Now if you'll excuse me,
these two need to eat.

He bought a breastfeeding book,
someone may want to pop in on him.

There's no way Chris is going to be
able to take care of two babies.

Well, maybe he should have thought it out
before he opened his slut legs.

No. Peter, that's not...
Anyway, we got to call child services.

Lois, if you do that, Chris will
resent you for the rest of his life.

Then what do you suggest we do?

I say you let him try.

Trust me, one day of watching those kids
and he'll want 'em out of here.

(SIGHS) All right. Fine.

Yes. Taking care of kids is a 24-hour job.

Like when I worked at that all-night diner
from that painting.

They kicked me out of the war
for kissing a guy.

All right, guys,
nothing but the best for you two.

So I got you, all organic, non-GMO,
no hormone food.

That'll be $500.

Ah, well, sorry, kids.

Looks like we're going to go
to Jersey Mike's

and hope that future science will save us.

Yay! We're jar people.

Ah! Science, help!

ANNOUNCER: <i>Jersey Mike's.</i>

<i>Bring your girlfriend with the fat ass</i>
<i>in here.</i>

Hey, guys, how about a little TV?

We can watch a baby thing together.

<i>Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies...</i>

Ah, what's <i>CSI Babies?</i>

(BABIES CRYING)

What's this? They can't solve this crime.
They're just frightened babies.

They don't even know it's a crime,
they just know their parents aren't there.

They're scared, now I'm scared.

-Turn this off!
-(BABIES CRYING LOUDLY)

STEWIE: Ah! That's not what I want.
I'm going to go hide in my couch fort.

Is <i>CSI Babies</i> over yet?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, hello, Consuela.
You must be here for the twins?

No. No take babies.

I have good news
and "ay-ay-ay" news.

Okay.
Give us the "ay-ay-ay" news first.

Isabella no can come back.
Stuck in Mexico.

The babies, they stay here.

-What?
-What's the good news?

Good news is bus get new wiper blades.

No more...

(IMITATES WIPER BLADES SPUTTERING)

Well, these kids are not staying here.
You got to take them.

How can I take them when I was never here?

Wow! She's like the Mexican David Blaine.

Wait. Is David Blaine Mexican?

-He's something.
-Peter, forget that.

What are we going to do?

Chris can't just be stuck
with these babies.

Why not? I'm doing a great job.

I love Isabella and I love her kids.

Chris, you're living in a dream land.
How are you going to support two babies?

I could just take some time off school
and get a job.

No. Absolutely not.

Well, hold on, Lois. Hold on.

Maybe Chris getting a job
is not the worst idea.

I mean, I made pretty good money
when I hosted that confusing game show.

All right, Phil, come stand by me.
It's Ashley's turn.

Ashley, go ahead. Pick an answer,
find the question, spin the table,

and remember
the clock is ticking backwards.

-I'll pass.
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

Congrats, you win. Sorry to see you go.
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.

Well, that's all the time we have.

For those of you playing at home,
"Why and how?"

-Audience?
-AUDIENCE: "Why and how?"

Stop that!

Forget it.

I will not allow you to drop out
of school.

If Isabella can't get here
to take her kids back,

we'll just have to bring them to her.

What? What do you mean?

I mean, we're going to Mexico, so we can
give these kids back to their mother.

Peter, back me up here.

(SINGING)
<i>Let's get those kids back to their momma</i>

Look how winded he is
from doing that one spin.

(PANTING) Your mother's right, Chris.
We're going to Mexico.

I got to sit.

All right. We're off to Mexico.

If you kids are good, we'll bring you back
a tangled marionette.

Is it going to be a long trip, Dad?

No, not too bad.

Especially since we're going to do it
to the wrong stock footage.

Boy, what a trip!

Chris, are you sure this is
Isabella's village?

This place looks pretty rough.

Yeah, this is it. Santa Terrible.

Look, there she is!

Chris, what in the mind of Mencia
are you doing here?

-My babies.
-Isabella, I missed you so much.

<i>Ay,</i> Chris, I missed you, too.

Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be
separated from your children,

so we've brought them to you.

We wish you all the best.
Say "Goodbye," Chris.

Mom, we can't just leave them here.

This is no place
for Isabella to raise a family.

(MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH)

Oh, you're right, Chris.

I didn't want you to have to
raise those babies yourself.

But as a mom, I don't know if I can
in good conscience leave this family here.

We'll just have to smuggle her
and her babies back in.

Well, no one's better at smuggling
than El Chapo.

Maybe he can help us.

How are you going to get El Chapo to help?

It's easy. All you got to do is say,
"Dyed, black eyebrows"

into the wind and he appears.

"Dyed, black eyebrows."

-Can I help you?
-Peter Gallagher.

-Maybe I can help.
-Mark Cuban.

Now we're getting
all the wrong eyebrow guys.

Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk
of smuggling me and my children

across the border?

But you could be arrested.

I realize that.

But you have just as much right
to a decent life for your children

as anyone else.

Now, we just need a plan.

All right. What if we run?

(COUGHS) Damn it, Peter!
What about Quagmire?

He could probably get his hands
on a plane.

Lois, that's actually a great idea.

"Actually"? Why are you saying
it like that?

And Quagmire owes me a favor anyway.
Remember?

Last time he went out of town,
I sat on his eggs for him.

LOIS: Peter, it's time for lunch.

Sorry, Lois. Can't leave the eggs
till Quagmire gets back.

LOIS: We're having sloppy joes.

Well, I guess I haven't seen
that mongoose in a while.

-LOIS: We're having sloppy joes.
-Yeah, I heard.

-Please say you got the onion bun.
<i>-We're having sloppy joes.</i>

(GASPS) Mongoose!

(GASPS) Mongeese!

(CHOKING)

Hey, just a heads up.
My dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire,

is going to say a lot of stuff to you
and it's all going to be disgusting.

Hey, you must be Isabella.
I came as soon as I heard about you.

And then I got on my plane.
(CHUCKLES) All right.

OFFICER: Hold it right there!

Uh-oh. Somebody's coming.

No, no. Hold on. Hold on.

I put my business card in a fish bowl
at an El Torito.

This could be about that.

<i>Policía!</i> Put your hands up.

Is this about the raffle for the free
lunch?

Does it have to be during the week?
Because I... (GROANS)

Wait a second. Are we being arrested?
We've done nothing wrong.

We're not arresting you,
we're taking your plane.

And Javier, get their keys
and take their SUV.

Ah, that stupid fat guido.

No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.

No, I know.
I was just thinking about Snooki.

(VULTURE SCREECHES)

Wait. I can't believe
there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.

Yeah, Donald Trump was right.

His daughter is a hot piece of ass.

Uh, you guys, don't panic.

But there's a couple of coyotes
over there.

(GROWLS AND SNARLS)

Oh, like <i>Coyote Ugly</i> with Piper Perabo.

Is that Pari... Pari-bow? Para... Para...
Para-boo.

Para-boo. Say it with me. Par... Para-bow.

Is that right? It's weird,
but you remember.

You know, I guess...

I guess that's the point.

-You think she's set for life?
-Peter, we're about to die!

(SNARLS AND BARKS)

No. My babies.

Get out of here! You leave them alone.

Ow! (STRUGGLING)

Ah, Chris!

(COYOTE WHIMPERS)

You guys, I've been bit!

And he got away
with my friendship bracelet.

-You are a boy.
-Chris, you saved my babies.

Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.
We're his parents and we did nothing.

I know. But, wow... Did you see
how Chris took care of those kids?

Up till now the only thing he could
take care of was my traffic tickets.

-Name?
-Uh, Peter Griffin.

Peter Griffin's here to surrender
for his vehicular manslaughter.

What? No! I'm a good boy.

He is a good boy.

(DINERS SCREAMING AND GROANING)

Oh, this is awful.

Chris is injured and we're completely
out of food and water.

I know. I'm so thirsty,
I'll be willing to drink anyone's pee.

(STAMMERS) Not yours, Chris, or Peter.
But, you know... You know, anyone.

Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.

You know, I just wanted
to do the right thing,

but now we're all going to die.

Did... Did you gals hear my pee thing?

Time for clean getaway.

-Consuela?
<i>-Tia.</i>

<i>Ay.</i> Thank God. How did you find us?

Babies' earring have chip.

Oh, well, this is great.
Can you help us get to the border?

Oh, you already in United States.

-We are?
-Yes. This Texas.

What? So we walked right across the border
and didn't even know it?

That is a problem, right?

I mean, politics aside,
we can all agree that is a problem.

Thanks for the ride, Consuela.

And thanks for taking us
on that little detour to Dollywood.

Was I right or was I right?

Yup. Totally worth the extra two days.

Look, Chris. I owe you an apology.

I didn't believe in you.

I was wrong to say
you couldn't handle the responsibility

of taking care of two kids.

You risked your life for those babies.

Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.

That's right. Because you care about them
just like you care about Isabella.

And if you want to continue to date her
and be a part of those kids' lives,

I'd be just fine with that.

Are you kidding? Screw that.
Looking after babies is a nightmare.

Oh, you have no idea.

You know how many times
I had you kids in the oven

just daring myself to turn it on?

Well, thanks for trusting me
to figure it out for myself.

-I love you, Mom.
-I love you too, sweetheart.

Isabella, being with you
has been really great.

But I think I realized my mom was right.

I'm too young to be taking on
this much responsibility.

I understand.

But I know someday
you will make an incredible father.

-Goodbye, Chris.
-Goodbye, Isabella.

(ENGINE STARTS)

LOIS: Chris, time for dinner.
We're having sloppy joes.

-Oh, boy!

No! Please, no!

How would you find out the name
of the actual actress

I left a list of hot commercial girls
on the refrigerator.

What is this refrigerator
you keep mentioning?

Are you talking about the sandwich house?

(SIGHS) I guess I'm not the only person
with a useless husband.

I mean, look at Mrs. Butterworth's.

at me about.

-Nobody called or anything?
-Nope.

So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough
to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?

You know, where I just lie there
and arch my hips a little bit

and breathe like a dying whale.

-All right. Well, just in case,

I'll be upstairs getting into my boxers

Do you think it's possible
he actually has an illegitimate child?

I don't know, but something's going on

he lied right to my face.

Sometimes friends put wine out
for each other.

I just don't understand it.

I mean, we don't keep secrets

We didn't even keep the Pop Secret,

-Psst. Hey, did you hear?
-Hear what?

Orville Redenbacher is gay.

But he has a son,
he's in the commercial.

His son's gay, too. They're both gay.

They have sex parties
in the Hollywood Hills.

It sounds like you're just
making up stories about your competitors.

-You're gay, too.
-What?

Ah! You're a psycho!

Dad, you're never going to believe what...

Chris, meet Orville Redenbacher
and his son. Watch.

And that's where we get the expression,
"Gay as a bag of popcorn."

-All right, I'll see you later.
-What? Where are you going?

Laser tag orientation.

Well, that's obviously not true.

Yeah, that boy got liarrhea.

Oh, my God. I got to follow him,
find out where he's really going.

Good idea.

If I was you I'd stick to him

Now you've ruined Christmas.

Peter Griffin, you tell me
what's going on right now.

(SIGHS) Okay, fine.
I'll be honest with you.

Okay, but hang on.
You were a sperm donor?

Yeah. I had almost forgotten about it,

but then last night I get this call
from a woman who says she's my daughter.

Peter, that was me.
I was prank calling you.

You what?
I can't believe you would do that to me.

DONOR 1: Can you guys argue elsewhere.
You're making it tough to finish in here.

DONOR 2: No. Fight louder.
Call her a bitch!

But I don't understand.
Why did you come here today?

'Cause that call last night gave
me a scare.

I figured if I do have a kid out there,

I want to make sure
they're not giving out my information.

They're not supposed to.
I signed a form.

Hold on, Peter.
I'm sorry I tricked you.

But if you do have a child out there,

isn't it only fair to let him or her
meet you?

(SIGHS) Maybe you're right.

I mean, as long as we're here,
maybe you should sign a consent form.

Okay. Yeah. All right. I'll do it.

You know what? It feels good
doing something nice for others.

Like when I was a mentor for Kid Rock.

Okay. I took a leak into this can
of Busch Light without spilling.

You're ready.

You don't need me anymore.

Will I see you again, Peter?

Wherever a father weighs less
than his daughter, I'll be there.

Wherever someone has a banner
for a football team as a curtain,

I'll be there.

Wherever there's a fight
in a Waffle House, I'll be there.

Now go. People need a concert to go to
after the water park.

-What's going on?

-Who's this super model?
-I'm Katie.

I'm your daughter.

You're what?

Holy crap!

Yeah. I hope you don't mind the drop in?

But the, uh, sperm bank
said it was okay to contact you.

Yeah. I guess...
I guess I didn't expect this so soon.

Well, we were all
pretty excited to meet you.

What do you mean, "we"?

ALL: Hi, Dad!

We're all your children.
We came from your semen.

Semen. (GIGGLING)

(ALL GIGGLING)

-Semen.
-Semen.

(CHUCKLES)

Oh, sorry. Wrong house.

Look. Eddie's at the wrong house.

(ALL LAUGHING IN SUCCESSION)

(PETER'S CHILDREN
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Peter, how many times
were you a sperm donor?

Only once. But I had just seen
Uma Thurman in <i>Beautiful Girls,</i>

so it was kind of a kablamo.

You ever seen those videos
where they put Mentos in Diet Coke?

Uh, listen. I want all of you to know
how happy we are to meet you.

In fact, this calls for a celebration.

Can you all stay for dinner?

Aw, we'd love that!

-Wouldn't we, guys?
-Yeah, absolutely.

-You said it, babe.
-Yeah. Chinese Peter very hungry.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, Lois.

Just 'cause they're my kids
and they all look like me

doesn't mean we have anything in common.

I've never felt proud
of any of my children until now.

This is so exciting.

For years I have dreamed of one day
traveling from Bavaria

to play the accordion for my birth family.
May I?

(PLAYING)

I have just one question for you.

What are those?

Oh, I get that. Because this comedy
has just made it to Germany.

Wow. You look exactly like me.

(RUSSIAN ACCENT) Yes. I'm not actually
part of sperm donation thing.

I'm your secret clone.

We have been <i>Orphan Black-</i>ed
and you soon will be dead.

-(GUNSHOT)
-(GASPS)

-LOIS: Meg, where are you?
-(IMITATING MEG) I'm right here, Mom.

Wow, look at your fine ass.

-Are you talking to me?
-Damn right.

I've been looking around this whole house
for something to nibble on,

I think I just found it.

So many confusing feelings!

<i>-Dad.</i>
<i>-Sex.</i>

<i>-Black woman.</i>
<i>-Historically low mortgage rates.</i>

Ah! I got to go buy a house.

Lois! Lois, can I keep
the little Persian Peter?

No. They're too much work.

But I'll take care of it. I promise.

You always say that and I'm the one
who always ends up feeding them

and walking them,
and doing all the clean up.

Excuse me, I'm a candidate
for a doctorate in classics at Wesleyan.

It talks. Lois, it talks!

Ah! (GROANS)

Whoa, that was close.

You almost dipped one of your yabos
in the marinara.

-Let me help you with those.
-Well, thank you. That's so sweet.

You're the first person
who looks anything like my husband

who's offered to help in any way.

Oh, you must be Peter's wife, Lois.
I'm Larry.

It's nice to meet you, Larry.

Weird hands-full pinky shake?

I got to tell you, it's so strange,
you look so much like Peter

when I first met him.

Well, I'm guessing
you look exactly the same, too.

You're in such great shape.

Well, I do have tiny blue weights
in my garage.

(BOTH LAUGH)

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

-Oh. Hi, Larry.
-Hi, Lois. Is Peter here?

Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.

Peter's still sleeping off last
night's party.

Then why... Why are you still
in your pajamas and bathrobe?

Oh. That's because I'm depressed.

Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob
is following you around?

Who would ever fuck me?

Anyway, we didn't really get a chance
to finish our conversation yesterday,

and I thought maybe we could
grab some lunch together.

Ah. That would give me a reason
to get dressed today.

Oh, would you, uh, like to join us?

That didn't sound like a real invitation.

See. This is why no one
ever wants to fuck you.

Thank you again for lunch, Larry.

Sorry, I drew so many Nazi symbols
on the place-mat. I was just nervous.

That's okay. I just wish
we hadn't gone to a kosher restaurant.

Oh, look at me,
I got ice cream all over my fingers.

-Do you have a napkin?
-No, but let me help you clean it off.

Larry, are you turned on or starving?

Can't it be both?

(SNAPS)

(LOIS MOANS)

Wow, Larry. That was unexpected.

Shh. We'll discuss this later.

-I have to get back to my high school.
-Oh.

-Where I work.
-Oh.

-As a janitor.
-Oh.

-To pay for medical school.
-Oh.

-That I'm building.
-Oh.

-Out of Popsicle sticks.
-Oh.

That big one doesn't blink a lot, does he?

Hey, Lois, where's your purse? Me and
some of my kids are going to the movies.

By the way, dwarf Peter died. I didn't
know what he ate, so I gave him nothing.

His name was Tyler!

He had a name.

Everything you say, you say with pride.
I like that about you.

Anyway, where's Larry?
Maybe he wants to go to the movie.

Larry? Why would I know
where Larry is at?

-Who is Larry?
-Oh, never mind.

All right. Everybody bring your phones,

so we can text each other
during the movie.

Wow, you want to tell me what that was?

Brian, Larry and I
sort of crossed the line yesterday.

I don't know.
He's just so sweet and fun-loving.

And for God's sake he looks just like
Peter did when he was his age.

-Yeah. But?
-Well, he kissed me and I kind of let him.

I told him it could never happen again
and I...

-(GRUNTING)
-What are you doing?

Oh, I thought that was kind of like,
"I'm open for business."

No! I'm confiding in a friend.

Oh, you're the safe friend.

Look. I feel awful about it,
but I told Larry that was it,

and we couldn't be anything
more than friends.

-So, you're still going to see him?
-Yes, of course.

He's a nice young man,
and he's practically family.

ZOLOFT BLOB: Lois.

No! Zoloft blob, don't!

(GUNSHOT)

(GROANS)

-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

I'm fine.
I just hurt my neck this morning,

vigorously nodding approval to Judge Judy.

Okay. All right. The doctor is in.
Come on, back it up over here.

Somebody's got a neck massage coming.

Ah, right there.

Okay. But let's keep this friendly.

You can choke me for just a second.

You know, maybe I should just go ahead
and do your whole back.

Yeah, your bra strap
is getting in the way here.

I'll just bite it off with my teeth.

Lois, is a President stronger than a king?
What the hell?

Oh. Peter...

Look. Calm down. We're just friends.
He's just giving me a friendly massage.

"A friendly massage"?

Yeah. And what do you care?

When's the last time
you did anything nice for me?

I ate that gross pasta you made.

I might as well just tell you, Peter.

I'm in love with Lois.

I knew it the moment we kissed.

"Kissed"?

-Is that true?
-Yes, Peter. But I...

You son of a bitch!

(GROANS)

Ah!

(GROANS)

(PANTING)

(CRACKS KNUCKLES)

Everybody says,
"We don't need a home owners association.

"That's stupid, Quagmire." Well, this is
why a home owners association.

(WHEEZES)

(GROANING)

(THUDS)

What the hell? Lois.

What did you do that for? I thought you
and him were girlfriend and boyfriend.

He was not my boyfriend, Peter.

And I wasn't about to stand by
and watch him kick your ass.

-I was holding my own there.
-You were getting beat up.

No... No. I meant, I was holding
my own nuts, so he wouldn't kick 'em.

But if he's not your boyfriend,
why did you kiss him?

He kissed me.

And I should have told you.
I'm sorry if hurt you, Peter.

I guess Larry just reminded me
of a younger version you.

And the truth is I liked
that he was paying me a little attention.

The way you used to.

(SIGHS) Maybe I have been
taking you for granted.

But I promise I'll make it up to you.
I'll be the best husband ever.

You already are.

For God sakes,
when push came to shove,

you stood toe to toe with
a much younger man and fought for me.

Oh, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids,
for stepping in to help. Really...

Really appreciate that.
But you're right, Lois.

I'm going to change.

I'm going to do all the stuff for you
that Larry was doing.

No, Peter. I don't need any of that.

At our age,
all I'm really looking for in a husband

is someone who wants to watch TV with me
on a Saturday night,

and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.

"Afraid"? I love doing that.

It's like bubble wrap you get
to have sex with every now and then.

I got a pretty good one going right now,
Peter.

You always do, Lois. I love you.

MALE NARRATOR: <i>From that day forward,</i>

<i>Peter and Lois never again... Oh, nope.</i>
<i>Sorry. There's still another scene left.</i>

Well, Peter, turns out
your initial instinct was right.

You never should have let
any of your children contact you.

You said it. From now on,

I'm making sure
my sperm stays right where it belongs.

which is who you are.

My wife, Lois. Hugging my wife.

Package for Peter Griffin.

Thank you, unknown delivery woman.

Forget the freaking Emmy.
If you touch her ass, I will...

Ah! Amazon. Ay! My Uncle Alejandro
lives in the Amazon.

Do you think he has sent us
shoes made from banana leaves?

Boy, the ethnic characters
on these Emmy-winning shows

aren't exactly rocket scientists,
are they?

I don't know what you
talking about, Liz Lemon.

No, this is something I ordered, for me.

(INHALES) I am a woman
and always have been.

I've made plans to undergo surgery,

so my wang don't get in the way
of the woman what I am.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Lois, I'll still be a parent
to our children.

But now I'll be a trans-parent.

Get it? Transparent? Clever pun, right?

Please honor me for my courage.

I think gender-reassignment
surgery is very brave,

and the fat man should win
some kind of award for it.

-The fat woman.
-He hasn't chopped it off yet.

That doesn't matter.
Peter already identifies as a woman.

And on karaoke night,
I identify as George Michael.

That doesn't mean it's true.

Brian's just mad because
he has to be the lady one.

Which makes you the one
who's gay in real life.

Daddies, I'm standing here,

delivering my line
with more emotion and less of a monotone

than the actual Lily on <i>Modern Family.</i>

I'm now confident enough to share my truth

with the rest of my loved ones,
beginning with my son, Chris.

Bazinga, Father. Assuming "father"
is still the appropriate designation.

-What are you doing?
-Waiting for the laugh to die down.

I'm here because I've decided
to become the woman I am inside.

Can you find it in your heart
to accept me?

Oh, Dad, science has moved so far past
binary gender construction.

And if being a woman makes you happy,

then in the words of Mr. Spock,
"It's only logical."

I couldn't follow any of that,
but look how smart your audience is.

A-ha!

-Louis C.K.? Is that you?
-Yup. I'm a big fan of yours, Peter.

Wow, that's great, because if Louis C.K.
likes something, everyone has to.

That's right.

Well, I'm glad my popularity
has cooled off just enough

that you were able to get me to do this.
Bye, Peter.

Boy, he's not afraid
to go there, I'm told.

ALL: (SHOUTING) Norm!

As if gender roles have
been turned upside down.

Correct, Quagmire. I'm going
in for gender-reassignment surgery.

What the hell, Peter?
First my dad and now you?

Am I... Is it...
Am I doing this to people?

Do you guys feel like
cutting off your penises?

No, but I can turn it inside out
like rolling up a dress sock.

You guys aren't supporting my choice?

Well, what do you expect, Peter?
I mean, a sex change operation?

-Why are you doing this?
-I'll tell you why I'm doing all of this.

For me. M-E. M-E.

I'm doing it for M-E.

(SOBBING)

Ew. I mean, yay.

(CRYING)

(SNIFFLES) Man or woman,

I'm a big fat joke.
No one takes me seriously.

I do, Dad.

You've inspired me to nakedly
eat this cake in a weird place.

Thanks to you, I now believe in me.

Me. M-E. I believe in M-E.

Okay, okay, all right.
Don't want one that bad.

Peter, I'd like to introduce the surgeon
who will perform your procedure today.

Dr. Wang Gon.

Wow, I can't believe all you guys
came out to support me.

You guys aren't just the best friends
I've ever had.

You're also the best comedy.

ALL: Aw!

Great job, everyone. If that don't
get us the Emmy, nothing will.

Where do you think you're going?

(SCOFFS) Doc, I'm not actually going
through with the operation.

I'm going home.

We're doing this
whether you like it or not.

(CLAMORING)

-Hey, Doc, no. Stop him! Somebody help!
-You want the Emmy, don't you?

PETER:<i> And that is how</i>
<i>I became your mother.</i>

So, the Emmy committee watched
our submission for Best Comedy?

Uh-huh.

All right. Thank you.

They hated it so much,
they gave us a negative Emmy.

-We now owe them an Emmy.
-(ALL GROANING)

The Emmys aren't fair.

I mean, shows like <i>Nurse Jackie</i>
are basically dramas,

but they get comedy awards all the time.

(GASPS) That's it.
We'll sneak into the drama category.

That's how we'll win the Emmy,

with dark, confusing plot twists
like on <i>Homeland</i> or <i>Mad Men.</i>

Ooh! Or <i>Breaking Bad.</i>
Or <i>Mr. Robot Chicken.</i>

No, Chris, it's <i>Mr. Robot.</i>

<i>-Chicken.</i>
<i>-Mr. Robot.</i>

<i>Chicken.</i>

No, Chris. You see, <i>Mr. Robot</i>
is a critically acclaimed show.

<i>Robot Chicken</i> is something
kids used to watch in 2006.

It's basically four minutes of nonsense

on at 1:00 in the morning

What's the most acclaimed
drama of all time?

<i>-The Sopranos.</i>
-Right.

And what's the most memorable moment
in the history of that show?

Well, I'd have to say...

JOE: Nice briefcase full of cash.

Where'd you get the money for
a briefcase like that, Peter? I want in.

I need the money to pay off my
mysterious boss, Mr. Robot.

-CHRIS: Chicken!
-Chris, get back in the house.

(IMITATES KEVIN SPACEY) My whole plan,

You know, growing up in Gaffney,

my daddy always said,
"Turn the other cheek."

Kevin Spacey always said,

"I was just walking my dog
in that park at 3:00 a.m."

I don't trust either one of them.

I suppose it's time to
tell my wife the truth. Like a man.

(SOBBING) And then, I sold all the drugs,

'cause the doctor said I had the cancer,

and I killed the guys,
and Joe took all the... the money.

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

I see.

Are you leaving me?

-No, Peter. I'm helping you kill that cop.
-(GUN COCKING)

Because I'm darker than you
and the audience ever thought.

What a twist.

For five long years,
orange was my new black.

Peter, I don't care if it's drug money.
I have grown accustomed to Hulu Plus.

If you think I'm going back to
regular Hulu, you're crazy.

-We don't even watch that much Hulu.
-I still want it just in case.

Now take off all your clothes
so we don't get blood on them

when we kill that cop in the desert.

Oh, the beginning all makes sense now.

Why won't you die?

(BOTH SCREAMING)

-I did not see that coming.
-Wahey! One more. Let's watch one more.

Hold on. Like all television viewers,

our first priority before deciding
to continue watching a show

should be whether or not it

-Is that all?

No. There's another from Fleetwood Mac.

"Don't stop, stop.
Thinking about tomorrow, stop."

And here's one from the Supremes.
"Stop, stop. In the name of love, stop."

-Are you finished?
-Are you asking me to stop, stop?

Peter, close the door.

Well, that's it.
We didn't get Best Drama either.

This is hopeless. We've tried everything.

No, Lois, we haven't.

But that's just what we're
gonna do. Everything.

We're gonna try for every
single Emmy category.

Starting with Best Stunt Performance.

(PETER GRUNTS)

Peter, I don't think that's a category.

Okay. Best Documentary.

(STEWIE YELLS)

Chris is playing my dummy nephew.

Our family actually lines up
really well for this.

Best Competitive Reality Show.

-Peter, you're out.
-I'm off the show?

-No, your penis is out. Urine.
-I'm in?

No, urine is running down your leg.

Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series.

PETER: Okay, so the deal is
I get girls like you jobs.

The jobs pay $1,000 to $5,000 a day.
I'm recording this interview.

Then I send the demo tape to producers.
If they like you, they're gonna hire you.

-Have you done anything like this before?
-Never. This is my first time.

PETER: A lot of these scenes are gonna be
you interacting with someone else,

so I'll just come around
and read with you.

Now, since I'm holding the camera,

I'm gonna need
some help with my belt buckle.

And there you have it.
<i>Family Guy</i> reaches a new low

as it grovels and begs
for a meaningless award.

I would say they've got about as
much chance of winning an Emmy

as the Republican Party has
of accomplishing something.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

MAN: Peter, over here.

Bill Maher? What are you doing
not smirking outside a church?

Yeah, I was just doing that.

Look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons.

First, to find out who that
Asian girl was on the couch,

and second, to tell you that
<i>Family Guy</i> will never, ever win an Emmy.

Okay, first of all, that was Asa Akira.
I think you knew that.

Second, are you saying there's
a conspiracy against us?

Follow the Emmy.

(TIRES SCREECH)

It's back this way.
And who was that Asian girl on the couch?

I think you knew who that was.

To convey this moment of shock
at the depth of the conspiracy around me,

here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie
<i>Tough Guys Don't Dance.</i>

Oh, man. Oh, God. Oh, man.

Oh, God. Oh, man.

Oh, God. Oh, man.

Oh, God. Oh, man. Oh, God.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Peter, there you are.
I've been calling you all night.

-Where the hell have you been?
-No time to explain.

This Emmy thing goes deep.

The same people win year
after year after year.

It's like there's some
kind of secret society

that takes all the awards and
is keeping us from getting one.

Yeah, I know. They're all here to see you.

-Hello, Peter.
-(GASPS)

The Michelin Man? You're part of this?

No. I'm two-time Emmy-winner Alec Baldwin.

Peter, stop snooping around the Emmys.

Yeah, butt out.
It's none of your business.

Well, why not, Julie Bowen?
Huge fan, by the way. Just huge.

What are you hiding?

What's the big, secret reason
<i>Family Guy</i> can't win an Emmy?

All right, we'll tell you.
Your show sucks.

Peter, I'm famous writer Aaron Sorkin.
Walk and talk with me.

You wouldn't know my work
because I don't write for <i>Juggs </i>magazine.

Let me explain "writing" to you.

You can't take a scene
from <i>Ferris Bueller,</i>

cross out the name "Ferris,"
and replace it with "Peter."

And the racial stuff on your show
is just embarrassing.

You have people of color
voiced by white actors.

-No.
-Yes.

Hell, I'm Shonda Rhimes,
and I'm being voiced by a white actor.

And worst of all,
you take this big pile of garbage,

and you tie it all up by having
everyone sit around saying,

"At least everything's back to normal,"
as if something happened.

When nothing happened!

It was a complete waste
of everyone's time.

Well, I'm glad all this
Emmy nonsense is over

and things are back to normal.

Yeah, me too.
You know, I may not get Emmys,

but I do get the best award of all.
My family.

And this email from a young fan.

"Dear sir, your show helped me
when I was going through chemotherapy...

Aw!

"...My favorite episode was when
Homer stays home from church..."

Damn it. He thinks we're <i>The Simpsons.</i>

-Hey, what do you say? One last try?
-Why not?

Ladies and gentlemen,

please enjoy this spectacular live-action
chicken fight, starring Ty Burrell.

Good night.

Shh.

Shh.

one of those forced-happiness

that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.

Why are you so (BLEEP)
negative all the time?

I... What?

Come on, you guys. Relax.
Let's have a fun night.

We haven't done anything as a family
since we sat courtside at that NBA game.

(CROWD URGING)

-CROWD: Oh!
-You okay? You guys okay?

Great seats.

Yeah, it's a whole different game
when you sit down here.

Ha! "Samurai" or "geishas."
Which one am I?

I'll just wait till somebody else goes in.

Well, that wasn't helpful.
Mmm. This one's holding a fan.

That's usually what I need
when I'm done in a bathroom.

Yup! No urinals. Must've guessed wrong.

(WATER TRICKLING)

Wow, look at this place.
There's candles, hand lotion.

Wow! There's not even any swastikas
carved into the toilet seat.

And it's so peaceful.

I haven't heard a guy's booming fart
the whole time I've been in here.

I feel more relaxed
than a chick on Facebook

with her legs in front of a pool.

All right, Lois, I'm off to the mall.
I'll be back in about 20 minutes.

Oh, what are you gonna buy?

Nothing. After the other night,
I made a decision.

From now on,
I'm only using women's restrooms.

What? You can't do that.
You're a man. You'll get in trouble.

I got that covered.
I'm going to Anthropologie.

I'll just ask them for something
so ridiculous,

they'll have to check in the back for it.

And then I'll sneak
into their ladies' room.

Yes, I'd like a $4,000 ping-pong table
that's shaped like Easter Island.

We have one right over there.

Okay. How about a telephone
that's made of vintage phone book paper

and doesn't make or receive
phone calls or work in any way?

You mean like this one right here?

-Right, but what if I wanted...
-Sir...

Sir, there's nothing
you can possibly imagine

that's strange or useless enough that
we don't have it here at Anthropologie.

I know one thing you don't have.
Black customers.

Argh! I'm melting!

A-ha! To the ladies' room.

Wow! This is the nicest one yet.

Ah, what are the odds she's gonna show up?

(WOMAN CLEARS THROAT)

Did you get your ass kicked
by Meryl Streep?

No. It was just some low-class

by holding his iPad

while he watches
Season 1 of <i>House of Cards.</i>

Where was the house?
Where was the house of cards?

All right, Stewie, time to go.

Whoa! A little wobbly.
Guess my legs fell asleep.

PETER: Argh!
STEWIE: Ah!

Stewie, Daddy can't feel his legs.
Go get help.

I'm hanging from a door, you idiot.

Argh! Oh!

There he is. Welcome back, buddy.

-Who are you?
-I'm a paramedic. Name's Stryker Foxx.

Oh, Lois just texted.

"Burgers or meatballs for dinner?"
I'll text back for you.

"Same thing, bitch.
Just different shapes."

-(MESSAGE SENT WHOOSH)
-(TABLET BEEPING)

(CHUCKLES) This is gonna be fun.
Oh, battery died.

Sir, you've sustained a head injury.

How many chicken fingers am I
holding up and do you want one?

Three, and hell yeah.

Mmm. Ah!

These are amazing.
Did I die and go to heaven?

Well, you didn't die, 'cause I saved you.

And you're not in heaven,
'cause you're not holding a margarita.

Oh, wait a minute. Yes, you are.

You brought a lot of food in the bathroom.

I always do.

Oh, my God. Are you the coolest guy ever?

Nah, that's just a silly title
they gave me

down at the Karate
Paintball Dirt Bike Club.

Awesome.

Okay, well, bandaged you up.
You should be good to go.

-But just be more careful next time.
-I know. What a stupid injury, huh?

I haven't been this embarrassed
since I was a rookie firefighter.

(ALARM BLARING)

PETER: Sorry. First day. Still learning.

Hey, Stryker, wait.

Hey, listen, I just wanted to
say thanks again for patching me up.

No problem, buddy. Hey, that's
an interesting necklace you got there.

Oh, this? It's from when I was a kid.
It's half of a "best friend" coin.

I always had this crazy dream

that one day I'd run into
the guy with the other half.

Oh, my God. Cody?

Oh, that must be the name

-What do you think? How do I look?
-Like a gas-station energy drink.

But you put that on to go to The Clam?

Aren't the guys gonna think
you're a little overdressed?

Oh, I'm not hanging out with the guys.

I met someone new.
His name's Stryker and he's really cool.

Like, he's one of those
guys whose forearm hair

makes his watch look even cooler.

-(PHONE BEEPING)
-(GASPS)

It's Stryker. I want him to think
I was listening to a cool song.

Nothing much. Just getting slurped.

Boy, Dad sure seems excited.

I know. I haven't seen him this giddy

that single-loop roller coaster.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Wow! What a cool loft.

I bet it cost a ton
to make this place look unfinished.

Hey, come over here. There's someone
I want to introduce you to.

1997 George Clooney.

Wow! That's the coolest
George Clooney there is.

Hi. George Clooney, second worst Batman.

Peter Griffin, second-best Homer.

You may have heard, I'm also known
for my practical jokes on the set.

One time, I nailed Nora Dunn
in the head with an apple.

(LAUGHING) That's hilarious,
'cause you're handsome.

Otherwise, you're just
some dick who hit a lady.

Thanks for bringing me here, Stryker.
I'm having the best time ever.

Even better than when I lived in Santa Fe.

-Have you ever seen a prettier sunset?
-Never.

-It's just so peaceful here.
-It sure is.

Hmm. Sure is.

Did you also have
a very public meltdown in another city?

-I did.
-Yeah. Yeah.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Ugh! It's the guys.
What do those losers want?

-"Losers"? Those are your friends.
-Nah, they're lame.

Not one of them
has ever vaped at a funeral.

-Hey, Peter.
-Hey, what are you doing tonight?

We're gonna watch Cleveland put
a garbage can full of coins in a Coinstar.

Sometimes it takes my buttons.

Ah, thanks, guys, but I can't make it.

I'm, uh, I'm getting re-circumcised.
Got a wedding next week.

-I just want to clean it up a bit.
-Oh, that's too bad.

-Yeah, maybe next time.
-That sounds horrible.

Peter, why did you just lie to the guys?

'Cause I got plans with Stryker.
I don't want them to embarrass me.

Ah, I get where he's coming from.

That's why I never introduce you
to my friends.

-What friends?
-Like the guys in my photography club.

"Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones
and Jared from Subway,

"I feel like I'm the only one
sending pics.

"I love all the positive feedback,
but maybe you guys send a pic?

"Anyway, here's more pics."

(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

-Hey, you ever try that? Wingsuiting?
-I mean, basically, yeah.

One time, I jumped off a top bunk
with a towel around my neck like a cape.

It was inside the IKEA.
I landed on a cardboard computer.

We should totally do that sometime.

Nah, I can't go back there.
They got my picture by the door.

-Hey, he is in here.
-What the hell are you guys doing here?

We were coming back from the Coinstar
and saw your car out front.

Rough night.

Turns out the can was all buttons.
We're not gonna make our mortgage.

What are you doing here? I thought
you were too busy to go out tonight.

Peter, who are your friends?

Oh, erm, Stryker, this is Quagmire,
Joe and Cleveland.

How do you two know each other?

Did you meet at the Harry Potter store?
Peter loves that place.

It was one wand
and I was using a gift certificate.

No, we actually met when I was
administering first aid to him.

-I'm a paramedic.
-For real?

Hey, can I show you seven
or eight things on my body

and ask for medical diagnoses?

This thing here
that looks like a second elbow,

I don't know what it is.
Feels like it's filled with liquid.

Well, I could take a look at it.

No, no, no, guys, guys,
it's his night off.

-I have two pee holes.
-Stop it. Guys, can I talk to you?

Look, this... this right here
is exactly why I've been avoiding you.

I knew you'd embarrass me
in front of Stryker.

-Who cares? He's just some dude.
-He's not "just some dude."

He happens to be the first
really cool friend I've ever had.

-What are you talking about? We're cool.
-You are absolutely not cool.

Oh, yeah? Well, then why did
those teenagers on the way in say,

"Cool wheelchair, dick"?

Look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed
by us and you think we're losers,

well, we don't want to
hang out with you either.

-Good. Who needs you bums? I got Stryker.
-Oh, yeah?

Well, I hope you two are
happy together, you jerk.

MAN: Cool wheelchair, dick.

JOE: Thanks. Did you see
the backpack hanging off it?

Wow, you know, I never thought
I could be talked into wingsuiting.

You're gonna love it. It's just
a short hike from here to the summit.

A hike? It's no problem.
Shouldn't affect my old football injury.

-I spilled hot chili on my nuts.
-You're a riot, Peter.

Hey, are you sure you're up for this?

Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something,
I go all the way.

Like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.

-(IN WOMAN'S VOICE) Good morning, guys.
-Peter, what's wrong with your voice?

I got punched in the throat
at The Clam last night.

Now I sound exactly like Kathleen Turner.

I'm just gonna get my stromboli.

Hey. Get away from my stromboli,
Kathleen Turner.

(GROANS)

Wow! That's, ah, that's some view.

I know. Isn't it?
You see that rock formation over there?

We're gonna fly right through
the center of it.

It's called "threading the needle."
Totally intense.

Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. Or how about this?

Maybe you jump off this cliff

and I spin around over there
and sing <i>Sound of Music.</i>

Or we could just go home
and watch <i>Sound of Music.</i>

I can see you're a little nervous, Peter,

but I'm telling you,
it is easier than you think. Watch.

(AIR WHOOSHES)

Wow! Look at him go.

You know, just when I thought he couldn't
get any cooler, he goes... Holy (BLEEP)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

What just...
There's almost nothing left of him.

And I just know I'm gonna be the one
to have to identify the body.

That's him. Poor guy.

He looks like a bowl of tomato soup.

Guy next to him died in a fire.
He looks like a grilled cheese sandwich.

Oh, these two poor souls are
the best combination for a rainy Saturday.

So, hey, guys. What are we drinking? Beer?

Hey, Quagmire, how about one
of your famous sexual stories?

-Take a hike, Peter.
-You mean something Joe can't do?

(LAUGHS) Friendly jokes
indicating closeness.

We heard about Stryker dying.

-Yeah, craps.
-Yeah, give it up.

We know the only reason you're here
is 'cause your cool friend is gone.

That's right.
We're not your floppy seconds, Peter.

It's actually "sloppy."

Well, for me, it's both.
But, listen, you really hurt our feelings.

You can't just treat us like garbage

and then expect us
to take you back like nothing happened.

Okay, that's too bad,
'cause that was kind of my plan.

Well, you can go to hell, Peter.
We're tired of you taking us for granted.

Yeah. And this isn't even the first time
you ditched us for someone else.

Remember when you blew us off
to hang out with Jerry Seinfeld?

Julia Louis-Dreyfus
has a lot of Emmys now.

Yeah.

Why did your wife steal that cookbook?

Peter, I'm sorry about
your friend Stryker.

I know it's got to be hard
to watch a man explode

like a bug on a windshield.

No, it's not that... I mean, I do
see that every time I close my eyes.

But it's the guys.
They're really mad at me,

and I'm afraid they don't want
to be friends with me anymore.

Well, it's hard to blame them.

You treated them
like you don't even care about them.

I do care about them.

It's just, (SIGHS)
when I hung around with Stryker,

people thought I was cool,
and it felt good.

No one ever thinks I'm cool.

Your friends thought you were cool,
until you dumped them.

Oh, wow.

I guess you're right.
I treated them like crap.

I just got to find a way to make
it up to them. You got any ideas?

Mom? Dad? Can Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones
and Jared from Subway spend the night?

I don't know, Peter, but it's got to be
something really meaningful,

because imagine how they feel.

After all, you were willing to
jump off a cliff for Stryker.

Well, they didn't say yes
but they didn't say no.

You're right. Thanks, Lois.

And now I know exactly what I have to do.

Uh, where the hell are you going?

Lois told me to go jump off a cliff
to prove my friendship to the guys.

Are you, are you sure
that's what she said?

I don't know, Brian.
Her shirt was kind of open.

I was trying to get a peek down there.
Anyway, I got to go jump off a cliff.

Peter, wait. Hold on. This is crazy.

-Damn it.
-Where's Peter going?

Huh?

Oh, for God's sake.

Hey, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe.
It's your buddy, Peter,

and I'm about to thread the needle
to prove to you guys how sorry I am

and that I'd do anything to win you back.

And if something goes wrong
and I don't survive,

you can go ahead and delete
the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.

I'm never gonna watch that.

Okay, here goes nothing.

I just wish the sponsor
on my suit was a little cooler.

CLEVELAND: Peter, stop. Don't jump.

Brian told us you were gonna...
Why are you wearing a douche suit?

-They also make wipes.
-They're not known for their wipes.

Peter, you don't have to jump off a cliff
to prove you're sorry.

Not all of us believe that,

but we took a vote
and I agreed I'd respect the majority.

Look, you really treated us badly,
but the fact that you'd be willing

to literally risk your life
just to show us how much you care,

well, that says a lot.

Listen, I'm so sorry.

If being cool means
I don't get to hang out with you guys,

then I don't ever want to be cool.

What do you say?
Can we just go back to being friends?

-Of course.
-You bet.

Totes McGoats.

(CHUCKLES) "Totes McGoats"?
Maybe you guys are cool. Fist bump.

Ah, crap! (SCREAMS)

-Oh, my God!
-Peter!

Should I shoot him, make it go quicker?
I got a shot.

Too late. You didn't answer quick enough.

(SCREAMING)

Hey, I'm doing it. This ain't so hard.

Guys, I'm gonna do it.

GLENN: What? We can't hear you.
We're very far away.

Oh, my God. I did it.

Damn it. Oh! Son of a bitch.

I think I'm okay.

Argh! Nickels.

Well, it's good to be back, you guys.

And I'm sorry again
I dumped you for Stryker.

Who the hell is this Stryker guy
you keep talking about?

What do you mean? He's that
cool, handsome guy I was friends with.

He's the whole reason I went
wingsuiting and hurt my head.

Wingsuiting? Peter, you hurt your head
in a ladies' bathroom.

Yeah, your legs fell asleep
and you bashed it against a sink.

You were in a coma for two weeks.

You must have dreamed about
this Stryker or something.

No. We were buddies.
We rode on his motorcycle.

And he introduced me
to 1997 George Clooney.

Okay, well, right there
you should've known it wasn't real.

Huh!

Well, whether it was real or not,

I want you to know
you are the best friends I've ever had.

-Of course. We know that, Peter.
-Yeah, and we feel the same way.

Hey, this is a really weird question,
but do you boys want to go out dancing?

Peter, you can't just sit there

I was gonna go down to the Guitar Center

Lois, I worry this is not

-Mom, please.

You know I would never
put my children in harm's way.

Oh, boy. AMBER Alert.

Stewie was last seen
with a goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel

heading north on I-95.

How do you turn those off, by the way?

Lois, I've seen enough.

You're completely overwhelmed,

I'm getting you a nanny.

Oh, I guess it would be
good to have some help

with Meg and Chris.

And Stewie, if he's ever found.

Honey, do you think
that's the goat and baby

-from the AMBER alert?
-It's a Tercel,

but I don't think it's the right year.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

That must be the new nanny.

Is this the Griffin house?

Welcome to this work environment.

I'm not the nanny. I'm her Uber driver.
Your nanny's still in the car.

She dozed off on the way here.

I not doze off, Yoober.

Was looking at crinkled photos
of dead relatives.

Hello. I am Natalia.

What is favorite breakfast fish?

Well, if you must know...

-(PETER GROANS)
-Welcome to this work environment.

Okay, Natalia, level with me.
Why are you really here?

I have been sent to neutralize
liberal Jewish dissident,

Fievel Mousekewitz.

Well, the only mouse
in this neighborhood is

our innocent neighbor, Frank Maxwell.

Comrade Mousekewitz!
Did you think you could run forever?

I, ah... I think
you've got the wrong mouse.

I'm just regular old Frank Maxwell,
and I'm very late for work.

Good day, ma'am.

Oh! You killed him?

That was not me.
Someone else got to him first.

Tough break, Jew mouse. Ah-ha!

Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

Under parody law, in order to
use someone else's character

in an unlicensed fashion,
we have to provide

something called "commentary."

The commentary here is that
Mickey Mouse hates Jews.

Now, let's see what else
this new nanny has up her sleeve.

Okay, Stewie, this is favorite
Belarusian children book

called <i>Goodnight, Moon of Chernobyl.</i>

"Goodnight, Chernobyl moon.

"Goodnight, radiation house.

"Goodnight, melted phone.

"Goodnight, glowing milk.

"Goodnight, bleeding Grandpa's eyes.

"Goodnight, two-headed cat.

"Goodnight, nobody.

"Goodnight, blocks and blocks
and blocks of nobody.

"The end."

Next book.

<i>Everybody Poops... Blood.</i>

I'll get started on dinner.

No need to start dinner.
Homework is done. Kids are fed.

You two should go out
and have lovely evening.

-Together?
-Yes. Everything taken care of.

Go out. Enjoy American freedom.

What do you say, Peter?

It could be fun.
And we haven't been on a date

since I broke the Guinness record

for longest nasal exhale
at that Tina Fey movie.

<i>You're the baby mama?</i>
<i>Well, that's no </i>bueno.

Hello. I'm Steve.
I'll be your server this evening.

May I start you off with a cocktail?

(CLEARS THROAT)

-You don't work here, do you?
-I do not.

This is nice.

-So, how's work?
-Good.

How, ah...

How's the stuff you do during your day?

-Good.
-Good.

So... Is that it?
Did we do a date? Phones back on?

Peter, we finally have
a chance to reconnect.

We've been given this opportunity.

It's like before we had kids.
We got to make the most of it.

Hang on, hang on, Lois.

Give me two of those round balls
of butter and a breadstick.

You'll see where I'm heading with this.

Okay, look, look, look.
Here's what you want.

-Here's what you got.
-(LAUGHS)

-I'm very happy with what I got.
-Hmm.

Well, maybe I can give you
half a breadstick later.

As long as you don't mind
a little marinara dipping sauce.

That's absolutely disgusting.

And I love it.

You know what? I like date night.

To Natalia, for making it possible.

Pretty sure that's Steve's pee.

Enjoying your wine?

What an amazing night.

I told you we could have a fun time,
just the two of us.

Fun's not over yet.

PETER: Come on, let's get in the trunk.

I filled it with water
so we can do it hippo-style.

Weightlessly,

with my feet lightly
scraping the bottom as we do it.

LOIS: Okay. It's kind of sexy, I guess.

PETER: And in the hippo tradition,
first we must eat a whole head of lettuce.

-Now, do you have the lettuce?
-I didn't know we were doing this.

-Did you bring the lettuce?
-Oh, no, I forgot.

Ronald, I asked you to do one thing.

Honey, honey... I brought the lettuce.

So thanks to Natalia,

we've been spending
so much more time together.

Let me tell you, Joe,
it's really been a rediscovery.

-JOE: Hmm.
-Joe, "we time"

-is just as important as "me time."
-Okay.

We've actually been watching
<i>The Middle </i>together.

-It's so funny! Isn't it funny, Peter?
-It is actually funny.

At least three times an episode
we turn to each other and we say,

"That's just like us!"

-(LAUGHING)
-Why are you laughing?

-It sounded funny.
-But you had to be there.

Well, I was able to imagine myself there,
which is why I chuckled.

And, Donna, have you seen this <i>Black-ish?</i>

-Why are you asking me that?
-I don't know.

It seems like you might like it.

Oh, and, waiter, have you
seen this <i>Fresh Off the Boat?</i>

-Why are you asking me that?
-I don't know.

It seems like you might like it.

There's Mort. Mort!
Have you seen this <i>The Goldbergs?</i>

Yes! I like it 'cause I'm Jewish.

Boy, our friends
all seem to be happily married.

-(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
-(LAUGHS) Yeah, right.

You know, Donna told me in the bathroom

she and Cleveland haven't had sex
in over three months.

I love that you share things
that were told to you in confidence.

-And the poor Swansons.
-I know.

Joe's dead from the waist down,
and Bonnie's dead from the waist up.

They're perfect for each other.

-(BOTH LAUGHING)
-I know, I know.

I got to say, Peter, I really feel like

Natalia has helped put the spark
back in our relationship.

Yeah, we even had independent movie sex.

I want to lean over
this half-eaten blueberry pie

and kiss you with black coffee breath.

-Is that okay?
-Yes.

Now, can I do you to a song you know,
but sung in German?

Hello? I see.

What is it?

I've been assassinated.

Wow, what a night.
I guess someone's sleep number is 69.

Yes. It was, apparently, also number two.

Would you maybe make some coffee
and give me a moment?

Car is packed for weekend.

-Weekend?
-Yes.

You come in late last night drunk

and tell me to pack car
for weekend getaway

you book online.

Then you make me watch
<i>Different Strokes</i> episode

with substitute teacher
played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

You know, I forgot
about this weekend trip.

Is that something we still want to do?

Well, I do if you do.

Absolutely I do...
I was just seeing if you do.

Of course I do.

I mean, we've already had
six nights out together.

It'd be great to have three more.

That's what I'm saying.
That's what any guy wants,

the same gal again and again and again
and again and again and again and again...

and again and again and again
and again and again and again and again.

And every gal wants the same guy who keeps

getting fatter and fatter
and fatter and fatter...

Stop it right there, Lois.
This is <i>Family Guy.</i>

We only do the male side of the joke.

You know what?
I think this weekend will be fun.

Yeah. I mean, it's not like we're gonna
miss anything around here.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Hey, Joe, what the hell's going on here?

You didn't hear? Today is the opening

of the first-ever
Spooner Street Farmers' Market.

(IN SLOW MOTION) Farmers...

Market?

Yeah, it's really exciting.

For 50 cents,
you can get your picture taken

wearing a farmer's hat.

(IN SLOW MOTION) Farmer's...

Hat?

Hey, have a great weekend, you two.

So glad you're finding
time for each other.

Goat meat. Get your goat meat here.

-Cleveland, are those...
-Yep.

I have dibs on whatever silliness
Peter loses interest in.

Remember this?

To the Cleveland copter!

The mustache obscures my view!
(SCREAMS)

LOIS: Oh, another hawk.
Or maybe it's the same one.

You think it could be the same one?

Doubt it.

Hey, do you have the address?

I think it's in my pocketbook somewhere.

'Cause I got to know if
we should take 24 or 495.

Hang on.

-Anything?
-Hang on.

Exit's coming up.

Half a mile.

Quarter mile.

(CHUCKLES) Ah, you'd think
I could find it.

Yeah, yeah, I would. I would.

Okay, I'm taking 495.

Okay, here, let me see if it's...
This is why I don't like big purses.

Here it is. It says take 24 to 128.

Hey, look, cookies.

-Chocolate chip?
-Oatmeal raisin.

-(BLEEP)
-(PLATE CLATTERS)

I guess they stopped
serving dinner at 9:30.

Looks like that missed exit
had the last laugh.

Look at this cute note.

"In lieu of television,
please tune in to each other." Ha-ha.

"Ha-ha", indeed. And get this.

"Sorry, no Wi-Fi, but the good news is
your marriage has four bars."

-Terrific.
-Here's another note.

"How adorable were those first two notes?
I hope you read this one third."

There's a used condom in the fireplace.

And the fireplace is decorative,
so that's here to stay.

So, do you think word just got out
in the daddy longlegs community, like,

"Hey, come to this hotel"?

Peter, it's a little warm in here.

Do you want to turn on
that overhead ceiling fan?

Sure. Looks stable.

(FAN RATTLING)

-Can you notice that?
-Yeah.

Can you notice anything
in the world other than that?

Only that fist-sized moth
in the lampshade by the bed.

I'm going to bed so that
"go home time" comes faster.

I'll just sleep with the light on.

Natalia, will you be our nanny forever?

Da! Unless Belarus security force

-track me down.
-I'm sorry, what?

before she leave Belarus.

-Oh! This.
-What?

That mealy-mouth thing you do.
Take a sip of water.

I don't like water. I like pop.

Hey, will you let me know when you're done
using the phone charger that I brought?

You mean the only thing that you packed?

Yeah, I just assumed if you pay,

-you don't have to pack.
-Here we go.

My husband, the Rockefeller,
letting my parents pay for the nanny.

Kids still lining up around the block
for those piano lessons?

I wonder which has more clutter on it,
the piano or your treadmill.

You know what?
I'm gonna go with the treadmill.

Really? Let's go knock on
the door of the next room

and ask them which one of us is fat.

I'm so sorry I'm not Bradley Hooper.

It's Cooper, not Hooper.

You're thinking of
Mr. Hooper from <i>Sesame Street,</i>

and I'd sooner bang him.

He was a business owner.
He was a successful man.

You think you're the only
one in this relationship

who wants to be with a successful man?

Get over yourself.

Hey, do you want these spit droplets back,
or are they for my arm to keep?

Sorry, I was trying to scare
that fly on your hand.

Oh, it's a liver spot. Never mind.

I'm hoping it's cancer.
I want the ticket out.

Aw, if you die,
can I have all of your nothing?

What do you mean if I die?

I've been dead
since the minute I said "I do"!

Well, the minute you say "I don't,"
I am out that door.

-Oh, is that right?
-Yep.

Well, what if I just said,
"The hell with it, go"?

Us redheads have to stay together, right?

(BOTH LAUGH)

So this is "stuck at work"?

Honey, please. Lois is a friend.

Really, Nicole, you got the wrong idea.

How does this bitch know my name?

"Bitch"?

Okay, ho.

Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

Come on, now, ladies.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Awesome. A chick-chicken chick fight.

(LAUGHS)

Since you are my girlfriend and are hot,
will you marry me so that I can bone you?

As long as you can always
throw a Nerf football

over my truck with your strong arm.

You mean this arm?

-(GRUNTS)
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

Ah, cripes.

Yeah, now there is no way.

Hey, a dollar! Neat!

Maybe her knowing I have money
will bring the moisture.

Janine, wait! I have a dollar!

We could split a Mickey's Big Mouth!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

-(HORN HONKING)
-(WOMAN SCREAMS)

You're gonna crash!

Ah! A parchment of value! What an event!

You said it, friend.

The goddess of money
has fisted our stocking.

(BOTH GROAN)

-(FOOTSTEPS THUMPING)
-(GRUNTING)

(LAUGHING) Is many funny arms!

So, the guy asks,
"What's the name of the act?"

And they say, "The Aristocrats."

Ah, I didn't tell it right.

Hey, must be my lucky day!

Perhaps I press my luck.

No Whammies, no Whammies, no Whammies,
Big Bucks, Big Bucks, and stop!

(ERROR TONE)

(LAUGHING)

Ah, rats.

Well, perhaps I press my luck with Meg.

Hey there, Meg.

I was wondering
if you'd let me take you out

for a feast of Indian food,

followed by some
blow-off-to-the-side curry burps.

Oh, I can't tonight. I, um...
I have a date with a Whammy.

(QUAGMIRE LAUGHS)

All right, well, if you're ever free,
here's my number.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh. Hi, Chris.

But... But that's... That's my line.

Hey, I came by to bring you a frame
for that birthday dollar I gave you.

Hi, Meg.

What a disrespectful turd.

You brought a frame?
Why would I frame a dollar?

Chris, didn't you
take a look at that dollar?

It's an extremely rare misprint.

Benjamin Franklin and Washington
are both on the front,

posing back-to-back like an '80s sitcom.

Sorry, Grandpa. I lost that dollar.

You what?
We got to find that thing!

I get the last joke before the commercial?

(GASPS) Wow, this is a first.

Okay, okay. A priest, a rabbi
and a Frenchman walk into a bar...

ANNOUNCER: Family Guy <i>will return</i>
<i>after these messages.</i>

-Last line!
<i>-No, it isn't.</i>

All right, Chris, if we're going
to find that misprint dollar,

we have to retrace your steps.

Now, where'd you go
after your birthday party?

Well, first I drank a Four Loko,

and then I rode my bike
down to the hair salon

and shouted "Nope!"
at all the women who came out.

Huh. Call me next time you do that.

Hi, Meg.

Unbelievable.

Can I have a can of chaw and a fork?

-Do you need this phone number on here?
-Nah.

How long has that bike been out front?

I don't know. A couple hours.

I'm gonna swipe that puppy.

All right, got some vodka and tampons.

Now to go ask Chris how they're
doing this at the high school.

-A-ha!
-Stewie, what...

What are you doing here?

Busting you. You were gonna drink that.

Technically, no.

Do you even hear yourself?
Look, I'm gonna fix this.

I know a guy who's got pills
that help stop addictions.

Ugh, fine.

All right, we are buying none of these.

Please put them back.
But we'll take one of these.

Oh, Charleston Chew. Good choice.

You know about
putting them in the freezer?

Yeah. I know about the freezer.

There's nothing you can teach me,
thank you.

All right, this is where
we can buy those pills

to get you off the sauce.

MAN: You guys ready for this?

Stewie, who is this guy?

My friend, Todd. He's gonna help us out.

But this looks like a drug den.

What are you talking about?

WOMAN: (SINGING)
<i>Drug den, drug den</i>

<i>Drug den, drug den</i>

I told you it was a drug den.

How you doing? Come on in.

(SLOW ROCK SONG PLAYING)

Hello, new friends.

Welcome to my "prescription pad."

(CHUCKLES) Get it?

We're... We're dead. We're getting shot.

Oh, calm down.

Heads up. Sometimes my knob
plays peek-a-boo through my pee hatch.

-(THUD)
-So, I hear you guys need some benzos.

-Yeah, we got to dry this dog up.
-(THUD)

-(BRIAN GASPS)
-Hang on, hang on, hang on.

This is my favorite part of the song.

(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

Tequila!

Oh, I'm thinking of a different song.

So, uh, you guys got the $500?

Here's a little taste.
And there's more where that came from.

But I got to see the merchandise first.

Good, good. I need singles.

I got to do laundry so I can
stop hanging out in my underwear

with a bunch of guys.

(COCKS GUN)
All right, give me all your money!

Stewie, what's this guy doing?

No idea. I don't know him that well.

He was kicking a Redbox machine
outside of CVS.

Seemed like the kind of guy
who could help us out.

-(GUNSHOT)

-Pistorius!

Boom! Through the bathroom door.

Did you just name-drop "Pistorius"?

He's still a hero to us.

So I made it, Cleveland made it
and now you made it, Joe.

Yeah. Thanks for the recap.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Everybody's made it but this guy.

Quit it! Get off of me.

Ah, what's wrong, Pete?
Oop, oop. Oop, oop, oop!

Stop it! Stop touching me.

Hey, guys, I did it three more times
while you were grab-assing.

(SQUEAKING)

-MAYOR ADAM: Need a lift?
-(SQUEAKS)

(RAT SQUEAKING GLEEFULLY)

(LAUGHING)

We could be a Geico commercial.
You're absolutely right.

You don't have ass or grass,

-so I'll be taking this dollar.
-(SQUEAKING)

No, no, no. I don't want ass.
Just give me the dollar.

And now to turn slightly...

(YELLING)

Ah, heck! I did a fail.

A dollar.

Oh, my dollar. I guess Meg didn't care.

Ah, my heart broken,

and nothing to console me
but the screaming black dolphins.

Man, that dollar's getting all over town.

-(SCOFFS) Yeah, like your mama.
-(LAUGHING)

Oh, Dag!

Aw, man, you know I'm just playing.

-Hey, man, you seen that movie <i>The Cove?</i>
<i>-The Cove?</i>

How youse gonna be talking about <i>The Cove?</i>

I mean, I saw the movie,
but I was like, aw... (BLEEP)

Oh, man, you know, what even is a cove?

I think it's like what
a white dolphin calls a bay.

They be all like, "Honey,

"I'm taking Cooper and Tucker
down to the cove."

-Right, right.
-(CHUCKLES) Rest of us be like...

(SINGING)
<i>Sitting in the morning sun</i>

Don't do it, then.

-Don't do it!
-Oh, I'mma do it!

All right, then just
squeak out the whistle part.

(MIMICKING WHISTLING PART IN SONG)

-(BEATBOXING)
-(CONTINUES MIMICKING WHISTLING)

You ever had your heart broken, Jerome?

Hell yeah, man.
Married my high school sweetheart.

Week after our wedding,
she was diagnosed with cancer.

At her funeral,
our little girl caught pneumonia.

We buried her next to her mom
six weeks later.

You never seen a casket so small.

I hear ya.

I gave my number to a girl
and she threw it away.

You and me, fraternity of pain, eh?

Okay, this is the one.

-Son of a...
-(BUZZING)

-Come on, Peter. Let's call it.
-No, Joe!

Nobody's leaving
until I sink a penny in that glass!

-(ALL GROANING, MUMBLING)
-For God's sake.

Say, Peter, you know, maybe you should
try this one with your eyes closed.

Just feel it.

But if I close my eyes,

you'll all disappear,
and I'm a-scared of being alone.

Don't worry, Peter.

(INHALES)

-Guys?
-We're right here, Peter. Throw it.

-(GRUNTS)
-(CLATTERING)

(GASPS) Oh, my God, I made it?

-Sure.
-Right in.

Amazing.

Yes! I've never felt so much power.

I'm gonna go have sweaty
day-sex with my wife.

Excuse me, sir.

Would you like to buy some candy
to send Jewish kids

to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?

Will it get you out of my bar?

It sure will.

Look who's still standing, bitch.

Go buy yourself something nice in hell.

Hey there, sailor.

What are you doing here?

Oh, sometimes I come here
to think and fart.

So, you still up for our date?

Our date? But I thought you got rid
of the dollar with my number on it.

No, I put your number in my phone, silly.

So, what do you say? Are you free tonight?

Let me consult my charts and maps.

Low tide... 5:23.

Yeah. Moonrise, 7:48. (MUTTERING)

Aye, looks like I am.

Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass,

so get your pants off
and put a towel on the kitchen table!

LOIS: Peter, I'm in the middle
of book club.

-(OBJECTS SHATTERING)
-Forget book club, we're doing it.

Anyone who doesn't want to see
my big, white, flailing butt,

get the hell out.

Joe, I found a dollar!

JOE: That's great, Bonnie!

Let's go to dinner.
We can talk all about it.

What's there to talk about?

I looked down on the ground
and there was a dollar.

Bonnie, save it for the dinner table!

Crap, I don't have any change.

Hey, Seamus, you got change for a dollar?

I don't know.
Is my boat parked illegally in the harbor?

I don't know.

Are you gonna make a contribution
to the Policeman's Ball?

I don't know.
Are you gonna help me move next week?

Geez, what are you two,
dating or something?

BOTH: I don't know.

-(PIANO PLAYING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Good evening, everyone.
Welcome to Whispers.

I'm your hostess, Ida, and as always,

I am joined by my trusty psychic,
Ryan Reynolds.

-I knew you'd say that.
-(LAUGHS)

Piano? Comedy? What don't you do?

-Windows.
-(LAUGHS)

Trust me, folks, he doesn't.
I've tried. (CHUCKLES)

God, this is going well.

Well, Stewie, you were right.
I couldn't make it a day without drinking.

Well, the important thing is
you barely tried and then got shot.

So I read a fun compatibility quiz
in <i>Cosmo.</i>

I don't know if you want to take it.

-I don't.
-I didn't either!

Compatible!

If you'll excuse me, I have to urinate
every time something good happens.

(APPLAUSE)

I thought the show was really great.

Thank you. I couldn't help but notice
you talked throughout it.

Take it off!
I want to see if mine look right.

(MEN CHEERING, LAUGHING)

Well, Chris, we've looked all over town.
Might as well check here.

This is where dollar bills come to die.

Wait, Grandpa. Look!

I don't believe it!

(BOTH GRUNT)

Oh, no. Now we'll never find it.

Hold on. I got an idea.

Hey, can I turn off everything
but the black lights?

-Sure, I don't care about anything.
-Cool.

Wow, this place is gross!

Yeah, the NBA All-Star Game
was in town last week.

There it is!

I got it, Grandpa!

Attaboy! Happy birthday, grandson.

Thanks.

Hey, so, how much is this
rare dollar worth, anyway?

Well, some dildo
wrote his phone number on it,

so now it's worth jack!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(LAUGHS) Is everyone who was in the show!

(STUTTERS) Hold on, everyone. Everyone?

Ellen DeGeneres
wants a selfie of all of us.

Come on, squeeze in, now.
We're gonna blow up the Internet.

Let's take all that we did today

ALL: <i>He's a family guy!</i>

Hi there. It's me, Peter.

You know, when it comes to
making dreams come alive,

there used to be nothing like the movies.

So we thought it would be fun to ask

a few visionary
Hollywood directors to create his...

Let's be honest, "his."

...own unique version of the
same <i>Family Guy</i> story,

"Peter Gets Fired."

Of the countless directors we contacted,
three did not say no immediately,

and I got a weird message
from Paul Verhoeven

that I could not understand.

I've listened to that over 100 times now.

I got nothin'.

Anyway, here's our first director,
Quentin Tarantino.

(GANGSTA MUSIC PLAYING)

(BONES CRACK)

-What's in your lunch?
-Pizza.

From home or from a place?

A place.

Griffin, you're three hours late.

Stop trying to be a clock,
you ain't got the face for it.

I've had enough of your nonsense.

Here's Christoph Waltz to
fire you in a weird accent.

(IN WEIRD ACCENT) You're fired!

It's a cliché.

You think you can fire me?

I'm taking this keg as payback.

Cinema is an event.

(PANTING)

-Where's my family?
-Dead. All of them.

(MONITOR BEEPING)

(GASPS) Oh, my God, where am I?

-What happened?
-Ugh! Coma breath.

"Coma"? How long was I out?

-What year is this?
-It's whatever year

Quentin Tarantino
used to watch television.

Well, can I go home?

Well, you're not really ready,

but if it's for revenge,
you can stab me with this scalpel

-and then run out.
-Thanks.

Oh, that was unnecessary but cool.

So awesome!

Ah, so close.

No, this is better.

Somebody order a wet-haired black guy
to help with your revenge and sometimes

(SPEAKING LOUDLY)
speak louder than necessary?

Angela? We got business.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Sorry, that's my car alarm.

(GASPS) Of course. That!

Welcome back to our special episode,

featuring famous directors' versions

of the same <i>Family Guy</i> story,
"Peter Gets Fired."

I'm still here in front
of the Hollywood sign,

but I've asked the cameraman
to adjust the shot

so that you can only see "wood."

I thought that would be hilarious.
You know why? 'Cause of boners.

Anyway, our next director is Wes Anderson,

a guy who makes you feel
like you ate a pot brownie

and woke up in a greeting card.

Mmm! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

STEWIE: <i>On a March day, </i>

<i>Needless to say, </i>

You're relieved of your position.

I see. And what's to happen to my play?
The opening is only days away.

The play's off.

STEWIE: <i>With no discernible reaction,</i>

<i>my father made his way home </i>
<i>to deliver the news to my mother.</i>

<i>Let me tell you about my house.</i>

<i>We lived in a New England cottage</i>

<i>that was inside a vintage Army tent,</i>

I'll be there right away.

STEWIE: <i>The exterior of our house</i>

<i>Inside's the same.</i>

<i>Okay, back to the story.</i>

I've summoned you all and arranged you

in a perfectly symmetrical form
in front of me

to tell you some important news.

I've been relieved
of my position at the brewery.

What of the play?

The play is postponed, indefinitely.

No, Mr. Griffin.

You need to do this play. We'll help you.

But I've lost access to the brewery.
That's where the whole piece is set.

Maybe it doesn't have to be.

But that's where
the free tape and paper is.

I'll buy you new tape and paper.

The play is back on.

STEWIE: <i>On an overcast Thursday afternoon,</i>
<i>my father presented his play,</i>

<i>one of the most compelling</i>
<i>stories of the 1980s,</i>

Max Dugan Returns.

Max, you've returned!

I have.

(CHEERING)

This took a lot of work.

STEWIE: <i>My father passed away </i>
<i>in the spring of his 43rd year,</i>

<i>and was put to rest </i>
<i>in the family graveyard.</i>

<i>He died chasing a Pokémon</i>
<i>across a busy street.</i>

Hey, there. It's me again.

Wouldn't it be great
if Wes Anderson's movies

were actually that short?

Anyway, the Hollywood sign
is more historic than you think.

On this very spot, 52 years ago,

a piece of beef jerky
was planted in the ground

and watered with Red Bull.

A speedboat erupted from the soil,
and in that speedboat was Michael Bay.

(INAUDIBLE)

This already doesn't make sense.

(CHEERING)

You're fired, Griffin,
for destroying company property.

Tell it to my tongue.

Mr. President, we have a situation.

The Decepticons plan to destroy
the Seven Wonders of the World,

starting with the Hagia Sophia.

The what?
Is that even one of the Seven Wonders?

The Decepticons have only one weakness.
They're allergic to beer.

I don't like the taste either so much.

That chest plate
is where they're most vulnerable.

If we could find someone
strong enough to throw a keg

with enough force, we might have a shot.

The only problem is,
there's not a man alive

who can throw a keg
with that kind of force.

There may be one.

MAN 1: I wonder who it is.

<i>Our top story,</i>
<i>stopping the Decepticons with beer?</i>

<i>According to our sources,</i>

<i>for a man strong enough</i>

<i>to throw a keg with enough force</i>
<i>to save the Seven Wonders of the World.</i>

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

What took you so long?

There was a train
and I like to count the cars.

It was a big one.

Me, too. That is fun.

But you're wasting your time coming here.

I don't throw kegs anymore.

Who's this?

What are you wearing?
That's my funeral shirt.

Look, Peter,
I didn't want to ask you to do this

because of that maverick
but awesome thing you did

in the battle war of the past.

Is this the stuff
you didn't want me to ask you about?

I told you not to ask me about that.

He went rogue and saved everyone's lives,
but he didn't do it by the book.

Is that why he can't get an erection?

Everyone stop talking about me!

Listen, it's not me that's asking,

it's America.

Tell America my answer is no.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go change my mind

in the shower.

<i>Peter's country needs him</i>

<i>But he just doesn't know</i>

<i>He's scared he'll miss his shows</i>

<i>And he's expecting a UPS package</i>

<i>Who's gonna water his plants?</i>

<i>He's got a lot of balls in the air</i>

<i>That's for sure</i>

(ENGINE REVVING)

PETER: Hold on!

Damn it, I'm in.

But I do things my way,
and I pick my crew.

Deal. Now let me sit sideways
on your motorcycle

like a Vietnamese woman,
and let's get out of here.

Still trying to put the world
back together, I see.

Hello, Peter.

We're not joining your team.

I'm putting together a team.

-We're in.
-Good.

Let's shake hands like tough guys.

Some of your sweat went in my mouth.

(SCOFFS)

Oh, hello, Peter.
I was just out back working in the garden.

Oh, yeah? Trying to grow some balls?

Okay, okay.

LOIS: Play nice, boys.

Love the cookie-cutter house
you and Poindexter got here.

Never pegged you for a 'burbs dweller.

Peter, you used to live here.

That was a long time ago.

It was two months ago.

Two months is a long time

when you don't sleep
and only eat ground beef.

Did you tell Chris about my mission?

I thought you should.

This is my favorite
out of all the Seven Wonders of the World.

The Hagia Sophia.

It's like God made a basilica for himself.

I can't believe Peter's gone.

I never got to repeat to him
the line he said to me

earlier in the film
that has taken on new meaning

in the context of all that has happened.

Today is the day
we honor the late Peter Griffin,

the hero who saved
the Seven Wonders of the World.

PETER: Who's that ugly son of a bitch?

Peter, you're alive.

But, but how?

You were blown into a million pieces.

Luckily, I know
a couple of pretty good welders.

Wait, they welded you back together?

And they knew
you were alive the whole time?

You want to ask questions
or you want to do it in a cemetery?

(BOTH GIGGLING)

LOIS: Is... is everything all right?

PETER: Yeah, no, I think I'm just tired
from all the flying back and forth.

Maybe we just talk here for a little bit,

and then you can tell everyone
that I functioned as I should.

LOIS: Yeah, okay.

PETER: So, which director thing
was your favorite?

Mine was this one.

LOIS: Honestly,
I didn't care for the episode.

Thanks for driving me
to the library for story time, Brian.

Today we're reading
<i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>

<i>vs. The Human Centipede.</i>

I heard it's like <i>Alien vs. Predator,</i>
with a little bit more butt eating.

That does sound fun, but what if
I took you to a different library today?

What? But I like my library.
I met Curious George there.

Mom said he was a puppet,
but she's stupid.

I'm just saying we should go
to the library at Quahog University

and take your education to a higher level.

I guess I can try it.
I mean, I do want to get ahead.

I don't want to end up like Meg,
doing sad one-woman shows.

Who do you think?

-Him?
-Shh. She's crushing it!

Oh, yeah. That's good library.

Oh, you didn't come here for me.
You came to be a creep.

Whatever. You go do your thing.

I'm gonna go watch that young

who's clearly in the

-George Eliot.

Ah, Georgie.

I'm a big fan.

"Bantam Press, 1851."

-Lumineers?

BRIAN: Hmm?

You just said "Lumineers" with no context.

(IMITATING URKEL) Did I do that?

Ugh.

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Tumblr?

Wow, I've never seen someone go
O for six in 15 minutes before.

Just hard rejection after hard rejection.

(STUDENTS CLAMORING)

-What's going on over there?
-Looks like a student rally.

They probably forgot to study for an exam,
so they organized a protest.

In the '90s, you'd just pull a fire alarm.
Now you hold a protest.

That is, when they're not
looking down at their phones.

Hey, what's going on?

Someone wrote "weird"
on the transgender bathroom,

and the school president didn't overreact,
so we want him fired!

Seems reasonable.

Exactly!

Oh, I see news cameras.

I'm gonna yell "Viva la Stool"
like a young, white drunkard.

And last week, a professor told
his class to have a nice day,

which is microaggression,

because in our systemic rape culture,

no day is a nice day.

So we want him fired, too.

Hey, (CHUCKLES)
if you don't want to get fired,

-don't become a teacher, right?
-Totally.

You should tweet that. #FireEveryone.

STEWIE: Viva la Stool!

Hmm. Well, I guess I could
fire up my account again.

All right, open app.

Got a bunch of those. No biggie.

Type in tweet.

Blast off in three,

two, one,

and tweeted.

I am back in the game. See?

Hup, you're gone.

And the crowd is gone.

And the animators are gone.

Hey, Stewie,
what do you think about this tweet?

Oh, don't be that guy.

"Kelly Ripa no-shows at work.

"Who does she think she is,
a Republican senator? (CHUCKLES)

"#G-O-P-U."

Three references in one tweet.
I'm sweating.

I'll just add it to my notes for later.

Why are you getting into Twitter now?

Unless you're an athlete or a celebrity,
no one cares.

A lot of people like my stuff.

Oh, yeah?

"it's not fashionable to wear orange

-You know, I don't care.

Just like people can't stop Peter
from ordering shepherd's pie.

I'll have the shepherd's pie.

Yeah, remember how mad people got

when DiGiorno tweeted
about domestic violence?

I'll delete the tweet.

What do you want me to do?

I... I deleted my Twitter account,
my Instagram, Facebook, everything.

People still won't leave me alone.

You have to apologize.

Go outside, do it now.

Tell them that it was a mistake

Boo, Brian Griffin, boo.

STEWIE: Boo. Apologize somewhere else.

Boo. Boo, Brian, boo.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here today to apologize...

MAN 1: Why did you say "ladies" first?
That's sexist.

It's just, it's just a standard greeting.

(STAMMERING) Let me start over.
Gentlemen and ladies...

WOMAN 1: Ooh, says the man.

Okay, sorry, I... I...
Um, humans in the audience...

MAN 2: I identify as a basketball.

Humans and basketballs...

PARROT: I'm a parrot who mimics words
but doesn't comprehend them.

Humans, basketballs, talking parrots,

and... And whatever else is out there...

WOMAN 2: "Whatever"? It's whoever.

WOMAN 3: Actually, it's whomever.

WOMAN 2: No one likes you, Mary.

All right, all right, just...
Just calm down, okay?

WOMAN 4: Now you're tone policing us!

MAN 3: That makes me uncomfortable.

Anything that makes me
uncomfortable in 2017 should be illegal.

-You know what? (BLEEP)
-(ALL GASP)

I'm not a racist, all right?
I just told a bad joke.

There's a huge difference.

But nobody on the Internet
ever takes the time to ask themselves,

"Is this worth freaking out over?"

Or, "Are there bigger problems
in the world than this tweet?"

Well, I assure you, there are.

And just for the record,
I love black people.

I watch tons of black porn.

So, what do you all want from me?

Huh? You want to ruin my life?

Then congratulations. You did it.

Everybody hates me.

I can't leave the house
without getting harassed.

No one will hire me.

STEWIE: That was a problem before.

I can't turn on my phone without
strangers telling me to kill myself

or that they're gonna kill my family.

Leave me alone!

I'm the self-righteous,
liberal douchebag, not you!

I've kissed a transsexual before!

How many of you can say that?

Where's my (BLEEP) medal?

I am so far left,
I'm spinning in circles, you (BLEEP).

Instead of killing myself,
I should kill all of you!

I'd like to see you try.

Ow!

Jeez.

(CROWD BOOING AND JEERING)

Well, we started the dialogue.

You screamed "black porn"
at the top of your lungs

in front of women and children.

I am not the person
those people out there say I am.

I know that, but you also haven't
done much to prove that you aren't.

I know, I know.

All I have left is you guys.

Thank God you have my back.

-We think you should move out.
-What?

-(LOUD THUMPING)
-Oh! Brian, listen, we love you,

but they're throwing things at our house.

We've got to keep our family safe.

I'm sorry. It's for the best.

Are you serious? You're okay with this?

Does this slow pan across
our disapproving faces

answer your question?

I saw <i>Baywatch.</i>

That thing was frickin' rad.

I still think this is a drastic measure.

Yeah, I messed up,

but what about all the
stupid things Peter's done?

He's never been kicked out and his life...

My life is not the issue here.

Peter, calm down.

Did you eat breakfast this morning?

I had a banana and a coffee.

Why am I so fat?

I'm sorry, Brian,
but this is the way it has to be.

All right, then.

I guess this is good-bye.

Brian, wait.

This collar is ours.
It has our address on it.

Peace, dude.

All right, radio, time for you
to tell me what this all means.

And I'm gonna move to New York City
and walk in and out of my building.

Okay, everybody, time to go
to Grandma and Grandpa's house.

-They're dead.
-Not your grandparents, Peter.

-I'm talking about my parents.
-I hate going there.

I'm not allowed to touch
anything in their house.

And, besides,
today's Dolph Lundgren's birthday,

and me and the guys always celebrate it
by watching <i>Rocky IV.</i>

Fine. We're probably better off
without you.

You always find a way
to embarrass us at my parents'.

Please pass the All Fruit.

Pass the Polaner All Fruit.

Pass the Polaner All Fruit.

Would you please pass the jelly?

Hi. We're concerned that many
of you <i>Family Guy</i> fans under 40

didn't get that reference,

so I'm gonna take you through
the actual commercial.

<i>Okay, typical '80s stuffy brunch.</i>

Please pass the All Fruit.

<i>Clearly the matriarch.</i>
<i>She's got the most pearls.</i>

Pass the Polaner All Fruit.

<i>Weird sexual tension there.</i>

<i>Okay, okay, watch.</i>
<i>Here's where it all goes to hell.</i>

Would you please pass the jelly?

<i>See? He called it jelly.</i>

<i>All right, now, what I don't get is,</i>
<i>if they know this guy,</i>

<i>why are they surprised</i>
<i>by the way he talks? Right?</i>

<i>And if they don't know him,</i>
<i>why is he at the table?</i>

Okay, now you have the information

that would've made that funny
had you had it going in.

All right, you ready to watch <i>Rocky IV?</i>

-Let's do it!
-Yeah!

Happy Dolph Lundgren Day!

-What the... What the hell?
-Try blowing on it.

Crap! It doesn't work!

Well, we got to watch the movie.
It's our tradition.

We could just stream it on your Apple TV.

Is that what that is?
I thought it was a coaster.

I've been putting cold,
wet things on it for a month.

Turn it on.
I'm sure we can find <i>Rocky IV</i> on there.

I don't know how to turn it on.
It doesn't have any buttons.

Well, maybe it's voice-activated.

<i>Rocky IV! Rocky IV!</i>

Let's just go to the damn store.

Hold on, hold on.
Let me try screaming at the PlayStation.

Hey, you guys. Why the long faces?

We were trying to watch <i>Rocky IV</i>
and our DVD didn't work.

And that's just Scottie Pippen.

When I was a baby,

they pulled me out of my mom's real slow.

We got a bin of old movies.

<i>Rocky IV</i> might be in there.

Let's see. <i>Talladega Nights,</i> everywhere.

<i>Ladybugs,</i> classic Rodney.

<i>A Million Ways to Die in the West,</i>
no, thank you.

Here it is! <i>Rocky IV!</i>

Nuts! This one's written in terrorism.

That's, uh, Cyrillic.

It's a Russian bootleg.

All right, we'll take it.
It's better than nothing.

Hey!

Welcome aboard, Brian.
This is your coworker, Martha.

Pleased to meet you, Brian.

Pleasure's all mine. So, any advice?

Well, there's a script you can go off of,
if you want.

Ah, script.
Now you're talking my language.

So, watch out,

-What the hell?
-Son of a bitch!

Those Russki bastards changed
the movie so Drago wins.

Yeah. Rocky gets up.

Not only does he not get up,

he's holding a sign that says,
"Workers of the world, unite!"

Well, that seems like a logical idea,
but this aggression will not stand!

I'm writing Vladimir Putin
an angry e-mail.

"Dear Vladimir..."

Ho-ho! That's telling him.

"I hope this e-mail finds you well."

Oh, man, I wish I could see his face.

"I'll get right to the point.

"My friends and I were aghast

"when we saw what you did

"Everyone knows that any American

You can Google that during the commercial.

Oh, my God. President Putin?

What are you doing here?

Husband write me impertinent e-mail.

Says any American can beat up any Russian.

I am here to prove him wrong.

You're gonna beat up my husband?

Unless he American chicken.

Did you just call me chicken?

Yes. Chicken.

(SQUAWKS IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)

Sound different in Russia.

Nobody calls me chicken.

Outside, now.

Hi, we're from Publishers Clearing House.

I have a million-dollar check

(GASPS) A conflict!

You're going down!

-Kick his ass, Peter!
-Yeah, kick his ass!

Punch his ass, Peter!

Pretty quick, huh? Well, how about this?

Here comes the haymaker.

You had enough?

He gone.

-Peter!
-(PHONE BUZZING)

Oh, looks like Putin's phone is buzzing.

-Brian?
-Oh, hey, Martha.

-What are you doing here?
-I'm always here.

Suicide is not a nine-to-five problem.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

Yeah, so I was thinking,

maybe we could Netflix and grill.

I think it's "Netflix and chill."

Oh, good, 'cause I don't have a grill.

Hey, do you have Netflix?

The credit card numbers I've been guessing

Good night, Brian.

Well, nothing says

Yup, private account.

But, sister.

Few parties they went to together.

Oh! "Grandpa's Funeral."

I'll tell you something,
if he were here right now,

I'd kick his ass.

Just like hundreds of dead journalists,

I'm not afraid of Vladimir Putin.

Hello? Is it me you're looking for?

Yes! (WHISTLING)

Peter, you not coward I thought.

You put up impressive fight.

Thanks, Vladimir.

You know, as someone
who doesn't read the paper

or listen to the news,
you're not such a bad guy.

Well, thank you.
To show there are no hard feelings,

anyone want to go to strip club

and look at some cat emojis with me?

-Hell yeah.
-I'm up for the strip club.

Great. Who's driving?

You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy,
but it's such a nice day,

I was kind of thinking
of taking my shirt off

-and riding a horse there.
-Get out!

That's totally my thing!

(CARS HONKING)

(SIGHS) The sun
feels good on my drunk chest.

You know what?
You're a good guy, Peter. Friend?

How do you say "friend" in Russian?

There is no Russian word for it.

Well, you're my friend now.

Funny how this worked out.
Who would have thought, huh?

I guess things not always what they seem.

Yeah. I mean, except for Ronan Farrow,

who is clearly Woody Allen's son
and absolutely not Frank Sinatra's.

I... You know,
I'm glad you could make it home

for the family dinner, Ronan.

You got it, four eyes.

Wouldn't miss a dinner
with my cuckoo dad for the world.

Hey, Anna May Wong, no tickie, no shirtie.

I'm just kidding around, rice bowl.
Geez, lighten up.

This room is tighter
than Ava Gardner's caboose.

Us, right? It's like looking in a mirror.

Well, Peter,
thank you for showing me Quahog.

It was fun.

I'm gonna miss you, Vladimir.

So, come with me back to Russia.

I need friend.

Aw, I'm flattered, but my home is here.

And besides, I can't go to Russia.

I'm scared of Brigitte Nielsen.

She is here with you in your country.

She's here now? Is she...
Okay, okay, let's go.

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Man, Russia has the hottest

What can I do?

Do what I do when people
don't pay their rent.

Plant drugs and call the cops.

I don't know. I may be broke,

but that seems like a crappy thing
to do to somebody.

and I guess in your own weird way,

you were complimenting me.

Um, what?

I just wanted to let you know

I'm not going to tell anyone
about what happened,

and maybe we could
get that drink tomorrow.

how your hair strands got in that baggie.

Hello, Officer!

-Is this your desk, ma'am?
-Yeah. Why, Officer?

Cocaine. Glorious cocaine.

Best thing ever.

You're gonna have to come with us.

you might want to call your sponsor.

You did this, didn't you?

I knew you were a little twerp

He did this! He planted that!

-Martha, I'm so...
-You bastard!

No. It's "Don't talk about Fight Club."

-Yep.

Ow! Son of a bitch! What was that?

I don't know.
Someone must've messed something up.

Listen, you need to talk
to Meg about her drinking.

What? Why me?

Because you're the one who told her
to start going to these parties.

Okay, fine. I guess it's just something
I got to deal with,

like the flush of a high-powered toilet.

So, you plan on going
back at that banana, huh?

So the bastard killed his wife,
and then reported her missing.

I got to... I got to call the cops.

-(KEYPAD BEEPS)
-(PHONE RINGING)

-Quahog Police.
-Joe, Joe, it's Brian.

Listen, I have to tell you something.

I'm pretty sure
Principal Shepherd killed his wife.

That's a serious accusation.
Do you have any proof?

I have something better than proof,

rank suspicion
born out of boredom and loneliness.

Sorry, that's just not enough
for us to go on.

You must be pretty tired
from thinking about all this.

-You ever get bags under your eyes?
-What?

I've been using this eye cream,
it's done wonders for me.

It's made by a company
called Rodan + Fields.

Have you heard of them, Brian?

-Yeah, I think...
-Oh, they make terrific stuff.

In fact, I was such a fan,

I became a sales consultant
for the company.

Listen, Joe, I got to run.

I'm hosting a little get-together
tomorrow night, if you wanna stop by.

There's gonna be pizza and soft drinks,

then a man's gonna talk
about the whole line.

Can I go ahead
and confirm your attendance?

Well, that was no help.

What if I go over there

and try to find some evidence
that he did it?

All right, fine.
But you have to be careful.

Don't worry, he won't have any idea.

I'll be more discreet than a guy
standing by himself in the ocean.

-Hey, are you peeing?
-No.

-Are you pooping?
-I'm just trying to enjoy the day.

Why don't you go bother that guy?

Summer's blown by, huh?

So, your mom says you've been drinking.

Yeah, like, a little bit,
but it's nothing you have to worry about.

Look, I was young, too, you know.

I remember going to parties,
walking up with a six-pack.

You're so excited to get there,
you start jogging a little.

Your friends are all there
and they're so happy to see you,

they're practically cheering your name.

And then <i>Mony Mony</i> comes on
at just the right time,

and everyone's dancing,

and Laura Hallston's jugs
are just slamming into you.

You don't have a care in the world,

and if all of it came to an end
right then and there, so be it.

Well, you're my daughter,
and I don't want any of that for you.

Hey, you want to see
where I was sitting when you were born?

Yeah, I still think about Laura a lot.

You were already drinking tonight,
weren't you?

(CHUCKLES) A little.

I can't talk to a drunk person
if I'm sober.

Hey, Jerome, can I get a beer, please?

But now, I'm starting to sober up,

so, I'm gonna need one
to keep an even playing field.

All right, but it stays between us.

And what if they card you?

Don't worry. I got it covered.

Wow! That's really good.

Right? Jerome, make it two!

Oh, God.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

-Oh, good.

DELIVERY MAN: Medium pie, 10 wings.

BRIAN: Is the blue-cheese dressing
in there?

Thanks a lot. Have a good one.

(SLURPING) Mmm.

He got out! Ha-ha! Yes, Stewie!

Oh, crap.

Oh, my, that was close.

Stewie, he saw you.
He saw you leaving his apartment.

Oh! Well, so, what?
He doesn't know what we're doing.

-(GASPS)
-What? What is it?

Well, that's...

That's not good.

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

Dad? Dad, wake up!

-What happened?
-I don't know!

We must have stolen this boat last night.
I have no idea where the hell we are!

Oh, no, my cell phone's dead!

I got a little bit of juice left,

so we can either A, call someone,

maybe they answer, maybe they can help,

or B, we can definitely switch faces.

Look at you! Look at me!

-That's what this is!
-(CELL BEEPS)

PETER: Oh. We're gonna die.

Dad, what are we gonna do?

You think it's too early
to tie our shirts around our heads

to show we're going insane?

I mean it, Dad. This is serious.

I did pants instead.

Ugh! I don't feel so hot.

What is wrong with me?

Have you taken a break
since you started drinking?

Not until right now.

Do you feel like lying on the couch,
rubbing your eyes,

while listening to Lou Reed's <i>Perfect Day?</i>

Yes!

Then I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
You got a hangover.

What can you do for a hangover?

Well, Meg, so I don't have to think
about my throbbing headache,

I try to think of something else,
like a riddle.

Like, how would you describe
Chris O'Donnell?

Huh! He's not tall or short.

And he's not fat or thin.

He's not handsome or ugly.

And he's not young or old.

He's not loud or quiet.

He's not memorable, but I know who he is.

(GASPS) Thanks, Dad!
I feel so much better.

But you know who doesn't?

Chris O'Donnell.

Bye, dildo.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Oh, no. Hard shoes on linoleum.

That's a principal!

Brian, a lot of people
live in this building,

and you can't tell it's a principal
just from a walk.

(BANGING ON DOOR)

PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD: Excuse me?
May I have your attention, please?

Okay, that's probably a principal.

Hey. How are you today?

What can I do for you?

What do you want from me?

-Listen, it's not what you think.
-Then what is it?

Well... I'm...
I'm actually doing a documentary

about some of the finest principals
in the country, and...

Ow!

Continue.
"Finest principals in the country," and...

Brian!

Stewie! Help me!

<i>How did I get here?</i>

<i>Well, to answer that,</i>
<i>you'd have to go back a little while.</i>

STEWIE: We're not doing that!

We found this in a dumpster
behind Principal Shepherd's building.

That's it! That's the bag!

I guarantee his wife's in there.

-(BAG RIPS)
-(RETCHES)

Ha! What's the matter, rook?
Too heavy for you?

I've actually been a cop for years.
I have tummy cancer.

Oh, weird way to say that.

What the hell? But I saw...

Yeah, what is all this?

Principal Shepherd,
I think you've got some explaining to do.

Look, I tried to tell you,
I didn't kill my wife.

She just texted me today
that she's moved out,

and she's banging my cousin.

Pat Sajak's accountant, by the way.

STEWIE: It's a weird time to name-drop.

And the food, well, I've been stealing it
from the high school to make ends meet.

My life's "kinda brute," as the kids say.

Sounds like you've had a rough day.

No wonder you've got those bags
under your eyes.

Have you ever heard
of a company called Rodan + Fields?

MEG: (GROANS) Are all hangovers this bad?

PETER: Yep, that's the deal you make
with the gods of fun.

Every 72 hours, you lose a day.

Dad, you're so sunburnt.

I can't move because it hurts too bad.

Ugh! This is awful.

We don't even know
if anyone's looking for us.

Look, don't worry. We're gonna be okay.

This is why you shouldn't drink.

Booze is nothing but trouble,
and you don't need it.

You got a good brain in your head.

Thanks, Dad. And if this is
what drinking makes you feel like,

you don't have to worry about it.

I am done with booze.

I'm glad to hear that.

And I'm sorry I pushed it on you.

I just wanted to watch TV.

I don't want
to see you waste opportunities

'cause you were out partying.

That's what I did.

You just worry about being you.

Don't worry, Dad.
I'll never be anything like you.

That's my girl.

-(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
-Dad, look!

Oh, my God. Meg, we're saved!

Thank God you found us!
We're so glad you picked us up...

-Chris O'Donnell?
-That's right.

And I hope you like turbulence, dildos.

Oh, my God. Brian, are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Annie, are you okay?

So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

What happened to her?

She was hit by...
She was struck by a smooth criminal.

That was fun, Mom.

We don't get to do
a lot of that kind of stuff together.

Listen, Brian,
we want you to come home again.

Oh, so, the Twitter pariah
is finally welcome home?

No, but the school board hero dog is.

It was all over the papers.

You saved the school $206
from all the food they recovered

from Principal Shepherd's fridge.

So, you really want me to come home?

They're still gonna serve that food?

Of course we do.

Hey, where's everyone else?

Oh, my God. Peter, what happened?

PETER:<i> What happened? A fair question.</i>

<i>And to answer it,</i>
<i>we have to go back a ways.</i>

-STEWIE: Stop doing that thing!
-Ah!

Brian, I got to say,
it's great to have you home again, buddy.

It's great to be here.

Living on my own was fun,

but I couldn't stop thinking
about all the stuff I was missing

being away from you guys.

Did you ever finish that banana, Brian?

And, Meg, I hope you learned
your lesson about drinking.

Yeah, I think I'd rather live my life
as a loser,

than feel bad once in a while.

I hope you know
that you're our loser.

Thanks, Mom.

Brian, I don't think
you've put yours there yet.

Well, as we know, the true spirit
of the holiday is one of giving.

So, I've signed all of us up to volunteer
tomorrow at a homeless shelter.

-That's your present.
-What?

Last year, you wrote us a freaking poem,
and now this?

I thought the poem was lovely.

Now hold on, I think that's actually
a wonderful idea, Brian.

It'll be good for the kids.

Oh, Peter, you're finally home.

Yup, just in time to watch
Patrick Swayze's <i>Christmas In Wonderland.</i>

Well, before you sit down,
I just need you to do a couple things.

Okay, first, I need you to take down
last year's Christmas lights

and put up this year's Christmas lights.

Then, I need you to get the eggnog cups
out of the attic

and bump your head on a low eave.

After that, take my cousins
to the airport,

and pick up my other cousins
at a different, farther away airport.

Then, shovel and salt the walk.

Then, shovel and salt the driveway.

Then, shovel and salt
Mrs. Whitaker's driveway.

She's 96 and has no one to help her.

We need four netted bags
of cinnamon pine cones.

Get the bags at Hobby Lobby
and the pine cones at Pier 1.

Next, inflate the giant snowman,
and put it on our front lawn.

The pump's broken,
so you'll have to do it by mouth.

Then it's just laundry,
take out the trash,

and move the house
a little bit to the left.

Argh! Can I do some of that tomorrow?

No, because tomorrow we're going down
to volunteer at the homeless shelter.

What time will you be back?

You're coming with us.

What? What does that
have to do with Christmas?

Peter, it's a holiday of giving back.

Yeah, but bums?

What kind of presents would they possibly
have for us?

Bags full of bags full of bags?

You know what, Peter, I've had it.

I'm tired of your selfishness.

It's setting a bad example
for our children.

Kids, get your coats!

Oh, is this it? Is this the divorce?

"Coats"? Where are you guys going?

Every year, my parents invite us
to their house

to enjoy Christmas in Newport.

And every year, we don't go
because you don't want to.

Well, this year, I am going,
and the kids are coming with me.

Go ahead! I'm fine by myself!

I'll just watch my Patrick Swayze movie,
and take a too-full bath.

Now I want to be on that side.

Well, that didn't work.

Now to take a slidey-toilet-seat,
soaking wet dump.

<i>Merry Christmas, kids.</i>

Haven't you ever seen <i>Ghost?</i>

Peter, you're in trouble.

So, I've come back to help you
recapture the true spirit of Christmas.

Go ahead.

(LAUGHING)

Yay!

That was awesome!
Where are we?

Peter, you've lost your Christmas spirit,

so I'm taking you on a journey
to Christmas Past to find it.

Oh, wow.

This is my old house
from when I was a little kid.

That's right, Peter.

I've taken you all the way back
to the year 1970/80/90.

I'll never forget that year,

when President Richard Reagan Clinton
lied to the American people.

Hey! That's me!

Look how skinny I am!

Yay! It's Christmas!

And I made your favorite,
peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.

Wow! These are all for me?

Of course, Petey, it's Christmas,
everything's for you.

Yay! Cookies at 7:00 a.m.!

Thank you, careless parent.

I'm going to eat 'em and hum.

(HUMS <i>JINGLE BELLS</i>)

See? Look how happy I was.

That's the Christmas spirit.

I haven't felt that in years.

Yeah, looks like your mom
really went out of her way

to make Christmas special for you.

She sure did.

Oh, hey, look, there's my friend Holden.

Merry Christmas, Peter!

He could still talk then.

I wonder what happened to him.

I got to go! I got to go!

Hold it in! Hold it in! Hold it in!

Hold it in! Hold it in! Hold it in!

Hold in! Hold in! Holden!

You died before <i>Game of Thrones,</i>
but a lot of people will like that.

What is this? Are we still in the past?

No, this is the present.

that not everyone in Quahog
has lost the Christmas spirit.

-What's this?

-Coal!
-Why?

He was right here.

Huh? Here? Really?

Wow, no wonder I don't see Cleveland
until New Year's.

At least they're together.

Well, I know one family
that isn't together for Christmas.

That was a delicious meal, Daddy.

You all laughed
when I suggested Boston Market.

Well, who's laughing now? (LAUGHS)

I guess I am.

All right, everyone, grab your hot ciders,
and gather around the speakerphone,

it's time to call my grandmother,
Nana Pewterschmidt.

(PHONE DIALING)

(NANA SPEAKING)

What did she say?

She wishes you a Merry Christmas.

That's not what she said.

Time for figgy pudding!

-ALL: Yay!
-Wonderful!

Seems like they're having
a good time without you.

They're just pretending to have fun.
I'm sure they miss me.

We should probably call Durd.

You mean Dad?

No, the fat guy who sleeps with Mom.

You guys talking about Durd?

More champagne, Miss?

"Miss"? Oh, my!

It's been a long time
since anybody's called me "Miss."

Wow! Merry Christmas, huh?

Oh! Merry Chris-Miss! (LAUGHS)

Oh, my God, she's doing
that flirty laugh she does.

It's subtle, but when you've been married
as long as we have,

you notice these things.

(LAUGHS HEARTILY)

You're very funny, Lance.

You're a very handsome, funny man.

Now, let's see that penis!

Yeah, see, again, if you read
between the lines, she's flirting.

Why, this isn't a Merry Christmas at all.

I don't like anything
you're showing me, Pat...

Oh, my God, they got Joe.

<i>Have you heard the story</i>
<i>That they're telling about Bethlehem?</i>

<i>Have you heard the story</i>
<i>Of the Jesus child?</i>

You're not scaring me with any of this,
Patrick Swayze!

And no matter what you show me,

there's no way my family
won't be right back here

spending Christmas with me tomorrow.

(HISSING)

<i>Oh, my love...</i>

What's happening?

I'm the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

I'm shaping your future.

And you will see...

Oops!

That's what happens
when I talk while I'm doing this.

Is this how Jonah Hill was made?

I can't believe our buddy's dead.

I know, and it's so sad,
he left his family with nothing.

Yeah, Lois had to sell her clothes
to get by.

I mean, I love having this underwear,
I just...

I just don't love why I have it.

God, it's so sad.

Who's this poor Benjamin that just died?

Nobody ever said Benjamin.

Poor, dead Benjamin.

All right, you're not getting it.
Let me just take you to your house.

Boy, I love the holiday season
with my husband

who's right upstairs, just out of frame.

Am I coming down?

Please tell me I lost the weight,
and kept it off this time.

Merry Christmas!

Who's that guy?

That's Lois' new husband, Lance.

Wow!

I finally had the guts to leave her.

Good for you, Peter.

What about the kids?
How are they doing?

See for yourself.

All right, everybody,
I'm off to Colombia...

Chris got into Columbia?

...South America.

Where I will attempt to smuggle drugs
back into the country in my rectum.

I knew there was some
kind of rug-pull coming.

-And I'm off to Yale...
-The lock maker?

...the lock maker,
where I have a minimum wage job.

All right, okay, yeah,
I'm getting ahead of these.

I'm going to Brown

four boxes of Jimmy Dean
pure pork sausage for my breakfast.

Well, I'm proud all my kids got into
Ivy League puns.

But what happened to Brian?

What's Brian doing
out here in the graveyard?

He usually sleeps at the foot of my bed.

He still does.

Oh, my God.

I'm dead? But how?

You died from a fire
started by your MILF On A Shelf.

Want to see some pictures of my teenagers?

No, Karen. Look, I haven't watered my
Christmas tree for a few weeks now,

so could you watch your
really long cigarette, please?

Did I tell you I went to the mall
with my daughter,

and an employee thought we were sisters?

Yes, many times.

I don't understand.

Why didn't someone in my family save me?

They went to Newport because you
wanted to be by yourself, remember?

Looks like you got what you wanted.

Oh, my God, look, it's my ghost.

Not exactly.

Yeuch! Why do I smell so bad?

Because I'm a dog fart now.

What? Why?

Because that's what happens
when you lose your Christmas spirit.

You spend all of eternity as a dog fart.

Was this in the book?

Yes, it was an obscure chapter written

during Dickens' opium
and spoiled lamb phase.

But how do I...

Where'd... where'd he go?

Don't worry, Brian's a 13-year-old dog.

-You're around a lot.
-(BRIAN FARTS)

Please, Peter,
don't lose your Christmas spirit,

it's disgusting in there.

-He eats garbage and his own poo.
-(BRIAN FARTS)

Please, Peter,
don't lose your Christmas spirit,

-this is no life for a person.
-(BRIAN FARTS)

Please, Peter, he ate Lois' trash.

-There's tampons in there.
-(BRIAN FARTS)

-Please, Peter.
-Keep your Christmas spirit.

-Please, Peter.
-This is no life for a person.

-Please, Peter.
-I'm the tampon one.

No! No!

(SCREAMING) No!

No, please, spirits, no! No!

Where am I?

What day is it?

All the porn girls I follow on Instagram
have Santa hats on.

It must be Christmas!

Merry Christmas, POV Angie.

Merry Christmas, triple-X underscore
Tara Kink underscore triple-X.

Merry Christmas to all the thirst traps.

Thanks, Grandpa!
This Christmas is perfect, isn't it, Mom?

Almost, Meg.

Almost.

Yeah, it is.

Except every time Grandpa bends over
to get a present, his robe opens up.

Let's see, I think this is for Chris.

Good God. Looks like two eggs
in an old handkerchief.

Merry Christmas, everybody.

-Peter!
-Durd!

Dad!

Peter, you did come.

Yes, Lois, I'm here.

All loaded up with Christmas spirit

and a sack full of hastily-bought gifts
from the CVS.

For Chris, a special <i>People </i>magazine
look-back at Robin Williams

'cause he killed himself.

Wow, look how thick the cover is.

It's almost like a real book.

For Stewie, a two-dollar Styrofoam cooler.

Awesome! I can probably fit 16...

Oh, the top blew away.

For Brian, a Rhode Island sweatshirt
with both "Rhode" and "Island" misspelled!

Wow! It hurts when I put it on.

And for my beloved wife,

a lawn chair that was 80% off
because it's winter.

Peter, I can't wait
to drink outside in this.

And finally, for Meg,

a clock radio with an iPod jack
for the iPods they don't make anymore.

Dad, you've never bought me
anything before.

Are you sure this is for me?

Of course, Meg, sweetie.

It's Christmas, everything is for you.

I love you, Peter.

I love you, too, Lois.

And, Patrick Swayze, thanks for helping me
find the true spirit of Christmas.

I wish there was some way
I could repay you.

Who are you talking to?

Well, actually,
there's one thing in heaven

that Chris Farley won't do with me.

I know exactly what you're talking about.

-Hit it!
-Hit what?

Peter, come on, time to get dressed
for our Valentine's Day dinner.

We don't want to be late
for our reservation.

Reservation?

Yeah. I decided we're going
someplace nice this time.

Not like last year when we went
to the Outback Steakhouse,

but it's "out" as in the gay way.

We'll get to the specials,
but first, I need to tell you...

I'm gay.

The hell you are!
No waiter of mine is gonna be gay!

Peter, please. He's our waiter.

He's the only waiter we have.

Lois, our waiter is dead to us.

We have to focus all our attention
on our hostess now.

He just needs a little time.

Scott,

I'm finally ready to hear the specials.

Well, happy Valentine's Day, Lois.

Let's have a dying marriage,
side-face kiss.

(KISSES)

Well, I better set out
a can of tuna fish and a cigar

for Arthur Valentine.

I can't wait to see what he brings me.

You want to tell us
what the holy hell that was?

(SIGHS) I'm afraid
it's something we made up

that we finally need to deal with.

You see, years ago,
when Chris was in preschool...

(CHRIS SOBBING)

Peter, poor Chris didn't get
a single valentine today

from any of his classmates.

What? Why not?

Apparently, he's not well-liked.

Some of the kids think he's weird
because he takes his shirt off to pee.

Yeah, I taught him that.
That's also called "peeing."

Pee? Pee now?

No. No, Chris.

Why no valentines?

Hey, hey, hey, stop crying, Chris.

You're gonna...

You're gonna get tons of valentines.

I am? From who?

From... Arthur Valentine.

-Really?
-Yeah, yeah, that's right!

Who's Arthur Valentine?

Only the most magical man ever.

And he comes every Valentine's Day on

a purple Vespa

to bring candy and sweet notes to children

who've managed to not use
any swears in the last year.

He does?

Uh-huh. And he has a long beard...

Oh, and he's got an eye patch.

But not for medical reasons,
he just likes the look.

Plus, he wears a <i>Cat in the Hat</i> hat

and sometimes a scarf,
no matter what Lois says,

because it gives him a youthful vibe
and adds some color to his face.

We were just trying to cheer Chris up.

I assumed he'd outgrow it
in a few years,

but, Peter, it's time
we have a talk with Chris.

We've got to put an end to this
Arthur Valentine nonsense.

(SIGHS) I guess you're right.

Well, I best be going anyway.

Donna and I are spending
our Valentine's Day

in Johnnie Cochran pajamas,
just caressing each other

in a very beige bedroom.

Yeah, and hopefully Bonnie and I
will do a sexy bath night like last year.

It was amazing.

She laid out a trail of rose petals,

and I elbow-crawled
to the sponge and shower chair.

I go down to the video store
and put my hand on <i>Love Actually</i>

at the same time as a woman, and I go...

(IMITATES LAUGHTER)

What about you, Brian?
What are your plans for Valentine's Day?

What? Oh, no real plans, I guess.

Ha! Looks like Brian's the only guy
with nothing going on.

Hey, you can come over
to my house, Brian.

I thought you had
that whole thing with Bonnie.

I do, but she needs help
lifting me into the shower chair.

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story, today
the Quahog River was dyed red

in honor of Valentine's Day.

So if you're looking to do a river murder,
this could be your window.

Stupid Hallmark holiday anyway.

Oh, hey, Bri. How's your night going?

I hope Rupert and I haven't been
too loud up there.

(SHOUTS) Happy Valentine's Day!

Oh, yeah, we're gonna go all night.

Just leave me alone, Stewie.

Well, Brian, if you're stuck
being a single loser,

you might as well just embrace it.

Mm. Oh, yeah.

(GROANS)

Wait a minute. What am I thinking?

Chocolate is poisonous to dogs.
I better stop or...

(RETCHES)

-(UTENSIL BANGING)
-STEWIE: Happy Valentine's Day!

-CLEVELAND: Stop the damn banging!
-(UTENSIL CONTINUES BANGING)

People are trying to have
dignified relations!

Oh, boy, look!

Arthur Valentine brought me
plates and a salt shaker!

Chris, Chris, settle down.

It's actually time your father and I

had a talk with you
about Arthur Valentine.

Yeah, (SIGHS) that's right.

Son...

I'm afraid Arthur Valentine isn't real.

What? Not real? (SCOFFS)

Then who leaves those notes
with all the misspellings?

Well, first, Chris, English
is a very fluid language.

We're sorry, but you're old
enough now to know the truth.

He... He doesn't exist.

(GASPS)

No! You're both lying!

(SIGHS) What are we gonna do?

It seems like there's
no getting through to him.

You know, if Chris
is this hard to convince,

we may just have to kill
Arthur Valentine.

What? What do you mean?

Maybe we make Chris believe
that Arthur Valentine is dead.

Huh. Well, we just might have to.

Hey, what's the matter, Brian?

Have you fallen and can't get up?

Turns out, still using
that joke is a felony.

Guess I better not drop the soap.

That one's the death penalty.

You were very lucky.

We managed to pump your stomach
just in time.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF) Oh, thank God.

I had him pump my stomach, too.
Doc, what was in there?

Well, it's a pretty extensive list.

I'm gonna need Billy Joel
to help me out.

<i>Lots of Legos, rubber bands</i>
<i>web-shooting Spider-Man</i>

<i>An old pet rock, an antique clock</i>
<i>a ton of red Play-Doh</i>

<i>Colored pencils, lots of nickels</i>

<i>Half a jar of Vlasic Pickles</i>

<i>Banjo strings, chicken wings</i>
<i>a single by Skee-Lo</i>

<i>I didn't poop those items</i>

<i>They were in my tummy</i>
<i>'cause they all looked yummy</i>

<i>He didn't poop those items</i>

<i>He tried to eat 'em</i>
<i>so you shouldn't feed him</i>

Wow, that was great, Billy!

Hey, does anyone call you
Bill Joel or William Joel?

No. Does anyone call you Petey Griffin?

No, they don't, because I'm an adult,

which is kind of what I was getting at.

(SIGHS IN DISGUST) Who sends
a Christmas card to their vet?

I know. It's so lame, right?

And did you see the lady outside
with the empty cat carrier?

(SIGHS) Cry much?

(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah, I bet she actually
thinks that thing loved her. (CHUCKLES)

Hey, I'm Brian.

Shake.

Nice to meet you. I'm Ellie.

What are you in for?

I got this small cut,
and they wanted to bandage it

so I'd stop chewing
the crap out of my foot.

Aw, that sucks. I love chewing
the crap out of my foot.

I know, it's the best.

But while I was here,
I also had to get...

(BARKING)

...a prescription filled.

Listen, I got to go.
You want to continue this sometime?

Let me give you my number.
It's on the back of here.

-It's this.
-Got it.

See you around, Brian.

Definitely.

Bye, Ellie.

(IN GERMAN ACCENT) Is this
the Veteran Aryan's office?

No, this is the veterinarian's.

I think you want
the Veteran Aryan's Center next door.

Ah, I see the confusion.
This must happen all the time.

We're ready for the German shepherd.

(IN GERMAN ACCENT) <i>Ja, </i>that would be me.

This is a very confusing lobby.

(LAUGHS)

(TAPS SCREEN)

Hey. Hey.

You think you could be with me?
Right here? In this place?

Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.
Sorry, Stewie. It's just...

I met someone amazing
the other day at the vet's office, and...

Well, she's actually a dog.

And it's so great dating someone
who understands

why it's especially important
to walk around in a circle

many, many times before lying down.

So, that's who you were texting with?

Sort of. I was just rereading
some of the texts I already sent her.

(LAUGHS)

That's good.

You're rereading your own texts?

Yeah, do you, do you not do that?

Nobody does that.

Golden Eagle to Red Shrew.
Ready for the plan?

Come in, Red Shrew.

LOIS: <i>Peter, we did not decide</i>
<i>on those names.</i>

Chris, come down here, quick!
I see Arthur Valentine outside!

I think he's come to say hi!

-Really?
-Yeah, look.

Oh, my God. Hi, Arthur!

I love you so much,
and I haven't cussed once today!

(YELLS) Dad, get the bowl of tuna
from under my bed!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

(ENGINE ACCELERATING)

(SCREAMS) Arthur!

(GASPS) Oh, my God, he's dead.

He's dead!

(SOBBING)

Mission accomplished, Red Shrew.
Over and out.

Huh. That looks tasty.

Little walkie-talkie piece.

God, I forgot how much I love art.

Hey, who's your favorite artist?

Me?

(STAMMERS)

You know, I really like,
that Jackson "Polack."

You know, I know they're not
supposed to be that bright,

but that was pretty genius, you know?

I mean, leave it to a Polack
to just grab the paint

with his hands and just start
chucking it everywhere.

I mean, it's great.

It's pronounced "Pollock." (CHUCKLES)

But, Brian, you don't have to keep
trying so hard to impress me.

I already really like you.

You do? Thanks.
I really like you, too, Ellie.

Truth is, I haven't felt this way
with anyone in a long time.

Listen, I'm really sorry
to cut things short,

but I've got to go. I have rehearsal.

-Oh, what, for a play?
-No.

It's kind of dumb,
but it's for a dog show.

Oh, you're a show dog?

No wonder you have
such a perfectly coiffed anus.

Thank you.

No, thank you. It's perfect.

I mean, God, I bet every
time you go snaffling on it,

you have to stop and admire it.

Come on, now, Brian.
A lady has to have a few secrets.

Man, she is something else.

This must be how Ronald Reagan
felt about Nancy.

Nancy, will you make me
the happiest man in the world

by turning a blind eye to the AIDS crisis

and ineffectually trying to warn
young people about drugs?

Yes! Oh, yes, Ronnie! Yes!

<i>If you're too young</i>
<i>those are both things she did!</i>

Peter, I'm really worried about Chris.

The shock of seeing Arthur Valentine die
seems to have really gotten to him.

I've never seen him
so depressed and catatonic.

Well, you know, in <i>Awakenings,</i>

Robin Williams tossed a baseball
to Robert De Niro,

and he snapped out of it and caught it.
Maybe we do that.

Chris, you doing okay?

It's Mom and Dad.

We thought we'd... <i>Awakenings!</i>

Peter, I'm not sure that's...

<i>Awakenings!</i>

-You're gonna hurt him if you...
<i>-Awakenings!</i>

Peter, knock it off.

I never thought Chris would
take things so hard.

I think we went too far
by killing Arthur Valentine.

We have to bring him back to life.

What? Are you serious?

It's the only thing
that'll snap him out of it.

Well, maybe, but what if
I try it with a basketball?

<i>Awakenings!</i>

Oh, God, that broke his nose.

He didn't even flinch.
It's bad. Let's do your thing.

Let's twirl some
toilet paper up into his nose,

and then when...
We'll do your thing.

Wow, thanks again.
What a nice dinner.

I'm so lucky to have met you, Brian.

You're such an amazing guy.

I'd say we're both lucky.

Oh, no, no, no, wait!

Don't do that.

What? What's the matter?

Oh, brutal.

Yeah, that's gonna be
a terrible car ride, man.

I would hate to be you, and I'm me.

I'm really sorry, Brian.
It's not that I don't want to kiss you.

I smell the poop on your breath,
and then that's all I want,

but my owners made an arrangement
with the organizers of the next dog show.

They paid a lot of money
to schedule me to breed

with whichever male dog
wins the competition.

What, like... like "breed" breed?

I know it might seem odd to you,
but this happens in the dog show world.

I have to have sex with
whichever male dog wins,

whoever that ends up being.

Stewie, we're entering a dog show!

-Where's Stewie?
-He ate me!

I ate him.

<i>He ate Stewie, holy crap </i>
<i>family Guy will be right back!</i>

All right, Brian,
now if we're going to get you

ready to compete in that dog show,
we've got a lot of training to cover.

Let's begin by doing
some work with the clicker.

Oh, yeah, I've seen these.

You click it when
you want me to do a trick,

and then I get a treat,
so I associate the two.

No. I use it to punctuate my jokes.

Now, Brian, you've got to roll over
and be good on all fours.

-If Nathan Lane can do it, so can you.
-(CLICKER CLICKS)

Okay. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

But maybe we should just focus
on getting ready for the show.

Well, look who wants to be prepared.

-You're a regular Beagle Scout.
-(CLICKER CLICKS)

Wait, shouldn't I be the one
who clicks if I like the joke?

You can't just click
after everything you say.

If it's funny, I can.
And so far, they've all landed.

Unlike the planes on 9/11.

See? No click.

That one was in poor taste. Not funny.

You know, I was supposed to be
on one of those planes.

Yeah, me, too.

Yes. Brian Griffin.

Brian?

What are you doing here?

Oh, hey!

You know, I...
You just made dog shows

sound so fun the other day,
I thought I'd give it a try.

Who knows? Maybe I'll end up top dog.

And on top of you. (CHUCKLES)

-(CLICKER CLICKS)
-Thanks, Stewie.

Brian, most of these dogs
have been training since birth.

Are you sure you're ready for this?

You bet I am.
I've never been so prepared.

I'm a regular Beagle Scout.

(BOTH LAUGH)

That's hilarious. Good luck, Brian.

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

Chris, you got to snap out of this.

I mean, I've been where you're at.

Listen, I've never told anyone this,

but I killed a jaywalker in 2002.

She looked old, but she was only 51.

I mean, back then, that was old to me.

It's why I always talk
and ask questions so much.

When there's any moment
of quiet, I think about her.

That's why all mothers do that.

Every mother has killed someone.

Now drink your ginger ale.

Hey, hey, hey!

It's Arthur Valentine,

here to accelerate awkwardly
into a bush.

-(TIRE SCREECHES)
-(PETER GRUNTS)

Damn it!

Arthur...

Valentine?

Chris! You're okay!

But I saw him die.

Man, thank you for all your help, Stewie.

I really couldn't have done it...
What the... What's going on?

This is it?

It's happening right here? Right now?

Uh-huh. They have
to certify the union, Brian.

Stud is ready to mount.
Please turn up the lights.

What? No! No, the opposite!

In fact, could someone maybe turn on
some Drake or The Weeknd?

Ha! He's blowing it! He can't do it!

Oh, I have an all-access pass to anything

Okay, okay, thanks, man,

I'm sorry, Brian, (EXERTS) but this is

I'm sorry, too, but I see now
that you were right.

I'm just not sure how this could work

or how our relationship
could fit into your world.

GLENN: Hey, less talk!

I guess this is good-bye.

ELLIE: I guess it is.

I'll always remember you, Brian.

And I'll always remember you, Ellie.

I promise to name
one of the (GASPS) puppies after you.

Let's just cross our fingers (PANTS),

it's not one of the ones he eats.

Thanks. That means a lot...

Okay, (SIGHS) we're at the part where
he bites down on the back of my neck,

so we should probably wrap this up.

Yup.

Whoa! Max's grandfather
may have been a horse.

Come on, let's just go home.

Okay.

Is this the romantic ending
you were hoping for?

Look, that was a tricky
situation, all right?

The lights, the people watching.

If it hadn't been for all that, I...

Trust me, I would've
set her world on fire.

I was drunk. It was an accident.
I must've thought he was a chew toy.

So? If you were driving drunk

would you still go to jail?

It's a stuffed animal, Chris.

Yeah, well,
he cremated that stuffed animal,

and he's going to Vermont
to scatter the ashes.

What? I got to go after him.

Not until I finish fitting this.

Hmm. Well, violent murderers
can often be found at bus stations,

so why am I surprised?

You can't go to Vermont alone.

I'm not. Got Rupert with me.
He and I had an agreement.

If he died first, I would scatter
his ashes on a mountain.

If I died first, he would
throw my body whole

into the fountain at the Bellagio.

I don't care. I'm coming with you.

Well, you're not going to sit with me.

Oh, come on. If I don't, I'll get stuck

Fine. You're right.
You know what? It wasn't an accident.

I knew he wasn't a chew toy.

I was sick of you talking
to him all the time.

I was sick of you

Is it weird that we're in a group text

No, what's weird is that
your Bitmoji can walk.

I'm allowed to have legs
in the phone world!

You know, once we're done here,
I'm never speaking to you again.

Well, how the hell was I supposed to know
it was gonna upset you so much?

How? How?

You saw me spend
almost every single minute

of every single day
with Rupert since I was born!

And you don't... Oh, hang on, hang on.
Another hiker going by.

One of us is going the wrong way.

(LAUGHS) When are they gonna
put in the elevator, right?

(LAUGHS)

I loved Rupert!

He was the most
important thing in my life,

and you willfully violated
the sanctity and trust

of our friendship when you destroyed him!

Stewie... I just don't get it.

You're so mature in so many ways.

You're... You're the smartest person
in the house.

You're incredibly perceptive.

You're wiser than people
40 times your age.

Why is Rupert the one baby thing
you're hanging onto?

Why are you so upset over a doll
when I'm real and I'm still here?

Because Rupert was
going to be with me forever!

He wasn't ever going to leave!

So what? I'm not leaving you, either.

Oh, really? Brian, let's be honest.

You're a middle-aged dog.
You don't have that many years left.

And one day, all too soon,

I'm gonna be crying
at your funeral in an Armani suit,

and people are gonna be like,
"Oh, nice suit,"

and I'm gonna be like,
"Why are you talking

"about my awesome $2,000 suit?
My friend's dead!"

Feels like that story is less about me
and more about your suit.

Go to hell! Besides,
if you don't believe Rupert was real,

why are you so jealous of him?
Why does it bother you how upset I am?

That is a very good point.

Damn right it is,
you joyless, fake-wisdom-spouting...

Hey! When are they gonna put
in the elevator, right?

Yeah. That other guy said that to me.

Nice shorts.

For the record, I would have preferred
to dress as Franken Berry.

-That doesn't make any sense.
-And this does?

If anything, we all three should've been
Snap, Crackle and Pop.

Yeah, we missed an opportunity there.

-It's fine.
-We did this wrong!

-To a place better than this, son.

BOTH: Yay!

Well, Rupert, we made it.

It's beautiful up here.

So should... Should we just...
sprinkle him around randomly, or...

Don't be a savage, Brian.
What is your problem?

We have to have the ceremony first.

Dearest Rupert, we're here.

I never wanted this to happen,
and it happened far, far too soon.

But...

(CRYING) I can't.

You... You do it.

Wha... What?

You give the eulogy.
I'm too upset. I can't.

What am I supposed to say?

I don't know, Just... Just tell the truth.

Let Rupert know how important he is.

Okay...

Rupert was a great bear,

a great... Uh...

-Power bottom.
-Right, right, okay.

But most importantly of all,
he was a great friend.

He was always there
whenever Stewie needed him.

He was understanding. He always listened.

He made Stewie a better person.

Stewie...

and I are both...

incredibly grateful for
all the time we had with you,

and we wouldn't change a single moment.

Except the end. Sorry about that.

Rest in peace, Rupert.

Thank you, Brian.

You deserve them.

She won't get them. No way.

She needed to get them, like, a month ago.

So, is that me over there?

-If you like.
-Here we go.

I saw the kid who has cancer leave.

That must've been fun.

I don't know why his parents
are still bringing him to school.

It's uncomfortable for everyone.

I've never seen him
when he's not just thrown up.

Charming. This is charming.

It reminds me of the therapist's office
Bethenny Frankel goes to

on<i> The Real Housewives of New York City.</i>

I hate her.

She looks like a wooden doll you'd find
in an Eastern European toy shop.

Oh, don't act like
you don't know who she is.

Please, that doesn't impress me.

We live in the world.

We all know who Bethenny Frankel is,
whether we like it or not.

You know, I actually don't mind her.

And she's built quite a business
for herself.

You have to hand it to her.

I don't mean to name-drop,
but I kind of know Andy Cohen.

I guess I'm his type.
Which, of course, is very flattering.

He's outrageously successful.

He originally wanted me
for<i> The Rachel Zoe Project,</i>

but I said no, so they went with Brad.

And now look, that could've
been me on<i> Fashion Police</i>

with Melissa Rivers 14 times a year.

Ah, well, hindsight.

I see the tissue box is empty.

Somebody was going through those like,

well, tissues. (CHUCKLES)

Hmm, I hope he didn't get cancer
all over this seat.

Yeuch! Yuck. Bad luck.

Although I did hear
Ryan Reynolds visited him.

Something to do with<i> Deadpool,</i> I guess.
So it's not all horrible.

If they don't give us a day off
when he dies, I'm gonna be so pissed.

Oh, look, you got
your Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

I don't know why those cups
always depress me.

It's like you've already given up
before the day's even started.

You might as well tattoo
"Can't afford Starbucks"

on your forehead.

What do I care, though?
None of my business.

I haven't heard of any
of the schools you went to,

but I'm sure they were great.
I mean, you're here, right?

And why are you here, Stewie?

Oh, that was lame.

You seem to have
a lot of strong opinions.

I do. Mostly because
I come across a lot of dicks.

Or I guess I should say "wankers".

We do like that word, hmm?

Or "tosser," "git," "prat,"
"sod," "chuffer."

Take your pick, eh, Dr. Pritchfield?

-"We"?
-Yes, "we."

I'm not following.

-The accent.
-The accent?

You speak with a British accent.

Yes, I'm aware.

Well, I've often been told
that I have a British accent.

Oh?

That's all you're going to say? "Oh"?

What is it you'd like me to say, Stewie?

That I have a (BLEEP) British accent.

I apologize, but I can't hear it.

You mean to tell me
you don't hear me speaking

-with a British accent right now?
-No.

That's odd, because everybody else does.

Have you spent much time in Britain, then?

No, I haven't.

-Excuse me?
-(SHOUTING) I said no!

But you're the absolute only person
who hasn't noticed it.

Really? Everyone hears this?

Well, just the people
who can understand me,

which you appear to be one of.

But that's too complicated to go into.
I'm not even sure I get it.

The point is, Stewie has a British accent.

That's, like, a known thing. Ask anyone.

I'm afraid I don't hear it.

Yeah, you've said.

It sounds like it's very important
what other people think of you.

Oh, is that what it sounds like?

To me, it does, yes.

To you it does. I see, I see.

So after five minutes,
you think you know me, is that it?

A little, perhaps.

I am trained, Stewie, to observe things
that give me an insight.

And, yes, I do feel I know you a bit.

You do feel you know me a bit.
Hmm. Okay.

All right, all right. Well, that's fair.

Might I?

I'm not sure how this is going to help.

Indulge me.

Thank you.

I see you're on vacation
in Rio de Janeiro in this photo

with your partner, I'm guessing.

Or is he your husband?

Yes, probably wanted
to make it official, didn't you?

Never thought you'd see it
in your lifetime.

Blah, blah, blah, blah.

At a quick glance,
I'd say there's roughly

a 26-year age difference
between the two of you.

Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows

while still giving you
a younger mind to shape.

"Oh, you mean you haven't seen
<i>All About Eve,</i>

<i>"Gypsy, Valley of the Dolls,</i> et cetera?"

And a younger body
to make you feel more virile.

Taking into consideration the math,
he was probably born at a time

when the most
popular name was...

-Michael.
-(GASPS)

From the dog-eared pages
of that volume of Shakespeare,

I imagine you wooed Michael
with a sonnet or monologue each day.

And no one had ever done
anything so romantic

as reciting Shakespeare
for Michael before.

And he was smitten.

While not as physically attracted to you
as you are to him, that's okay...

You each bring something
important to the relationship.

Isn't that what you believe,
Dr. Pritchfield?

I see a prescription
for heart medication on that table.

My guess is you keep that at the office.

You don't want to worry Michael,
you say to yourself,

even though the truth is,
it embarrasses you.

Your age, your mortality.

Best to keep appearing
as vital as possible.

And no need to have reminders at home

of what's just around
the corner, is there?

And your office is your haven,

since Michael doesn't work
and is often at home,

perhaps as a result
of a low-level depression

that you don't really want
to get into with him.

Oh, he always planned to have a career,

but he could never settle on exactly
what it was he wanted to do.

And at first, you liked having him at home

to take care of the house and plan trips.

So that's just what happened.

"And that's a job, too,"
he reminds you over the years.

Michael likes to travel,
and he prefers the finer things.

And you'd like to give them
to him, wouldn't you?

But it's a bit difficult
on a child psychologist's salary

at a Rhode Island preschool, I'd imagine.

Fortunately, you don't have children,
so you do have some disposable income.

Oh, you have talked about it
with other couples,

just for show, probably at dinner

with younger friends of Michael's
who are starting a family,

you know, to be part of the conversation,
to feel included.

But you said you preferred your trips

and your rescue dog
named after a character

most likely from Dickens.

Ah, how accomplished
and affluent you both look in this photo.

Just the image Michael
is so desperate to project.

Let's look a little closer, shall we?

Now, I see you're both wearing
Ralph Lauren Purple Label dress shirts

that retail starting at $495.

But from the disfigured
button holes on one

and the small discoloration on the other,

I can see you bought them
at the outlet in Providence.

Probably third markdown,
in which case, $49, give or take.

Since you also have light jackets on,

I can see that you went there
during summer vacation,

which is, in fact, winter in Rio,
outside of the high tourist season.

And I see that you're
on the rooftop pool deck

at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema,

the most exclusive hotel in all of Brazil.

Michael would've been dying to stay there.

Had a friend that went
with his older boyfriend,

who makes a lot of money
in, most likely, banking,

much to your chagrin.

But even in August,
it's almost $1,000 a night.

You tell him people are starving
in the streets in Brazil.

How do you justify paying those prices?

When the truth is,
you simply can't afford it.

It's for another class of gay people.

The window that Michael
is always desperately peering through

and sadly on the other side of.

But you do your best.

You don't go on Airbnb,
because you don't trust it,

even though Michael
has stories of friends

who have found the most fabulous places.

You like a hotel.

Besides, it's more romantic, you tell him.

But when you take him
to the place you're actually staying,

the one you found on TripAdvisor
that was rated number 27

of all the hotels in Rio

and was having a special rate
of $295 U.S. a night...

Which is still not cheap, you remind him,

most people never get to visit
half the places he's seen,

you tell him... You can't help
but feel like a bit of a failure

as you see the look of disappointment
on his face as he enters the room.

So, you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel
for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks,

once you've seen
the restaurant prices online.

And once there, you can see
how Michael begins looking

at all the older men who can afford

to take their boyfriends.
I'm sorry, husbands,

to such luxurious hotels.

And you worry a little,
that you're diminishing

in his eyes with each passing year.

But you tell yourself
you're being ridiculous,

as you see Michael
glancing about the rooftop deck,

looking at all the young men,

men that would be 20 years
younger than even Michael,

men that you're invisible to.
But he isn't yet, not completely,

and you're jealous
and you loathe yourself for it.

But Michael wants a photo,
and he says, "Let's take a selfie."

But you say, "Let's ask someone
to take one of us,"

and make some tired joke
about selfies that only you laugh at,

wishing that you could take it
out of the air

as soon as you've said it,
as it's just one more indicator

that you're older than everybody here.

So, Michael calls over a young man
wearing a tiny swimsuit

to take the photo and makes
a crude joke that embarrasses you.

But the young man laughs,

and he and Michael share a moment
that you're not part of.

And you feel humiliated and unseen.

Which explains Michael's joyful grin

and your slightly disconnected half-smile.

And you've posted the photo on Facebook,

and Michael's posted it
to his 86 followers on Instagram,

you don't know how that one works,

to at least give the impression,
in your Ralph Lauren shirts,

holding your $20 cocktails,

that you're both way more
successful than you are.

But it makes you feel a little dirty,

the lengths you have to go to
in order to keep Michael happy.

And every time you glance at this picture,

you wonder,
"How long before he leaves me?"

See? I guess we both know
each other a bit.

You seem like a very lonely little boy.

(SOBBING) Oh, my God, I am!

I'm so lonely!

(SOBBING CONTINUES)

(GROANS)

You can see inside my soul!

Oh, God!

(CRYING)

Thank you.

Thank you, Barbara.

Are you all right now, Stewie?

Yes, I think.

You're very kind.

She's a gem, that one, you know.
I hope you appreciate her.

Try taking some deep breaths.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

(EXHALES)

I do this sometimes in yoga.

(INHALES) I take yoga.

I have a sick body.

(CONTINUES BREATHING DEEPLY)

I do... I do feel a bit better.

But still lonely.

I'm sorry. It keeps spilling out.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

It seems like you're keeping
a lot bottled up inside.

I am. Nobody here likes me,
Dr. Pritchfield.

I try to fit in with the other boys

and talk about things
like dirt and shapes,

but they won't play with me.
And I don't have any friends,

and I have nobody to eat lunch with.

It's very interesting you'd say
that you have no friends, Stewie,

especially considering
the reason you're here.

Oh, that.

Shall we talk about it?

I don't know what there is to talk about.

You pushed a classmate down the stairs.

It was an accident.
Haven't you ever seen<i> Showgirls?</i>

Yes, of course I have.
But according to Tyler,

it was no accident.

Well, I guess it's my word
against his, then.

It is creating a bit of a con-traw-ver-sy?

-Excuse me?
-A con-traw-ver-sy.

-I don't know what that is.
-Con-traw-ver-sy?

"Con-traw-ver-sy"?

Oh, "controversy."

Apologies. Those of us
with British accents

pronounce it "con-traw-ver-sy."

But how would you know that?

Yeah, how would I know that?
Look, Dr. Pritchfield.

Cecil, if I may?

It's pronounced "Seh-sel".

-Damn it!
-But, again, how would you know?

-It's not as if you're...
-Okay, okay, we got it.

I only pushed Tyler down
the stairs because I like him

and I'm afraid he won't like me back.

And not "like him" like him. I'm not gay.

This whole thing isn't because
I'm gay, so calm down.

I can already see you lickin' your chops.

I'm sure you live
for the coming out sessions.

If anything,
I'm less gay than I used to be.

Not that anybody
at this school would care.

But do I think that
Grant Gustin and I would make

the most adorable Instagram couple?
Yes. Yes, we would.

Grant Gustin plays the Flash
on the CW, if you were wondering.

Because, you know, most people over 70
probably don't know who he is.

Think young Anthony Perkins.

Ah! Oh.

There we go.

Anyway, "fluid" is something I hear
being tossed around a lot now.

But I'm confident in my heterosexuality.

-That's a word, right?
-Yes, of course.

Okay, just sounded strange for a second.

It must be difficult for you,
Stewie, being so intelligent.

It is.

Oh, just that... Just that acknowledgment.
(EXHALES)

You know, sometimes
I don't know where I fit in.

I just, I just want to be
like everybody else,

but nobody's interested in the things
that I'm interested in.

They think I'm weird.
And I'm so anxious all the time,

but I... I always put on
a brave face and try to hide it,

and I... I give myself
these excruciating migraines.

I actually have way more hair than this,
but I pull it out.

I'm sorry, now I'm getting
all worked up again.

I'm worse than Bethenny Frankel
on her period.

I don't why I keep bringing her up.
It's just I think about her a lot.

Well, what are the things
you're interested in, Stewie?

Me? Well, I like to talk
about world domination.

Some people don't think
I talk about it enough anymore,

but mind your own beeswax
is what I say to them.

I also like to talk about musicals.

It's hard to find someone who can converse
on one of those topics, let alone both.

And I really, really, really
want to see<i> Hamilton,</i>

but by the time it gets here, I'll be 30.

I think I'm still the only one in town
who's even (HICCUPS) heard of it,

and it's been out for over two years.

Which just makes me even more
(HICCUPS) depressed.

How do you live in a place like that?

Quahog. What a pile of garbage.

And I've even memorized
some of the songs,

but I have no one to sing it for,
and I'm really good.

Do you want to hear it?

Oh, erm...

You mean now?

I really... I really need you to hear me
sing<i> Hamilton. </i>Ah!

I'm so good. Why can't I be on Broadway?

I want to be on Broadway.

I want the world to fall in love
with me eight times a week.

I'd love to hear you sing.

Okay, okay, now I'm nervous.

If it's not good this time,
just remember it was good at home.

Don't look at me while I start. It's hard.

It's a lot of words very fast.

Like Gilbert and Sullivan,
but for Hispanics.

Well done!

You're a very special little boy, Stewie.

I saw you check your watch.

That was a bit emotional
for you, wasn't it?

But it felt good.
Like, I got so much out, you know?

-Would you like a cup of tea?
-I would love a cup of tea.

It's hot already?

Yes, it's an electric kettle.

We don't have that at our house.

My mother boils water
in an old Jiffy Pop tin.

She's just a useless old slut.

Hey, my hiccups are gone!

If you liked Tyler and you
wanted to be friends with him,

then why did you push him down the stairs?

Oh!

I... I don't know.

Can I tell you a story
about another little boy?

Erm. Okay.

When I was your age, I grew up in London

-when the Blitz had just ended.
-Good God, how old are you?

Our neighborhood was reduced to rubble.

<i>And in the chaos, I searched</i>
<i>desperately for my parents.</i>

Mum. Mum.

Mother. Mother.

Mum. Mummy.

Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.

Mummy. Mum. Mother.

STEWIE:<i> Don't.</i>
DR. PRITCHFIELD:<i> Don't what?</i>

STEWIE:<i> You know what.</i>

DR. PRITCHFIELD: <i>But Mother</i>
<i>was nowhere to be found.</i>

<i>And neither was Father.</i>

<i>You see, I was</i>
<i>the sole survivor of my family.</i>

<i>So I was sent to live</i>
<i>with an aunt in Cornwall.</i>

<i>But she had too many mouths</i>
<i>of her own to feed, so...</i>

<i>I was next sent to a distant</i>
<i>cousin in Northumberland.</i>

<i>But she didn't care for children,</i>
<i>and off again I went,</i>

<i>this time to an orphanage</i>
<i>in Gloucestershire.</i>

<i>But they didn't like little boys</i>
<i>from London in Gloucestershire.</i>

<i>Or from Cornwall or Northumberland.</i>

<i>So I pretended I was from</i>
<i>Shropshire, of all places.</i>

<i>And eventually,</i>
<i>I became friends with six boys.</i>

<i>Sebastian, Declan, Flibbit, Pipadoodle,</i>

<i>Scudger and Nonsenseword.</i>

<i>And together, we traveled.</i>

STEWIE:<i> Okay, before you say</i>
<i>another name of anything,</i>

<i>I'm going to have to stop you.</i>

-Yes?
-I'm only here for 40 minutes,

and this is already a really long story

with a lot of locations.

And I don't feel like waiting
to see how it links up to my thing.

The point of the story is,
I know what it's like to feel alone

and to have to pretend that
you're something you're not.

And also, how my first kiss
was with a Nazi.

See? We didn't need
to go back 1,000 years for that.

And I don't pretend
I'm something I'm not.

-I never said that.
-You just said it.

I might have implied it.

I suppose the question is why
you feel the need to do that.

I... I don't know.
I guess I hadn't realized it before.

Maybe I'm worried
nobody's going to like me.

Lois left a tissue in the dryer again.

And these are my only pants.
How sad is that?

When I was in the orphanage,
my Sunday shoes were potatoes.

Well, you win that one.

Look, I'm different, Dr. Pritchfield.
I'm not like the other kids.

I realized that
when you picked up that photo

and decimated my entire life.

Sorry. It's kind of
a parlor trick of mine.

Have you ever thought
of just being yourself...

Your real self...
And then see what happens?

I... I don't think I know how.

Everything about me is this
carefully-constructed persona

designed to keep people at arm's length.

This isn't even how I really talk.

(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
This is. This is how I talk.

The accent is nothing more
than an affectation,

a coat of armor
to get me through the day,

just an image I cultivated
so I could feel special.

(EXHALES)

Wow. What a relief.

For once, to talk with my real voice
without the burden

of trying to sound like someone I'm not.

-What do you mean by that?
-Well, this is my real voice.

I don't hear a difference.

(IMITATES PETER) How about now?
You freakin' hear that?

(IMITATES GLENN) What about now?
Sound different? Giggity?

(IMITATES BRIAN) What about now?

(IMITATES TOM TUCKER)
Coming up now, this voice.

(IMITATES SEAMUS) Ahoy. It's me.

(IMITATES ROGER) And I'm a gay alien.

I'm sorry. That just all sounds
like the same person.

Well, Stewie, that was quite
a breakthrough we just had.

How do you feel?

(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
I feel... relieved,

like a weight has been lifted.
I can finally be myself.

I like this Stewie.
I hope he stays for a while.

I've never been vulnerable
to anyone before.

You're the only one
who's ever met the real me.

Well, I'm honored, and now,

the rest of the world is going
to meet him.

Yes. Yes, that's right.

There's no going back now!

I'm gonna talk to Tyler.
I'm gonna make friends.

I'm gonna be a normal boy!

Yes, you are.

You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

Wh... What? Say that again.

You're finally going
to be just like everybody else.

But... But I don't...

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I don't want to be like everybody else.

What do you mean?

I, I don't want to be like them.

Like any other zero in this
miserable town, like my family.

I won't do it! I don't want
to be like any other person!

Like you skiing in...

Please don't pick up that photo.

I want to remain what I've always been...

Superior, brilliant, special.

Oh, God, what was I thinking?

I'm never going to lift the veil, ever.

Nobody will ever know the real me.

My accent's back, by the way.
It was a very dramatic moment.

If you say so.

Now, let's talk about... (GROANS)

Stewie, can you hand me
my heart medication, please?

Of course!

Except there's one person
that does know the real me,

and that's you.

I don't understand.

Why aren't you getting my medication?

(INHALES) Hmm...

Yeah. Listen, you're not gonna like this.

Please, there's not much time.

I'd like to, really I would,
and you were super helpful,

and this... This kind of seems
like a crummy way to repay you,

but... I'm not going to get it.

Is this because I made you wait?

It's because I can't have anyone
know the real me.

And so, you must die.

I guess that's what happens
in therapy, though.

(WHINING) No, it's not!

Ah, you're right.
That didn't make much sense.

-Not to sound ghoulish...
-(STRAINING)

...but any indication how much
longer you're going to linger?

I'm not sure. (BREATH TREMBLING)

I think it's different for everyone.

Yeah, because you're still pretty chatty
is why I'm wondering.

Don't do this, Stewie!

It will stay with you forever.

Mmm, yeah, not worried.
For me, this is kind of no bigs.

(SHOUTS) Barbara! Barbara!

Oh, didn't you hear her go to lunch?

It was like an orchestra
of squeaky chair springs

playing her out.

So, this is how you leave me.

Yeah?

Would you mind maybe

-Sure.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

Lovely day for a walk, eh, Holmes?

Yes, just look at our great city,
bustling with activity.

Even the chimney sweeps are hard at work.

MAN: It's all dirty in here.

I don't care, keep going.

MAN: Shouldn't I wear
some sort of protective suit?

Why? Don't you trust me?

MAN: I do, but our friend Bartholomew
went in lots of chimneys in the '80s,

and now he's sick.

Holmes, there's something
I have to tell you.

-I'm getting married.
-I deduce, Watson, you're getting married.

-I just said that.
-Yes, but I had deduced it first.

That's what happened. So, congratulations.

Thank you. I thought you might be upset

because we won't be able
to solve mysteries...

Solve mysteries together. Elementary.

Crown jewels stolen.

"Another one bites the dust," says Queen.

And coming up, Russia and Prussia
still named basically the same thing.

Ghastly.

Who would have the audacity to steal
the crown off the Queen's head?

Only one man, Watson.

Professor Moriarty, the Napoleon of crime.

I've had him on the run for a year now.

His criminal empire is in shambles,
but he won't go quietly.

I say, look, there's hotshot
20-year-old comedian Benjamin Hill.

<i>(YAKETY SAX</i> PLAYING)

Oh, that'll be funnier
when he's older and slower.

Watson, this is the boat to America.

-How do you know that?
-Because Neil Diamond is on board, look.

<i>September morn</i>

We danced until the night
became a brand-new day...

I really hoped he'd be singing <i>America.</i>

Well, how will we know who Moriarty is?
We've never seen him before.

The science of deduction.

Hold it right there, Professor Moriarty.

Sherlock Holmes?
How did you know it was me?

When I see a man about to go
on a sea voyage and not wearing a topcoat,

with no watch fob,
and whose spats are not fully buttoned...

And the jewels hanging out of my hat?

Yeah, and the jewels
hanging out of your hat.

(GRUNTS)

He's got a gun. Look out, Stew... Holmes!

God, this is gonna be so annoying.

Watson, the scepter!

(GRUNTS)

(GROANS) Lucky shot.

There was no luck involved.

From the angle you were aiming the gun,
I extrapolated the path of the bullet,

and triangulated the deflection point...

Uh, is this... Is this speech for me?

Because he's dead.

For the court's amusement,
we now present Sir William of Cosby.

Well, you see, the children of today

you can see the first three layers
of their undergarments, zazzle, zoozle.

(ALL SNORING)

I get away with this
for another 122 years, you see.

Hello, Your Majesty,
I have recovered the crown jewels.

Mum, may I say,
it's been a pleasure serving you,

but I've decided to retire.

We are losing interest
in this conversation.

It would be a wonderful cap
on my career to have a knighthood.

Come, come, now, Holmes,
you're not... (SNORING)

COSBY: Sometimes, the bigger ladies
take a little longer, you see.

Really, Holmes, why retire?
There will still be crimes to solve.

But with Moriarty gone,

and with you, my biographer,
leaving me for marriage,

there is little point.

Just going to toss it
in the old waste bin.

Yup. Goodbye, detective cap.

Yeah.

And you, old chap,
are about to solve the biggest mystery

facing men of our time. The wedding night.

I know, I'm just...
I'm just giddy with anticipation.

Lifting her nightgown, nightshirt,
evening cape, boudoir coverall,

torso doily, and the various corsets
and trusses below.

Exposing her shame to God,

followed by brief missionary coitus
with no eye contact.

And then, five months later,

a stillborn child the size
of a digestive biscuit.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

-Constance.
-John.

-Hey.
-Sup?

So, my betrothed,
how go the wedding plans?

Oh, John, my father is sparing no expense.

Boiled beef for every guest,
fish head stew, old cheese,

and men's attire will be provided
by Gentlemen's Wearhouse.

You're gonna fancy the way you look,
this I vouchsafe.

What is it, Holmes?

It's an urgent missive
from Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.

Oh, darn, there's been a murder
and he's begging for my help.

Oh, darn, darn, darn,
this is embarrassing.

Now I've got to see
if I can dig that hat out of the trash.

Come, Watson, the game is afoot.

"Afoot"?

Starting, beginning.

Well, then just say that.

Enjoying all the old-timey jokes?

Don't worry, next week,
back to a normal episode.

Hmm. This is most curious.

It appears she was killed
by our old nemesis, the Scottish Brute.

That's impossible, he's in prison.

I put him there myself one year ago.

Nevertheless, we can't ignore
the evidence.

All his victims were prostitutes
whose names began with the letter "V."

This one's name is Veronica,

as evidenced by this satin
softball jacket that bears her name.

These threads
are from a Scotsman's plaid kilt.

The telltale locks of red hair.

But most significantly,

the Scottish Brute replaced
his victims' intestines with bagpipes.

(BAGPIPES PLAY)

Want to give it a whirl?

<i>(HEART AND SOUL</i> PLAYING)

How could he accomplish
this murder from prison?

He couldn't. There are only
two possible explanations.

Either there's a murderer who has copied
the Scottish Brute's methods,

or I put the wrong man away.

(GRUNTS)

What are you in for?

I Rathboned somebody's Cumberbatch.

Well, well, well, if it ain't
me old nemesis, Sherlock Holmes.

Hello, Brute,
I've got some questions for you.

Who did you tell about the murders?

Nae a soul,
'cause I dinna commit no murders.

I'm innocent, you nosey parker.

How can I believe you?
You're a common criminal.

All the prostitutes were killed
by a left-handed assailant.

-So?
-So,

I was born with two right hands.

-(BOTH GASP)
-Dear God.

That means
he couldn't have been the killer.

That's right.

You ever seen a man with two right hand...

Oh, this... This thing was open.

That shouldn't be open, right?

No, no, I wouldn't think so.

I hope you will accept
my sincere apologies.

Oh, you've done more than
made up for it, Mr. Holmes.

I'm just happy to be free.

Ah, the world's changed
since I've been in there.

That puddle wasn't here.

That cloud wasn't there.

That window was open.

That lady was four feet that way.

All right, well,
I hope you make a go of it.

Good luck with your fresh start.

BRUTE: Oh, where'd that bird
come from? That's new.

Watson, I found some important new clues.

These red locks of hair
I found at the crime scene?

They don't belong to the Scottish Brute.

They belong to a woman.

-How can you tell?
-It's hard to explain, Watson.

Women are mysterious.

But don't ask me.
Ask contemporary personality Oscar Wilde.

I prefer a man with a future,
and a woman with a past.

(LAUGHS) Splendid. Well said, splendid.

All right, let's get out of here
before we're all arrested

for the crime of "bum-fancy."

And now, I will disguise myself
as a prostitute named Valerie.

What the devil is that?

It's my own invention.

A steam-driven
mechanical exoskeleton. Observe.

(WHIRRING AND CLANKING)

It's cutting-edge technology, Watson!

Exchange money
for sexual services, guv'nor.

Are you a bobby? You have to tell me.

Mind the gap.

Astounding.

Yes. Now, I'll stroll around the block,
and you'll proposition me,

loud enough so the killer can hear.

Appetizing young love for sale.

<i>Love that's only slightly soiled...</i>

Love for sale.
Race-contingent love for sale.

Did I hear your name was Valerie?

Yeah, guv'nor. Uh, have we met?

Your voice sounds very familiar.

-(GASPS)
-(GRUNTING)

-What the hell is this?

HOLMES: Watson, hurry!

"Watson"? Oh, my God, Sherlock.

VALERIE: Watson, help.

(DISTORTED) Watson.

All I would've done
is be a perfect gentleman.

Sorry, got distracted.
Lot of rats in London.

That's for you.

Sorry we didn't
catch the murderer, Holmes.

And I'm afraid you'll have
to catch her without me.

My wedding is tomorrow.

Yes, about that, you know, I was thinking.

Maybe you should
put that off for a little while.

You know, sow a few more wild oats.

Oh, I've done enough of that, my friend,

especially after that raucous
bachelor party trip

you threw for me in Las Vegas.

(VULTURE SCREECHES)

So when do the strippers arrive?

1952.

Watson, I don't know how to tell you this,

but the murderer we've been looking for...

It's your fiancée, Constance.

You lie! You're just jealous!

Well, let's go to her place,
and I'll show you.

(GROANS) Sorry,
today was y'all's cleaning day.

Y'all want me to come back later?

Maybe, maybe, yeah.
Maybe, maybe another day.

MAN: That's fine, I'll pull out.

Just go easy,
it really hurt on the way in.

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

Constance? Are you here?

She's... She's gone.

I'm sorry, Watson.

Unfortunately, it appears
my deductions were correct.

Not so fast. Look, she left a note.

See, Holmes, it says here...

These are test results. She has gonorrhea.

I... I can't believe it.

My beloved Constance is the murderer.

It's even worse than you think.

If she's a murderer from this time period,

that means there will be a terrible,
pretentious musical about her one day.

<i>Behold the tale of Constance</i>

No doubt she'll be using those
for her escape.

Very well. Then we're off to France.

That's right. We're off to Gay Paree.

-What's this now?
-Gay Paree.

Some people call it "Gay Paree."

Oh. Then I suppose I should change.

Let's get separate rooms
just so we can spread our stuff out.

-Porter!

Watson, do you have thruppence
for the porter?

-I have tuppence.
-So you don't have thruppence?

Quick, after her.

We have to chase her
through a series of shots

where she has an inconsistent lead on us.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

This way, Holmes.
She's heading towards... Holmes?

I couldn't come here and not do this.

She has appendicitis, by the way.

She must have gone up
this strange building. What is it?

It's the brand-new Eiffel Tower.

-Well, let's hurry. She's getting...
-Hold on, hold on.

I think we may have
just photobombed that family's picture.

Damn it, my heel is caught. (GRUNTS)

-(YELPS)
-Constance!

Hang on, my darling.

John, I did it for him.

And you didn't mean to hurt me?

No, you're not getting what I'm saying.

I didn't care about you at all.

Who did you do this for?

Why were you killing prostitutes
with the initial "V"?

(LAUGHS) The great Sherlock Holmes.

He said you'd never figure it out,
and that he'd be victorious. (LAUGHS)

(SCREAMING)

Constance!

(THUDS)

(GROANS) <i>Depardieu!</i>

I can't believe she's gone, Holmes.

Oh, you'll find someone.

You're a good guy with a great body.

I still don't understand
what she meant by,

"He said you'd never
figure it out, and..."

"That he'd be victorious."

Watson, that's it.

Didn't think I'd figure it out.

This calls for the old Sherlock Holmes
celebratory smoke.

I'll just light my pipe.

(THUNDERCLAP)

(SNORING)

What is the meaning of this?

I'll be replacing your innards
with these bagpipes, Queen Victoria.

Not before we put you in jail.

What's with this "we" crap? It's just you.

Oh, no, it's "we."

(GASPS)

We made it just in time.

And I was able to fool you,
as I am a master of disguise.

Seems like you're just good
at dressing up like a woman.

Ah, you caught me, Mr. Holmes.

I suppose it's back to jail for me.

You can dispense with the act,
Professor Moriarty.

Holmes, what are you talking about?

Moriarty's dead. You killed him.

No, that was one of his lackeys.

Isn't that right, Professor?

Very clever, Holmes.

What gave me away?

Constance.

She said that you'd be victorious.

That was the vital clue
that these murders were for my benefit.

<i>I was dismantling your criminal empire,</i>
<i>and you wanted revenge.</i>

MORIARTY: You cannot catch
what you cannot see.

(LAUGHS CUNNINGLY)

HOLMES: <i>So, you concocted</i>
<i>an elaborate series of murders</i>

<i>with clues leading me</i>
<i>to the fictional Scottish Brute.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, two toothless,</i>
<i>British homeless people</i>

<i>had filthy sex in an alleyway.</i>

<i>They would become the grandparents</i>
<i>of the guys from Oasis.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, you had your girlfriend</i>
<i>seduce my best friend.</i>

<i>She arranges for me to kill your impostor</i>

<i>and commits an identical murder</i>

so I would come
to the inescapable conclusion

that I put the wrong man away.

Constance would lead us away from England,

while you killed the last prostitute
with the name "V."

And I'd get the blame for freeing the man
who killed our beloved Queen.

Brilliant.

Why do you think Queen Victoria
is a prostitute?

She formed an alliance
with the Dutch royals

for shared control of Guyana.

So... political.

One last mystery to solve.

Why do they call you "Professor"?

I teach at Hogwarts.

-Really?
-No.

But we should've done that
instead of this.

Holmes, with this case,
you saved the entire British Empire.

Yes. Now it will last forever.

And it's not like I'd be lying.

There we go.

Hey, another round
for me and my veteran buddies.

Dad, <i>Family Guy</i> used two of your songs.

Well, that's great,
but I'm not your dad.

I'm Kenny Loggins, and you're a groupie
I brought here for sex.

-Dad, <i>Family Guy</i> just...
-See, now, that's my daughter.

-You guys got your video cameras ready?
-Yeah. What's going on?

Well, as a veteran,
I get to star in a viral YouTube video

of me reuniting with my beloved pet.

So here goes.

(GROWLS)

My pet is Christian the lion.
I'm doing two Internet things at once.

This is my heterosexual roommate, Ace,

with whom I shared the lion
two decades ago.

-You look great, Peter.
-I have a family now!

You know, guys,
if being a veteran is about anything,

it's about getting halfhearted applause
on a Southwest Airlines flight.

-(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
-MAN 1: (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Veterans.

MAN 2: (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yay, veterans.

Holy crap, you're Eric Dane
from<i> Marley & Me,</i> and other stuff!

I'm afraid you got to give us
your front-of-the-plane seats

'cause that's what celebrities
do for veterans.

Well, clear out, kids.
It's just part of the Hollywood deal.

Thank you. Thanks.

Thank you so much. This is why I served.

<i>"USS Nathan James"?</i>

Yes, sir. Boats, military, sir.

The<i> Nathan James</i> is the fictitious ship

on TNT's<i> The Last Ship,</i> starring
Adam Baldwin and Jocko Sims.

-And Eric Dane.
-Uh-oh.

You guys aren't veterans at all!
You're frauds.

(ALL GASP)

Okay, we ain't real vets.

Quagmire served in the Navy.
The rest of us are charlatans.

-Boo!
-You're terrible!

I fly Southwest
to have a classy experience,

and you've ruined it.

Excuse me, gentlemen. You're under arrest.

What? Why?

You three are in violation
of the <i>Stolen Valor Act,</i>

which makes it a crime
to pretend to be a veteran.

Oh, so suddenly it's a crime
to break the law?

Mr. Quagmire, you're free to go.

But the rest of you
will have to come with me.

I thought we had it bad,
being gay overhead bins.

-What makes us gay?
-We've got bags in our mouths.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, quick, put these on.

They're not gonna throw a veteran in jail.

-Is this some kind of joke to you?
-No, it was a sincere idea.

Real servicemen and women

have made real sacrifices
for this country.

And you! You're an actual veteran,
you should know better.

I'm sorry.

You made a mockery
of our whole family, Glenn.

Now, everywhere I go,

it's like people are staring at me
and whispering.

Court is now in session.
Judge Dignified Q. Blackman presiding.

You men are accused of violating
the <i>Stolen Valor Act,</i>

and that's years of jail time.

We forgot to get a lawyer.

But in view of your long service
to comedy,

I'm willing to offer a deal.

What kind of deal?

I'll waive the charges,

but only on the condition that
you men enlist in the military for real.

You three have to join the Marines.

Oh, my God. We could be killed!
Please, no!

All right, how about the Coast Guard?

-Yeah, that's fine.
-(ALL GASP)

-Something happened.
-Something just happened in court.

Glenn, if you were half the man
I used to be,

you'd stand up and join them.

Your Honor,
I'd like to sign up, too.

MAN 1: Oh, my God.
MAN 2: I was checking my phone.

-What happened?
-Excuse me?

That's right. I'm going with them.

The four of us
will join the Coast Guard together.

All right.
Report to the induction center tomorrow.

Court is adjourned.

Next case on the docket.
<i>The People v. </i>Ted 2.

Okay, come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go. Let's go.

Good morning, recruits.
Welcome to the Coast Guard.

Sir, when do we report
for basic training, sir?

Hey, what's with the "sir" stuff?
This is just the Coast Guard.

Now, come on.
Who here can pantomime driving a boat?

Mmm, we got any boat guys here?

Whoa, look at that!
You guys should be recruiting me.

Now, can you bounce
with the waves a little bit?

Uh-oh! Getting kind of choppy.

Is this guy for real?

This is idiotic.
This is nothing like what the Navy was.

Shh. Quagmire, I got to focus
on my boat here.

The way people's talking makes me think

we're gonna be dealing
with a lot of water.

You guys seem to have what it takes,

so raise your right hand
as I recite the Coast Guard pledge.

"When you're here, you're family."

-Isn't that the slogan for...
-We had it first!

(CLEARS THROAT)
Everybody ships out tomorrow.

You'll find your assignments
listed on this sheet.

Oh, crap. Where in Iraq
is "Fort El Ahoud Urd Ali"?

Peter, that's "Fort Lauderdale."

We're being shipped out
to guard freaking spring break.

-Sweet!
-All right!

Spring break on the land, not the water!

No, it's not sweet. It's a joke.

This whole thing is a joke!

Compared to the Navy,

the Coast Guard is totally unprofessional
and incompetent.

-Well, I'm off.
-Oh, Peter, I'm so worried.

-Where are they stationing you?
-I can't tell you.

That is on a knead-the-dough basis.

(WHISPERING)

-Florida?
-Shh.

Hey, you be safe.

Wait, Dad, before you go,
can you teach me to shave?

Well, for starters, bud,
that's supposed to be on your pubes.

You got a secret inch hiding under there.

-This is what I'm gonna be missing.
-(CAR HONKING)

Well, that's an unrelated car honking,
but I'm gonna go now.

Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

where all the art
in every dentist's office comes from.

All right, let's get to work.
Grab your binoculars.

We got to practice doing
funny double-takes

upon seeing a bikini woman.

Sir, should I say, "Aaoogah," sir?

Affirmative. And, Joe,

I order you to just let the binoculars
fall right out of your hands,

but you don't even notice
'cause of how foxy the woman is.

All right, yeah. I can see that we got
the right skill set for this assignment.

Okay, guys, knock it off.

But, Quagmire,
there's spring-break boobs everywhere!

Come on, guys, I mean it.

This is important.
I want you to start acting like it.

-Wow, he's serious.
-He's very serious.

We're in the motel now.

Guys, we have to complete a 160-point
inspection of this coastal patrol cutter.

I'll call them out.

Item one, "hydraulic grapple-winch."

-Guys?
-JOE: We're over here,

painting clever names on boats.

No, Peter, it's supposed to be
short and poppy.

Oh, okay.

Okay, guys, while I scan
for disabled watercraft,

I need a status report
on that hydraulic grapple-winch.

-Guys?
-PETER: We're busy.

We're hanging out with Aquaman.

I told you, I'm not Aquaman.
I am the Sub-Mariner.

What's your deal?

I'm just like Aquaman,
but I can't get fish to do things.

That's the big thing.

I mean, isn't that all Aquaman does?

No, he can also breathe underwater,
and he's strong, like me.

Isn't everyone strong underwater?

No. No, not like me.

I can punch a big octopus
a really long way.

Hey, guys.

-Hey, Aquaman!
-Yeah!

Hey, make a fish do something.

Oh, shucks, guys, I don't know.

I guess I could do something like this.

(PINGING)

Wow, a real superhero.

I... I have little wings on my feet!

Just... Shh. It's over. It's over.

(BEEPING)

Hey, can you guys keep it down for a bit?

I got to have a FaceTime conversation
with my wife,

where we talk at the same time,
and then stop,

and then start again, then laugh.

-Hi, honey...
<i>-Hi, hon...</i>

-No, you go...
<i>-You go ahead.</i>

-No, I...
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

-You first.
<i>-You first.</i>

(BOTH LAUGH)

STEWIE:<i> Hi, Pop.</i>

Oh, God, Stewie. You've gotten so big.

<i>No, I'm just in the foreground.</i>

You're as tall as your mother now.

<i>He... He doesn't understand perspective.</i>

All right, let me say goodbye to Mommy.

<i>-Well, you take care...</i>
-Goodbye, hon...

<i>-You go...</i>
-What?

<i>-You go...</i>
-I was just gonna say...

(BOTH LAUGH)

Everything stinks.

-Hey, Quagmire, where you going?
-I'm going home.

-What? Why?
-'Cause I'm sick of this.

I'm the only one taking the job seriously.

Hell, you guys
still don't even know how to operate

a simple hydraulic grapple-winch.

Okay, that's the third time you've
mentioned the hydraulic grapple-winch.

Is that gonna be important for later?

I feel like maybe it is.

Quagmire, you can't just go home.
We're stationed here.

I wasn't sentenced,

but I came anyway because I thought
I could try and teach my friends

what it means to serve their country,
the way I did.

But you're hopeless, so I'm done.

MAN:<i> And I'm still the voice</i>

-(DOOR CLOSES)
-(PETER SIGHS)

I disappointed
the stupidest guy in football.

-I got to go take a sad pee.
-Me, too.

We should probably all go
urinate together, outdoors,

as a group of guys,
while wearing backwards baseball caps,

per Fort Lauderdale municipal law.

(URINATING)

The Florida ways are the best ways.

MAN 1: Are we ready to attack?

MAN 2: We are! And many people will die.

-What the hell's that?
-(ALL ZIPPING)

Are we ready to attack?

We are! And many people will die.

Oh, my God.

Those evil frat boys
are planning to kill spring break.

And they only had time to record
two lines of dialogue.

Are we ready to attack?

We are! And many people will die.

We got to stop them.

All right, let's just find a quiet place
to come up with a plan.

-(LOUD CHATTER)
-All right, here's what we do!

-We track down...
-(BLENDER WHIRRING)

-We start talking and...
-(BLENDER WHIRRING)

-Joe, you get us some...
-(BLENDER WHIRRING)

-Cleveland, I want you to get...
-(BLENDER WHIRRING)

...buildings in the city.

I'm still very unclear about the plan!

(SIGHS) Three more banana daiquiris.

-We track down the...
-(BLENDER CLATTERING)

Did you see all of those guns and weapons
those evil frat boys had?

I sure did.

And we still haven't nailed down a date
for visiting Epcot.

But what can we do?

Quagmire was the only real soldier
among us.

You're right.

Compared to him, we're about as useless
as one of those automatic bathroom sinks.

Oop. Oop.

Oop.

Oop.

Oop. Oop. Oop. Oop. Oop. Oop. Oop. Oop.

What the hell are you doing?
This is a women's bathroom.

Oop.

Come on, guys, we don't need Quagmire
to do the right thing.

I love that movie.

If there's gonna be an attack
at spring break,

we can't just stand by
while people get hurt or even killed.

Joe's right. It's up to us to stop it.

Because we're in the Coast Guard.

And when you're here, you're family.

(ALL LAUGHING)

-Great!
-Yeah!

Yeah.

That food was all very salty.

There are so many people.

We got to find those frat boys.
Look for anything suspicious.

(GASPS) The Coors party ball
is a dirty bomb!

No, Peter, it's not.

It's just the coolest, freshest way
to keep your party rolling is what it is.

This is hopeless!

There's no way to guess
what their target is.

MAN: (OVER PA)
<i>Final boarding call for the</i>

<i>"Are We Ready To Attack, We Are,</i>
<i>And Many People Will Die" booze cruise.</i>

Okay, I got a feeling about that one.

Let's go!

No, guys. We'll never make it on foot.

We got to steal that kid's Jet Ski.

Peter, the boat's right there.
We'll totally make it.

-It's the only way, guys!
-(BOY GRUNTING)

Peter, we're now literally
standing on the boat.

That's how close the boat is.

Made it!

-You wanted to ride the Jet Ski.
-I wanted to ride the Jet Ski.

(HORN TOOTING)

How much you reckon
a boat like this costs?

All right, everybody, freeze!

This is the U.S. Coast Guard.

And when you're here, you're family.

(BURPING)

Anyway, U.S. Coast Guard.

You kids are...

What are we gonna do? We're way outgunned.

Are any of you familiar

with what's referred to
as a "Leeroy Jenkins"?

Well, I don't know what that is,

but let's make a very long,
elaborate plan.

All right, so I'll run in first
and use an intimidating shout.

When my shout's done,

I'll need Joe to come in
and use his shout, too.

What do you think?
Can you give me a number crunch quick?

Yeah, give me a sec. I'm coming up
with, uh, 32.33, repeating, of course.

Okay, that's a lot better
than we usually do.

-So let's...
-Leeroy Jenkins!

Oh, my God, he just ran in.
Let's go! Stick to the plan!

Let's go! Let's go!

PETER: Oh, man. We're dying.

JOE: <i>Damn it, Cleveland.</i>

PETER:<i> Where'd they get dragons?</i>

<i>These guys have magic, guys.</i>

JOE:<i> I can't move.</i>

<i>Oh, God!</i>

(GUNS COCKING)

Oh, crap, we're gonna die.

-GLENN: Freeze!
-(MEN GASP)

Quagmire, you came back!

That's right.

Because I'm in the U.S. Coast Guard.

-And when you're here...
-No, don't say it!

I'm glad you came back, buddy.

You really saved the day.

Hey, where'd you get the machine gun?

From the coastal patrol cutter.

"Machine gun" is item 49
of the 160-point inspection.

Oh, that was when I was writing
homosexual stuff on the boat.

Too bad about the bomb.

-Bomb?
-Yep. Right here on the boat.

Soon you will all do
the foamy dance of death.

We are! And many people will die.

He just says that one thing.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

(GASPS) The bomb is hidden in the foam.

Where is it? Have you found it?

No. I was thinking next Thursday
for Epcot, but no bomb.

You're wasting your time.

The bomb will activate
the moment the floor stops vibrating.

(GASPS) Did you hear that? Twerk!

Twerk like you're Miley Cyrus
trying to prove something to your dad!

Found it!

(BEEPING)

-We're all gonna die!
-(ALL GASP)

No, we're not.
I stole a Jet Ski from a kid.

(GASPS, LAUGHS)

Oh, I forgot they do that.

Hydraulic grapple-winch!

-Oh, yeah!
-From earlier!

(GRUNTS)

-We did it! It's over.
-'Cause of you.

Thanks for saving us, Quagmire.

Ah, I was just doing my duty.

Just like you did.

Good job, soldier.

Anyway, what matters is everyone's okay,
thanks to the Coast Guard.

-Because when you're here...
-(GUNSHOT)

I'm not going back to that restaurant.

I'm so happy you're back home
where you belong, Peter.

It's just not the same here without you.

Thanks, Lois,

and I thought about you not at all.

Well, I'm so proud
of my Coast Guard husband.

And I'm proud of my Coast Guard dad.

And I'm bisexual,

Good night, Coast Guard!
Hope you enjoyed the episode!

What the hell?

Oh, hey, Brian.

I was sick of waiting my turn
outside the supermarket,

so I bought every
coin-operated horse in town.

I assume you're on the unicorn?

You know me well, sir.

Must be a dozen horses here.

How do you possibly have the money
for this type of stuff?

Well, I'll tell you,
but only on one condition.

Fine. Never mind then.

Investing! I invest in the stock market.

The stock market?

Ugh! What do you
even know about that stuff?

It's easy. I just follow trends
and invest accordingly.

For instance, there are more single people
over 50 than ever.

So I'm investing in handguns
and blackout window shades.

They don't want to be
part of society, Brian.

They've made that very clear.

I don't know, Stewie, if you ask me,
the stock market's just a rigged game

where the top 1% make out like bandits,
and regular people get hurt.

Are you reading off
a teleprompter right now?

-No.
-(TELEPROMPTER WHIRRING)

-The prompter's down. What do we do?

It's my mom's birthday.
You have to be there.

Lois, if you let me out of this,

I will go to Meg's ballet recital
in your place.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

PETER:<i> I did not go to the recital.</i>

Argh! What a day.

I asked Miss Watson
if she had any kids of her own.

Immediately, she put me in a time-out.

What the hell?

Hey, a Mets fan, huh?

No, no, Joe, now is not the time
to use your new conversation techniques.

I love her so much. Look at her.

So beautiful.

And there's no one to take care of her,

so, unfortunately,
I'll be gone for a while.

-I got to close this place for a month.
-A month?

I wish it was February.

'Cause, you know,

Nice one, Joe. You're on the board.

Look, I don't want
to close the place either,

but I don't have anyone to run it.

Hey, Brian, I need to talk to you
about that money I invested for you.

I knew it. You lost it all, didn't you?

God, I never should have
given you my money.

The stock market is a sucker's bet,
like chasing your tail.

God, it's right there
and yet a million miles away.

What are the physics of that?

I didn't lose your money, Brian.
Quite the contrary.

Here's a thousand to fix your car
and here's a thousand profit.

Wow, wow. Hold on.

-You made $2,000 in a couple days?
-Yep.

Oh, my God.
You got to teach me how to invest.

Okay, but I can see
this is going to be a lot of work.

So in return, you must teach me

Gymkata, the fusion
of gymnastics and karate.

No, Stewie! I won't do that.

It's too dangerous.
I swore I'd never teach Gymkata again.

Brian, there's
a 22-year-old Mongolian heiress

and cruise the pier. You want in?

Well, cancer's not going anywhere.

I'm sorry, Billy, you're $1 short

of being able to afford
the surgery you need.

STEWIE: Yeah!
BRIAN: Money!

Sweet. I know those guys.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Wow, look at us, running The Clam.

-Joe, why are you dressed like that?
-'Cause I'm a mixologist.

-Oh, cool. What can you make?
-You name it, I can make it.

-Could I get an old-fashioned?
-Classic. Rum and Coke, coming right up.

-And could I get a Moscow mule?
-Rum and Coke for my comrade.

-I'll have a whiskey sour.
-Rum, Coke. Coming right up.

-Could I get a rum and Coke?
-Pepsi okay?

Brian, I've got great news.

-We're going for a ride in the car?
-No, our portfolio's up 30%.

In fact, we're so successful now,

we have to make one of those sappy
investment commercials.

<i>Thanks to my investments,</i>
<i>I've watched my money grow.</i>

<i>And my little girl.</i>

Dad?

Thanks for making my big day possible.

Don't thank me. Thank Fidelity.

Okay, I'm ready to marry you now.

Wait, what? No, I'm your dad.

Yes, you are. This is what's happening.

<i>Fidelity. We're there for you</i>
<i>when your baby marries his dog-dad.</i>

Stewie, why'd you bring me
all the way out here?

Now that we're eccentric rich guys,
we're going to go down 20,000 feet

and pants James Cameron
while he's excavating the<i> Titanic.</i>

(VESSEL WHIRRING)

(CHUCKLES) There he is.
This is gonna be so great.

(SONAR BEEPS)

(VESSEL WHIRRING)

(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Wow, business has really picked up.

I think it's because of the trivia night
Quagmire started.

Here we go, next question.

And remember, no phones, people.
Playing an honest game, no phones.

Okay, "In what country..."
No phones, I'm seeing phones.

"In what country..." No phones.

I've been pretty cool about this so far,
it's a gentlemen's game.

"In what country can you find
the monuments called..."

I see phones. I see...

All right, you know what, that's it.
Trivia night over!

Three cotton-picking weeks
and no one's gotten a single answer wrong.

Everyone's like, "Hey, settle down,
we're not using our phones."

I see you using your damn phones!

Just give me my shift drink!

CLEVELAND: Technically, you got to finish
the game before you get your drink.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

"In which country..."

And, you know, I think some people
may be here because of me.

I spread the word about my sweet playlist.

This is just a bunch of covers
of <i>Life Is A Highway.</i>

Yeah.

Joe... You did a really great job.

Thanks.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)

<i>Life is a highway</i>

<i>I wanna...</i>

(BLEEP) We went to the wrong place.

Hey, guys, I had a great idea.

You know how people love mechanical bulls?
Well, I got something even better!

-(SNORTS)
-A real bull?

If that thing gets mad,
it'll destroy the bar!

Yeah, right. How can it get mad
when I cinched its balls with my belt?

See, it loves it here.
It's even picking out a song.

<i>Life is a highway...</i>

Excellent choice.
You know, not to tell tales out of school,

-but I sucked my first jug to this song.
-(BELLOWING)

<i>-If you're going my way</i>

<i>Gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah</i>

<i>If you are going my way</i>

<i>I wanna drive it all night long</i>

-Edgar, do you know anything about this?
-What? No.

Edgar?

I was at Stanley Kaplan
preparing for the ACT.

-Well, then I am sanguine.
-Huh?

A-ha!

(GROANS)

Guys, wake up.

Oh, man, the bull kicked our asses.
And totally trashed the bar.

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

-What the hell is that?
-Oh, that's my ringtone.

It's from<i> Game of Thrones</i>

when Stannis' daughter
is burned alive at the stake.

No way. It's from when Arya
and that other tiny girl

fight to the death.

-Nah, that scream is from the Red Wedding.
-(SCREAMS CONTINUE)

It's the sound of a mama being stabbed
right in the baby.

Hey, Jerome.

Hey, Peter. I have some bad news.

My mama... (SOBS)

She's dead.

Oh, man, that sucks, Lois.
Your friend is probably just jealous.

Peter.

There's nothing left for me here,
so I'm coming home tomorrow. (SNIFFS)

(COUGHS) That painting's all I got
to remember her by.

You take good care of it, Peter.
It's my prized possession.

<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

What are we gonna do?

Yeah. When Jerome sees that painting,
he's gonna kill us.

Don't worry, guys,
he's got another one over there.

-Peter, that's Bruno Mars.
-"Bruno Mars"? Who's she?

He's a man. And he's not even black.

He's a beautiful, mixed-up
tomorrow person.

What is this place?

This is what you dragged me
out of the house

first thing in the morning for?

Yeah, it's a great company
I found to invest in.

Korean. They make protein shakes.
The profits are off the charts.

Well, why is it in the middle of nowhere?
And why are there no windows?

And why is there
a security guard out front?

All these questions,

this is why I didn't want
to let you have a soda in the car.

It's not 'cause of the soda! God.

Something's going on here.
I'm taking a look.

What are you doing?
It's just a protein shake.

And it's the cheapest on the market.

(DOOR SQUEAKS)

Uh, Brian,
I think I know why it's so cheap.

They're made of dog meat.

Oh, my God, look at
all those poor, sad dogs.

They're all in trouble,
even Rover Dangerfield.

I tell you, I got to
pay more attention, you know?

When the Korean guy said "shake,"
I thought he meant my paw.

Then he said I was gonna be protein.

I said, "Damn right, I'm very pro-teen.
I'm dating a 16-year-old."

Oh, boy, I tell you,
I came in this place a purebred.

Now I'm leaving it a purée.

(GROANS) Oh, no respect,
no respect at all.

Brian, let's get out of here.

What do you mean? I'm taking a meeting.
This company's worth a fortune.

What? You still want to invest in this?

-You can't be serious.
-Sorry, Stewie.

Wall Street is a people-eat-dog world,
everyone knows that.

Oh, my God.
Brian, you've turned into a monster.

Hey! That's offensive
to the monster community.

Yeah, some of us are nice.

Yeah, real nice.

Weren't you charged
with sexually abusing a 16-year-old?

Elmo's accuser recanted

and admitted the relationship
was consensual.

Yeah, but wasn't there another case
that was only thrown out

because the statute of limitations
had expired?

Elmo no comment.

Cookie!

-A-ha! He wants a cookie.
-Oh, I love the Muppets.

I can't believe
you still want to invest in this.

They use dog meat.

How can you condone
the eating of other dogs?

Come on, Stewie, it's their way.
Who are we to judge other cultures?

Look, I'm investing in this company.

And if you're too scared to do it with me,

then maybe I'm working
with the wrong partner.

What are you talking about?

I'm the one who taught you how to invest.
You can't ditch me.

Sorry, Stewie.
When I left you, I was but a learner.

Now I am the master.

-Hee-ya!
-Yeah. No one in<i> Star Wars</i> says "hee-ya."

You know what, Brian, forget it.
We are done. You ruined this.

We were a good team,
like Ricki and the Flash.

-I love you, Ricki.
-I love you, the Flash.

-Stewie, I don't think that's right.
-I didn't see the movie.

Yeah, no, I didn't see it either,
but, yeah,

"the Flash" was the name of her rock band.

Oh, you saw it.

Yeah, I saw it.

So did I.

-This is stupid.
-Come on, guys. We got no choice.

We have to paint that portrait
of Jerome's mother ourselves,

and this is the only class in town.

But aren't these classes
just for lame chicks

who want an excuse to drink together?

(ALL LAUGHING)

-I'm having so much fun.
-Me, too.

This wine is an artist,
and it painted my smile.

I don't think Paul really wants
to marry me. (SOBBING)

I, ah, I'm not sure what we're doing now.

Hi, Brian Griffin.

I have an appointment
to see your CEO about an investment.

Ah, yes, we're waiting for you.

Here, breathe deeply
into this investors' rag.

All right. Now, I'm not sure
if I'm saying this right,

but, "Boo. Cocky."

Can you believe Brian?

Thinking he can fire me
when I'm the one who taught him?

I have had it with him, absolutely had it.

He's just so selfish. He drives me crazy.

I don't know why I put up with it,
I guess...

I guess I just have
a forgiving personality.

But enough about that,
I'm probably starting to bore you.

It's just that whenever
I start talking about Brian,

-I lose all track of time.
-(PHONE VIBRATING)

You would think,
after all these years together,

that I could simply tell myself
enough is enough.

(DOGS BARKING)

<i>You've reached Stewie Griffin.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

-(PHONE BEEPS)
-Hey! Give me that phone.

Stewie, it's Brian, you got to help me.
I'm gonna get...

-(GRUNTS)
-Damn it!

Well, I guess Stewie's my only hope now.

-(DOGS WHINING)
-I can't believe I might die like this.

I always thought I'd go
the way all dogs dream about,

slowly and at great inconvenience
to my owners.

Come on, boy. Here we go. Here we go.
Let's get you to the living room.

(PETER GROANS)

Lois, wrap one of his
"walking to the car" pills

in roast beef and peanut butter.

I'm gonna hold his hips
while he stands confused

in front of the water dish.

Go on, boy. It's right there.

(DOG SNIFFING)

Come on, boy, it's right there.
It's water. You like it.

There you go. You're doing it yourself.

Oh, God.
Jerome's gonna be here any minute,

and then we're totally screwed.

Well, I guess all we can do now
is the honorable thing.

Make realistic puppets of ourselves

to leave in the bar
for Jerome to beat the crap out of.

JEROME: What the hell happened to my bar?
And my painting?

Well, don't just sit there staring at me

with your limp limbs
and your straw-filled plaid shirts.

-(THUDS)
-(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

-Wow, it's working!
-Good plan, Peter.

PETER: Thanks, guys.

Oh, no, I left the real me in there.

He's falling for it, guys.
He thinks I'm me.

(JEROME GRUNTING)

Come on, Stewie, check your damn messages.

(DOG WHINING)

God, that must be where they do the deed.
I hope it's at least peaceful and humane.

CROWD: (SHOUTING) Vick!

Oh, boy.

CROWD: (SHOUTING) And Eli Manning!

Oh, I didn't know that about Eli Manning.

Oh, yeah. I'm a real idiot psychopath.

-(OBJECT CLATTERING)
-What was that?

What the... (SCREAMS)

Good job, Rupert.

Now let's hope we can find Brian
before it's too late.

BRIAN: Hey, don't touch me, I'm rich!

Ugh! He just makes it
so difficult to be on his side.

Come on, there's got to be a way
we can work this out.

Rupert, music!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Life is a highway</i>

I'm so sorry, Stewie.
I guess I just lost my head.

Well, lesson learned, Brian.
Money doesn't buy happiness. This does.

<i>Life is a highway</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

<i>If you're going my way</i>

Stewie, I am so sorry
I became such a jerk.

But I guess I learned my lesson
about the evils of Wall Street.

What're you talking about?
This isn't about Wall Street.

-This is about you.
-Me?

I've been investing in the market forever
and doing just fine.

You did it for one week
and were literally eating your own kind.

This isn't about Wall Street,
I cannot stress that enough.

-Well, money is the root of all evil.
-No, it's not. It's just you.

Hello, others, I am the father.

Where is the mother,

For 60 years, Sunday has meant

And later, to a lesser degree,
<i>The Simpsons.</i>

Premiering in 1952 as a recurring sketch

<i>Family Guy</i> has survived 19 cancellations,

two assassination attempts,

Hup, here come some tourists.

I know, I'll sit here

Good morning, family.

I'll have my regular breakfast
and the newspaper, please.

Okay, here's your highball, a grapefruit,

and our one weird serrated spoon.

-And Raisin Bran?
-(SIGHS)

Yes.

But sorry, there's no newspaper.
Chris quit his paper route.

-What?
-Ah, jobs are for bozos.

Besides, I won't be around to work.

Me and my pals are going to Woodstock
to smoke dope.

No, you are not!

Chris Griffin, you are grounded.

Oh, I hate you!

Now I'll never get to see Sha Na Na!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hello. I just moved in down the block.

My name's Herbert, not Roy Mitchell.

So, if you see news reports
about a Roy Mitchell

from three towns over

who was accused of all sorts of nonsense
and left in a hurry,

it's got nothing to do with me,

because, again, I'm...

...Herbert.

Mom, Dad, Chris is gone!
He went to Woodstock.

Now, Meg, nobody likes a snitch.

I'm not a snitch.
I just tell it like it is.

Damn it, Meg!

Excuse me, Peter,
maybe I should handle this.

-Mr. Brady?
-You know, Meg,

when you tattle on someone,
you're not just telling on them,

you're telling on yourself.

And by tattling on someone,
you're really just telling them,

"I'm a tattletale."

Now, is that the tale you wanna tell?

I never thought of it that way.

Thanks, Mr. Brady.

That's right. Mike Brady.

So, if you see any news reports
about an actor named Robert Reed

from three towns over
who was accused of all sorts of nonsense

and left in a hurry,
it's got nothing to do with me,

because, again, I'm...

...Mike Brady.

Chris went to Woodstock?

I got to get there and bring him back
before something bad happens.

Honey, I'm taking the compact,
save a little on gas.

(ENGINE STARTS)

Cars are bigger back now.

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, no, my dad!

-(CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
-PETER: Chris!

He'll be here in ten minutes.
I got to hide!

-Chris!
-Dad, what are you doing here?

-I'm here to bring you home.
-Well, I'm not going.

I'm staying here and smoking dope.

What? No son of mine
is gonna be smoking dope.

Why not, Dad? Is it any worse
than your three-martini lunch?

What? No son of mine

is gonna be drinking
a three-martini lunch.

Why not, Dad? Is it any worse
than your five-Scotch breakfast?

What? No son of mine

is gonna be drinking
a five-Scotch breakfast.

Why not, Dad? Is it any worse

than your "three X's drawn on the jug"
corn whiskey moonshine?

What? No son of mine
drink anything but rice wine.

That's right, we trace
our early family roots to Asia.

Listen, Chris, your mother and I love you.

We just want you to stay a kid
a little bit longer.

You understand?

Um...

-Yeah.
-I'm glad.

'Cause the thing is, Chris,

drugs turn you into someone you're not.

But you know what?
We love you just how you are.

That's why I'm so grateful
I got here before you dropped acid

or took any kind of drugs that...

You... You're trippin' right now,
aren't you?

-A little.
-All right.

Hey, why is Pete Townshend
taking pictures of you?

He's been doing that all day long.

PETE TOWNSHEND: It's for a book.

I don't think it's for a book.

Okay, I'm off to do my paper route.

Wow, Peter, your plan worked
to show Chris how horrible drugs are.

Quiet, Lois, I'm trying to watch TV.

NEIL ARMSTRONG: <i>That's one small step...</i>

(INAUDIBLE)

Lois, why is my son
playing with a vacuum like a girl?

Here, play with this discus and javelin.

Then you can grow up like a man,

like track and field star Bruce Jenner,

the greatest man in the world.

Maybe you'll even end up
on a box of Wheaties.

Didn't these used to have nuts in 'em?

Chris, I see in the paper
that Vietnam is still going on,

and as a blue-collar TV dad,
I demand you enlist.

Peter, you can't send Chris to Vietnam.

They're bombing women and children.

You have no idea how bad it is over there.

I don't? Oh, I know war, my friend.

I stormed the beaches at Normandy.

(YELLING)

<i>Of course, it was 1958,</i>

<i>so the resistance wasn't quite as stiff.</i>

(LIFEGUARD BLOWING WHISTLE)

No running.

I said no running!

I'm not running!

Chris, you are going to Vietnam
and doing your duty,

like Quagmire did.

As a matter of fact, his tour just ended

and his transport
should be getting in soon.

So let's head down to the airfield

and give our soldiers
the respect they deserve.

Welcome home, Quagmire! (SPITS)

Oh, good to see you back safely, Glenn.
(HAWKS AND SPITS)

-Murderer!
-Hey, show some respect.

Sorry. (SPITS)

Oh, I left my carry-on back on the plane.

All right, when he comes back,
we got to make him feel welcome again.

(ALL HAWKING)

Boy, The Clam sure looks different.

Yeah, just be careful
with your collars on the way in.

They're kind of sharp.

-(COLLAR SLICING)
-(PEOPLE GRUNTING)

Yeah, we'll have a round of beers
for the table.

Yep. We got her, too.

It's good to have you back from the war
in one piece, Quagmire.

Yeah, some of us weren't so lucky.

What are you talking about?
You never went to Vietnam.

Hell I didn't!

I went to the draft board
and told them I was gay,

and then got hit by a bus
on the walk home.

(SOBBING)

So, Quagmire, Chris is shipping out
tomorrow morning,

and he's pretty nervous.

I know you enjoy staring, like,
3,000 feet out into dead space,

but you got any good stories
I could tell him about how cool Nam is?

You know, there's lots of things
you expect in war...

Carnage, the sleepless nights...

But what they don't prepare you for

is the incessant use of <i>Fortunate Son.</i>

<i>(FORTUNATE SON</i> PLAYING)

<i>I'd hear that song</i>
<i>any time I was in a helicopter.</i>

<i>Or taking a swift boat</i>
<i>deep into the jungle,</i>

<i>that song again.</i>

<i>My penis would even play</i> Fortunate Son

<i>while I was visiting a whorehouse.</i>

(SONG PLAYING MUFFLED AND CLEARLY
AT REGULAR INTERVALS)

<i>It ain't me, it ain't me</i>

<i>I ain't no millionaire's son, no</i>

Oh, Lord, that's horrible!

There must have been
some other song you heard.

Yeah, there was.

That "There's something
happening here" song.

Hey, I just realized,
your clothes kind of look like the jungle.

Shut up, Joe! You weren't there!

You don't know!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

You didn't hear the songs I heard!

Oh, my God,
Chris ships out in the morning!

I got to get him out of there.
I thought this war would be fun,

you know, just go over there
and fight the Donkey Kong.

We were trying to fight the war our way,

the way we'd always fought wars,

but we were gradually climbing
steel beams and ladders,

and the Donkey Kong knew that.

It was barrel after barrel.
We lost a lot of good men.

And so many quarters.

(MILITARY DRUM BEAT PLAYING)

Now, listen up! When you hear your name,

I want you to sound off smartly
and move out.

-Capo.
-Yes, sir.

-Sumner.
-Yes, sir.

Griffin.

Chris Griffin!

Yes, sir.

I didn't think this through.

Hey, where you going?
What's the matter with you?

I said put your duffel bag right there!

There was a time, not too long ago,
when people would talk to each other.

Yeah, the bad times, the Sucky Ages.

Our society is doomed.
People and technology are a bad match.

Just like moms and Radiohead.

you could actually do something
positive with your life.

Ah, forget it.

I'm just gonna lie down on the couch

with my head on the armrest
to accentuate how sad I am.

You know, Brian, if I had... Aw!

One day in your body,
I would give it back to you

with a new and improved life.

You know what my response is to that?

A through-the-nose dog exhale.

I realize I've wasted most of
my life being a pathetic jerk.

You know, like you were at Disneyland.

Hey, kid,
can you duck down for this picture?

What? Why?

It's our family photo.
You're getting in the way.

I'm not ducking down, you duck down.
You're getting in my way.

Stop being a brat and duck down.

No way. In fact, I'm standing.

Whoa, what's this?

Brian, I present to you,
my particle interchange transporter.

(POWERS UP)

Wait, wait, wait. So, when you said,
"spend a day" in my body,

-you were being literal?
-That's right, Brian.

This device will allow me
to inhabit your body, and you, mine.

That way, I can fix your life
and then return your body to you!

Now, the instructions
gave me a couple of options.

I chose the one where my voice will be
coming from your body, and vice-versa.

Still, from time to time,

we will have to imitate
the other person's voice

to fool those
who don't know what we've done,

which is everyone.

Stewie, this is ridiculous.

Trust me. What do you have to lose?
Literally nothing.

Fine. But just for the record,
every device you've ever made

has broken at some crucial juncture.

-This one won't.
-All right, you talked me into it.

Okay, here we go.

I'll see you on the other side

of your eyes.

Whoa! (CHUCKLES)

STEWIE: My hand. I mean, your hand.

It's mine. Yes!

BRIAN: Stewie, I think it worked.

We did it! We switched bodies.

Wow, this is really weird.

It feels like... Hey!

What the hell
have you been complaining about?

BRIAN: I can't believe
we actually switched bodies, Stewie.

And God, your head! It's so heavy.

STEWIE: Yeah, you got to have a wide base.
Let the shoulders do more.

All right. All right.
I think I'm getting it.

Okay, I'm off to get you a job,

a girlfriend,
and onto the road less scummy.

So, how exactly are you planning
to get me a job here?

It's very easy.

My research shows
that every seven minutes,

with one of his students.

-That's not even a thing.
-GIRL 2: Yes, it is.

STEWIE: Well, it's a long story,
but I was really hoping

to come home with a job
and a girlfriend today.

I could be your girlfriend,
and give you a job.

Really? This day's starting to look up.

Follow me into the men's room.

Is this dating? Is this how dating works?

(CHUCKLES) You're cute. I like you.

You better pay my wife, bitch.

Go, go, Brian dog legs!

(BARKING)

BRIAN: Hey, how'd it go fixing my life?

STEWIE: Uh, not great.
There's nothing I can do with this body.

Also, I know this is a big inconvenience,

but you and the trash guy
now wave to each other.

Oh, really?

It's once a week, it's not that bad.
He really lit up.

Oh, and you're gonna hate this,
but I gave him the salute,

so, you're a salute guy now.

Well, is he a veteran, at least?

Does it matter?
You're saluting the trash guy now.

All right, let's switch back.

Just a few more seconds,
and we'll be back to normal.

-PETER: Hey, Chris.
-CHRIS: Hey, four eyes.

-PETER: What did you call me?
-CHRIS: Oh, you're deaf, too?

-BRIAN: Stewie? Is that you?

Yes, Brian, it's...
God, that is a tight belt.

How does he live like this?

Ah!

There we go.

If I'm in Chris' body,
he must be in mine.

He's got to be freaking out.

CHRIS: What the hell have you
been complaining about?

Oh, my God, Peter!

Peter? You in there?

PETER: I feel really weird.

What the hell's going on?
What happened to my body?

STEWIE: He's panicking.
We can't let him know what's going on.

BRIAN: Don't worry, I got an idea.

Peter, everything's fine.
Just look in the mirror.

Well, here you go, about to put
you in front of the mirror.

Right now.

PETER: Oh, phew, there I am.

Hi, me!

Okay, everything seems normal.

Now, to do my traditional mirror dance.

<i>There's a place in France</i>

Time for your nap.

PETER: But I'm not tired!
I want to go to The Clam and...

BRIAN: Thank God.

All right, just switch us all back.

STEWIE: Oh, my God,
the machine's been damaged.

It's broken.

Swapping four bodies
must've overloaded its system.

If I can't fix it,
we'll be like this forever.

This is a total disaster,

like when the fat man tried to keep
Michael Shannon from going insane!

A soaring bird. Rain on a metal roof.

Hey, Peter, I'm gonna need you
to fill out your time card.

Yeah, sure,
I'll have it by the end of the day.

It's okay.

We'll hire new people
and start again tomorrow.

Oh, oh.

Wish I could, Glenn.
Sure could go for a Pomtini.

But, unfortunately, I've got to help
my son Chris with his homework.

Well, if you finish early...

They've all switched bodies. Let's go.

That was close.
All right, let's get upstairs and fix...

LOIS: Peter, come in the kitchen,
I need your help.

PETER: What? Huh? I'm watching something.

STEWIE: Oh, God, keep him busy.
I'll make this quick.

Hey, I realized
I can reach the animal crackers,

so, I'm actually gonna be a while.

Here, load these in the car.

Are you going away for a long time?

Oh, darn it. Darn.

Please tell me you didn't forget.

This is the weekend we're going
to Dr. Johann's retreat.

Oh, of course.
Remind me what that is again?

It's the couples sex seminar

where the husband learns
how to give his wife an orgasm.

Wait, are you saying
we have to have sex this weekend?

Yup. All weekend long.

Now, that's what I call a curveball.

(VICTORY MUSIC)

Commercial!

Peter? Everything okay?
You hardly spoke the whole car ride.

STEWIE: Uh, I was simply thunderstruck
at the prospect of intercoursing you.

Darling.

(DIALING)

Brian, you've got to help me.

Lois signed us up for some
perverse, pee-pee-related class

on the female orgasm.

-She's crazed!
-BRIAN: Wow.

You've got to get here
with the machine, so I can fix it.

Right. So I can take your place
in Peter's body.

No! Bring everybody.
We've got to get things back to normal.

And hurry, she's all revved up.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

(WHIMPERING)

BRIAN: Forty-five minutes to Weekapaug.

If we hurry, we can get there
before Stewie's scarred for life.

CHRIS: Brian, it's only 10:30 a.m.

Why does my body crave alcohol?

BRIAN: That's perfectly normal
for this time of day.

CHRIS: I'm sweating and shaking
and planning out lies.

BRIAN: Yeah, why do I have
the overwhelming urge

to eat Cheetos and masturbate
in the woods?

CHRIS: Because it's 10:30 a.m.

I like us learning about each other.

Okay, everyone,
please put your bananas and donuts

back on the table,
we're done with that exercise.

Next, we'll focus on the female genitalia.

STEWIE: Oh, good Lord!

I mean, va-va-voom! Right, other men?

I'm confused as hell,
but I'm enjoying these graham crackers,

so, I'm not gonna say anything.

-(CAR THUDS)
-BRIAN: What the hell was that?

I think that was on purpose.

Oh, you think I forgot about you?

You owe my wife 100 bucks
for a lavatory misunderstanding.

Hey, sugar.

CHRIS: I've never
seen you before in my life.

BRIAN: Yeah, what are you even talking...
Oh, Stewie.

CHRIS: Brian, we got to get out of here.

BRIAN: All right, let's have an
inconsistently smashed windshield chase.

(GASPS)

(POWERS UP)

(SIREN APPROACHING)

BRIAN: Joe, thank God.

We need to get to the Weekapaug Inn, fast.
Can you drive us?

CONSUELA: No, no.

Oh, God,
Joe's swapped bodies with Consuela.

That must mean...

-CHRIS: Everyone's swapped bodies!
-BRIAN: The whole town swapped!

Damn it, I was gonna say "the whole town."

WOMAN'S VOICE: I'm standing here
for some reason,

doing the weather
in a giant black man's body.

What kind of a Friday is this?

-MAN'S VOICE: Freaky!
-WOMAN'S VOICE: Back to you, Tom.

WOMAN'S VOICE: This just in,

all kids report to the blue van
in the park at 3:00 p.m.

for free popsicles!

MAN'S VOICE: What the hell?
Am I doing a Madea?

WOMAN'S VOICE: Oh, Lord, this time,
I'm gonna need a chainsaw.

GLENN: Don't do it.
Don't do what I was gonna do.

-(CHITTERING)
-No! No!

GLENN: You've perverted
something beautiful!

Oh, no!

Oh, yeah!

Is funny 'cause different voices
are coming out of different mouths.

Ha-ha.

Wow, what a seminar.

That Dr. Johann sure knows his stuff.

Get over here.

STEWIE: (GASPS) Gross! I mean, uh...

Freakin' sweet, Lois.

One moment while I Desitin my junk
in the bathroom.

-BRIAN: Stewie?
-Brian, where the hell are you?

Lois just asked me if I want
to see her kid's first apartment.

What does that mean, Brian?
I'm so frightened and confused.

BRIAN: We've got much bigger problems.

We hit a telephone pole,
the machine activated,

and it swapped everybody in town.

-Good God! We've got to fix this.
-(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Peter, I'm gonna open the door
with no hands.

(GAGS)

Listen to me, Brian.
We've got to act quickly.

I'll walk you through the repairs.
First, open the back panel.

Okay, it's open.

All right, now, you got to reverse
the voltage orientation

and amplify the electron flow
to the motherboard.

Stewie, just say it in English
or so help me God,

I will hang up
and make you screw your mom.

Switch the black and yellow wires!

Stewie, I see the wires,

but Chris' pudgy fingers
won't fit inside the panel.

STEWIE: <i>Crap! I do this all the time.</i>
<i>Where's me?</i>

PETER: Hey, who installed this car seat?
It's not even attached.

-(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-One moment, dearest!

Okay, just use his tiny hands
to switch the black and yellow wires.

-Okay, got it.
-PETER: I helped.

STEWIE: <i>Great. Now, we need to find</i>
<i>an energy source powerful enough</i>

<i>to match the electrical surge</i>
<i>that swapped the town in the first place.</i>

<i>According to my GPS, you're 20 feet</i>

<i>from the base</i>
<i>of the Quahog cell phone tower.</i>

BRIAN: Okay, I think I found it.

STEWIE: Now I need you to strap
the body swapper on your back

and climb to the top of the tower.

There's no time to waste.

(BANGING ON DOOR)

(GASPS)

Muncha buncha Fritos!

No!

<i>Brian, hurry!</i>

Stewie, I'm in Chris' body.

I'm dragging 230 pounds of lard
up a ladder.

CHRIS: I'm 215, you liberal dickweed!

Okay, I'm at the top. What now?

STEWIE: <i>Now,</i>
<i>you have to get struck by lightning.</i>

How do I do that?

You're an atheist. Offend God.
Say something you couldn't say on TV.

All right.

Hey, God.

(BLEEPING)

Not me.

(IN INDIAN ACCENT) You can't say that.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Oh, God. No. No!

(STEWIE SCREAMS)

(MOANING)

You didn't listen to a word
Dr. Johann said, did you?

BRIAN: No, I did not.

I mean... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

The movie <i>Road House.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
S16E18.en
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good, old-fashioned values</i>

ALL:<i> On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

ALL:<i> He's a family guy!</i>

-You guys know what this meeting's about?
-No idea.

How about you, Morning Breath Mike?

I have no idea.

Listen up, everyone.

Sales are down across the board,

but mostly we're failing to connect

with a group called "millennials."

I saw this guy cry one time.

To learn more
about our target demographic,

we're all gonna watch
this instructional video.

ANNOUNCER 1: <i>News on the March.</i>

<i>Millennials. Who are they?</i>
<i>What do they want?</i>

<i>A millennial can be defined</i>

<i>as anyone born between 1982 and 2000.</i>

<i>Or anyone who thinks loving</i>
<i>sriracha or Austin, Texas...</i>

<i>...counts as a personality.</i>

<i>Millennials crave things like,</i>

<i>instant gratification,</i>

<i>authentic experiences,</i>

<i>and, for some reason</i>
<i>we haven't figured out yet,</i>

<i>improv comedy.</i>

<i>Here's one millennial who has a parakeet</i>

<i>with nine-million followers on Snapchat.</i>

<i>Here's another who single-handedly</i>
<i>started the hashtags</i>

<i>that canceled 12 network TV shows</i>

<i>she found offensive.</i>

<i>And now I'm told she identifies as a man,</i>

<i>so I'm being fired.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Hello.</i>
<i>I'm your new announcer.</i>

<i>And actually, he was just about done.</i>

<i>Thank you and good day.</i>

So please welcome someone
who's gonna help us reach millennials,

our new head of social media, Hammer.

(MULTIPLE DEVICES BEEP)

Oh, he just group-texted us, "Hello."

-(PHONE BEEPS)
-And now here comes a text

from the guy who doesn't know
this is a group text.

"Nice to meet you, Hammer.
Let's have lunch later,

"and I'll tell you who's gay."

Right on. 'Sup? I'm Hammer.

Uh, first, I'd like to not thank you
for hiring me,

because I just expect
good things to happen to me

without working for them.

Second, I'd like to give you all
a list of my trigger warnings.

What's a trigger warning?

Actually, brah, asking me
what a trigger warning is

is one of my triggers, brah.

I feel traumatized, brah.

And now I'm tweeting about you, brah.

And now you're trending, brah.

And now your life is ruined, brah.

And now you're fired, brah.

What... What happened to Brah?

Also, the lack of diversity here
is horrifying, brah.

Uh, Brah is gone.

Now, if we wanna get
some social media attention,

we got to start with a group selfie.

Um, excuse me. Didn't Ellen do this,
like, three years ago?

Hey, does Taye Diggs
follow you on Twitter?

No, but Kraft Singles does.

That's what I thought.

And posted.

Do you know what I just did?
I just made you all viral.

Also, my band is playing tonight
at an inconvenient time.

It's six un-showered guys
and a pale woman with a ukulele

shouting "Hey!" in unison.

Because that's what music is now.

Hey!

Hey!

What is this? They just keep saying "Hey."

I know. It's my favorite song.

Oh, 'cause "hay" is for horses.

Hey, guys. You wanna have a smoke break?

What? We can't smoke inside.

It's not smoking, Peter. It's vaping.

Everyone's doing it. Even Darth Vaper.

I find your lack of vape disturbing.

Come on, Peter, give it a shot.

What happened?

All of a sudden I feel like
I know better than everyone else!

That's because anytime someone
walks through a cloud of vape smoke,

a millennial is born.

I think I feel it!

<i>Broad City</i> is so funny.

No,<i> Broad City</i> is genius.

No, no. <i>Broad City</i> is everything!

There it is.

Grossly exaggerating
the quality of a just-okay TV show.

Peter, you're officially a millennial.

Hey, you want a ride
in the<i> Millennial Falcon?</i>

Ah! Look at that. We found another one!

Peter, a rite of passage
for any millennial

is attending Coachella.

It's a great place to see bands

that are either really new or really old.

-Which one should we see?
-Well, on the main stage,

it's Tame Impala that formed
in an UberPool on the way here.

And on the side stage,

it's Neil Young asleep
in front of the television.

-(SNORING)
-(ALL CHEERING)

I always get him confused
with <i>Bloom County's</i> Bill the Cat.

Peter, you're doing great as a millennial.

Next thing is you got to learn
how to be on fleek.

"On fleek"?

People still say "on fleek"?

No, Peter, that's not what I meant.

I want you on Fleek.

This is Fleek.

Aw! Can I ride him?

Sure, Peter. Get on Fleek.

Yay!

Our country's involved
in six different wars,

but millennials think about this stuff.

Remember, Peter, never walk anywhere

when you can ride something weird instead.

What's that?

Sorry, I was taking a selfie
while shooting a Snapchat

while Periscoping that Snapchat

while Instagramming latte art
while Shazaming The Weeknd

while streaming<i> Master of None</i>
while retweeting George Takei

while saying, "This wins the Internet!"

while still being hashtag so bored.

Hammer?

Hammer?

Come on, man, don't make me
look up from my phone.

Oh, you're texting me.

Oh, no! Hammer!

You! Call 911!

You! Give me your shirt
to make a tourniquet!

You! Snap a pic.
Clarendon filter. Clarendon!

Hammer, stay with me, buddy.

Peter, if I die,

chop my body up
and serve me as street tacos.

So selfless.

No! I won't let you be made into tacos!

Peter, it's too late.

Listen, I've got this idea for a business,

and I want you to have it.

It's artisanal.

Artisanal...

Artisanal what? Is it pretzels?

Is it artisanal pretzels?

Has that been done?

Does anyone know
if artisanal pretzels is a thing?

It seems so obvious,
yet I don't think I've ever seen them.

I better do millennial CPR.

One... Ugh, whatever...

Two... Ugh, whatever...

Three... Ugh, I'm gonna let my parents
take care of this.

I've never been to a millennial funeral.

Yeah, it seems in poor taste
that they hired Keyboard Cat.

(PLAYING CHIRPY MUSIC)

Assembled congregants,

no worries to you.

And also to you.

Let us tweet.

Peter, why is he naked in there?

It's an environmental statement.

Lois, please stop looking
at my dead friend's dong.

Listen, I made breakfast and drove,

so if there's a dead dong,
I'm gonna look at it!

We've all lost a great
friend-slash-barista-

slash-deejay-

slash-Genius Bar employee-

slash-person with a yellow highlighter
at the Best Buy exit.

And now a reading
from the book of <i>Just Jared.</i>

"Death be the ultimate fail."

Peter, I hate to do this here,

but you were good friends with Hammer,

and business at the brewery must go on.

That's why, as of today,

I'm making you head of social media.

Hey, whatever you want. I'm a team player.

I was even one of the 300.

Hey, does 299 work?

'Cause I got to go diarrhea off the cliff.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to Marvel's</i> The Offenders.

<i>Good morning, you see.</i>

I gathered you all together, Kevin Spacey,

Roman Polanski...

Hey, hey, hey...

Woody Allen, Steven Seagal,

Matt Lauer with the pudding pop,

Brett Ratner,

and you, lesser-known offender
James Toback.

Don't forget me!

Harvey shower!

(STAMMERS) Is Matt Damon coming?

No, but he knows about all of us.

He's very aware of what's
going on here, you see.

All right, guys, I got to come up
with some social media ideas

for the brewery. What do ya got?

Oh, you want viral?
You asked the right guy.

You remember Leeroy Jenkins?

-Yeah.
-Right.

-What do you mean, "right"?
-You know, Leeroy Jenkins.

-What about him?
-Do that.

Joe, you can't... That already happened.

Do it again. This time with beer.

Hang on a sec.

-Thank you.
-How about some fruit in the beer?

No, guys, we need
social media-specific plans

to reach a younger audience.

JOE: You remember "Charlie Bit My Finger"?

Do that.

You know what? I give up.
We've given this,

what, almost a minute?

Peter, that's the problem with kids today.

They have no attention span.

Wait. That's it!

We'll do a show for people
with no attention span.

We'll call it <i>"The Six-Second Talk Show."</i>

Well, I guess that could work.
But it's just so sad

that young people can't pay attention
to something longer than six sec...

Oh!

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

ALL: Whoa!

What the hell, you guys? I was talking.

You know, there's more to life
than just what's on your phone.

-Wrong, idiot.
-(BEEPING)

Anyone know how to turn these things off?

All right, <i>Six-Second Talk Show</i>
in three, two...

<i>I'm Peter Griffin,</i>
<i>and this is </i>The Six-Second Talk Show.

<i>My guest tonight is Joe Biden.</i>

<i>And that's all the time we have.</i>
<i>Thanks for watching. Good night.</i>

-How was that?
-It kind of dragged.

<i>Well, Congress is at it again. Good night.</i>

<i>It's </i>The Six Second Talk Show,

<i>and now, your host, here...</i>

Welcome to <i>The Six-Second Talk Show.</i>

<i>I'm Peter Griffin, and now</i>
<i>our musical guest</i><i>Barenaked Ladies.</i>

<i>It's been...</i>

I'd like to thank our musical guest,
Barenaked Ladies. Good night.

Peter, I can't believe your talk show
is such a huge hit for the brewery.

And thanks to that,
I'm now a huge social media star.

Oh, my God, what the hell is that?

<i>Hello, Griffin family.</i>

<i>I'm coming to you live,</i>
<i>via Living Room Hologram.</i>

<i>I'm Parker Stanton, CEO of Boop,</i>

<i>the most powerful company</i>
<i>in Silicon Valley.</i>

-Do you know Mr. Skin?
-Do you know Mr. Skin?

BOTH: Ha!

-We'll talk later.
-We'll talk later.

<i>Look, Peter, the reason I'm here</i>

<i>is because of your </i>Six-Second Talk Show.

<i>Now, I haven't had the time to watch it,</i>

<i>but I hear it's the buzz</i>
<i>of Silicon Valley.</i>

<i>I want you and your family</i>
<i>to visit us here as my guests,</i>

<i>so I can find out</i>
<i>what the next big thing is.</i>

Oh, I got lots of ideas.

I've been working on something
called "Look At It, Kick It."

PETER: <i>Look at it...</i>

FATHER: <i>Excuse me, can I help you?</i>

<i>-Kick it!</i>
<i>-</i>GIRL: <i>Ow!</i>

<i>Pure genius!</i>

<i>See you in Silicon Valley.</i>

Oh, this is exciting.

A family trip.

Yeah, I love traveling.

Except that trip to Europe
where we spent most of our time

trying to refold our map.

All right, the museum is that way,

so let's fold the map and go.

Okay, couple more folds...

Nope, okay, wrong end. Now, let's see...

Nope, nope, that's wrong.

Find the corners.

It's not a puzzle, Chris.

You got to fold on the creases.

I'd be able to find the creases

if somebody had folded it
correctly last time.

I did fold it correctly.

Nope, you didn't. And then
you jammed it into a backpack

and now I'm in this mess.

Don't blame me, you ripped it up

when you were tearing through
the backpack for your snacks.

Okay, this is why I wanted
to bring a globe, all right?

You don't have to fold a globe.

Who the hell would bring
a globe on vacation?

See, Bon? We're eating food,

and they're tearing each other apart.

Where to next,<i> mon chéri?</i>

Welcome to Boop.

As our name suggests,
our mainframe connects to

and powers virtually
every server on the globe.

Without Boop, there is no Internet.

Hey, Parker.

Are we still on for the Samsung
Galaxy Note meeting after lunch?

Yep. Are the test results in?

Yeah, but...
Let's save it for the meeting.

Where's your nearest bathroom?

Gender-fluid?

Yes, there will be a lot of that.

Hmm, must be one of them
high-tech Japanese toilets.

<i>I'm gonna pee into electric urinal</i>

<i>And make the sparks go higher</i>

I'm having so much fun.

(POWERS DOWN)

What the hell is going on?

Our mainframe is having a meltdown!

-Hang on, let me flush.
-(ALARM BLARING)

You idiot.

You shut down the entire Internet!

How could you do that?

This is the most irresponsible thing
that I've ever...

PARKER: <i>Although</i>
<i>I was incensed by this man,</i>

<i>I had to admire his courage</i>
<i>for leaving his penis out</i>

<i>the entire time I was yelling at him.</i>

<i>As a man who struggles</i>
<i>with body dysmorphia,</i>

<i>I couldn't help but be impressed</i>
<i>by that kind of self-confidence.</i>

PETER: <i>As I stood there,</i>
<i>being berated by this man,</i>

<i>I couldn't help but notice</i>
<i>his searching gaze.</i>

<i>Years later, we would bump into each other</i>

<i>at a small cafe in Rome</i>
<i>and reminisce about this moment.</i>

<i>And later still, recreate it</i>
<i>in a small bed-and-breakfast</i>

<i>at the bottom of the Spanish Steps.</i>

<i>But that's a story for another time.</i>

<i>Or, as they say in Italian,</i> molto homo.

(GRUNTS)

Peter, you've done some stupid things,

but crashing the Internet
has to be the dumbest yet.

Look at the chaos you've caused.

(SCREAMING, CLAMORING)

I have no idea
how to drive without texting.

(SCREAMING)

Why can't I post this video?

-Hello.
-What did you say?

Why aren't you looking
at your phone, you psycho?

Why is no one liking my posts?

Well, I hate all your posts!

-Hello.
-(SCREAMS)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

Hello.

Peter, Lois is right.
This mess is all your fault.

Settle down, Brian.

I'm sure life will be just fine
without the Internet.

Maybe we can even go see
that Amish comedian.

-Sir, where are you from?
-MAN 1 IN AUDIENCE: Chicago.

I have never been to Chicago.

-How about you, sir?
-MAN 2 IN AUDIENCE: Boston!

I have never been to Boston.

Anyone here from the back fields
of Pennsylvania, Ohio

-or upstate New York?
--MAN 3 IN AUDIENCE: No!

Then I have been Jebediah, son of Abner.

How are we gonna get back to the airport?

There's no Internet,
which means there's no GPS,

which means we can't use Uber.

Okay, I have a crazy idea.

Let's get a cab. There's a taxi stand.

Dead.

Dead...

Dead.

Barely alive. To the airport.

Now, because you can't stare
at your phone anymore,

enjoy a disturbingly loud clip
of Jimmy Fallon on cab TV.

<i>Tonight, get ready to lose</i>
<i>all respect for Al Pacino</i>

<i>when I force him to play a game</i>
<i>meant for children!</i>

This. This is why Uber.

No Netflix, no Hulu, no Amazon...

I'm so bored.

Come on, Meg, you're overreacting.

We still got network TV.

<i>We now return to </i>Kevin Can Wait<i> on CBS.</i>

Well, that's not gonna work.

Okay, everybody, don't panic.

We'll just do what people did
before the Internet.

We can play charades.

Oh, you mean like your marriage?

Chris, I told you that in confidence.

Dad, you got to do something.

Nobody can live without the Internet.

Ah, you're right. This sucks.

It's even worse than when I was roommates
with Oscar Pistorius.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-Somebody's in here.

-(GUN FIRING)
-Somebody's in here!

I'm the one who screwed this up.

I'll be the one to fix it.

I'll be the Internet.

What are you talking about?

We can do all the things
we loved about the Internet.

We just got to do it without technology.

From now on,
if you want to tweet something,

you do it the old-fashioned way.

Write it on a piece of paper,

staple it to a bird,
and throw it out the door.

(SQUAWKS)

Hey, do you follow Peter Griffin
on Twitter?

No. Why? Is he funny?

No, he just throws dead birds
on his lawn. It's awesome.

Great news, Chris.

I figured out how to recreate
the best part of the Internet.

I've got pictures of five celebrities

who you'd never believe used to be fat.

-Great, let's see 'em.
-Sure, buddy.

But first you have to watch
this unwelcome pop-up ad.

I don't want probiotics.

PETER: Then press the "skip ad" button.

Why should I do all this work?

PETER: They're really
good pictures, Chris.

Number three will shock you.

Okay, I'll press it.

PETER: Oh, no!
You pressed in the wrong place,

and now you're being sent
to the ad's website,

which also has additional pop-ups.

This is a nightmare!

Just tell me one of 'em.

PETER: Kenan Thompson.

That's not a surprise!

Peter? What are you doing?

Oh, I'm your Waze app today.

-You on your way to work?
-Yeah, I am.

All right, you will be there
in six minutes.

Just start heading straight.

Okay, sounds good.

-So, how's everything at...
-Take a right! Right now!

Jeez, okay, calm down.

Left! Take a left immediately!

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

PETER: Would you like to upgrade
to an ad-free experience for $4.99?

-GLENN: No.
-PETER: Try new Domino's Pizza.

Hey, Peter, who are these guys?

This is just my looping GIF

of black teens
reacting to a very mild burn.

Ah, sounds kind of pointless.

Oh, you mean like your feet?

-Oh!
-Yeah!

All right, trying to be
the Internet is impossible.

I wish I never peed on that server.

You know, when my phone gets wet,
I just put it in a bag of rice.

Shut up, Meg. That's dumb.

I've done that before. It works.

(GASPS) Chris, that's brilliant.

We just need a big bag and a lot of rice.

You sure that's gonna work?

Eh, worth a shot.

We'll just have to roll up our sleeves
and do the best we can,

like the men who built New York City.

Men, creating an entire
subway system out of nothing

is grueling, thankless,
life-threatening work.

But just remember, we're doing this

so that one day,
future commuters can be hassled

by panhandlers and amateur break-dancers.

What about public masturbators?

Especially public masturbators.

Now, let's go die underground!

(ALL CHEERING)

Look, we're getting a signal.

I think we fixed the Internet.
Something's coming through.

It looks like an ad.

"Smithwick's Artisanal Pretzels."

Son of a bitch!

Well, I'm glad you got the Internet...

Hold on.

I'm sorry, what were you saying?

Yeah, sounds good.

-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
-And send.

Take that, Delta Air Lines.

Submitted for your approval,

a restaurant full of people
so distracted by their phones,

they're unaware that
they're all about to go up in smoke,

just like the Fox Tuesday night lineup.

-Yeah!
-Oh!

Well, Mr. Griffin,
there's no easy way to put this,

so I'm just gonna

-He's black.
-Not that friend. Quagmire.

Oh, him. Well, Mr. Quagmire,
you've had quite the nasty shark attack.

Luckily, you'll be okay.

But you're going to have
to learn to live without a penis.

Or will you?

Oh! What's this?

Is it your penis?

Nah, I'm just foolin'.

I play that with my penis-less patients
to lighten the mood.

Liev Schreiber gets a big kick out of it.

Doc, do you know who you're talking to?

-That penis was my whole life!
-It's not so bad.

At least you're not this pathetic guy

Come on, now.
Keep that enormous chin up, Glenn.

There's lots you can do.

You could devote your life to Christ,
or become a eunuch.

Cleveland, why don't you sit this one out?

Listen, Quagmire, I got just the way

for you to embrace
your new life without a penis.

I've had this computer blocked

so you can discover
all the other exciting things

-on the Internet besides porn.
-Like what?

Well, uh, there's... Uh...

I like to research birds.
Try to learn a bird a day.

-Well, not that necessarily, but, uh...
-You got your robin.

Wow, you really know your stuff, Joe.

-Your swallow.
-"Swallow"?

Uh, actually this is what
we're trying to avoid.

-You got your titmouse.
-Damn it, Joe, stop with the sex birds!

Look, I appreciate what you're trying
to do, guys, but this is a disaster.

You don't understand
what that penis meant to me.

We did everything together.
Absolutely everything.

"As she tenderly unlaced
her silken corset,

"Jennifer shuddered in anticipation of...

"the sensual night ahead."

This is not good.

As soon as I'm back in Quahog,
the mob is gonna kill me!

I don't care.
We're getting the hell out of Florida.

Florida. Which, interesting trivia,
was the name of the mom in <i>Good Times</i>

-played by David Ortiz.

Here's a suggestion.
Blow your (BLEEP) brains out

Is this... Is this real?

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Come on, Edgar.

I got a lot to live for

that would be best.

Yes, you'll be out of your misery.

Quagmire, have you lost your mind?

I'm holding this gun

<i>There's more than one bullet in here, Joe.</i>

you should hold this, Peter.

<i>you could get free tacos with me.</i>

It worked!

Quagmire, why the hell
would you want to kill yourself?

Yeah, who ever heard
of a depressed ventriloquist?

You want to know why?
Because I can't do this anymore.

My life is over.

I tried to adjust, but it's impossible.

Come on, Quagmire, it's not impossible.

You want impossible,
try eating local pizza

with a guy from New York.

You call this pizza?

We do here, yes.

All right, Brian, I negotiated to get Mort

-back from the mob.
-How?

I told them Mort gave us his flash drive

with enough evidence
to put them all in jail.

We're going to trade it for Mort
and collect our money.

And I also ordered an extra slice of pie.

Because you know

-Thank you, Cleveland.
-CLEVELAND: Have a blessed day!

Believe me, Glenn, I know
what you're going through.

No, you don't.

You had yours
surgically removed in a hospital.

I had mine bitten off by a shark!

I'm not allowed to go
into the ocean anymore.

The doctor says
I can't get seawater in it.

I also have Crohn's disease.

-They're unrelated.
-Why are you here, Dad?

I knew you were down in the dumps,
so I brought you something

-to cheer you up.
-A Yeti cooler?

-That is kind of rad.
-No, that's mine.

Your gift is inside.

Is that your...

Yes, Glenn. It's my penis.

After my surgery, I kept it in my freezer.

Next to a snowball from the winter,
if you can believe that.

I want you to have it.

I...

I can't take your penis, Dad.

Please, take it.

If you don't, I'm just gonna
give it to Paul Ryan.

I don't know what to say.

Thank you.

Weird.

Proud of you guys, but weird.

Okay, has everyone washed their hands?

Me neither, but going forward, let's try.

I'm so nervous for Quagmire.

I know, but it's nice that they
served hot dogs for the surgery.

There it is! Give me that!

Nurse, you put it on there. I'm not gay.

The operation was a success.

-Congratulations, Quagmire!
-Thanks, guys.

And, Dad, I don't know how to thank you.

You've given me the greatest gift
I could ever ask for.

-I love you, son.
-I love you, too.

-So, will it work, Dr. Hartman?
-Oh, yes.

I'm not sure about urination
or sex, but otherwise, yes.

So, how you feeling?

I'm actually in extreme pain, Doc.

It's like knives
are stabbing into my crotch.

Don't worry, that'll go away once you fill
your prescription at Goldman's Pharmacy.

-Mort's is closed.
-Oh. Oh, yeah.

Cool tie-in with the other story, though.

I'm trying to get more involved
in the writing this season.

In fact, I think <i>Family Guy</i>
should be more of a dramedy.

-What's a dramedy?
-Well, for one thing,

the scenes don't have to end with jokes.

-You got the flash drive?
-Yep.

All the information
that could put you away forever.

Now, again, I don't know why
we couldn't have done this by Dropbox.

I mean, I don't mind coming here
to a parking lot,

I had to get Mort anyway,
but Dropbox would've saved you time.

And you wouldn't have
to mail me back my flash drive.

-What do you mean, mail it back?
-You were planning to keep it?

It's 64 gigs! I bought the coverage.
You're not getting the coverage.

Hi, guys. I'm a pharmacist.

Ugh, Mort is so hard to write for.

Okay, give us Mort.

My mailing address is in the flash drive.

-(SIRENS BLARING)
-FBI! Freeze!

What the hell is this?

Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Goldman.

Wait a minute.
You were working with the Feds?

Absolutely.

When I heard there was a reward,
I immediately turned myself in.

So you guys get bupkis.

I'm a pharmacist.

Well, Brian, we may not
have gotten the $10,000...

<i>to hear no more Jewish talk</i>

<i>"for a long while.</i>

"Brian and Stewie laugh.

"The end."

Ah, that was a good day's work.

I've earned this.

Little shot
of the ol' Sorkin genius juice.

So, Quagmire,
how's the new rod holding up?

Yeah, you know. Good, pretty good.

I've been having a lot of sex. Um...

My dad didn't mention
there's a four-inch mole on the left side.

-What?
-Uh, huh,

it's, like, the size of a 50-cent piece
and a dime kissing each other.

Yikes. Frightening.

Yeah, some gals find it off-putting.

I try to tell them
it's my dad's old penis, but that, um...

That just tends to make it worse.

But the girls that stay are just great.

Well, I'm happy for you, Quagmire.

Don't be. Anyway, I got to take a leak.

Well, I'm just glad our friend's

-back to his old self.
-(QUAGMIRE SCREAMING)

Yeah, seems he hasn't missed a beat.

It's great that we can be there
for each other in trying times.

-What's that noise?
-(QUAGMIRE SCREAMING)

That's the sound of peeing out
your daddy's wiener.

that weren't so hard to sing as a group.

<i>Six o'clock, TV hour</i>
<i>Don't get caught in foreign tower</i>

<i>Slash and burn, return</i>
<i>Listen to yourself churn</i>

<i>Lock him in uniform</i>

<i>Birthday party, cheesecake,</i>

-How was it?
-Terrible.

MAN: (ON TV) <i>We now return</i>
<i>to a 1980s movie</i><i>you remember fondly,</i>

<i>but now feels excruciatingly slow.</i>

All right, <i>Stripes!</i>
This was hilarious.

All right, Bill Murray's driving a cab.

(CAR HONKS ON TV)

Still driving a cab.

Shot of the town.

Going over a bridge.

Traffic's neither heavy nor light.
Get in the army!

I hope you don't plan
on just lying on the couch

and watching TV all weekend.

That's exactly what I plan to do.

It's a free premium-channel
preview weekend.

Even Cinemax.

One of the shows is actually
two boobs fighting.

Sadly, there's still no penetration.

Well, just expect me to do

a lot of sour-faced,
arms-folded head-shaking.

(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)

Well, in return,

you'll get a lot of
beaten-down-husband eye-rolls.

(SIGHS)

(BOTH SIGHING)

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

One of the neighbors called about
a passive-aggressive domestic dispute.

Oh, is that <i>Stripes?</i>

Ah, he's not in the army yet.

Peter, this is ridiculous.
You've been lying here all weekend.

I'm not bringing you any more food.

I don't need you to.

I got a $1,000 credit from Uber Eats,
'cause that driver pinched my bottom.

Okay, well, if you don't get up,
I won't have sex with you.

And that will be different how?

And I'm still married to you because?

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

Guys, second time this week.

Peter, you got to come outside.

We found a used condom on the sidewalk.

That's a bigger deal than regular garbage.

Ribbed. A woman was pleased with it.

You got to see this, Peter.
A used condom. Just right out here.

And there's panties nearby.
Joe, you're a cop.

-What do you think happened here?
-I'll tell you what happened.

Somebody did it. Yeah!

Peter, come out here and high-five us
over the sex someone else had.

Someone had sex?

I got to touch another guy's hand
to celebrate.

(GASPS)

(GRUNTING)

(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

(INVIGORATING MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUFFLED) Oh, now he gets to the army.

Hmm. I've seen this before.

It's from Ethan Allen,
if I'm not mistaken.

-Am I gonna be okay?
-You'll be fine.

Here's a video to help you understand.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Hi, I'm Oliver Platt, and I'm</i>
<i>currently fused to this chair.</i>

<i>But how does it happen?</i>

<i>When a fat guy's sweaty skin</i>
<i>presses against couch fabric</i>

<i>for an extended period of time,</i>

<i>the fabric fibers</i>
<i>fuse together with the skin.</i>

<i>The longer you stay sedentary,</i>
<i>the stronger the bond.</i>

My advice, relax.
It's not the end of the world.

Being fused to furniture hasn't stopped me

from being an adult with a child's name.

And having thicker hair than a werewolf.

The procedure is called
"Rip You Off Real Fast."

Very painful. Ready?

Actually, I've decided
to keep the couch on me.

-Really? Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah. This is nothing.

I've been
in uncomfortable situations before.

Like, whenever I meet famous people.

Hey, what's up?
I'm Snoop Dogg, know what I'm sayin'?

I do.

(THINKING)<i> But you don't, Peter.</i>
<i>You don't.</i>

(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) How is it? Is it good?

Uh, it's a little tight.

A little tight in the couch?

Yeah, it's a little tight in the couch.

Hey, what's it like going through life
holding needles in your lips?

It's not easy.

Sometimes, the needles, they poke my lips,
and I say, <i>"mamma mia!"</i>

Well, you still got
James Brolin coming in here,

autographing your photos.
That's kind of cool.

You want to know something, Peter?
He no come in here.

I take the photo from the dry cleaners'.

<i>Mamma mia, </i>what a day.

And now to say good night
to all my celebrity pictures on the wall.

<i>Buonanotte, </i>Christopher Plummer.

Sleep with the angels, Sherman Hemsley.

See you when the sun shines, Ken Ober.

And now, to say good night
to my favorite celebrity,

James Bro... <i>Mamma mia!</i>

Who steal my James Brolin?

I took that photo from the bakery.

Pasta fazool,
what a good day in the bakery.

You take good care of the place
while I'm gone, William Katt.

That goes double for you, James Bro...
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

Uh, hey, Mom?

Was I always able to see
the living room from the kitchen?

(SIGHS) I've had enough of this.

That stupid couch is messing up our house.

If Peter won't let Dr. Hartman remove it,

we're doing it ourselves.

I put an Ambien in his beer,
so he's out cold.

I saw you put Ambien in your beer, too.

Every adult has to take Ambien every night

to even have a prayer at sleep.

(SNORING)

All right, kids.

We're gonna use these scissors
to separate your father from the couch.

I can't tell skin from couch.

Well, err on the skin side.
I love this couch.

It's from Ethan Allen, you know.

(SCISSORS CLICKING)

Wha... W-W-What's going on?

Peter, enough is enough.
That couch is coming off.

We're sick of your shenanigans.

(GRUNTS) How dare you?

I work my ass off to bring home
the bacon for this family,

and all you can say is,

"We don't want bacon,
we want actual money!"

Well, I don't have money.
I spent it all on bacon!

Peter, put yourself in our shoes.

I can't. My feet swelled up
too much from all the bacon.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I'm going to sleep
on the couch on the couch.

(GRUNTS)

-(DOOR CREAKING)
-(GRUNTING)

Chris, give me a hand with this.

All right, are you ready?

All right, one, two, three.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

-Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy.
-Okay, all right. All right.

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
-What? What? What?

-No, no, no, no. Twist it.
-What? I am.

Just look down, all right?
Just look at me.

All right, see the way I'm twistin' it?

-Okay.
-Okay. No, no! No.

You know what?
All right, just put it down.

-Put it down. Just drop it, drop it.
-All right.

All right.
Let's just hang on and figure this out.

A-Al, all right, okay.

All right. Okay.
I know what we're gonna do.

Okay. All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

We're gonna take the cushions off,
unscrew the legs, take the mattress out,

and this whole thing's will be simpler.

It's easier than we're making it.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

This isn't working.
You know what? Just give me a push.

-(SCREAMING)
-(CRASHES)

I have some bad news.

Ethan survived, but Allen didn't make it.

-What about Peter?
-Oh, him.

He's in what we call a "comma."

Now, where's his chart?

Ah, here it is. "Griffin coma Peter."

Will he ever recover?

How long is he gonna be like this?

(ECHOING) Please tell me
he's gonna be okay.

Oh, God.

(MAN CLEARING THROAT)

-God?
-Yes.

-And no Trump questions.
-Okay.

I have nothing else to ask you.

I can't believe I'm stuck
in an elevator with God.

Although, I guess you are everywhere,
and in all places.

No, you're thinking of Kevin Hart.

(LAUGHING) I know, right?
In every movie.

-Him and The Rock.
-Oh, I love The Rock.

No, no, no, I love The Rock, too.
He's just, he's just in a lot of stuff.

You know, his real name is Dwayne Johnson.

Yeah, I know.
We have <i>Us Weekly</i> on Earth, too.

Wait. Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be up in heaven?

There was an issue.
A few angels came forward.

I don't remember things
exactly as they do,

but I respect their experience.

How did I get here?

Well, you had a couch
attached to your back,

and you fell down the stairs
and hit your head pretty hard.

Am I in a <i>Leftovers?</i>

Is this a <i>Leftovers?</i>

I don't know what that is.

It was an HBO show
starring a bottle of hair dye.

Man, this thing is really stuck.

Hey, can you use
your God powers to get us out?

No, they don't really work in elevators.

Kind of like a cell phone.
I don't have a signal.

I have a cell phone. It's silver.

That's rad, Peter.

I always dreamed of being stuck
in an elevator with Tom Brady.

That makes two of us.

Can I ask you my Tom Brady questions?

I wouldn't deign to speak for Tom Brady.

Understood, understood.

-Hey, do atheists go to hell?
-No.

How about people who say
they are not religious,

but they are spiritual?

Straight to hell,
to the boiler room of hell.

All the way down.

Sometimes, I pull them out just so they
think everything is gonna be okay,

but then I put them right back in.

Good, good.
That makes me happy.

Um... God, here's something
you might be able to tell me.

Will Taylor Swift and Katy Perry
ever reconcile their differences?

What are you looking for?

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm looking for the gay guy
who can answer that one.

Some people say we're just
a computer simulation

run by a higher species.

-Is that true?
-It is.

(BEEPING)

My guy sucks.
Want to trade guys for a little while?

Oh. Never mind.

I'll stick with this pile of crap
I already have.

All right, can you name
every <i>SNL</i> actor alphabetically?

-Alphabetically by last name?
-Yes.

-No featured players?
-Yeah, okay.

Fred Armisen, Dan Aykroyd,
Morwenna Banks, Vanessa Bayer...

Jon Lovitz, Norm MacDonald,
Gail Matthius...

Gail Matthius, good pull.

Michael McKean, Mark McKinney...

Nancy Walls, Kristen Wiig
and Sasheer Zamata.

Wow. Now do <i>Kids in the Hall.</i>

That was five guys, Peter.

-Name 'em.
-I can't.

-Does reincarnation exist?
-It does.

As past human lives or as animals?

-Both.
-Who have I been?

-You were Henry VIII...
-Wow!

Let me finish.

You were Henry, the eighth guy to have sex
with Rock Hudson

-at one of his pool parties.
-Aw.

How many more shows
is John Stamos gonna get?

-Zero.
-Good. That's... That's good.

Are you real?

Do you think I'm real, Peter?

I like to believe there's
something bigger than me out there

keeping a watch out.

Different people think different things.

I'm kind of like a nanny cam.

The idea that I may exist is enough
for some people to behave better.

When I used to ask my mom
what God was, she would say,

"God is love." I always liked that.

That's nice, Peter.

God and love are very similar concepts.

-They come from the same place.
-Tatooine?

(LAUGHS) I always forget
you're such a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

Man, when are they
gonna fix this elevator?

It's not broken. I just haven't
decided where it's going yet.

(GASPS)

What's a "mezzanine"?

-It's like a loge.
-What's a "loge"?

Oh, hey, what's with all the questions?

Yeah, you don't know either.

Wha... Wait, hold on.

-Am I... Am I dead?
-Yes.

Oh, my God!

Since you're now a ghost,
would you like to do pottery

while straddling present-day Demi Moore?

-Pass.
-Yeah.

Not getting a lot of takers for that one.

I feel like the bones in her back
would hurt my tummy.

Am I, Am I really dead?

Well, if you weren't dead,
would you feel nothing when I do this?

Aah! Son of a bitch!

You know what?
That's right. It takes a day.

My bad. Sorry.

Tomorrow I do that, you feel nothing.
But trust me, you're dead.

But I can't be... Hold on, give me a sec.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

I can't be dead!
I have a family who needs me.

Actually, Peter, from what I've seen,

I think your family would be
better off without you.

What? What do you mean?

Well, you're an inattentive husband
and a terrible parent.

Oh, says Father of the Year.

Oh, please.
He played that for all it was worth.

"Why has thou forsaken me?"

You know what? I did him a favor.

Okay, well, there's a lot to unpack there.

But come on, God,
you gotta give me another chance.

I'll show you how good a husband
and father I can be.

Are you asking for a second chance?

I-I guess so.

Huh.

No one's ever done that.

You know what? You're on.

I'll give you one day to prove to me

that your family is better off
with you alive.

I'll return you to your life
before you were in a coma.

Thanks, God! I know I can do it.

I've faced bigger challenges.

Like when I recorded
that Russian-language album.

<i>(TEQUILA</i> PLAYING)

Vodka!

Okay, kids. I know how
you always wanted kittens,

so guess what I brought home.

This very pregnant, about-to-burst,
distended-nipples street cat.

(GROWLING)

Peter, you can't bring home a feral cat.

She doesn't want to be
around people right now.

She needs a quiet space
to have her kittens.

Yeah, so everyone gather round close.

Her name is Sophie,
and she's fully dilated.

(YOWLS)

Chris! She doesn't like that,
but I understand the instinct.

Now, we all need to do our part
to help with the birth.

Meg, boil some water.
Brian, get some clean rags.

Chris, blankets.
Stewie, Band-Aids for me.

Isn't it nice that we're
spending this time together as a family?

Let's go spend it in the ER.

Well, look at us.
Out for a fun family dinner.

If anyone's watching,
they'd say, "Look at that family.

"Look how happy they are."

Well, the kids do love Fuddruckers.

Yeah, getting to design
any burger you want?

Your only limit is your imagination.

What kind you make there
for yourself, Chris?

-Plain.
-Plain? What do you mean "plain"?

It's a plain burger.
That's how I like 'em.

That's not a burger,
that's just a meat sandwich.

At least Meg went wild
and got a beige burger.

No, I got chicken.

What? Here? This is Fuddruckers.

What part of "Fuddruckers"
don't you understand?

-All of it.
-All right, let's start this again.

You're all gonna get up,

go back up to that toppings bar,
and go nuts.

But it tastes good like this.

It's not supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to look crazy.

What the hell are you doing?

I'm cutting it. It's easier to eat.

It's not supposed to be easy to eat.

Half of it is supposed
to fall onto your plate

when you squeeze it,
and the rest goes onto your shirt.

How's everything going over here?

Terrible! Go away!

See, look, now I have to be
even more ridiculous

to make up for what you guys aren't doing.

Silverware? Put 'em on.
Salt shaker? Whatever.

Ice from soda, get on that burger.

Peter, people are staring.

Yeah, they're saying,
"Look at the creative guy.

"Look at King Fuddrucker over there.

"Usually you put a burger on a tray.

"This guy's putting a tray
on a (BLEEP) burger!"

Are you through, Peter?

Not yet, I'm not. Give me the car keys.

-Peter...
-Give me the car keys.

That's Fuddruckers.

(CAR LOCK BEEPS)

Peter, you've opened the trunk.

People are pulling things out of our car.

Good. That's also Fuddruckers.
Get used to it.

And prepare to fish my teeth
out of my stool.

-Peter, enough.
-You guys clearly don't get it.

Well, I'm sure when you explain
what we're supposed to get, we'll get it.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

Those poor kids. Those poor babies.

Hey, Chris, what do you got there?

A plain burger.

Looks good.

(THINKING)<i> You can do this, Peter.</i>
<i>You love your family.</i>

<i>You can do this, Peter.</i>
<i>You love your family.</i>

<i>You can do this, Peter.</i>
<i>You love your family.</i>

Dad, can you crack your window
a little bit?

I hate you all so much!

-(THUNDER RUMBLES)
-Uh-oh.

(LIGHTNING CRASHES)

(BRAKES SCREECH)

-Aah!
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

(THUNDERCLAP)

Aah!

Did you guys see that?

The bunny rabbit family you just ran over?

Yeah. We all saw that, Peter.

Oh, come on, kids. Let's go inside.

Before you go,
there's something I want to say.

If anything were to happen to me, Lois,

I'll miss you more than life.

The cereal, but not the board game,
which I quite enjoy.

-Okay.
-And, Meg,

I'm sorry I'll never get a chance
to walk you down the aisle at Costco,

to furnish your sad,
single-lady apartment.

-Thanks, Dad.
-And Stewie,

it kills me that I'll never see
you become a man... loving twink.

Is anyone gonna stop him?

And, Chris,
whenever you're feeling defeated,

I want you to remember to always
reach for the <i>Stars...</i>

<i>...sky & Hutch</i> DVD that fell
behind the entertainment center.

Sorry, you were the last one.

-What about me?
-You're a dog.

Peter, what's going on?
Why are you saying these things?

Sorry. Why don't you guys go inside?

I'm gonna stay out here
and listen to Nina Blackwood

slowly die of throat cancer on the radio.

WOMAN: (ON RADIO)
<i>Our next artist first climbed the charts</i>

<i>with </i>Dancing With Myself.

(WOMAN WHEEZING)

<i>Of course, that artist is Billy Idol.</i>

I'm supposed to get her
a week from Thursday,

but I may be moving that up.

I suppose you know why I'm here.

Yeah. I guess so.

It's weird. For the first seven days,
all I did was create things,

but since then,
it's just killing, killing, killing.

(CRYING) Well, go ahead and do it.

My family would be better off without me.

I'm a terrible husband
and a terrible father.

I should never have questioned you.
You were right about everything.

Say that again.

You were right about everything.

That's all I needed to hear.

That's what religion is.
It's not about being good or bad.

It's just blind subservience
to an imaginary being.

So, I'm not gonna die?

Nope, not for another four years.

Thank you, God!

Bless you, my child... pornography fan.

Ha, ha. You did it to me.

-Can I use that one on my son?
-Sure.

Hey, Chris, you like
pictures of naked children,

because you're gross and weird.

Ah, he screwed it up.

And I'm sorry about Fuddruckers.
It won't happen again,

because nothing means more to me
than my family.

Aw, Peter, that's wonderful.
What helped you come around?

Well, Lois, let's just say
the big man upstairs

put in a hard day's work today.

Well, looks like quitting time.

Good night, Kirk Cameron.

See you tomorrow, Gene Rayburn.

Have you always been so...

Freaky? No. But when I got my diagnosis,

I made a bucket list
of wild sex stuff I want to try.

Jess, I would like to help you cross off

every single item on this list.

Aw. You would do that for me?

All except for number 17.

I'm allergic to chocolate.

But isn't that only if you eat it?

You know what? Let me make a phone call.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Oh...</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

(MUSIC FADES)

Brian, I'm glad
your girlfriend could join us

-for dinner tonight.
-Thanks, Lois.

And when she gets back from the bathroom,

none of you say anything about cancer.

I'm serious. I really enjoy
spending time with this woman,

and I don't want you ruining it for me.

-Okay, okay, promise.
-Of course. We got it.

Lois, you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

It's like a whole Thanksgiving dinner.

Oh, it's no problem, Jess.

We're happy to have you.

Chris, pass me a turkey leg, would you?

I prefer the limbs.

I got a "limb fo' Ma."

Uh, let's stop talking
about the food. All right?

Anyone seen any good movies lately?

I saw that new Tom Hanks movie.

Oh, man, I love every Tom Hanks movie,

except <i>The Terminal.</i>

There's nothing worse than
when you're flipping channels,

and you're like, "Oh, God, it's <i>Terminal.</i>

"Don't say it's <i>Terminal.</i>

"God, what have I done to deserve this?

"Why does it have to be <i>Terminal?"</i>

Sir, I will tell you
a great Tom Hanks movie.

<i>Catch Me If You Can, </i>sir.

You have literally
never called Peter "sir."

Well, I've never told you
that I can't throw a boomerang,

but it's true.

(PETER WHIRRING)

See? I told you. But at least
I don't have cancer,

-like your girlfriend.
-That's it.

I'm getting you out of here.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

I like your family. They're scumbags.

-I like you.
-(KISSES)

No, Jess...

I really like you.

I can't remember the last time
I felt this happy.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(BRIAN MOANING SOFTLY)

I feel dizzy.

Me, too.

-This all happened so fast, I...
-(GROANS)

Jess? Are you okay?

Jess?

Are you guys still leaving?

Oh. Yeah. Sorry. (STRAINING)

(SIGHS)

(DOOR OPENS)

Wait, where's Dr. Hartman?

I'm afraid Jess' condition is too serious

to be announced by Dr. Hartman.

So they sent me, Dr. Gravitas.

-Oh, boy.
-Uh-oh.

Jess, I'll come right out and say it.

The cancer did not respond to treatment

and has spread throughout your body.

You've got approximately
two weeks left to live.

Oh, my God.

Oh...

(SOBBING)

(SIGHS) I'm so sorry, Jess.

If there's anything I can do...

No, you've been great.

I mean, you don't even
need to be here right now.

I'm just some woman

who never got to have
the career she wanted

or get married or have kids.

(SOBBING)

One of those things you can do.

It would be my honor

if you spent the rest of your life

as my bride.

Oh, Brian. Yes!

(TENDER MUSIC PLAYING)

(PHONE RINGS)

Oh, this is my vet.

Hello?

Oh, great.

Well, some good news.

That chocolate thing from the bucket list?

We're all good. Let's do it.

Toblerone probably isn't
the best thing for this.

Brian? It would mean the world to me

if you wore my tux
from when I got married.

I love you, buddy.

Yeah, I'm not wearing
a fat guy's old clothes.

And... Wha... Is this a flap
on the butt of these pants?

Yup. In case of emergencies.

My invention. Called it the Suit-Chute.

Got it patented in '97
and went into business.

Shot a local commercial and everything.

I'm Peter Griffin,
inventor of the Suit-Chute.

Are you about to walk down the aisle

and afraid you'll leave it brown?

Did you eat creamy soup
just before the opera?

Are you George Brett
at an awards ceremony?

Then you need a tux with the Suit-Chute.

Don't take my word for it.

Ask famous Hollywood actor-
slash-pants filler Dennis Franz.

On <i>NYPD Blue, </i>I'm known for packin' heat.

But every year, when I go to the Emmys,

the heat I'm packin'
is clumpy and smells terrible.

Not anymore, thanks to the Suit-Chute.

And the winner is...

Your socks and shoes.

(STATIC)

The business died,
and I lost $200,000, Brian.

Want to know why?

"555" means it is not
an actual phone number.

I truly wish I had known that.

Brian, I want nothing to do
with this sham wedding.

So if you're going to ask me
to be your best man, don't.

I'm not. I want you to be the ring bearer,

and wear a vest and a boutonniere

-and carry a satin pillow...
-Sold, sold. Yes, I'm in.

But it's still wrong. There's no way

you'd be marrying this woman
if she wasn't going to die

-in two weeks.
-Oh, come on!

Did you know that Lois was so moved

she called Channel Five
to do a profile of me and Jess?

Hey, pal.

Listen, I kn... I know
we've had our differences,

-but you're a good guy.
-Thank you, Quagmire.

Listen, I want to throw you
the wildest bachelor party

of all time. It's gonna be crazier

than whatever Kanye West is
doing at this particular moment.

I'm giving this lasagna a massage

while preparing to announce
I'm joining ISIS.

Thank you for your interest.

This is delicious.

Hmm. I still think the butter cream

was the best cake I've thrown up so far.

Oh, speaking of which. Mwah!

Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you.

Are you the dog
who's marrying the cancer girl?

Oh, uh, yeah, I am.

Oh, my God, we saw you
on the news last night!

You are just the best person.
I can't even.

How's she doing?

Honestly, not well.

She's only got 10 days.

So in 10 days you'll be alone?

I guess.

Well, maybe not.

-I'll give you my number.
-(KEYPAD CLICKING)

Here, I'll put my number in
with my tongue.

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

I'm not sure that's a complete number,

but I'm gonna call you first.

Wow. I haven't gotten
this kind of attention

since I went to see <i>The Peanuts Movie.</i>

-Look.
-There he is.

That's him.

That's the guy who peed

(CRYING)

(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

Hello, Brian, I'm Jess' mother, Helen.

Oh, hey.

Listen, I've been wanting to talk to you.

I was thinking maybe you could
move in with me and Jess,

because I know you'd want
to be with her for her final days.

Well, now, thank you, Brian.

That is such a sweet offer.

I would love to be there.

Now, you have a blessed day.

(CHUCKLING) Oh... Oh, no.

We's all gathered here

to join this couple in holy matrimony.

(SIGHS) Yet another wedding

I'm on this side of, Jeffrey.

We's just waiting for his mama to die.

(SINGSONGY) We've written our own vows.

PETER: Oh, no.

Brian, I... I haven't known you that long.

But these past weeks,

I feel like you've given me
a lifetime of love.

I vow to honor you and cherish you

until the day I die,

a week from Wednesday.

I'm so happy to place this ring

on the weird dog thumb you have
halfway up your arm.

(SNIFFLES)

Jess, I wish we had
a million years together.

But what we have is this moment,

and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

With this ring, I vow to honor
you and cherish you

for the rest of the month.

Ma'am, do you take this doggie
to be your husband?

I do.

Yay!

How about you, doggie?

I do.

Yay, again!

I now pronounce y'all husband and wife.

Everyone! Your attention, please!

Dr. Gravitas?

That's right.

I want to give you two your first gift.

These are your latest test results, Jess.

And they're remarkable.

Meaning what?

Meaning Jess is going to live.

(GUESTS GASP, CHEER)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Brian, we really will be together forever.

Forever and (VOICE DISTORTS)
ever and ever!

Can you believe this?

What?

Jess is gonna live.

I-I'm sorry, I took a muscle
relaxer this morning.

Tinazidine.

Before you drove here?

Yeah, I took half of one
before I got in the car.

And then another half at a red light.

It's fine, it's Tinazidine.

I-I might take another half.

You want a half?

Oh, no.

Come on. It was prescribed by a doctor

to a guy named John Selvaggio

who has a mailbox that he can't
see from his front yard.

It's Tinazidine.

Stop saying what it is.

Brian, did you hear that?

Mmm-hmm.

Remember what the doctor said?

Flatulence means my digestive

Oh, my God, I must have, like,

six months' worth
of cancer-farts built up.

(SHORT FARTS)

Would you stop farting, please?

This is a nice hotel.

-Okay, that's the last box.

Aw, you're so glad to be back
with me, aren't you?

Mommy was so sad

when she had to put you all
up for adoption.

Yes, she was.

Ooh, I'm going straight to the kitchen

to make my favorite meal
in a tiny apartment.

Microwaved salmon.

Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

What?

That's my thing I say, remember?

Oh. Uh, no.

I-I can't imagine anyone does.

Hey, listen, thanks for renting to us

even though we have 10 cats
and couldn't make the deposit.

Spent, uh, pretty much
every last penny on our wedding.

(CHUCKLES) Dead broke.

Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

-So, Bri, this...
-(APPLAUSE SLOWLY STOPS)

So, Bri, this is once again your hellhole.

I was going to help you move in,

but you don't really own anything, do you?

Yeah, we didn't bother
to register for gifts

because she was supposed to die!

I must say, she's looking... Healthy.

Putting those Juicy pants to the test.

(WHISPERING) Stewie,
I've got to get out of this.

You were right all along, okay?

I'm not ready to be married.

I-I gotta... I gotta get a divorce.

Oh, that'll go over well after you paraded

your "great love" around town.

Which reminds me, your
follow-up Tom Tucker profile

is coming on now.

We got countless letters

after our profile of the Cancer Girl

who won her sweetheart's paw in marriage.

Turns out their story
has a very happy ending.

Due to audio issues,
the following footage is subtitled.

(CONTINUOUS FARTING)

(MEWING)

Brian, look.

-Holy...
-I know.

My hair's growing back.

What do you think?

You look like a baby doll
found in hurricane rubble.

Aw, I'm your baby doll.

-(KNOCKING)
-I'll get it.

(QUIETLY) Ain't that somethin'
to flip your biscuit?

Nothing?

(AUDIENCE MEMBER COUGHS)

Oh, hey, Helen. What are you doing here?

Coming to live with you, like
you asked me to at the wedding.

Are... Are you watching HBO?

I'm a Christian woman, Brian.

Cancel HBO now.

We can spend the extra money

on the big photos of fetuses I hold

while I yell at people outside Panera.

JESS: Mom, guess what?

-My farts are back.

-Uh-huh.

It's all about how
she's having her period,

but the other guy she wanted to impress,

the one who created the social media app,

he walks in while she's singing,

so now he's not into her, either.

Uh-huh.

-Will you get me more salsa?
-Uh-huh.

Brian.

Will you get me more salsa?

Huh? Oh, uh, yeah.

Sorry. Got it.

(MUNCHING LOUDLY)

They only had mild.

(GAGGING)

(COUGHING, CHOKING)

Well, I'm sorry it's so disgusting,

but that's all they have.

Oh, you're gonna die if you
have to eat mild salsa?

Come on.

(CHOKING)

Wait, are you... Oh, my G...

Oh, my God, are you choking?

She's... Someone... I don't...

Heimlich maneuver.

How do you do the Heimlich maneuver?

Come on, come on.

Damn it. I've got one song
by Haim on my phone,

and every time I try to type
"Heimlich", it...

JESS'S MOM: It was my husband's name.

What's your maiden name?

JESS'S MOM: Borgwort.

Look, all I want to say is...

I always knew this day was coming.

But what I didn't know was

just how much I was gonna miss Jess.

I would give anything

We're not smoking. We're vaping.

What's the difference?

Smoking is for losers.
Vaping is for douchebags.

Aw. I want to be a douchebag.

Do you own 19 hats?

I only have one,
but it's a Stüssy hat with a flat brim.

Have a seat.

(INHALES)

Whoo-hoo, it's delightful!

Chris! Chris, isn't this cool?

Stewie, don't say my name!
There's an Alexa in here!

(CHIMING)

Sir, we have eyes on Chris.

He's at a douchebag vaping party.

Sooner or later, they all get sloppy.

I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands
are a little worried about you.

They said you had four
Scott Peterson fish sandwiches yesterday.

Fireball?

No, because I'm not a Skidmore freshman
at a Lake George share-house.

Or am I?

Man, Skidmore's the best!

You said it, Pete. Race you to the raft?

-(LAUGHS)
-You're on!

Yeah, let's go!

PETER: <i>But the water was too shallow.</i>

<i>Bryce broke his neck</i>
<i>and never walked again.</i>

<i>This put an end</i><i>to off-campus drinking</i>
<i>and lake house rentals.</i>

<i>I was just fine. I landed on Bryce.</i>

JESS'S MOM: He's starting to smell.
He needs a bath.

JESS: He doesn't like baths.

JESS'S MOM: And I see
you lost the alcohol argument.

Can't you hear them talking about you?

Yeah. I'm a dog. I can hear everything.

By the way, the <i>Stranger Things</i> monster
just farted.

Whew! Must have been that fat chick I ate.

-Time for dinner, guys.
-Awesome. I'm starving.

-(LOUD CRACK)
-Oh!

Oh...

Holy crap! Brian, you okay?

(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

Keep it down up there!

(GRUNTING STOPS)

Holy crap, Hal, what's wrong with you?

(CHUCKLES) You love it.

-How's it look, Doc?
-I'm sorry to say you have hip dysplasia.

What's that?

I'm not sure what dysplasia is,

but I do know you don't often see a "Y"
that far up in a word.

I took the liberty of X-raying my own hip
to show you what a normal one looks like.

Why does it look like there's
a Batmobile in your colon?

Just keep your eyes on the hips.

So, what's the next step?

I was hoping, whenever
the Bat-Signal goes up in the sky,

-this thing will just drive out.
-Uh, no. For Brian.

Ah. Well, wouldn't hurt
to lose some weight.

And he won't be able to walk
until his hip heals.

He'll need someone to take care of him.

I'll take care of him.

Like you took care of me when I was sick.

Come back in a week,
we can check your pfft-pfft.

What is that?

That's the sound
a blood pressure machine makes.

I do impressions
for the doctor talent show.

Do you know what this is?

Braaap! Braaap!

An MRI?

Yes! Adding that to my set.

(TOILET FLUSHING)

Oh, my God.

-Where there's smoke, there's...
-Just me vaping.

Stewie, if Mom and Dad see you
with that thing, they'll kill me.

Get rid of it!

No way. It's awesome. Watch this.

(INHALES)

I'm not good at the football part.

(SNIFFS) It smells like raspberry.

Yeah. It's basically the same
as eating fruit.

Vaping isn't bad for you?

It can't be bad for you
if Stephen Dorff gave up acting for it.

It does seem like
they're making it for kids.

This flavor is... "Baby formula."

Let me try.

(INHALES)

Yummy.

Watch this.

(INHALES)

(LAUGHS)

Like the movie <i>The Ring.</i>

Awesome!

(BOTH SCREAM)

-Come back here, you.
-(SCREAMS)

Giggity, giggity, crabbity, giggity.

<i>(STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU</i>

Anything that tastes like a Fruit Roll-Up.

Good, all good.

-Good.
-All good.

No worries, all good?

-We're good.
-Good, all good.

Here you go. You good? You all good?

-All good here.
-Yep, we're good.

Good, all good.

This whole vaping thing
was a very smart move.

It tastes great
and I don't feel violently ill

as long as some of this vapor
is in my lungs.

Plus, when you wake up at night shaking

because you haven't had any
in three hours,

it's so easy to vape more.

Let's face it,
this is the most fun we've had

since Mom got hooked on coffee
and bought that Alpuccino maker.

COFFEE MACHINE: (AS AL PACINO) Hoo-ah!

Thank you for having us over for dinner.

Sometimes it's been difficult to cook

with all the other things
I have to do for Brian.

Oh, don't listen to her, I'm so easy.

I do have to go to the bathroom, though.

Jess really has been amazing.

(URINATING)

She even set up surgery for me
to have my hip fixed.

(URINATING CONTINUES, STOPS)

Uhp, don't get fooled.

(URINATING RESUMES)

I don't know what I'd do without her.
I think I've really found true love.

(URINATING CONTINUES)

Well, that's lovely. You know,
I don't think we've said grace yet.

-BRIAN: Oh, yeah.
-Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts,

-which we are about to receive.
-BRIAN: Get out of there, Mountain Dew.

I'm here for Brian Griffin.

Well, this is it, Jess.
See you after my hip surgery.

He won't be needing this anymore.

Thanks.

Good-bye, Brian.

You mean "see you soon," right?

Wait, why won't I need my collar?

(DOGS WHINING)

So, what's this?

Kind of like a pre-op?

Are all these dogs having hip surgery?

Where do you think you are?

This isn't a doctor's office,
this is the pound.

You're being euthanized.

What? Jess is having me put down?

Oh, my God, this can't be happening!

Did you also eat a kid?

Look, there's been a horrible mistake.
You've got the wrong dog.

Says right here I got to euthanize
Brian Griffin, and you're him.

You wouldn't kill a singing dog,
would you?

(SINGING) <i>Hello, my baby, hello, my honey</i>

<i>Hello, my ragtime gal</i>

(CASH REGISTER RINGS)

(FANFARE MUSIC PLAYING)

(CROAKS LIKE MICHIGAN J. FROG)

WORKER: Oh, now you're getting
euthanized for sure.

(INHALES)

(EXHALES)

Hi, honey.

Mommy needs money for scratchers.

What the... What kind
of brazen thievery is this?

Where'd you get this?

Chris Griffin! You get in here!

What is this?

Um... Robot penis?

Seriously, I'm absolutely jonesing
right now, so give it back.

-I know what this is. I watch Bravo.
-I'm not doing it.

You are too young to be doing this.

Maybe it's his
and he's just too dumb to hide it.

And if that's not bad enough, you leave it
out for Stewie to get his hands on it?

I don't know, Mom,
I'm not my brother's keeper.

-He's just a baby.
-Babies are stupid like that!

-I'm taking it...
-(GRUNTS)

...and you are grounded, mister.

Now look what you did,
you little son of a bitch.

She has my vaporizer.
You have to get it back.

That's your problem.

You lost your vape pen,
I didn't lose mine.

Well, I guess you win.

-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS, CRIES)

-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

(GRUNTS)

Hey. (GRUNTS)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(BOTH SUCKING)

Oh, tastes so good, like skin berries.

I'm alive with pleasure.

(BOTH SUCKING)

It's possible we've taken this too far.

I'll just go down and get yours back.

I will never forget this day.

Mom, I need to talk to you.

Technically, that was not my vape pen,

but I do need it back
because it belongs to a friend of mine.

We accidentally switched jackets,

not unlike that episode
of <i>The Brady Bunch,</i> when Greg...

(COUGHS)

Oh, damn it, Chris, why do your lies
have to take so damn long?

You're smoking the vape pen?

No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette

like frustrated mothers
are supposed to do.

You're such a hypocrite!

At least vaping is healthy.

Oh, don't be an idiot.

Vaping is just as bad,
and you look like a douchebag.

No, I don't. I look cool.

Go ahead.

-Hold it to your mouth.
-(CAMERA CLICKS)

Oh, my God, I'm a douchebag.

(INHALES SHARPLY, CRIES)

It's okay, Chris.
Your secret's safe with me.

(PHONE CHIMES)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey, what's up, Jess?

I came to see how Brian's...

ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!

Sorry, I'm just making an Alpuccino.

Oh.

Well, anyway, I was just wondering...

ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!

Sorry, my mom wanted one, too.

Oh, that's-that's fine.

-So is Brian...
-Can I get you one?

Uh, sure. Is Brian going to, uh...

ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!

When is Brian coming back?

Oh, never. I'm having him euthanized.

Euthanized?

Oh, my God!

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Come on, come on.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Euthanize, euthanize, euthanize...

Oh, my God! I got to do something!

Damn it. Now I have to do that
with every dictionary here.

Hold on, Brian, hold on.

(DOGS WHINING)

(CAR HORN HONKING)

Don't worry, buddy. I'm on my way.

(DOGS BARKING)

I'm warning you, if you kill me,
the Internet's gonna freak out.

(TIRES SQUEAL)

Please, it can't end like this.
There has to be something I can do.

Well, for 200 bucks,
I'll strangle you with my bare hands

and stare into your eyes as you die.

What? I'm not paying for that.

I meant I'll pay you.

Stop! That's my dog!

Oh, Peter, thank God.
You got here just in time.

You want to make $200?

I do.

(CHOKING) It's...

Beautiful.

-What the hell are you doing here?
-Brian, I can explain.

Explain what? How you brought me here
to have me killed?

Well, you're no better.

You could have saved my life
in the restaurant,

but you let me choke to death.

Okay, fine. I probably could have
done more to save your life.

I was just so unhappy being married, I...

I guess I felt letting you choke
was my only way out.

God, that sounds awful.
Maybe I did deserve to die.

W-Well, and I should've kept
taking care of you

instead of bringing you here
to have you killed.

Maybe I deserve to be
with someone who let me die.

Maybe we deserve each other.

It does seem
like we're meant for each other.

I mean, gosh,
maybe that's what true marriage is...

Two people who want each other to die.

PETER: (CHOKING) Now you're getting it.

So much beauty.

Well, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died
during the commercial break,

but it was a very nice funeral service.

Yeah, it's sad.

She was the love of my life,
my heart, my...

ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!

I took that from her apartment.

So, Chris, I hear
you been doing some vaping.

So douchey.

Mom, you told him? We had a deal.

Thanks a lot, Peter.
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret

after you lied to me
about sneaking cigarettes?

What the hell, Chris? You told him, too?

-No, I didn't.
-Brian told me.

Are you serious, Peter?
You said you wouldn't say anything.

I promised Meg I wouldn't tell anyone.

Oh, good job with that, dick.

Chris, the only reason I told him
was he promised he'd keep his mouth shut.

Oh, nice job, Chris.

I should've known not to trust someone
who kisses his own brother.

What? Wh-Who told you that?

-Don't look at me.
-Meg told me.

How does it feel, Meg,
you friggin' town crier?

MEG: You're such a bitch.
PETER: She's a bitch?

Meg, you said
you wouldn't tell Stewie's secret.

CHRIS: Stewie, you told Dad?

STEWIE: I had to get it off my chest.
I didn't think he'd understand me.

PETER: I understand pieces now and then.

That's cool. Is it a queen?

Not sure, but people have said it is.

Wait a minute.

This is a self-empowerment seminar.

You lied to me.

You said we were going to Baskin-Robbins.

I said we were going

I do.

But some will never achieve it.

MAN 2: Oh, no!

You, sir.

Come out here.

Sheesh, your head is the size

Ha! I've been told that.

And you sound like you were lost at sea

and told not to drink seawater
but drank seawater.

Peter, will you just listen to him?

Tony, this is why I brought him.

He's never willing
to actually confront his issues.

Sounds like you have no self-esteem.

I don't deserve self-esteem.

Peter, I was once a lot like you.

Unmotivated, dangerously obese,
always relying on cutaways...

You know, that reminds me of the time...

No, Peter. No more cutaways.

-Stay in the present.
-Okay.

Okay. Now tell me what you feel.

Uh, a partial erection.

I don't get touched very often.

You know you deserve
a better life, right, Peter?

Yes. Getting hard to breathe in here.

I want to give you that life, Peter.

Time to seize your personal power.

(GASPING)

Yeah, by getting away from you,
you weirdo.

But first, here's that cutaway
I was gonna do

before you made me skip it.

I'm not going to let you

He's just, like, a cool guy.

Hi, Stewie. I'm putting sand on a cat poo.

Cool!

(SIGHS)

I like you, Stewie.

Can I come over for a playdate?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Yes, yes, yes!

Brian, can Hudson come over
for a playdate?

Sure, I guess so.

Never heard you ask for a playdate before.

I know, but there's a first time
for everything.

Like when I finally built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

out of Legos.

I did it!

TONY: (THROUGH CAR)
Hey, Peter, next time use a tissue.

-Who said that?
-It's me. Tony Robbins.

Tony Robbins?

That's impossible. You're dead.

TONY: That may be true,

but the lightning bolt that killed me

seems to have magically
transferred my personal power,

trademark, into your car.

Peter, I told you I was going to help you,

and I'm not leaving
until I make good on my promise.

Suit yourself.

Hey, if you're dead,
can you ask Bill Paxton

if he's the same as Bill Pullman?

Sure. Hang on.

He said no, but he winked.

Ah!

Hey, Stewie, let's play cops and robbers.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Got you.

(CHUCKLES) Gun?

Oh, that's... That's not...
That's not a gun.

These are guns.

You're welcome, Paul Hogan.

Any time someone says
a weapon is not what it is,

Paul Hogan gets a royalty.

Royalty check, Mr. Hogan.

PAUL HOGAN: Thanks, Jumpy.

Whoa! What are all these for?

Oh, the ushe,
destroying enemies, world domination.

Oh, and killing my mother.

You want to hurt your mommy?

LOIS: Stewie?

Blast! Here she comes.

Well, look at these handsome little boys.

Come downstairs. I made your favorites,

grilled cheese
cut to look like a dinosaur.

Ugh. They never look like a dinosaur.

Your mom seems nice.

She's a slag.

Well, I hope you don't use your guns
to kill your mom or do anything bad.

'Cause if you do,
I won't be able to play with you,

and that's my favorite thing now.

It is?

-Uh-huh.
-Mine, too.

You know what? I'm going to let her live.

I must say, I've been evil so long,

I've forgotten what it's like to be kind.

And it's all because
of our friendship, Hudson.

-You really mean that?
-You bet I do.

And I always tell it like it is,

like when I used to write tombstones.

Complained a lot is what she did.

Stewie, what are you doing?

Having a funeral, Bri.

Say goodbye to Evil Stewie.

CHRIS: Did we get a pool?

Is this a pool?

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Stewie, slow down, slow down.
What happened?

We went to the zoo. We saw an ape.

At first we didn't think we'd see him

'cause he was, like,
hiding back in his house.

But then he came out. We saw him!

We saw the ape! He was big.

And then... And then... And then...

Okay, I get it. You had fun.

Wait, you're not mad
I went without you, are you?

No, no, I... I was only going for you.

And maybe to taunt the animals
that aren't able to leave.

Which is all of them.

Losers.

All right, you have to take us to lunch,

but first we need to take our nap.

Here's your triple bacon burger
and your onion rings.

Ah, crap.

There's only nine pieces of bacon.

I paid for 12.

But I don't wanna make a fuss.

TONY: (THROUGH CAR)
Peter, listen to yourself.

No one will respect you
until you respect yourself first.

Yeah. But I'm a nobody.

You're not a nobody.

Your meal is just as important
as anyone else.

You're right.

I'm not a nobody.

TONY: Say it again.

I'm not a nobody!

TONY: That's the spirit, Peter.

Now yell at that nobody in the window.

You there! I demand more bacon.

Oh, I'm sorry. Here's more bacon.

That's not more bacon...

This is more bacon!

Big day, Mr. Hogan.

PAUL HOGAN: Keep 'em comin', Jumpy!

Here's your <i>Star Wars </i>kids' meal.

Which action figures did we get?

I got Kylo Ren.

I got the role during the two months
I was a hot actor,

and now they're stuck with me.

I got Forest Whitaker.

Even as a toy
you can't tell where he's looking.

I wish I had the poorly-cast Kylo Ren.

Here, Stewie. You can have mine.

You're giving me the better one?

Why would you do that?

Because you're my friend.

Yes.

You're my friend.

You're my best friend.

Let's choke on these together.

(BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)

(BOTH PANTING)

That was fun.

Let's switch.

(BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)

Okay, guys. Time to play "parachute."

Grab an end and lift.

You know who loves "parachute"?

My best friend, Hudson.

-You know Hudson?
-I know Hudson, too.

Are you going to his birthday
party tomorrow?

I'm autistic.

TEACHER: And lift.

Birthday party?

Yeah, it's at the Family Fun Zone.

Everyone was invited.

I take up a great deal
of the teacher's time.

-Where's the mail?
-On the table.

What's going on? You seem upset.

Oh, you're a... You're a real student
of the human condition, aren't you?

Yet, somehow, it escapes your writing.

Whoa! Why are you attacking me?

(SIGHS) I'm sorry, Brian.

Everyone but me got an invite
to Hudson's birthday.

I know why this happened.

I called him my best friend too quickly.

Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.

But, hey, I'm... I'm still your friend.

Yeah, but Hudson isn't.

And that's just something
I have to live with.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

Stewie, it's 2:00 a.m.

Revenge doesn't sleep.

Come on. Come back to bed.

No.

There's something I gotta do.

Go get 'em, tiger.

Hey.

Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Victory shall be mine.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

Ha. That's what the baby used to say
when I was your age.

Shut up, Dad. I'm watching <i>Rick and Morty.</i>

So, does Mommy have friends
over sometimes at night?

Sometimes.

It must be weird having only women
come over to see Mommy.

No, it's mostly men.

Oh, it is.

And you'd be comfortable
telling that to a judge?

Good morning, family.

My, who's this go-getter?

Tony Robbins has helped me
become a better person.

In fact, today, I'm gonna ask for...
Nay, demand... a raise.

"Nay"? Wow.

This new you is a bigger surprise

than when they're making fun
of a celebrity

on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

and the real-life celebrity
walks in behind them.

(CHUCKLES) Boy, they're really
socking it to this celebrity.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah, can you imagine
how mad the celebrity would be?

I mean, wherever they are
at this particular moment,

if they're watching, they must be...

(BOTH GASP)

Oh. (LAUGHS)

That's the actual celebrity
walking up right behind 'em.

He... He's catching 'em right in the act.

The... The <i>SNL </i>actor doesn't know.

Aw, he's gonna get in trouble.

Look how mad the actual celebrity is.

He's folding his arms and frowning.

He tapped the <i>SNL </i>actor on the shoulder.

Look how surprised the <i>SNL </i>actor is!

Oh! He's completely busted!

(SCREAMS AND LAUGHS)
How is this happening?

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Oh, my God!

I can't believe it!

I was watching upstairs on Hulu!

I saw it on my phone!

My plane has Wi-Fi!

Stewie? Stewie?

(READING)

Uh-oh.

Stewie's dug up all his weapons.

Oh, my God, I've got to stop him.

Go get 'em, tiger.

Hey.

Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.

Tony! You're not gonna believe it.

I demanded a raise
just like you told me to

and they gave it to me.

Tony?

Tony? You in there?

TONY: Guess who, Peter.

Geena Davis?

No, it's me, Peter. Turn around.

Tony? You're alive?

But how?

I saw you get struck by lightning.

I was created by lightning, Peter,

in a lab, like Frankenstein.

And what do you think about fire?

(ROARS)

Anyway, after the lightning strike,

I climbed into your trunk

and that's where I've been
living the past week.

So, whenever I heard your voice,
that was just you in the trunk?

That's right.

Why would you go to all that trouble?

Peter, I told you,

I wasn't going to let you be
my first failure.

Wow, Tony, I don't know how
I can possibly thank you.

You don't need to thank me, Peter.

I have hundreds of millions of dollars.

I keep it in my forehead.

Well, I better be going.

You have a smart car?

I have two.

I'm coming, broken people!

-(HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHILDREN LAUGHING, THEN SCREAMING)

Damn you all.

(ALL SCREAMING)

Stewie?

That's my name, don't wear it out.

Yeah, let that wash over you.

Learned that from a third grader.

Any last words?

Yeah. I'm glad to see you.

You never RSVP'd to the invite
my mom sent.

You... You invited me?

BRIAN: Yes. He did.

Brian? What are you doing here?

And how do you know I was invited?

Because...

I threw your invitation away.

You what?

I know. I'm sorry.

I just... I saw how you were
connecting with Hudson

and I was afraid of losing our friendship.

Friendship?

Brian, you and I have never been friends.

We... We haven't?

No. Friends are people
who come in and out of our lives.

But you and I are family.

That's forever.

Sorry I caused all this trouble.

I hope you can forgive me.

Ah, that's okay, nothing could
ever come between us.

I'm even going to
make a speech at your wedding.

So Brian and I are down in Mexico,

and, as usual,
he doesn't have any cash on him.

That's probably why your parents
are paying for all this, right, Evan?

BRIAN: <i>Wait, hold on. Evan?</i>

<i>Why am I gay in this?</i>

STEWIE: <i>Ah, it's the end of the show.</i>

<i>We sometimes do something silly here.</i>

So, now that you got me back as a friend,

what are all the great things
you have planned for us?

Uh, we could go see a movie.

Oh, a movie. That's a great idea.

You know what'll get me out of this funk?

<i>The Equalizer 2.</i>

(CHUCKLING) Okay. All right, fine.
I got... I got nothing.

Exactly.

And you were such a jealous little bitch

that you had to ruin the one friendship
I really cared about.

You're just a big jerk and I hate you,

and there's nothing you can do
to make up for it.

Fine.

Maybe I'll just go out
and get some ice cream.

Ice cream?

I like ice cream.

Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's more of a bigger kid thing.

No, no, no! No.
I've had ice cream, like, six times.

All right, come on, let's go.

You know, Brian, I'm starting to think

we're going to get through our Rocky Road.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

(FORCED LAUGH)

We had a lot of laughs tonight,
but let's remember the important thing.

You can't put a price on your happiness,

which is why I have. It's $6,000.

See you in Fort Myers, probably.

-(GROWLING)

I-It's just Stewie in a kitty costume.

I'm a calico, and my name is Humphrey.

He got his face painted
at a birthday party.

It was the only thing
this little guy could do.

He was too light
for the caterpillar slide,

too short for the piñata,

and too scared to touch
the animals in the petting zoo.

-Half of them had erections.
-Half of them had erections.

The pony was magnificent.

The pony was magnificent.

-Oh, what do we have here?
-Hey, back off!

That's my goodie bag.

Ugh. An eraser.

Raisins in an unsealed sandwich bag.

Oh, a parachute guy.

Ugh, he's already tangled.

This day started off so great.

It was awash in cake and pony boners.

Now all I have is this dumb whistle.

-(EXHALES)
-Doesn't even work.

(EXHALES)

Ow! What the hell?

Oh, it's a dog whistle.

-(EXHALES)
-(SHOUTS)

I've always wondered
what that sounds like to you.

(INHALES)

GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
<i>Dog whistle! Dog whistle!</i>

<i>Where are you, dog?</i>

-Give me that!
-Hey.

Oh, what, you want it?
Here, take it.

Give it back.

-Give me it.
-No. It's mine now.

In fact, I'm gonna put it
where you can never reach it.

No!

-Good luck, shrimp.
-(GRUNTING)

I can't believe the nerve of that dog.

Teaching me a lesson about size?

I'm not even that small.

Tiny Tom Cruise?

Oh, hey, little guy.
Forgot my sunglasses.

Hey, what's with
your gay character names lately?

Stacee Jaxx? Jack Reacher?

I mean, who are you playing next?

(CHUCKLES) All right,
try to make this sound gay.

next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.

-Anything else?
-Actually, yes.

After that, I'll be taking
the role of Major Dixon Butts,

then Senator Rod Clutcher.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

I'm too small, am I, Brian?

Well, we'll just see who's the bigger man.

"Brian, sorry I got testy.
Let's bury the hatchet.

"If you're free, I'd love to hear about

any new writing projects
you're working..."

-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-Oh, at least wait for me to send it.

-(TEXT MESSAGE CHIRPS)
-(COMPUTER CHIMES)

Hey, Stewie, I got your text.
What am I working on?

(CHUCKLES)
What am I not working on?

Well, first off, I got this
screenplay for Tom Cruise,

about the queen's private secretary,
Sir Gaylord Hummer.

Well, actually, he might do that.

But, Brian, I'm more interested
in <i>short </i>stories.

(WHIRRING)

(SHOUTS, VOICE PITCH INCREASES)

(FOOTSTEPS RUMBLING)

(ECHOING) Well, hello there, little guy.

(HIGH-PITCHED) What the hell
did you do to me, Stewie?

Well, Brian, you seemed
to enjoy belittling me,

so I decided to belittle you.

I've simply shrunken down
your molecular structure.

It was easy, really.

Like taking candy,
or a whistle, from a baby.

You dick. Undo this.

This is perfect.

I think my excitement is best expressed

by Jean-Claude Van Damme in this scene.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, you've made your point.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.
it's too high-pitched.

-You're what?
-I'm sorry.

-For what?
-For calling you a shrimp.

-And?
-What do you mean "and"?

Come on, you know what I want.

And... all four chairs

would totally turn for you on <i>The Voice.</i>

-Anything else?
-(SIGHS)

And the way you salute
and point is very casual

and free of affectation.

Hey, thanks, Bri.
I'll go switch you back.

(FOOTSTEPS RUNNING)

(SNIFFS)

-(GROWLS)
-Stewie!

You know, I'm really flattered you think
all four <i>Voice </i>chairs would turn around.

My dream order would be Adam, Blake,
Alicia Keys, and then Kelly Clarkson,

whose chair I imagine would turn last,

'cause she's, uh... She's a bigger gal.

Help!

Oh, crap.

Don't worry, Brian, I'll save you!

But I'm a millennial,
so first I have to watch

a YouTube instructional video
on how to do it.

<i>What's going on, guys?</i>

<i>I'm Corey, and today</i><i>I'm gonna teach you</i>
<i>how to get your friend</i><i>out of a rat hole.</i>

<i>Now, before we get started,</i>
<i>don't forget to subscribe</i>

<i>to my channel, Corey's World.</i>

<i>And, guys, I'll get to</i>
<i>as many comments as I can,</i>

<i>but I can't get to all of them.</i>

<i>And don't forget to check out</i>
<i>my other videos,</i>

<i>like "How to Play Guitar."</i>

Uh, Brian, this might be a while.

<i>What's going on, guys?</i>
<i>I'm Corey.</i>

-Brian? Hang in there, buddy.
-(RAT CHATTERING)

BRIAN: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Hurry up! Get this rat away from me!

I'll shrink myself down and come get you.

But in the meantime, they say

if you put your finger in a rat's butt,
that disables it.

(RAT SCREECHES)

BRIAN: It didn't work.
Now he's just angry.

Try wetting your finger first.

-(RAT SCREECHES)
-BRIAN: Just get in here!

(WHIRRING)

(RAT GROWLING)

Hey, come on, guy. (CHUCKLES)
Hey, you don't want to do this.

I'll have what she's having.

(SQUISHES)

Please tell me that's not the finger
you stuck in a rat's butt.

No. It... I don't-I don't
remember which one it was.

Yeah, that was the finger.

All right, let's get back to the machine.

Look at all this shag carpet.

This is like our Vietnam movie.

(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) I miss Jenny.

-What is that?
-That's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

-Yeah, I-I don't think so.
-Shh.

-(DISTANT MECHANICAL HUMMING)
-What is that?

It ain't a box of chocolates.

(WHIRRING)

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Vacuum cleaner!

(BOTH SCREAMING)

I hate my life and nobody
can hear me say it right now!

(BOTH SCREAMING)

(WHIRRING STOPS)

Oh, my God, this is disgusting!

I just hope she's done vacuuming.

-(VACUUM SQUEAKING)
-LOIS: Okay, everyone,

dump your toenails in the hall.
I'm vacuuming.

-(VACUUM WHIRRING)
-Oh, God.

That was close.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Oh, my God, we're in the trash outside!

We've got to get down from here.
Quick, pass me that baggie.

How am I supposed to get down?
That was the only baggie.

Use either the tampon strings

or the discarded dental floss
and rappel down.

-(BONES CRACK)
-Which one did you go with?

(MUFFLED) Neither.
I was hoping to kill myself.

(WHISTLING)

Two days of mail at once, nobody knows.

Don't go over two.
Don't get greedy.

(SNORTS)

Uh, got a bat in the cave.

All right, I figure if we can just...

What's going on? An eclipse?

-Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Holy crap! What is that?!

-Gross! Oh!
-What is on us? Oh!

Ah! Snot rocket!

Oh, my God, it's so disgusting!

Get it off! Get it off!

-Are you guys eating that?
-Uh, what?

(SLOWLY) Are you eating
this pile of boogers?

-Uh, no.
-Can I eat it?

Yeah, please. We're stuck.

Dude, dude, you got to get down here,
by the big trash can.

Dude, dude, dude, just get here.

(BEE BUZZING)

-Brian, we've got to get up to my room.
-Yeah, but how?

We'll just climb the lattice
on the front of the house.

-When did we get that?
-Well, every '80s movie had one,

so the fat man thought
we should have one, too.

Wow. Okay, great.

You know, it's funny,
you said "every '80s movie,"

but I can't think of a single one.

<i>-Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>
-I don't think so.

But the lattice thing
sounded right when you said it.

I-I feel like '80s movies
were wall-to-wall lattices.

<i>-Sixteen Candles?</i>
-Hmm. no, no.

I mean, she was being ignored
most of the movie.

Who'd be climbing into her window?

Ah, good point.
<i>Risky Business?</i>

No. Hookers don't climb.

Oh, I know, <i>Home Alone.</i>

<i>Home Alone </i>must've had a lattice.

Maybe, but that was 1990.

Eh, it feels like an '80s movie.

You know, it was probably
greenlit in the '80s,

when lattices were still a thing.

Oh, wow, here we are.

All right, Brian, at this size,
this is a two-man job.

While I adjust the settings,
you go over there

and hit the tiny button to fire it up.

(WHIRRING)

Wait a minute.

This doesn't feel right.
What button did you hit?

That one. The tiny button.

STEWIE: Wait, did you hit the tiny button
or the button that says "tiny"?

I hit the button that says "tiny."

-You said, "Hit the tiny button."
-Exactly!

I didn't say,
"Hit the big button that says 'tiny,'"

I said, "hit the tiny button."

The one you pressed is going
to shrink us down to microscopic size!

Well, why would you make
the tiny button big?

I had to make it big enough
to write "tiny" on it!

BRIAN: Well, what the hell do we do now?

STEWIE: I don't... I-I'm still thinking
about that lattice thing.

I want to say <i>Parenthood?</i>

BRIAN: <i>Parenthood. </i>Yes.
I feel like <i>Parenthood </i>is right.

(CREATURES CHIRPING)

It's beautiful.

Ah, I just wish
my hot girlfriend were here to see it.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you have a girlfriend?

-What's her name?
-Girly... Friendston.

"Girly Friendston"?
Nice try, Stewie.

Why won't he answer my texts?

WOMAN: Girly, your piano teacher's here.

-Oh, Mom, do I have to?
-Girly Friendston,

you stop mooning over
that boyfriend of yours

-and get down here this instant.
-(SIGHS)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hi. I'm the exterminator.

An ex-Terminator?
So you used to be a Terminator?

-No. I kill rats and bugs.
-And Sarah Connor.

-No, Peter. We have a rat.
-My stuff's in my truck.

-I'll be back.
-(GASPS)

See that, Lois?

There's more Terminators around
than you think there are.

(BEEPING)

I hope he can terminate

some of the bad attitudes
on our kids, huh?

(LAUGHS WEAKLY) Yeah.

-(RUMBLING)
-What's that sound?

Oh, my God! Look!

(CREATURES SCREECHING)

(ROARING)

(SCREECHES)

Holy crap, what the hell
were those things?!

Dust mites.

One of the most dominant species
of the micro world.

Why did they just attack like that?

MALE VOICE: Because they're jerks.

Aah! Who the hell are you?

Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you, little buddies.

My name's Vernon.
I'm a water bear.

A water bear? What's a water bear?

They're predominantly
water-dwelling, eight-legged

segmented micro animals.

They're also known as
a moss piglet or a tardigrade.

You can call me tardy,
but I'm always on time.

Ha-ha. Yeah.

Well, here she is.
Home sweet home.

Everybody, we've got guests!

You'll see that we have
quite the diverse cast of characters.

(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
I'm the country water bear.

"Yee-haw" is what I say.

Flagellum? I don't even know them.

I'm the Black one.

And I'm Patrick Stewart as a water bear.

I can't believe
there's this whole universe

hidden here in your rug...
where everyone speaks English.

Okay, Brian, take the ride.
Here, have a sip of water.

(ALL GASP)

What the... Hey, cut it out!

You have water?
Water is life.

Yeah, we need water bad.

And I'm the gay one,
but I'm not, like, doing the gay voice.

Listen, Stewie and I come from a place
where water flows like... well, water.

That's right.
And we need to get back there.

And if you guys help us,

we'll make sure
you never want for water again.

What do you say?

-(CHEERING)
-All right!

-Yee-haw!
-Patrick Stewart!

-Well, what'd you find?
-I'll be honest.

I think this is a conversation
best had over dinner.

Oh. Okay.

So what's going on with the house?

I don't like talking business
at the table.

-Let's just enjoy our wine.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

(SOFTLY) Your wife's asleep.

Sometimes she fakes it
so I can't hump her,

but this seems legit.

So, uh, shouldn't we talk about
what you found at our house?

I don't know. It's so late.
I have a crazy idea.

Should we talk about it over a nightcap?

Uh, sure, I guess.

I'm a little chilly.

Oh, well, I-I guess I don't need this.

Sir? Sir, I asked you
what you found out about the house.

What? Oh. You're gonna
have to tent the house.

All right. Thanks for your work.
You're very professional.

Yeah, that's me. Professional.

Always professional.

And alone.

(EXCITING MUSIC PLAYING)

What the hell is this giant wall?

We're here, Brian.
That's your laptop.

If we get inside,
I can remotely hack into the shrink ray.

Oh, my God!
It's the dust mites!

(SCREECHING)

Oh, no!
Water Bear Consuela, can you stop them?

No, no. I only clean Wednesday.

-Can't you just clean today?
-No, no. Wednesday.

(DUST MITES SCREECHING)

Here's the micro board.

I just need to reroute the circuits.

(LAPTOP POWERING ON)

(WHIRRING)

All right. The laptop is now
linked to the shrink ray.

The only problem is that
I can't activate it from here.

We still somehow have to press
the return button on the keyboard.

But at this size,
there's no way I can do it alone.

Wait. I've got an idea.

Well, you better act quickly.

Guys! Follow me up this way!

Why is there a tiny lattice
inside this computer?

I guess Steve Jobs
was really into '80s movies.

(ALL GASP)

(DUST MITES SCREECHING)

Brian, wait for my signal.

Hold.

-Hold.
-(HISSES)

Hold.

-Now!
-You-you never told me what to do.

-Jump!
-Why?

-Trust me.
-(ALL SCREAMING)

(BUTTON CLICKS)

My God! It worked!
Stewie, you're a genius!

-(GROWLING)
-Oh, no.

(ROARS)

Run!

Okay. All the gas bombs are set up.

Time to blow all those vermin
to kingdom come.

Can I press the button?

Hmm, perhaps that's a question
best pondered over dinner?

You-you can just press it.
Go ahead.

(ROARS)

(BEEPS)

Aah! Poison gas!

They must've gotten
an exterminator for the rat!

(ROARING)

Tiny Tom Cruise?

(BOTH GRUNT)

(BOTH COUGHING)

Thank you, Tiny Tom Cruise.
How can we ever repay you?

Well, you could make a sizable donation
to the Church of Spaceship Beep Boop.

You mean the Church of...

Yeah, kidnapping, torture,
extortion, that's the one.

And we won't get in trouble
because we didn't use the actual name.

MAN: What did he just say?

We are about love
and spaceships and beep boop!

Get my lawyer on the phone!

-You have children in there?
-Oh, yeah, three.

Should-should we have mentioned that?

MAN: Meg, Chris, come to the light.

Meg, no. Don't do it.

Don't go to Prince!

Come to the purple light, Meg.

Come taste infinity.

Don't listen to him, Meg.

But he's so talented
and he's got so many drugs.

Alan Thicke is here, too.

Hey, guys. Come on in. It's a hoot.

I'm coming, Alan Thicke.

No!

Google my Crystal Light
aerobics competition.

It's ridiculous.

I hope Vernon and the gang survived.

That gas was pretty powerful.

Well, let's take a look.

They're okay.
Let's deliver on our promise.

A little water for our little friends.

-Oh, hell no!
-Sweet country music!

Oh, my gay God.

(SCREAMING)

Ah, they're dead.
Now I'm sad.

Cheer me up, Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Happy birthday, Lois.

You know, today you officially become
the oldest woman I've ever slept with.

Yes. You said the same thing last year.

Well, unlike you,
that joke never gets old.

Oh, and I forgot to pick up the cake.

Hey, Lois, I don't like
any of these snacks.

Can I have something from the kitchen?

We can have snacks from the kitchen?

I could go for a sandwich.

No. No one gets snacks from the kitchen.

You see what you started?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hi. I'm here for the pony rides.

-What?
-Oh, boy.

This-this must be some sort of big mix-up.

Don't worry, Lois, I'll handle this.

-What's his name?
-Lightning.

(LAUGHS) That means he's fast.

So, uh, Lois, where are your parents?
Didn't they say they were coming?

Yeah, but I'm sure Daddy
had a last-minute work thing.

He's always put business first.

Even growing up, he never came
to any of my piano recitals.

It was the '80s, so he was always doing
cocaine-and-sushi business meetings.

All right, Hideki, it's a deal.

Now, let's celebrate
the way rich guys do, by...

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Ah, damn it, I snorted the wrong one.

Ah, wasabi!

Wasabi in my nostril!

(GROANS)

Still better than sitting
through that piano thing.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, hi, Daddy.

You missed the party.

I know. I thought I'd apologize

with an upper-class
New England mumble-kiss.

(BOTH SMOOCHING)

-I'm so sorry, dear.
-It's okay.

And here, I brought you a gift.

-A gun?
-Yeah, you love guns.

No, I don't.
You don't know me at all.

I can't believe you'd blow off my party
then give me a handgun.

Especially when there's kids in the house.

Hall. <i>Kids in the Hall.</i>

Damn it, Daddy.

I'm trying to explain
that guns are hazardous and unsafe,

not have a conversation about
a tepid 1990s Canadian sketch group.

You're wrong about guns and comedy.

I'm out of here. Buh-bye.

Was that a tepid 1990s
David Spade reference?

CARTER: People are allowed to like things!

Peter, you want to watch Netflix?

Yeah, let's watch one of those
stand-up specials.

There's a bunch of 'em,
they got to be good.

No. No.

Tom Segura? No.

Chinese girl.

Another Chinese girl.

No. No.

Anjelah Johnson?

Geez, they're giving one
of these to everyone.

-How come I don't have one?
-You do, Peter.

This is the taped intro.

Mr. Griffin, you're on.

(APPLAUSE)

Good evening, Ithaca Civic Auditorium.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So I'm thinkin' I might get a bike.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

You know, one of these things?
Ring-ring, ring-ring.

"I'll get you, Toto!"
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

I'm thinkin' I might.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Okay, I'm off to the grocery store.

-So, what'd you do with the gun?
-Gun?

Yeah, my father gave me a gun
as a present yesterday.

Where was that during birthday sex?
Maybe I would have finished.

Unlike you, guns can actually fire.

I don't think this marriage needs a gun.

Anyway, I hid the gun someplace safe

until I can figure out
how to properly dispose of it.

So don't get any ideas.

Good for Lois.
Guns are a major problem,

especially in the hands of someone like...

-(GUNSHOT)
-(GLASS BREAKING)

It was in a box
with Chris's adoption papers...

Oh.

-(COCKS GUN)
-You heard nothing.

Hi, I got my gun here.
I'd like to rent a stall, please.

Sure. You need a tutorial
before you start?

(CHUCKLES) Yeah, it's a gun range.
I think I got it.

Wait! I think I did it wrong.

So how was the gun range, Dad?

Did you shoot up
that silhouette real good?

(LAUGHS)
That is so my dad.

(GUNSHOTS)

Why do you hate that show so much?

(IN CHANGED VOICE)
Because it's preventing me

from doing my work here at <i>Family Guy.</i>

Damn it, I think I loaded a bullet wrong.

All right, let's all take turns
looking down the barrel with one eyeball

and see if we can
figure out what's going on.

Chris, you go first.

Oh, my God, Peter. Give me that.

This gun is not staying in this house
for one more second.

I'm giving it back to my father.

Yeah, it's been a disaster.

Like when Peter was the only one
not wearing black jeans

at a Rush concert.

(CHEERING)

Sing <i>Tom Sawyer!</i>

We already did.

And what are you wearing?

What? These are my concert khakis.

Beat him! Beat him in six-eight time.

And don't let him escape
to the completely unoccupied ladies' room.

Ah! No. Please,

uncles who voted for Gary Johnson,
leave me alone.

(WHIMPERING)

And now a song about radio towers.

Daddy?

Daddy, are you there?

(WHISPERING) Don't do anything
to scare him.

He flew on my shoulder
while I was having a lemonade.

-Daddy, I...
-(SQUAWKING)

What?

Daddy, you need to take this gun back.

I never should have accepted it
in the first place.

And you never should have given it to me.

Are you sure?
I bought it at Anthropologie.

Oh.

Wait a minute, what am I saying?
No. You have to take it back.

I'm not. You're keeping it. It's a gift.

Damn it, Daddy,
why won't you just take the gun?

-(GUNSHOT)
-(GRUNTS)

Oh, my God! Daddy!
I'm so sorry.

(GASPS) It can't be too serious.

They haven't done
an overhead crane shot yet.

Oh, God! There it is!

-I'm calling 911.
-(LINE RINGS)

Oh, no. It's floating up,
signifying his spirit leaving his body.

(SINGLE MINOR KEY NOTE PLAYS)

And there's the single minor key note.

This is bad.

Family Guy will be right...
(SQUAWKS) Back.

Well, now it doesn't seem so serious.

Hey, quick question:

any of you guys know
how to countersue somebody?

Dr. Hartman, please, how's my father?

Well, at this point, it's hard to say.

He suffered severe head trauma.

So if you want to beat him in <i>Mario Kart,</i>
this is your chance.

(VIDEO GAME SOUNDS ON TV)

And the champ is dethroned.

Oh, poor Daddy.
You know what?

We're gonna bring him home with us
and take care of him until he's 100%.

What? Oh, come on, Mom.

I want Grandpa to get better, too,
but living with us?

-Why can't Grandma take care of him?
-Oh, she's busy.

She went to Antarctica to steal a penguin.

Penguin?

Daddy's gonna require
all our love and support.

Well, you got the right guy for that.
I'm great at supporting people.

On <i>Mad Men,</i>
I was Christina Hendricks' bra.

Joan, can you call a meeting
of the partners?

PETER: (MUFFLED) Help me.

Too much is being asked of me.

CHRIS: (MUFFLED) At least you're there.
I'm Jon Hamm's underwear.

STEWIE: (MUFFLED)
Why am I Elisabeth Moss's socks?

Chris and I should switch.

-CHRIS: Yeah, let's switch.
-STEWIE: We're gonna switch.

All right, Chris,
give me a hand with Carter.

JOE: Hey, I heard another chair.

Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

He's not paralyzed, Joe,
he's just recovering.

Ah.

All right, Daddy living here
is gonna be a big adjustment,

and we're all gonna
have to make sacrifices.

So, Meg, Daddy will sleep in your room,

and Stewie and Chris,
you'll stay where you are.

What? I'm the only one sacrificing.

Don't be ridiculous, Meg.
I said everybody's names.

Come on, Meg, it won't be
any worse than when I took

Gérard Depardieu to Burning Man.

(IN FRENCH ACCENT) I feel so free.

My breasts are muddied up.

I'm tripping balls.

Easy, Gérard, we're still
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

I'm gonna go crazy.

You can poop anywhere.

We'll take the insurance.

All right, Carter, now we're
gonna try and jog your memory

and get you talking
with some familiar pictures.

So I'll hold them up
and you say what they are.

What? You don't know who this is?

But he's <i>so </i>talented.

Anyone who doesn't know who he is
brings shame on his children and wife.

Peter, come on.
We're trying to help Daddy,

not relive our embarrassing loss
to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.

All right, fine. Next picture.

What? You don't know who he is, either?

Go on, Lois, scream at him
that he should know.

This guy was in a movie once.

That means we need to put
a fifth head on Mount Rushmore.

Damn it, Peter,
you should've known who he is.

Even Joe knew.

Yep, Joe sure did.

Hey, Ansel Elgort and Gemma Arterton
are in a Cary Fukunaga film.

Good for them.

All right, Daddy, I know <i>NCIS </i>is on,

but I want to watch <i>Real Housewives,</i>

unless you tell me not to.

(GRUNTING)

Oh, those two hate each other.

These two have a three-year-old feud

based on an offhanded remark
at a charity fashion show.

(GRUNTING)

I'm sure Andy Cohen will explain it all
on <i>Watch What Happens Live</i> after the show.

No! The show itself is bad enough!

We don't need another show
explaining what we just saw.

Daddy! You're back.

Please, anything but this show.

We could watch Netflix.

Uh, <i>Cleveland Brown:</i>

<i>You Startin' To See</i><i>What I'm Sayin'?</i>

<i>So, the president pulls the plug</i>
<i>on an investigation into the president?</i>

<i>You startin' to see what I'm sayin'?</i>

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Since you're doing a little better, Daddy,
I thought you should see where you work.

It might help trigger
more memories about your life.

I work here? Wow. This place is huge.

What do we do? Are we nice?

You put pesticides in baby food.

-Aw.
-Not only that,

-your chemical waste gave a town cancer.
-Yikes.

You burned down
the entire Amazon rain forest.

Whoops.

You're the number-one producer
of whale meat.

Sheesh.

-You dumped lead in drinking water.
-Zoinks.

Your oil pipeline
moved 12 Native American tribes.

-(WHISTLES)
-Your fertilizer plant exploded,

-killing 4,000.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)

-You bought Vine and shut it down.
-I did what?

-You bought Vine and shut it down.
-I did what?

-You bought Vine and shut it down.
-I did what?

I'm sorry, Daddy, but you're
a very cutthroat businessman.

And maybe worst of all,

you engage in constant,
gratuitous animal testing.

Sir, as you requested,
we had all the monkeys watch <i>Vikings.</i>

Did they like it?
Do they think it's worth

-me putting in the time?
-Uh, no.

-They didn't care for it.
-Good.

This is valuable information.

Now have them watch Sarah Jessica Parker
and Thomas Haden Church in <i>Divorce.</i>

Sir, they've just watched
66 consecutive hours of <i>Vikings.</i>

-If you could...
-Oh, what, so you want humans

to watch <i>Divorce?</i>

Because if monkeys don't,
that's what has to happen.

Wow, I guess I was
a cutthroat businessman.

But what about when I wasn't at work?
What did we do together?

Well, sometimes you made me reenact

<i>Kids in the Hall </i>sketches
that basically had no endings.

-(MUSICAL STING PLAYS)
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

But to be honest, we didn't do much.

-Your work always came first.
-Really?

And you still took care of me
when I was hurt?

I... I don't like who I was.

But from now on, I'm going to be
a better father and grandfather.

We're going to spend real time together.

Really? Oh, that'd be wonderful.

I haven't been this happy
since I went on Safari.

Oh, my God.
This is so much faster than Firefox.

(CHUCKLES) All right,
let me go to Facebook.

F-A... (SIGHS)

It's autofilling "Fat Butt Rodeo"?

Peter!

You were supposed to stay on Firefox.

Morning, pumpkin. I brought muffins.

-You brought pumpkin muffins?
-What? No.

-Wh-What?
-But you said...

You know what? Let's try it one more time.

Hey, sweetie pie. I brought muffins.

-You brought sweet pies and muffins?
-No.

-(MUSICAL STING PLAYS)
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

We've already done that.

Damn it, now it's gonna go back outside.

Wow, Daddy,
you really meant what you said.

It's been wonderful spending
so much quality time with you.

Yeah, Carter. You know,
you've always been a real bastard,

but I got to say, it's nice
to see you turning things around.

Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize

that I wasted my whole life
caring about money,

and I'm not giving up another second.

That's why I've decided
to retire from Pewterschmidt Industries

and give all my money to charity.

Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.

Yeah, Carter. Good for you.

Thanks. You know, I was a little worried

you guys would be mad
about losing your inheritance.

Oh, Daddy, I don't care.

I've seen what wealth's done to you,

and I certainly don't want that
to happen to us.

Besides, we're regular people.

We wouldn't miss millions
of dollars, right, Peter?

I'm thinkin' I might.

So, it's weird being Japanese.

Last night, my husband wanted 69.

I said, "Why do you want
beef and broccoli now?"

Hey, that's <i>Chinese.</i>

Look, I know you're upset
about losing our inheritance,

but when we got married,
the first thing I told you

is I didn't want Daddy's money.

Well, yeah, not now,
but I didn't know you meant forever.

Peter, stop being so selfish.

For the first time in my life,
I have a father who's kind

and wants to spend time with me.

And that's more important
than any inheritance.

Yeah, well, I still want that money.

It's the only way
I can afford that surgery

to turn myself into 100% stained glass.

-I don't get it.
-Neither do I.

Oh, my God.

Dad's beautiful.

All right, guys.
Now, the way I see it,

Carter's only giving away his money
'cause he's nice now.

So to get our inheritance,

we have to figure out a way
to make him mean again.

I don't know, Dad.
He seems pretty happy.

Anyone can get mad, Chris.
Even Shaquille O'Neal.

Excuse me.

My flapjacks was supposed
to have a Superman "S" on them.

Are you mad? I...
I can't tell if you're mad.

Very mad. This is unacceptable.

What's the point
of having millions of dollars

if everything can't be Superman?

Okay, well, we'll fix it right away.

Is there anything else I can get you?

Yes. A big ambulance.

I am stuck in this booth.

So, ideas. How do we
make Carter mean again?

Why don't we hire a prostitute
to bring him almost to completion?

Okay, don't love that my daughter
came out of the gates with that.

Why don't we just mix up
all the colors of his Play-Doh?

<i>Chris.</i>

Well, you know what gets
Gargamel all riled up

is those pesky Smurfs.
Maybe there's something there.

Ooh, I know, I know.

Why don't we hire a transvestite
to pick him up at a bar,

then take off her wig
at the exact moment of completion?

Yeah, Meg, take it down a notch.

I know what'll make him mad.

Let's get him a book for Christmas.

Didn't I get you all books for Christmas?

Yeah. And now I've got something
for you to read, genius.

It's called the room.

Hey, wait, I got something.
How do we summon Zuul?

I bet Zuul could help.

Why don't we take him
to a truck stop bathroom,

and then after completion, we...

Okay, Meg, are you trying
to get a rise out of me?

'Cause guess what, young lady?

It worked.

Well, at least I'm saying real ideas
and not just repeating things

I've seen in children's programming.

Yeah, Dad, I kind of agree with Meg.

It seems like you're going
for comedy over substance.

I see. Well, then,

I have one last idea
how to make Carter mean.

(VOICE BREAKING)
Turn him into one of my kids.

(SOBBING)

So, what do you want to do today?

You know, this may be crazy,

but I'd love to finally
play piano for you.

Cool, like Alicia Keys.

A piano player named Keys?

-That has to be fake, right?
-Yeah, I'd think so.

That's pretty dumb.
I mean, if I was in a band,

I wouldn't call myself Carter Guitar.

I know, right?

Actually, I like Carter Guitar.

-I want to be that now.
-Hey, I have an idea.

Why don't we do something together?

I'll play, and you sing.

Sounds great.
Who's the guy who married a kid

and then later on killed his wife?

-Jerry Lee Lewis.
-That's it.

<i>You shake my nerves</i>
<i>And you rattle my brain</i>

<i>Something, some-something</i>
<i>Something, something insane</i>

<i>Goodness gracious, great balls of fire</i>

(CARTER VOCALIZING)

Y-You don't have to sing the piano part.

I'm playing it.

All right, here's the plan.

I clothespin his balls.

Meg and Chris, you twist his nipples
in opposite directions.

I'm glad you came around.

Peter, you may want
to take a look at this.

<i>You shake my nerves</i>
<i>and you rattle my brain...</i>

Oh, my God. Look at them.

This is just what
she's been saying she wanted:

to spend time with her dad
and for him to love her.

I guess that really is
more important than money.

Wow. Dad's really taking this to heart.

Meg. Meg.

Tie my shoe.

Hey, let's do another.
How about my karaoke song?

Sure, what-what is it?

The theme to <i>Hill Street Blues.</i>

What? But that doesn't have any lyrics.

The hell it doesn't.

<i>Hill Street blues,</i><i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>I've got those Hill Street blues</i>

Wow, you're good.

Of course I'm good. I'm Carter Guitar.

<i>Hill Street blues,</i><i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>I've got those Hill Street blues</i>

There were some ugly people on that show.

That's what made it real.

ALL: <i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>Hill Street blues,</i><i>Hill Street blues</i>

<i>I've got</i><i>those Hill Street blues</i>

What are you doing here?

I'm sorry I only cared
about the money, Lois.

You were right. You having a dad
is way more important.

Thanks, Peter.

-Oh, my God! Daddy!

Who told Carter he could
give away our (BLEEP) money?

Daddy? Daddy, please tell me
you can hear me.

Wh-Wha... What's going on?

And what are you idiots doing here?

I can't waste time with you.
I'm a cutthroat businessman.

Aw, the gunshot changed him back.

Oh, thank God. There's my Carter.

Well, I guess it was nice
to have time with Daddy while I could.

And Peter, I'm glad you finally realized
family is more important than money.

Me too, Lois.

And I think we all learned
a valuable lesson about firearms.

That's right, Peter.
Guns create problems,

but they solve them, too.

You said it, Lois.
And you know who else has a gun?

Stan Smith. Take it away, Stan.

Peter, that's...
That show's not on after us anymore.

Oh. What is on?

Something as or more successful?

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
thanks for coming in to see me today.

Is this about Chris?

We know he's been struggling lately.

Well, let me put it this way.

(QUICKLY) Parents of
a failing student say what?

-What?
-No, Peter, wait.

Nope, too late. He said it.
I'm marking it.

Didn't get the Woos.
They're very smart. Asian.

Maybe they didn't understand me.
I don't know.

The point is,
Chris's grades aren't improving,

and just yesterday,
he caused a little ruckus

in his history class.

(RAPPING) <i>Alexander Hamilton was white</i>

I just can't understand
why he's doing so poorly.

We here feel that the best solution

is for Chris to attend something
called vocational school.

Yeah, you know what?
Chris deserves a vocation.

He's been working hard,
he's doing great in school...

No, vocational school is where

less academically capable
students learn a trade.

Don't you have to be Italian
to go to one of those schools?

Ugh, there will be plenty of those jokes
later in the episode.

Now, won't vocational school
limit Chris's options down the road?

Oh, hardly.

He'll have a wide range of career options,
such as the following...

(PEPPY MUSIC PLAYING)

Those are three terrible options.

(QUICKLY) Parents who are okay
with this say what?

-What?
-Gotcha.

That one's on you, Lois.

Why, Meg, don't you look pretty today.

Thanks, Mom.

She's going to ask you for something.

So, listen, I was wondering.

Do you think you could take Stewie
to a birthday party today?

The birthday boy was premature,

so he looks like
a 12-inch-tall Rachel Dratch.

Why can't you do it, Mom?

(GROANS) I can't take another party
with that trio of judgy sitcom moms.

Oh, hi, Lois.

Gosh, I just love how you
always look so comfortable.

I know. Are those pajamas?

And I'm the black one
for unrealistic diversity.

I can't believe I have to go
to vocational school.

Does this mean I'm a failure?

No, sweetie. It means that we're failures.

You know, I'm always at a loss
for words in these moments.

Fred Sanford, you want to do the honors?

Go get 'em, you big dummy.

Um, your show went off the air
40 years ago,

and you died 30 years ago,

so that phrase means very little to me.

I know it's a big step, honey,
but you can do it.

That's right, Chris.
This family's never shied away

from a new challenge,
like when I was the spokesman

for that perfume, Deschanel Number Five.

PETER: (WHISPERING) <i>Precious. Annoying.</i>

<i>Twee.</i>

<i>Hot, but not worth it.</i>

<i>Probably a nightmare in person.</i>

<i>Deschanel.</i>

<i>The fragrance</i><i>for when you want to smell</i>
<i>like a 40-year-old toddler.</i>

Can I help you?

Yes, I'm here for my first day
of vocational school.

Right this way.

<i>(THEN HE KISSED ME</i> PLAYING)

<i>Well, he walked up to me</i>

<i>And he asked me</i><i>if I wanted to dance</i>

<i>He looked kind of nice</i>

<i>When he danced,</i><i>he held me tight</i>

<i>And when he walked me home</i><i>that night...</i>

This notepad and pencil
is from Mr. Tony over there.

<i>And then he kissed me</i>

All right, settle down, you yucks.

We got a new student, Chris Griffin.

So everybody give him an "ayy."

STUDENTS: Ayy.

Look at that, your first day,
and you got all A's.

Come here, let me pinch your cheek.

Got all A's.

(LAUGHS) You're expressing
affection and dominance.

Griffin? Where's the "Ucci"
or "Squalotta" at the end?

-You Jewish?
-No.

It true, if you're Jewish,
they cut your dong off with an ax?

My uncle's Jewish.
Friggin' mess, that guy.

Hey, chip-chop, it's 9:30.
Let's start thinking lunch.

We do a nice sit-down thing here.

Little piccata, little veal.

Rocco here learned to cook in the joint.

Okay, everybody dirty up your hands,
we'll eat in ten.

Wow. This is way better than
that barber school I went to

where I couldn't stop pumping the chair.

Just a bit off the top
and shorter on the sides.

We're just gonna be pumping today.

(CHILDREN YELLING PLAYFULLY)

Did you bring the cups?

Um, uh, no.

My mom didn't say anything about cups.

(SCREAMS)

(PHONE CHIMES, VIBRATES)

All right, snack table.
Now, what do we got?

Loose Cheerios, Goldfish crackers,

pretzel sticks, and, ooh,

the siren's song of the unattended:
whole grapes.

<i>Come and eat us</i>

<i>We won't choke you</i>

<i>Put us in your cheeks</i>

Oh, okay. These grapes seem nice enough.
They said they won't choke me.

Hey, hey! Get off my sister!

-Go fly a kite, bub.
-Ouch.

Wow, that book really worked.

And, Meg, why are you on the couch?

You know you're not
supposed to be on the furniture.

Look at her.
She just sits there and takes it.

She deserves a better life
than this, Brian.

And you know what?
I'm going to give it to her.

How you gonna do that?

I don't know, but it's
going to be a challenge,

like trying to seem sad
while you're wearing flip-flops.

-(FLIP-FLOPS SLAPPING)
-I'm sorry for your loss.

Very sorry.

All right, Chris.

A big part of being a mechanic
is being completely shocked

when somebody hasn't had a particular item
on a restaurant menu.

Hey, Chrissie.
We're thinking about going over to Pete's.

You want a bread sandwich?

-What's a bread sandwich?
-What?

You never had
a bread sandwich from Pete's?

Everyone who's not currently in the room,
get over here.

Griffin's never had
a Pete's bread sandwich.

Whoa, whoa, what? You never had
a bread sandwich from Pete's?

We've covered this.
Somebody tell me what it is.

What do you think it is?
It's three pieces of bread.

Me, I like a piece of sourdough on top,
piece of sourdough on bottom,

and a nice piece of wheat in the middle.

I like to go rye, rye, rye.

I'm a rye guy.

Hey, you guys going to Pete's?
Someone get me a bread sandwich.

-Griffin's never had one.
-What?

-What?
-Guys.

I just called Pete's.
They're closed forever.

STUDENTS: What?

Who answered the phone?

All right, Stewie,
how do we make Meg popular?

I've got it all figured out.

They're posting the cast list
for the school play.

I'll just give Meg all the parts.

That way, she'll be
the most popular girl in school.

Good night, good night.

As sweet repose and rest.

Come to thy heart
as that within my breast.

(IN DEEP VOICE) O, wilt thou
leave me so unsatisfied?

(GRUNTING, PANTING)

(IN NORMAL VOICE) What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

faithful vow for mine.

(IN COCKNEY ACCENT) 'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

-Well, that didn't work.
-Don't worry, Brian.

Mr. and Mrs. G, thanks so much
for having us over for dinner.

Oh, it's our pleasure.

Chris has said
so many nice things about you.

Ah, maybe one or two of 'em are true.

(LAUGHING)

Chris, tell your mom and dad
about the story you wrote.

Oh, I don't know.

Chris, come on, don't be shy.

Okay. It's called "The Black Duck."

"The Black Duck."
You ever seen a black duck?

I seen a brown duck, a yellow duck,
a white duck with a green head.

Hey, there's all kinds of ducks.
This kid thinks of a black one.

Come on, it's just a stupid story, guys.

Hey! If it was such a stupid story,

why would it have such
a well-rounded protagonist?

Remember what I told you
behind the garage?

That you might be gay?

Wh-What? No, no, I didn't say that.

The-the imagination on this one.

Black ducks, I'm gay, what's next?

M-Martians? L-Little green Martian people?

Oh, Chris, I'm so happy you have
so many wonderful new friends.

He was very unpopular in high school.

Oh, yeah, you know, he's strong, too.

He takes care of a lot of stuff for us.

Stuff?

Yeah, he-he took care
of one of our competitors.

Mr. Firestone says hello.

Ow. Ow. Ow.

-Stop it. Stop it.
-(AIR HISSING)

Oh, my God, Chris!

That's silly, but it's still murder!

Relax. That Michelin Man had no family.

He came from tires, Ma!

All right, if we can't make Meg popular,
we can at least find her a boyfriend.

Neil, can you come out?
We need to talk to you.

NEIL: I can't open the door.
It's the Sabbath.

You can come around the back entrance.

(BOTH SIGH)

Why are all the lights off?

I can't turn them on myself.
It's the Sabbath.

Get the lights for me, will you?

Also, can you pick up the phone
and order me a pizza?

I can't do it. It's the Sabbath.

Listen, Neil, we really
wanted to talk about Meg.

That can wait.
I've just looked at some porn,

and I need you guys
to give me some assisted relief.

I can't do it myself. It's the Sabbath.

Okay, this-this is starting
to sound a little weird.

It's not weird. It's Jewish.

I can't believe we did all that
and he still turned us down.

I know, and al-also, Brian, it's Thursday.

Well, I am officially out of ideas.

Yes, there's literally no one in town

sad and desperate enough
to date my sister.

Hey, guys, can you hold my phone
and point it over this way?

I want to live-stream my suicide.

Yeah, sure, Kevin.

You know what it is, Stewie?
It's a selfishness.

It's an inability to look out
and see someone who needs someone.

It's-it's just... it's a lack of empathy.

Can you make sure
I'm totally in the frame?

Yeah, I'm not a pro. You get what you get.

Anyway, what is wrong
with people that they're

so myopic and just preoccupied
with their own little lives?

Is it on?

It's whatever it was
when you handed it to me.

The point is,
there's someone out there for everyone

if they're just willing
to open their eyes and look.

Wait a second! Don't you see, Brian?

Oh, my God, you're right!

Kevin, before you go through with this,

would you consider
taking Meg out for a date?

Meg? Why?

Look, we know you've had a hard road
ever since you came home from Iraq.

Well, this could be a chance
for you to help someone else

who maybe feels as bad inside as you do.

Okay. I'll ask her out.

Great. Call her tomorrow.

Tonight she's doing the fall play.

It's a one-woman performance of <i>Hair.</i>

<i>(Let the Sunshine In</i> from <i>Hair </i>playing)

(SLIDE WHISTLE)

(GIGGLES) I finished the book.

All right, Brian. Here comes Meg.

Now, don't let on
that we had anything to do

with Kevin asking her out.

Relax. I know how to keep my cool.

You guys!
I'm going out with Kevin Swanson!

Get out of here!

Brian, why are your hands on your hips?

(QUIETLY) Turn it down a notch.

Yeah, he asked me out.
Totally out of the blue.

Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

Get your hand off your cheek, you mess.

Principal Shepherd, we came to ask

if there's anything we can do
to get Chris back in the school.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I-I'm afraid we can't do that.

Oh, I think you can.

I think you can do that
and a whole lot more.

Oh, my God.

That is not what a testicle
is supposed to look like.

Has a doctor seen this?

What are you gonna do,
charge me with smoking?

Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid
you have testicular cancer.

I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

Oh, I think maybe there is.

If you keep doing that,
you're gonna pop it.

Stewie, I still don't understand
why we have to pretend

to work at the restaurant.

It's all part of the plan, Brian.

Meg and Kevin need to have
the perfect date.

That's why I gave
the rest of the staff the night off.

We have to be in total control
of the evening.

Two for Swanson.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I'm sorry,
we have nothing under that name,

-and we're all full.
-Oh, I...

Uh, actually, I think
a table just opened up.

Right this way.

-What the hell?
-Sorry, I choked.

Hi. We're the Hollender rehearsal dinner.

There are 46 of us.

Uh, Stewie, before you gave
the staff the night off,

did you check the reservation book?

I did not.

And to remind you,
24 of us selected the salmon,

16 the filet, and six vegetarian.

MAN: One vegan.

Five vegetarian, one vegan.

-What do we do?
-Just keep giving them crayons

until we figure it out.

-More appetizer?
-No, thanks.

Cauliflower gives me the scoots.

Chris, there's something your father and I
want to talk to you about.

Uh, Chris? Ch-Chris?

Sorry, I only answer to "Chrissie" now.

-Fine. Chrissie?
-Yeah, Ma?

Can you stop lifting your rusty weights
while we talk to you?

Chris, we're worried
about you and your new friends.

Pa, don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it.

-Okay.
-No, Peter, it's not okay.

Chris, we don't want you in the Mafia.

Hey, I'm in waste management.

Chris, you need to be back
in high school where you belong.

But Principal Shepherd
won't let you back in,

and we don't know what to do.

What do I need school for?
Tony Danza never went to school,

and he played a guy named Tony
on four different TV shows.

Lois, let me handle this.

Chris, I'm gonna say this in a way
an Italian mechanic would understand.

You're breaking your mother's heart!

Ma! Why didn't you say so, Ma?

I'll take care of it.

(DOOR CREAKS)

(DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

What have you got there?

A guy letting me back
into school says what?

-What? Damn it!
-Okay, see you on Monday.

-Oh, God.
-What? What is it?

The Hollender rehearsal dinner
review on Yelp.

"Undercooked and underwhelmed.

Argumentative staff."

I thought chicken sushi
was wildly inventive.

So, Meg, how was your night out
with your boyfriend?

-Actually, we broke up.
-Aw.

Aw, Meg, I'm so sorry.

Well, I guess some people are just
meant to be alone, you know?

They're so broken inside.

They're just not worth it.

Don't say that, Meg.
You're totally worth it.

I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Kevin.

He's a psycho. I dumped his ass.

So... you're okay with it?

Yeah, it actually felt great
to be empowered for once.

Good night, guys.

You know what, Brian, we actually did
make Meg's life a little bit better.

She got to dump someone.

Well, you know what
the real lesson is here, Stewie.

Brian, I'm being told
the show is running long.

-We've got to speed this up.
-Oh, that's okay.

I'm sure they can fix it
in editing. What I was saying...

Because it's all about family and...

In love. You see, the thing is...

-Love you, Brian.
-Tractor guy now! Who wants a ri...

So, Chris, how was
your first day back at school?

It was fine. I'll miss the guys
at vocational school,

but it is nice to be back where I belong.

-(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-I'll get it.

That's him.
That's the one who popped me.

-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

Did I not sound sure?

Please go back on the road!

<i>...takes punishment</i><i>in large doses...</i>

-My balls!
<i>-...and comes back for more!</i>

I like safe driving. My balls!

Thanks again for coming, guys.

It really means a lot to me.

Of course, honey. We wouldn't miss it.

Plus, it's a good excuse
to put on my winter coat

and find items from last year
still in the pocket.

Ooh, sticky pennies,
a rock-hard Starburst,

an appointment card
for my next dental appointment

that's already come and gone,

a ticket stub for a matinee
of <i>Interstellar,</i>

an unwrapped piece of Dentyne,

a yarmulke from when that Jewish guy died,

a breath mint
from the now-defunct Clorets corporation,

printed-out Mapquest directions
to Dave & Buster's,

Iron Man Band-Aid,

Flintstone vitamin I didn't take
'cause it was Barney,

refrigerator magnet from local electrician

who is now arrested,

and balled-up tissues
with last year's flu on it.

You done with your pocket bits?
It's freezing!

So the biathlon combines
cross-country skiing

-and rifle shooting?
-Yeah.

Well, that doesn't sound so hard.
Can I try?

I don't know if that's a good idea.

My event starts soon.

Meg, it is my duty
as a bad father to prove

that I can do anything my kids can do.

Okay, fine.

Here we go.

All right, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

I have to say, I'm very proud of Meg.

Who knew she was good at something?

Yeah, does anybody else
in the family have any secret talents

we don't know about?

I'm the Quahog edging champion.

That's great, Chris. Now what's that?

It's the practice of erotic sexual denial.

Go wait in the car.

And no edging!

MAN: <i>But he did continue edging,</i>

<i>bringing himself to the verge</i>
<i>of sexual pleasure,</i>

<i>only to stop</i><i>at the last moment.</i>

<i>I'm Ron Howard,</i><i>and I do voice-overs</i>

<i>for this show now, too.</i>

WOMAN: <i>But that was</i><i>the only voice-over</i>

<i>Ron Howard did for the show.</i>

<i>He asked for too much money.</i>

<i>I'm Kristen Bell, and I do</i>
<i>reasonably-priced voice-overs.</i>

MAN: <i>But her voice-overs</i>

<i>were not reasonably priced,</i>
<i>so they turned to me,</i>

<i>a guy who sounds</i><i>like Morgan Freeman,</i>

<i>but is not, in fact,</i><i>Morgan Freeman.</i>

<i>My name is</i><i>Josh Robert Thompson,</i>

<i>and I perform for scale.</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

You're going down, Meg.

-Lacey Chabert?
-That's right.

This should be my Olympics.

-Shut up, Meg.
-No, you shut up, Meg.

No, you shut up, Meg.

PETER: Shut up, Megs!

Yay, Meg!

Wow. Meg is going to the Olympics!

Let's celebrate by burning our lips
on vending machine hot chocolate.

-Ow!
-Ugh!

Mine has whipped cream,
so I didn't get it on the first sip.

Ow!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

Um, I, I'm not really good
at public speaking,

so I'll just say...
farble shlup muckle blop.

All right, Meg, I'll take it from here.

Hi. I'm Lois Griffin, Meg's mother.

You may also know me as the lady
who threw a plate of cheese

during that city council meeting.

(CROWD MURMURING)

But we got the streets plowed,
though, right?

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

MAN: The cheese worked, yeah.

I just wanted to say how proud
we are of Meg's accomplishment.

So it looks like the Griffins are going

to the Winter Olympics in Korea!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Do you think there'll be a gag
about the Jamaican bobsled team?

-No, probably not.
-Oh.

'Cause I was working
on my exaggerated shiver.

Burr. Burr. Oh.

(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT)
Yeah, man, it be cold.

(LAUGHING) Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, maybe.

There might be. Don't-don't go far.
Don't go far.

My race isn't for a few days,

so we should have plenty of time
to hang out.

Anyone want to grab some food?

Sorry, Meg, I can't.

I'm trying to land you some endorsements,

and I have a lead
with a very popular IBS medication.

Quick, say,

"I never let traveler's diarrhea
keep me grounded."

No!

Well, then you're just handing
this thing right to John Kruk!

Oh, my God, Brian, look.

-Who is that?
-Oh, that's figure skater

turned flamboyant commentator Johnny Weir.

I wonder where Tara Lipinski is.

I heard they always have to be

within quipping distance of each other.

Oh, she's in the hat!

Isn't she amazing?

I feel like she's my soul mate.

How is she your soul mate?

She looks like a baby,

and she's best friends with a gay guy.

-Her life is my life.
-I'm not gay.

Well, it's not me!

Come on, let's go meet them.

Hi. I just had to come over
and introduce myself.

My name is Stewie,
and I'm a huge fan of you guys.

Oh, it's nice to meet you, Stewie.

Yeah, it's always so nice
to meet our fans.

And can I just say,
the shape of your head is stunning.

Really? I get a lot of grief for it.

Some people say it looks like a football.

Okay, I don't know what that is,
but they're just jealous.

Every one of them.

Remember, nothing normal looks good.

Well, I have to say, you two
are the best thing to happen to sports

since the New York Knicks
finally changed their name.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>please welcome your 2018</i>
<i>New York Pieces-Of-Dog-</i>(BLEEP).

(CROWD BOOING)

(EXHALES)

Bitty bitty bop.

Funky, funky.

Wow, I can't believe

I'm on a first-name basis
with Tara Lipinski.

Now, refresh my memory,
is Tara the one who had the DUI?

No, that's Oksana Baiul.

Oh, sounds like something Gandalf says

at the foot of a mountain.

Oksana Baiul!

(TIRES SCREECH)

Okay, we can go in now.

Oh, God, here she comes!

Act like I said something funny.

I don't know, Stewie.

I think the Special Olympics
serve an important purpose.

So do I! Who thinks they don't?

I don't know. Ask this guy.

He's a dog.
He's just learning how to talk.

So, hey, Tara,
are you doing anything later?

I was thinking maybe we could
grab dinner or something.

Yeah, sure. You seem cool.
That could be fun.

All right then, it's a date.

Oh, I just need to make a call.

I was supposed to help the speed skaters
get their tights over their thighs.

(GRUNTING)

Stewie, it's not gonna fit!

Hey, we can do this.

I worked with Garth Brooks.
Shirt and pants.

Little secret... Garth wears leggings.

The denim pattern is projected on.

Hello, Kansas City!

Stick to the agreed-upon
choreography, please.

Ask who else has friends in low places.

BROOKS: Hey, who else here
has friends in low places?

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

All right, we got 'em back, baby.

Whoa, Ryan Lochte?

-Uh, where?
-You.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, are you athlete?

No, I just like wearing clothes
that feel like pajamas.

That's most of what being athlete is.

Wait, aren't you a summer sport guy?

Oh... it's cold.

Here's a beer. Follow me.

MORGAN FREEMAN: <i>Peter partied all night</i>

<i>with international bozo</i><i>Ryan Lochte.</i>

<i>And this voice-over</i><i>was actually covered</i>

<i>by my original payment.</i>

Stewie, I'm very impressed.

I didn't know you skated.

Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

Like I'm always full of surprises.

-(SNAPS FINGERS)
-(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS)

-BRIAN: Did it work?
-Yes. Yeah.

You were supposed to be quiet!

Would you like to join me for a dance?

Wow!

STEWIE: <i>But that's</i>
<i>not how it really happened.</i>

Would you like to join me for a dance?

BRIAN: Oh-ho! Wow.

Ow! Ow! I bit my tongue!

-I swallowed the piece!
-Oh, my God, are you okay?

Don't go on the ice. It's too slippery.

I'll crawl back. Don't watch me.

(GROANING)

-Hi, hi, hi.
-Oh. Hey, Johnny.

I'm just gonna run to
the bathroom real quick. B-R-B.

Oh, she's a regular Tinkle Britches.

(IN DEEP VOICE) Get the hell out of here,
you little maggot.

What... What... Johnny?

-What happened to your voice?
-This <i>is </i>my voice.

You think I actually talk like that?

That's just something I do
to get the skater chicks.

-Does Tara know?
-Nah. She don't like guys like me.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
She likes guys like me.

Wait, but she had a great time
with me tonight.

(IN DEEP VOICE) Yeah, that's what she does
with her gay friends.

But you're her gay friend.

What'd you say, you little (BLEEP)?

Is everything okay out here?

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Yeah, I was just looking at his shirt.

I love this Nordstrom Rack.
How was the tinkle?

It was good. I also dumped.

You're so bad.

Anyway, sad emoji face,
Stewie has to leave.

Oh. Okay. Bye, Stewie.

I had a wonderful time.

Me... me, too.

(IN DEEP VOICE)
Not as good as I'm gonna have.

And I know what a (BLEEP) football is.

Killed me to say that.

Hey, you flush underwear in train toilet?

Yeah, they, uh, th... they were done.

This illegal. I want you off train!

What are you gonna do about it?

You're just a train conductor...

who has a huge kicking foot?

Aah!

Aah! Oh!

Where the hell am I?

Oh, my God, I'm in the wrong Korea.

That's it. Like your missiles,
I'm about to go ballistic.

PETER: <i>But that's not</i>
<i>how it really happened.</i>

That's it. Like your missiles,
I'm about to go ballistic.

Ow! A northern bird flew into my nuts!

(GROANS) Go to commercial.

(SNIFFING)

That's weird.

It doesn't smell like open butt in here.

Peter?

Huh, he's usually up by now
dry-heaving in the shower.

Hi, I'm pink-eyed Bob Costas,

live from our Pyeongchang studios,

here to bring you breaking news,

and occasionally blink off-synch

in an attempt to satisfy
my searing eye itchiness.

A U.S. tourist, Peter Griffin,

has been apprehended by North Korea

and is being held prisoner
for what I'm being told

is trespassing and doing
that thing with your eyes

that makes you look Chinese.

Damn it. Why does Peter have to
ruin every family vacation?

Just like he ruined
our trip to <i>La La Land.</i>

Hey, guy who's never been
uncool in a movie,

I requested "Dominick the Donkey"

like an hour ago.

It's Christmastime,
and I want greaseball songs.

(SIGHS)

<i>Hey, chingedy ching</i>
<i>Hee-haw, hee-haw</i>

<i>It's Dominick the donkey</i>

<i>Chingedy ching</i>
<i>Hee-haw, hee-haw</i>

<i>The Italian Christmas donkey</i>

<i>La, la, la-la</i>

Ooh, like the movie!

<i>La-la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

<i>La, la, la</i>
<i>La, la, la-lee, oh, dah!</i>

Again.

(IN DEEP VOICE) Hey,
sorry about last night, bro.

-No hard feelings?
-Yes, hard feelings.

I told you, I really liked her.

Yo, relax. We only had awesome sex.

Geez. All right, see you later.

I got to go wash Tara's lipstick
off my ass.

Well, at least I have a side,

you neutral Swiss cowards!

Oh, hey, Stewie, how's it going?

Terrible. Johnny Weir's
making my life a nightmare.

I really thought I had a shot
with Tara Lipinski,

and he ruined it.

I'm sorry to hear that.

You want me to take him out for you?

Really? You'd do that for me?

Of course.
I owe you for getting me that job

with Gloria Allred.

(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

CHRIS: <i>They say if you get</i>
<i>a job doing what you love,</i>

<i>you never work a day</i><i>in your life.</i>

Now it's clothes, now it's clothes,

now it's clothes.

This is for my brother,
you Tom Hiddleston lookalike!

-(IN DEEP VOICE) You serious, bro?
-Oh, no.

Now you're gonna beat me up
like a Batman fight,

only with gay words.

Kids, Brian, I've got some bad news.

Your father has been kidnapped
by North Korea.

We've got to save him.

But my race is this afternoon.

I know, but your father needs us.

I don't care. Where was he
when I needed help?

Where were any of you guys?

This was supposed to be my week.

Down here, it's my time.
It's my time down here!

-Is that from <i>Goonies?</i>
-I think so, yeah.

So you guys can all go.

But I'm staying here, and I'm competing.

And I'm gonna go inside,
outside, inside, outside.

And I'm gonna get 'em on the run, boys.

And once I get 'em on the run,
I'm gonna keep 'em on the run.

Wow, she knows a lot
of Sean Astin speeches.

Go. You don't care.

The only thing you care about
is nugs, chilling and grindage.

<i>Encino Man.</i> Sean Astin, deep cut.

Me? Oh...

(STARTING GUN FIRES)

SPECTATOR: Go, everyone but her.

(SPECTATORS CHEERING)

Wait, before you kill me,

can you at least give me an extra bullet

so I can pretend to catch one in my teeth?

(GUNS CLICKING)

MEG: Lacey Chabert!

Meg!

(GROANS)

Meg, that was amazing!

But how we gonna get out of here?

-We're surrounded.
-There's only one way.

An impossible video game escape.

Ooh, can it be <i>GoldenEye?</i>

-Sure.
-Yes!

PETER: <i>Bond. James Bond.</i>

<i>Don't worry, Meg, it's less sad</i>
<i>'cause they don't bleed.</i>

(GRUNTING)

<i>Oh, don't shoot this guy.</i>
<i>He was nice to me.</i>

<i>Aw, never mind.</i>

(GROANS)

<i>These guys are terrible shots.</i>

<i>I love this</i><i>almost James Bond music.</i>

<i>Meg, this is what</i><i>1997 looked like.</i>

<i>It's my turn next try.</i><i>I want to go next.</i>

(GRUNTS)

<i>You think one guy had to</i>
<i>shovel this whole walkway?</i>

<i>Ugh, great, more stairs.</i>

<i>This is how you know</i><i>we're done.</i>

Peter, you're safe!

Yep, and it's all thanks to Meg.

But, Meg, what about your race?

Well, I realized that
it wasn't worth doing

if you guys weren't there with me.

Oh, Meg, we are so sorry

for how we treated you this week.

You may not have won
a gold medal in the games,

but you won one in our hearts.

What do you say, guys, should we go home?

I don't know, I'm thinking
maybe we can hang out a little bit longer,

see what else Korea has to offer... Uh-oh.

No! You leave Korea now!

-(GRUNTS)
-PETER: Meet me wherever I land...

MORGAN FREEMAN: <i>Peter landed</i>
<i>somewhere in the DMZ,</i>

<i>and was recaptured</i><i>by North Korea.</i>

<i>Fortunately, tensions caused</i>
<i>by this international incident</i>

<i>were resolved</i><i>by the steady hand</i>

<i>of Dennis Rodman,</i>

<i>who let Kim Jong-un win</i>

<i>in a one-on-one</i>
<i>basketball game against him,</i>

<i>continuously saying,</i><i>"Oop, you got me,"</i>

<i>in a way that was</i><i>just convincing enough</i>

<i>for Kim to believe.</i>

Nobody does that anymore.

I like to keep up on local news.

Huh, most of these arrests are Cleveland.

And the arresting officer is Joe Swanson.

JOE: Can I help you, sir?

CLEVELAND: I'm doing my mail route, Joe.

JOE: Maybe you'd be more comfortable
talking about it down at the station.

You're right.
It <i>is </i>more comfortable here.

Oh. Yeah. A friend invited me

A friend? She's 100!

What are you up to?

Nothing. I enjoy her company.

Older women are cultured, worldly.

I've got nothing to be defensive about.

Her husband passed away.
She appreciates my friendship.

I'm providing companionship.
Dogs are known for that.

I don't like it.

(GRUNTS)

Peter, I need you to mow the lawn.
It's out of control.

I can't mow the lawn, Lois.

The Friends of Distinction are out there,
grazing in the grass.

<i>It sure is mellow grazing in the grass</i>

Oh. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

Mmm, that was a good toilet dream
about my neighbor and his lawn.

Peter, I don't care who's grazing.
The lawn looks terrible.

Get out there and mow it.

Why can't Chris mow it?
He's old enough.

Look, I'm all for Chris mowing the lawn,
but you got to teach him.

Fine, I'll do it tomorrow.

After my weekend job as a zookeeper
with very muscular thighs.

"Thigh" there, nice to see you all.

As you can see right here and here,

I am qualified to be a zookeeper.

This is my friend Frederick.

And I'm sure you're all
wondering how much I can squat.

you'll have to go to my Instagram,

YourThighness99.

Now, I'd like to open up
the floor for questions.

-Yes, what food does the bird...
-Not about the bird!

Now, who wants to see me
jump over this fence

from a standing start?

Let me scooch these shorts up
a little "thigher."

Look out, elephants!

This? Oh, yeah, I-I've had this.

Nobody's owned one of those for 80 years!

What are you up to?

You already did this.

I'm not trying to show skepticism.
My head is too heavy!

I heard the doctor whisper to Lois,
"3,000th percentile."

Okay, Chris, now, if you're
gonna learn how to mow a lawn,

the first lesson is that
you always start by 7:00 a.m.,

before everyone wakes up,
including roosters.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

What the...

-Hey, shut up!
-PETER: You shut up!

Oh, real original.

Now, to start the mower,

you grab this pull cord like so
and give it a nice hard yank.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

Can I change my grip?

(ENGINE SPUTTERS, STARTS)

Wow, much better.

It's a more familiar motion.

You know, I've been looking
for a muscley-armed young fella

to mow my lawn.

Sorry, Mr. Herbert,
but I don't even want to mow this lawn.

You could bring your friend
over there to help you.

Come on, Herbert.
Rope this calf.

Would $600 a week change your mind?

Uh, would it?
(CHUCKLES) You got a deal!

And I can pay you under the table.

I like to make a little fort under there.

I call it Fort Dix.

He'll pay us $600!

about Fort Dix?

Oh, Admiral, you've been
so good to me these past weeks,

and me alone to tend
to his massive estate.

You know, helping you
might have been difficult

were you not so utterly charming.

(CHUCKLING) Oh...

Plus, helping you helps me forget
my own country's troubles

and my struggle to save
our national flower,

the <i>Masdevallia </i>orchid.

(GASPS) That's my favorite flower.

And pet charity.

(GASPS) Really?

I've devoted my life
to raising money to save it.

What a coincidence.

You <i>and </i>the count.

-The count?
-Yes, of Monte Hall.

We like to October in Zurich.

Ah, yes, the best place to October.

The secret, however,
is to October in Zurich

but in September, to avoid
the obnoxious Octobering crowds,

saving October for Paris,
Novembering there,

then Decembering in Palm Beach in November

and, in December, Januarying, of course,
as always, in Gstaad.

We December in London.

You, madame, are a cream-faced loon.

Count, I don't believe
you've met the Admiral.

Well, he may be an Admiral,
but he's certainly not <i>admirable.</i>

So, Admiral, you must have had
quite the military career.

Your honors are impressive.

Is that medal
a stretched-out carnival penny?

Thank you for noticing, Count.

It means a lot from a man whose top hat

looks suspiciously like an Amazon Echo
with a cardboard brim.

Why, wha-wha-what a preposterous notion!

-No, don't say that!

This is my scam.
Now butt out.

Now, why would I do that, Brian?

These old bags are going to die.

Someone's going to end up
with their money.

(SIGHS) Look, all right,
there's no reason to sabotage each other.

There's plenty of Newport heiresses
for the both of us.

Maybe we could even help each other.

Exactly.

Two con men like us working together?

We'll be set.

It wasn't a trick.
It was stuck to your neck.

Oh, yeah.

She goes by "Pip."

-Pip.

Been trying to schmooze her for months.

The only catch is her 95-year-old husband
is still hanging on by a thread.

I can't make a move until he dies,
which, hopefully, is any day now.

If we can charm her,
we'll be set for life.

I'll be down in a minute.

Hey, boys. I've got some cookies

You don't even live together.

She's old.
She says, "You weren't here yesterday."

I say, "Yes, I was." And that's it.

Our top story:

Newport's wealthiest heiress,
Margaret Woolworth...

Holy God, I'm not reading all that.

...was found dead in her home
of an apparent heart attack.

-Did you...?
-No. Did you?

No. You think Quagmire did?

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

You, uh... You guys actually did it.

And made it look like a heart attack.

Wow. I, uh...
I didn't think you had it in you.

I... I guess you thought wrong.

Listen, I-I know there's been
some bad blood between us,

but I-I promise, it won't happen again.

I hope you can forgive me.

Well... just watch your step.

Well, a deal's a deal,
so here's your share of the estate.

Just sign here.

-We're rich!
-We're rich!

(BOTH LAUGH)

We're rich, Stewie.

And no flip joke can take that away.

Gentlemen, due to a disastrous investment
in a <i>Mindy Project</i> amusement park,

Miss Woolworth etcetera, etcetera,
died owing $18 million,

for which you are now liable.

We owe money?

Look, Stewie, it-it could be worse.

We could be dead, like Margaret.

You're right. Poor thing.

I guess she just died of natural causes.

What a couple of rubes.

I'm finally out
from under that crushing debt.

I suppose I don't need this anymore.

Webster's defines "class"
as "a group of students

"gathered at a pre-ordained time
for the purposes of education."

Angela pretty much
epitomized class.

Who could turn the world on

Who could take a nothing day

and suddenly make it all
seem worthwhile? Angela.

So no one told you life

Angela.

I'm sorry. Death is hard for me.

But at least Angela died
doing what she loved:

swimming less than 20 minutes
after she had eaten.

That's a real thing, kids.
Listen to your mothers.

That was Angela.
Fearless. Spontaneous.

Honest, about herself
just as much as she was

about the world around her.

She had grace, courage,
and an unmatched zest for life.

She may be gone,
but her voice will live on

So, Peter, we've been tasked
with making the operations

around here
run more efficiently,

and part of that will involve

We want you to be

So we're gonna
put a flag on you,

and wherever you go,
people will know

that's where they put
their recyclables.

Please don't just
throw them over.

the liquids are gone, please,

Let me do my intro!

Okay, we're gonna go up
to people and give a dollar

to everyone who recognizes you.
Let's go.

Sir, sir, sir, for a dollar,
do you know who this is?

-No.
-Oh, come on, he's in a new commercial.

I don't even own a TV.

Oh, you don't own a TV?
I'm very impressed! Let's go!

Sir, sir, quick, tell me.

-Who is this man?
-Uh...

<i>Adweek </i>magazine called him
the Pitchman of the Year.

Who doesn't read <i>Adweek?</i>

(PANTING) There's, uh,
there's more running

than I thought there'd be.

-Oh, is he Jerry Ferrara?
-Jerry Ferrara?

You mean Turtle from <i>Entourage?</i>
You're the worst!

Even worse than
the <i>Entourage </i>movie!

Mark Wahlberg is one of
our finest producers!

I-I don't, uh, I-I don't feel
comfortable doing this.

He was just getting a cup
of coffee with his daughter.

-They should know you!
-Hey, you're Pawtucket Pat.

Yes, thank you!
He's Pawtucket Pat!

Not that I watch this show.

I watch <i>Black Mirror </i>and
<i>The Goldbergs, </i>and that's it!

Wow, can I get
a picture with you?

-No!
-What's his problem?

Between you and me, I think
he may need a lady friend.

Peter, I'm famously gay!

Oh, my God,
he ran around the world.

Hey, so how's the whole
Pawtucket Pat thing going?

Aw, it's the best.

Everywhere I go,
people recognize me and love me.

And the other day,
I even got to hang out

with a bunch
of other famous mascots.

So, you, uh, you really make
all those cookies in that tree?

-They're great!
-Like, the tree is wood.

Like, how does the tree
not catch on fire?

Hey, you want to cool it
with that drumming?

Anyway, do you have
to water your house?

-'Cause I would think that...
-Ho ho ho!

You know what, let's just forget
the conversation

and just pose for the picture.

By the way, Tony,
I'm sorry your wife was shot

by Donald Trump's children.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

(ALTERNATING WORDS) Hi, Peter.
It's me, Sheila, and me, Bert.

Here's a dollar!
Stop talking like that!

Sorry about him.
We ruined people's days

in New York earlier.

We came by to share
some great news.

That's right.

Your character's so popular,

you're gonna have a balloon
in the annual Quahog Parade!

-No way. That's awesome!
-Said no one ever.

Ah. (LAUGHS) Yes.
I've seen that on the Internet.

Uh, who is this?

Oh, that's my dog, Brian.

You have a dog that makes jokes
and drinks beer?

Not just any beer.

Pawtucket Patriot
Truckers Blend.

-Ah, I approved that.
-Oh, this is just what we need.

-You guys are great together.
-What are you talking about?

Well, think about it, Peter.
The public loves Pawtucket Pat.

Imagine how much
they'd love to know

he has a funny sidekick dog
who drinks with him.

Wow, that could be really cool.
What do you say, Brian?

You're saying you need
a mascot's sidekick?

Hold my beer.

Uhp, that's also
from the Internet.

Hi, I'm Bert of Bert and Sheila.

And I'm Sheila.

All right. Now, before
we bring out Daughtry...

LOIS: Hurry it up!
Some of us came for Daughtry!

...it's our pleasure
to introduce Pawtucket Pat

and his new sidekick
Hops McElaney,

the Alcoholic Dog. Come on, y'all!

(CROWD CHEERING)

-Say, Brian...
-"Hops."

-Hops.
-Yes, Peter?

-"Pat."
-Pat.

What were you doing
up on the roof last night?

-Well, Peter...
-"Pat."

Pat. I was up on the roof

because you told me
drinks were on the house.

(CHEERING)

Nice one, Brian.

-"Hops."
-Hops.

MAN:
Let's hear more from the dog!

CROWD (CHANTING):
Hops! Hops! Hops!

LOIS: And Daughtry!

I'm sorry, sir,
you can't park here.

This spot is reserved
for the brewery mascot.

Yeah, I am the brewery mascot.

No, you're the brewery mascot's
sidekick.

What the hell? I'm the sidekick?

Aw, my life can't get any worse.

Hey, at least
you're not getting attacked

by a goose for no reason.

Hey, you got bread, bro?
Give me that bread, bro.

Come on, bro. Bro.

(SCREAMS)
Help me, Officer Goosefear!

Guys, from now on,
I need to stand this up

in the middle of your table.

(CHUCKLES)
Pawww yeah!

'Cause he's a dog.

Man, I hate being a sidekick
to this stupid dog.

-Yeah, I can imagine, Peter.
-I doubt you can, Quagmire.

None of you can.

-Well, I think I understand...
-I'm talking, Glenn.

I doubt any of you can begin
to know what it's like

to ride someone's coattails,

to play second fiddle
to some fat idiot,

to constantly be setting up
someone else's...

JOE: <i>It's</i> The Joe Show

<i>Starring Joe</i>

<i>Doing all sorts</i>
<i>Of Joe things</i>

<i>Not your average joe</i>
<i>And also he can walk</i>

PETER: ...just a footnote
to someone else's narrative.

I tell you, this sucks worse

than being a monkey at Coachella.

Dude, it sucks this year.
There's no good bands.

-There's Bananarama.
-There's, like, one good band.

Hey, Brian, you want
to go to the park?

The public park?

Uh, no, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

Because of Beaglemania.

-What?
-My fame.

-That's what they're calling it.
-Who's calling it Beaglemania?

Well, you just did. Catching on.

Well, leave it to you
to ruin it.

Just like Dasani ruined water.

Hey, guys, so you know
how water tastes like nothing?

Well, what if it tasted like
every bottle had a nickel in it?

I want you to sign my chest.

And I want to hawk a loogie
in your face.

(SNORTS, SPITS)

I want you to sign my ass.

And I want to hawk a loogie
in your face.

(SNORTS, SPITS)

I want you
to autograph my stomach.

Okay, fine, but do me a favor:
don't spit on my friend.

Hey, Brian?

Why don't you mind
your own (BLEEP) business?

Oh, God, again
with this Beaglemania?

-Where'd you get those T-shirts?
-From Brian.

He says it's really catching on.

-Well, it isn't. It's a joke.
-It's no joke for him, Dad.

He even recorded <i>The Bite Album.</i>

-(CAT MEOWING, DOG BARKING)
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

-K-nine. K-nine. K-nine.
-(WIND GUSTING)

K-nine. K-nine.

Coming up, uncomfortable pause

as anchor throws to reporter
in the field.

But first, hey, hungover dads,
want to go to a parade?

Does that sound like fun
on a Sunday morning?

Not just being worried
about your kids,

but everyone else's kids
around you, too?

For more,
here's Tricia Takanawa.

<i>Apparently we've lost Tricia...</i>

Tom, I'm standing here
outside some public toilets

where dads who are really
hurting will be vomiting

in front of their
still-developing children.

The parade is tomorrow,
but already the giant balloons

are being inflated, including
two newcomers this year:

Pepe, the alt-right frog,

and Hops the Dog,
the beloved beer pitchman.

Aw, man.
Brian gets his own balloon?

This can't get any worse.

In fact, Hops is so popular
that hundreds of Quahog women

have volunteered to blow up
his balloon.

(EXHALING)

Aw, that's the cashier
at the CVS I like.

ANNOUNCER 1: And here comes
the marching band,

led by baton twirler Jane Duncan,

whose aunt is famously-thin
actress Bebe Neuwirth.

Jane lists her hobbies
as baton twirling

and trying to contact her aunt.

And, look,
is that the beer mascot

you've all been waiting for?

ANNOUNCER 2:
That's right, it's Hops the Dog.

Stupid Brian. Can't even
wave to the crowd right.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Hi! Thanks for coming out. Hi!

CROWD (CHANTING):
Hops! Hops! Hops!

Where's Dad?
He's missing this.

Say good-bye, Hops.

HOTEL EMPLOYEE:
Excuse me, sir?

Are you a guest of the hotel?

I, uh...
I'm just here for an event.

Oh, are you part
of Sarah's bridal brunch?

Uh, yeah. Yeah.

Can't-can't believe
she's heading down the aisle.

Well, they're making speeches
in the Santa Fe Lounge.

If you hurry,
you can still get yours in.

Well, Sarah, another turning
point, a fork stuck in the road.

Who is he again?

I think he's that guy
from the funeral.

You know, part of me
is glad Sarah met Henry,

because she and I had a pact
that if neither of us

was married by 40,
we'd get hitched.

And I think you all know
how that would have gone.

(laughter)

Everybody, get down!

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING)

So, to Sarah and Henry.

May they have a long
and happy marriage.

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Tom, I'm standing here
along the parade route

where the Hops balloon
has just been punctured,

and is now raining helium

(HIGH-PITCHED)
down on the crowd,

creating chaos
and wreaking havoc.

(TIRES SCREECH)

(HIGH-PITCHED)
We have an active shooter!

I repeat,
we have an active shooter!

I can't stress the seriousness
of this situation enough!

(HIGH-PITCHED)
This is a disaster!

(HIGH-PITCHED)
Brian, you're fired.

(HIGH-PITCHED) What do you
mean? This isn't my fault.

(NORMAL VOICE) I'm never
drinking this beer again.

My voice is impervious to helium.

What a mess, huh?

Hey, Peter, sorry all that fame
went to my head.

And I'm sorry
I shot your balloon.

How'd you get out
of jail so fast?

I took a hostage.

-It's an ongoing situation.
-(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

(SIREN WHOOPING)

WOMAN: Honey, close that window
and come to bed.

-In a minute.
-Greg Mitchell,

sometimes I feel like
I married you and that window.

The two of you
are more similar than you think.

And how's that?

Well, for one thing,
you're both a real pane.

Hey, you guys ever check Zillow?

Joe, why don't you shut the...

Tell me more about this silly word.

It's this website, Zillow.com.

You plug in your address,
and it gives you an estimate

of what your house is worth.

But they call it a Zestimate,

because of the "Z" in "Zillow."

(LAUGHS)

How do they...

I just don't have that creative bone.

Wow, my house is way up
from when I bought it.

-Mine's up, too.
-What the hell?

Mine's way below what you guys are worth.

Wait, this-this can't be right.

It says... it says
my house is a murder house.

What, like-like someone was killed there?

Yeah, it says... it says, in the '60s,

some woman named Doris Billingsly
died in my house.

Probably some naggy bitch, right?

-Joseph!
-You know, they say

when someone dies violently like that,

-their spirit can linger.
-What do you mean?

I'm saying you might have a g-g-g-g-g...

disembodied spirit in your house!

Wow, this is so cool.

Have you ever witnessed
anything strange there?

Actually, now that you mention it...

Good news! The biopsy was negative.

Did you hear something?

(IMPERCEPTIBLE)

Hi, Chris.

Oh, hey, Kristen. What's up?

Not much. I wanted to know
if you're gonna go to the dance on Friday.

Nah, probably not.

Oh, that's too bad.

I was thinking maybe
you and I could go together.

Oh, that's sweet, but, like I said,

I-I don't think I'm gonna go.

-Well, if you change your mind...
-I said no!

Okay. Geez.

Bye, Chris.

Uh, Chris, that very attractive girl
just asked you out, and you said no.

Well, sorry, Brian,
she just doesn't do it for me.

I'm hungry. I might grab a bite to eat.

We all just ate, right?

What's wrong with that kid?

Why wouldn't he go out with that girl?

Who knows? Maybe he's gay.

What? No.

Well, you never know. I say we find out.

You think he could be?

Hey, I've been right
about these things before.

Remember what I said in 2009?

-Bruce Jenner is a man.
-No, Brian.

That's what the press would
have you believe, but he's not.

Bruce Jenner is a woman.
An elegant, beautiful Dutch woman.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

Okay, guys, now, the murder took
place down here in the basement,

so it's probably our best shot
at finding something.

I do feel a presence in the air.

CLEVELAND: Only Lucifer would reveal
himself to you, adulterer.

Well, now, I have to warn you fellas--

the only spirits I'm used to chasing
are whiskey and tequila.

(ALL LAUGHING)

That's so Joe!

(BOWLING PINS CLACKING)

Wow, what's going on down here?

Trying something new for Joe.

And we're looking for ghosts.

We're like the male version
of the female <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

Peter, there's no such thing as ghosts.

I don't know why you guys
listen to a word he says.

(CHUCKLES) That's so Lois.

(CASH REGISTER DINGS)

All right, we ready?

GLENN: Wow, it is creepy.

So, what do we do?

PETER: Just follow my lead.

Are there any spirits present
that would like to communicate with us?

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

-(PETER SCREAMS)
-(THUMPING)

GLENN: What the hell was that?

I got scared and tried to run
through the wall,

leaving a hole shaped like me.

Yeah, can't do that in a basement, bud.

All right, fellas, I just
finished up an EVP session.

-Let's see if we picked anything up.
-What's EVP?

Electronic voice phenomenon.

Oftentimes, the human ear
can't pick up paranormal sounds,

-but electronic recording devices can.
-Mm. That right?

(PETER ON RECORDING)

(FARTS)

(GASPS)

(FARTING)

Is this whole thing just you
beefing into the microphone?

Yeah.

Dad, they did this bit
in the lady <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

Did you hear something?

Stewie, I'm telling you,
there's no way Chris is gay.

Oh, why, because he never hit on you?

God, the ego.

Hey, Chris. What's up?

I'm just relaxing, listening to some
of Charles Manson's music.

What's up with you guys?

Actually, Brian and I are taking a survey,

and we wanted to see
if you had a few minutes.

-Sure. Go ahead.
-Okay, question one.

What night are the Tony Awards?

Tony Danza has awards?

Name an appropriate price
to pay for jeans.

Um, five dollars?

What year did Bette Midler release
"You've Got to Have Friends"?

Oh, 1972.

And it was fabulous!

Chris, are you gay?

What? No, I'm not gay.

Well, then why didn't you go out
with that girl?

(CHUCKLES) Why would I?

I have everything I need in
that department on my computer.

You have 28 windows of porn
playing simultaneously?

Sometimes I pretend I'm at
the security desk at the mall

and everyone at the mall
is banging each other.

Chris, don't you see?

You're so desensitized by all this porn,

you're-you're not even interested
in actual girls.

Wh-What are you doing?

I'm taking this, and we are
gonna help you start thinking

about sex like a normal teenager.

All right, I'll give it a shot.

But it's not gonna be easy.

I had a hell of a time getting off sugar.

-Chris, can you pass the syrup?
-Oh, you want the syrup, old man?

(GRUNTING)

(SHOUTS)

Yeah!

(CACKLING)

(LAUGHS)

Yeah, nice attached head, Meg.

Body, throw potatoes.

-(GRUNTS)
-Winner declared!

Okay, guys, now, I thought
we could try to find the ghost

by doing the movie <i>Flatliners.</i>

-I've never seen it.
-Me, neither.

Oh, my God. All right, we are
stopping everything right now

and watching <i>Flatliners.</i>

KENNY LOGGINS: <i>I'm all right...</i>

I'm glad we switched to <i>Caddyshack.</i>

You know what, Peter, I think
I've had enough ghost hunting.

-I'm done, too.
-Yeah, I'm out.

-Wait, why you leaving?
-Because all you do is screw around.

We've been down here for hours,
and we haven't found a thing.

Well, maybe that's because you
guys don't know the first thing

about catching ghosts.

You know what, Lois was right.

We should just never listen to you.
Come on, guys.

I think you're all just scared.

Oh, yeah? Let's see who's scared.

What are you doing?
Turn that light back on.

GLENN: Have a good night, Peter.

-(POUNDING AT DOOR)
-PETER: Quagmire. Help!

Someone help me! Hey! Open this door!

Don't leave me alone with the ghost!

Peter, are you okay?

I was... down here all night.

So dark.

Oh, my God. Peter, your hair.
It turned white.

What?

(GASPS)

Well, I'm a fat dad with white hair now.

Time to become an issue
at Hooters after 9:00 p.m.

Hey, Ashley. Ashley.

Ashley.

I know... I know what car is your car.

So, how'd you get white hair again?

He was scared of a ghost.

Yes, I remember hearing
about this in med school.

Or was it a <i>Scooby-Doo?</i>

-You think it's gonna stay, Dr. Hartman?
-No, it's gonna be "Dr. Ramirez" now.

I'm taking my husband's name.

I'm talking about Peter's hair.

Oh, I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)
Wedding on the brain.

But, uh, as for the white hair,
I'm afraid it's permanent.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hi, sweetie.

We've discussed this. No to the mole.

Chocolate is for cake, not chicken.

Oh, come on.

He's crying.

What do I do now?
I mean, should I dye it back?

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I don't know why you'd ask me that.

I mean, I-I don't know anything
about that.

How does one even go about
dyeing one's hair?

-I've never heard of anything so crazy.
-Let me get that for you, Doctor.

-What? Oh, no, I'm-I'm not a...
-Morning, Doctor.

Wow, Peter, they all think you're a doctor
because of your white hair.

I have to say, it does make you
look more distinguished.

Really? Huh.

Well, maybe this will be
a good thing after all.

Like a garbageman with no nose.

Well, this is the best job in the world!

Rotting meat?

What does that smell like?

Oh, look, receipts.

I'll steal this person's identity.

From now on, I'm Robert Dibadeaux.
So long, stinkies!

Not that I would know.

All right, Chris,
it's gonna take a few steps

to get you off hard-core porn.

Now, the first step is soft-core porn,
where nothing really happens.

(TV CLICKS ON)

Oh, wow, she is just riding
that guy's belly button.

Yep, that's all we had.

And you could watch this at any time?

No, just Friday at 11:45 p.m.

-And it was free?
-No, $45 a month.

Well, what was playing
the other 200 hours per week?

Uh, mostly <i>D.A.R.Y.L.</i> The movie <i>D.A.R.Y.L.</i>

-Was it any good?
-It was okay.

Grandpa, what are you doing here?

Using the bathroom.
Where do you keep the nets

that you put on the bottom of guys' balls
to stop 'em from dunking in the water?

-What?
-What do you mean, "What?"

(RHYTHMICALLY) Where do you keep the nets

that you put on the bottom of guys' balls

to stop them from dunking in the water?

Oh, there's my silver fox.

What are you doing out here?

Well, now that I've got white hair,
I fix my car in slow motion

in an ad for a supplemental blood thinner.

that I found in a locker
at the town pool bathroom.

Okay, now we're talking.

(WHOOSHING)

Wait. I'm clicking on this thumbnail,
but the video isn't opening.

No, that's a still image.
See, you look at them,

and then your brain sort of
creates a scene for you.

I don't know. I think maybe
we should try something else.

I think you should give it a shot.

I think we should all go investigate

the still-unsolved murder
of Doris Billingsly,

who never did anything
but overcook one dinner

in March of 1962.

All right, I got next round.

Hey, Tom, you okay?

She left me.

Another sign from the universe
that I'll never find love.

Hey, come on, pal.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

Wow.

You're right. There are.

Say, you've got a way about you,

a certain... trustworthy quality.

You know, we've got an opening
at the station for a senior analyst.

I think your white hair
would be perfect for it.

Wow. Really? What do I do?

You just act like everyone else
is an idiot and shout over them.

-That way, you can...
-Shut up! I get it!

Terrific. Hey, why don't you come down
to the station tomorrow and...

-I know where you work!
-Again, terrific.

Wow, this is awesome.

I haven't been on TV since
I had IBS on <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

Derek, I had such a magical weekend.

You are truly one of a kind.

-(LOUD STOMACH GRUMBLING)
-And that's why I've decided to...

Excuse me. Uh, do-do you know
if I'm gonna get a rose?

We're getting to that, Peter.

Derek, that's why I've decided
to give you this rose.

(STOMACH GRUMBLING AND SQUEALING)

Evan, getting to see
your softer side was truly...

-(STOMACH GROWLING)
-Excuse me.

I hate to be a bother, but do you...
do you know if I'll be receiving a rose?

Because if there's, uh, further delay,
I believe something's gonna happen

that will put me
out of contention for a rose.

-(STOMACH GURGLES LOUDLY)
-And that thing just happened.

Farewell, and thank you

for feeding me champagne
and shrimp all day.

Reporting live from Quahog Prison,
I'm Joe Horrigan, Channel Five News.

Thanks, Joe.
Great reporting, terrible eyes.

Switching gears now, I'd like to talk
about the crime situation here in Quahog.

Joining me now is white-haired
contributor Peter Griffin.

Peter, what are you hearing
about crime in Quahog?

Uh... you know, not much.

Not much? Excuse us for one moment.

-What are you doing?
-What? I don't know anything about crime.

So? People want to know that
bad stuff's going on out there.

That's why they watch the news.

-You want me to make stuff up?
-I don't know.

I thought you had white hair.

-You're right, I do.
-Of course you do.

(GASPS, GIGGLES)

Now, you were talking about crime?

Crime is way up, and you know why?
'Cause of immigrants.

I say, as Americans, we should all take
a pledge to kick 'em out.

Only pledge I stand for is Lemon Pledge.

(SQUEAKING)

Peter Griffin, white hair, very
credible, thank you so much.

Coming up, lost dog comes home...
one piece at a time.

(NEWS THEME MUSIC PLAYS)

Peter, that was amazing.

I'm the news director
here at Channel Five.

How would you like to do
what you just did every night?

Wipe a bloody booger under the desk?

No, I'm asking you to join us full-time
to be our permanent senior analyst.

Would you excuse me
while I step into another room

and celebrate like a girl in a rom-com
who just got good news?

Aah! The Sanguelto!

My blood's thinner than water!

-(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)
<i>-If taking Sanguelto,</i>

<i>please refrain</i>
<i>from dancing like in a rom-com,</i>

<i>as nosebleeds may be permanent.</i>

<i>And remember, most drugs</i>
<i>are prescribed to you</i>

<i>because a hot girl with a rolling suitcase</i>
<i>gave your doctor a free pen.</i>

Peter, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

Who says you can just make
things up and call them facts?

Tom Tucker did. He kissed me.

You have a responsibility
as a member of the press

to report the news accurately.

You can't just say crazy things
that aren't in any way true.

JOE: (LAUGHING) Yeah, leave that
to the yahoos in D.C.

-Did that get a "That's So Joe"?
-No!

JOE: Okay, well,
what are the rules on that?

We're still working that out.

JOE: Well, let me know
when you decide on the rules.

I'm really excited about working on this.

With you guys.

Chris, welcome to the lingerie department.

What are we doing here?

When I was young, seeing
these half-naked mannequins

was all I needed to get me going.

What's the endgame here--
him walking around Macy's with a chub?

No, we've got to reset his arousal meter.

He needs to be able
to use his imagination again.

Any of these mannequins
doing anything for you, Chris?

Uh, I don't know.

I guess the one without a head
is pretty cool.

All right, that's... that's something.

And that bin of chopped-up ones
over there-- that could be okay.

'Specially the one
that looks kind of afraid.

There you go. Look at you.

Sounds like someone is ready
for that date.

-Do you gentlemen need any help?
-No, thank you, dear.

We're just trying
to get my brother to full mast.

We want to welcome back our new
permanent senior analyst,

Peter Griffin and his white hair.

What's the latest on crime in Quahog?

-Tom, crime is up.
-Wow. How high?

-All the way to the top.
-Whoa. The top.

Has it ever been all the way
to the top before, Peter?

Never. In fact, we had to raise the top.

So, the new top is even higher
than the old top?

Yes, the old top is now the middle.

And <i>The Middle </i>is a show

that was inexplicably on ABC
for a very long time.

How many seasons?

It might be, like, 11.
I'm not even kidding.

Peter Griffin, white hair,
very credible, thank you so much.

Coming up, we'll tell you where to look

when a person has a birthmark
on their face.

So, Chris, have you weaned
yourself off of Internet porn?

Wait. I thought the whole point
was to not wean myself off.

No, Chris, I mean, have you stopped...
Never mind.

-You ready for your date?
-You bet I am!

(KNOCKING)

Hi, Chris.

(LAUGHING)

Hi, Kristen.

Ready to see a Marvel movie,
'cause I chose?

Sure. And for sure this is a real date,
and me and the popular kids

aren't gonna thrill-kill you tonight.

I think Chris is gonna be just fine.

(SMOKE DETECTOR BEEPING)

Which is more than I can say
for our pizza.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, man.

Well, I hope you're happy.

You're telling lies on the news
just to boost your own ego.

It's pronounced "Eggo," Lois,

and I will thank you to leggo of mine.

Peter, fake news is a real problem
in this country right now,

and I really don't want
my husband contributing to it.

Maybe you're right.

It doesn't feel good lying all the time.

I guess I just like all the attention
that came along with having white hair.

Well, I don't think that's
the kind of attention you want.

And it's certainly not
the kind of attention

I want for our family.

You know what?
If it means that much to you,

I'll tell Tom that I won't do it anymore.

-Really?
-Really.,

Oh, Peter, that makes me so happy.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello? Donald Trump?

You saw me on the news?

You want me to be your press secretary
in the next episode?

Why, sure, I'd love to!

We'll get started drawing it right away.

Lois, pack your bags.

We're joining the Trump Administration.

(GRUNTING)

Just what Washington needs, huh?

Another talking head.

(PETER GIGGLES)

-(BOTH LAUGH)
-Oh, man.

-Meg, that's my boss, all right?

This is my career you're talking about.

I spent a whole day working on this.

-What?

When you walked through that door,
you insulted <i>Bob's Burgers</i>

Well, I was just kidding around.

No, you weren't. You're just jealous

'cause it wins all the Emmys

Anyway, my point is,

if Peter Griffin gets to be

then why can't Donald Trump?

Huh.

dumbest thing you've ever said.

So are we square?

No.

No, President Trump, we are not!

I quit!

-That's right.

And you know what else?
My days of being mean

Look, you were right.

I can be insulting sometimes, I admit it.

But so what?
I'm just a guy from Rhode Island.

You're the President of the United States!

You're not just a guy from Rhode Island.

You're Peter Griffin from <i>Family Guy.</i>

Many children have learned
their favorite Jewish, black

and gay jokes by watching
your show over the years.

In fairness, we've been trying
to phase out the gay stuff.

But you know what? We're a cartoon.

You can turn us off. You're the President.

We can't turn you off.

And you're on, like, all the time!

Yes, tremendous ratings.

Our Leslie Nielsen ratings
are the highest in history.

Surely you can't be serious.

I am serious. And don't call me Leslie.

Ugh. You really do find a way
to screw everything up.

If I screwed up so bad,
how come I'm a billionaire?

Billionaire? Please.

You're worth $700 mil on the high side.

And most of that is borrowed
or tied up and underwater.

That's why you ain't
releasin' your taxes, Trump.

You're cash poor!

Say that again.

I dare you.

You...

are cash...

poor.

Well, we had a lot of fun this week

If you want to learn more
about our president,

consult the Steele dossier,

which is all about getting peed on.

He also, with whole heart and full throat,

endorsed a pedophile
for the United States Senate.

That didn't fit into tonight's narrative,

but should not be forgotten.

And I am a proud hat owner.

Shut up, Meg.

we're very frightened.

You won't believe this incredible story.

Oh, wait, he's a Japanese man?

Happy birthday, Brian.

We bought you a cake with the groceries,

You got one from Rami Malek,

Wow, he gave me the dark circles

Aw, cool.

You know what?
Maybe I can lend a hand, Brian.

I'll help you write your biography.

Yes. After all, I helped

All right, Brian, time to get
to work on your biography.

Now, let's start with an interview.
Who would you say is your hero?

Well, I guess maybe Martin Luther King.

Okay, maybe someone you see every day.

Uh, well, I guess Peter is...

No, no, no. Like somebody younger.
Like younger than you, even.

Like that, like that kind of hero.

Well, I guess Meg and Chris.

Let's take Meg and Chris as a given.

Anyone else you maybe look up to?

-I guess Lois...
-We did say younger, did we not?

Well, uh, I guess that leaves... you.

Oh, boy, embarrassing.
That backfired, didn't it?

So, I should put me, then?

Yes, fine.

Now, another important part
of any book: the dedication.

It's not uncommon for an author
to dedicate his book

to his hero, who you have listed as...

(CHUCKLING) Oh, no, this is...

Oh, this is embarrassing.

We already did this. I got some free time.

-Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
-It's about time.

Thanks to you, we got leapfrogged
by Seamus' foursome.

Ha. Golf club hands.

Hey, could one of you spot me
the greens fees?

I blew all my money at the massage parlor.

Sheesh, you're sure spending
a lot of money at that place.

How much you pay one of them masseuses?

Eh, 200 bucks.

200 bucks? That's what I paid
for Reading Railroad.

What kinda medical benefits
do those masseuses get?

I think they see the Chinese vet
down the street.

Well, that's all the information I need
to make a binding vocational choice.

Guys, I'm gonna become
a professional massage therapist.

-What?
-Are you serious, Peter?

You bet. I could always use
some extra cash.

Plus, I've handled
bigger challenges before.

You know, I was once
in the Blue Man Group.

(RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT)

(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

Peter, what's wrong with your paint?

Remember when I asked
for a five-minute break?

Hey, Stewie, which title do you
like for the biography,

<i>Barking Up the Right Tree--</i>
you catch that?--

or <i>Are You There, Dog? It's Me, Brian.</i>

Oh, about that--
I was meaning to tell you,

your biography is finished.

Already? Wow. Print me up a copy.

Done, Brian. Look behind you.

Whoa, ass ahoy.

-Classic.
-Stewie, this isn't a book.

Brian, it's 2019.
We're living in a post-book,

Post Raisin Bran society.

So enjoy your new robot,
and enjoy a bowl of Post Raisin Bran.

Post Raisin Bran:
like Kellogg's, but worse.

Stewie, what about my biography?

This robot is a living record
of you and your history.

It knows you and your mannerisms,
and it will exist long after you're gone.

Brian, in every sense of the term,
Robot Brian is your biography.

This is how you'll be remembered, forever.

-Whoa, ass ahoy.
-He says that a lot.

He's also got
an interchangeable memory bank,

an expandable encyclopedia
database, and, as a bonus,

the new U2 album.

-Oh. I don't want the new U2 album.
-You don't get a choice.

So this is a robot version of me?

Not just a robot version, Brian.
It's like another you,

uploaded with your genetic code,
your cognitive patterns,

and your entire life story.

"Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke,
and now we are stuck in the history past."

Well, that is one of my catchphrases.

-I don't talk that robotically, though.
-That'll go away. He will evolve

as he gathers more and more data.

"Fire hydrants, images."
"Fire hydrants, news."

"Fire hydrants, near me."

-Now what's he doing?
-Oh, he's also been uploaded

with your Internet search history.

"Yahoo Answers: Is Anton Yelchin's jeep
for sale?"

-Ooh, shame on you, Brian.
-It's legitimate memorabilia!

"Applebee's, Brittany, Quahog."

"Brittany, Applebee's waitress, blonde."

"Quahog, Applebee's, Brittany, who is."

"Blonde waitress, Brittany,
Quahog, Applebee's."

"Brittany Babbit, home address."

Oh, good, you found it.

-Peter? What are you doing here?
-I work here now.

You what? Why would they hire you?

I don't know that they did.
Nobody ever picks me, though.

Just Bruce.
And his towel keeps falling off,

and he keeps saying, "Oops."

I don't know, the towels here
are very fally-offy.

Damn it. Goodbye, Peter.

-Where you goin'?
-Home.

I can't come here anymore,
you've made it weird.

You have one that looks like
snowboarder Chloe Kim?

She turned 18, so I can
say that out loud now.

Robot Brian,
it's so great that you're here.

I need a partner for a project
I've been working on.

But, sir, Dogbook was our idea.
It was stolen by Bark Zuckerbark.

And who are you again?

We're the Barklevoss twins. And... scene.

-So, what do you think?
-I think it's great. I have no notes.

It's called <i>The Barkial Network.</i>

How come you didn't call it <i>Barkbook?</i>

(CHUCKLES) I thought you
said you didn't have any notes.

I got you dropped from jury duty.

Oh, great. What line did you use?

"I have read about this exact case..."

-That's good.
-"...on hotsy-totsy Nazi dot com."

That's not good.

-Hey, can robots do cocaine?
-What?

Nothing, I was just, you know...

Can they get cocaine?

Hello, The Girls Aren't
the Girls in the Ad Massage.

Oh, yes, the girls are
absolutely the girls in the ad.

Freeze! Police!

-What's going on?
-You're all under arrest.

-Arrest? For what?
-This place is a brothel.

-What does that mean?
-Your coworkers are engaged

in the world's oldest profession.

Lead singer of The Pretenders?

No, Peter.
All these women are prostitutes.

Cuff them, cop with a wife
who's taller than him.

Uh, my name's Gary.

I'm sorry, I'm bad with names,

but I'm good
at remembering gigantic wives.

So, what was Brittany Babbit like?

Oh, you know, at Applebee's,
she's all like,

"Hi, may I take your order?"
and at her bedroom window,

she's all like, "Aah! Get out of here.
How'd you find my apartment?"

Tale of two Brittanys, huh?

Yeah, I mean, if you don't want
me showing up at your house,

don't put a smiley face on my receipt.

Uh, Your Honor, the defense rests.

See, you get it.

Have you read my book yet?

I'm downloading it right now.

It's beautiful.

-Mm...
-Mm...

Yeah, this is... this is fine.

This isn't... this isn't weird.

I'm a robot you. Mm.

-Good morning, Brian.
-Hey.

So, anything unusual happen
with Robot Brian last night?

Anything you'd like to share?

N-No. W-Why-why do you ask?

Well, as it happens, your robot
has a rear panel sensor.

Every time it's triggered, I get
a text, like a Google Alert.

(PHONE CHIMING)

I... This is ridiculous.

I don't even know
what you're talking about.

Mm-hmm. You know he backs up
his hard drive every night, right?

Though I guess you were also backing up
his hard drive last night, eh?

Wiping that history?

Ah, what else?
What other computer terms...

What, the... Oh, getting some RAM?
A few megabytes?

Logging in and logging out...

Wow, there's a lot of computer
things that sound dirty.

Okay, I admit it. I'm not made of stone.

I fell for me.

I know it seems strange,
but I'm gonna give it a chance.

And don't worry, we're not gonna
be one of those cutesy couples.

-Morning, RB.
-RB?

Yeah, it stands for "Real Brian."

Morning, RB. "Robot Brian."

Well, much like every other "RBs,"
you are making me sick.

Hey, did you get the license
plate of that handsome guy

who ran me over last night?

Ha, ha, clever.

So is there anything
we need to talk about?

I don't know. Is there anything
we need to talk about?

-I guess not.
-Well, I guess not, too.

-Thanks, RB.
-Back at you, RB.

We just click together.

Like all the pieces
in Chris's first model set.

Okay, lay out the pieces,
find the cockpit,

open the glue, take a sniff...

(INHALES SHARPLY)

...and this will be my life now.

Joe, you got to help me.
My picture's in the paper and everything.

Well, everybody knew that Bob Iger thing,
but you got to help me, Joe.

No way. You should've thought
of that before you committed

a victimless crime
between consenting adults

in a commercial arrangement
which also created jobs

and contributed tax dollars
to the community.

Now if you'll excuse me,

I'm gonna go watch Bob Iger
drain threes at the local gym.

We've got to think of something
to make Joe drop the charges.

I don't know, he seemed pretty insistent.

Trust me, Joe can be
pretty easily influenced.

<i>I get knocked down...</i>

Oh, no!

<i>But I get up again</i>

Yeah!

<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

Good!

<i>I get knocked down</i>

Oh, no!

<i>But I get up again</i>

Yeah!

<i>You're never gonna keep me...</i>

(LIPS SMACK) Ah...

(LIPS SMACK) Ah...

Sounds like that water's
pretty refreshing, huh?

-Excuse me?
-No, nothing, you just made a weird noise

after you took that sip of water.

RB, that's the sound you make
when you take a sip of water.

What? No way, that's so annoying.

I'd-I'd kill myself
if I sounded like that.

Brian, don't forget, I'm you.

Everything I do, I literally got from you.

Well, not that.

I think I know how to take a sip of water

without sounding
like a rock concert drum solo.

Go ahead. Show me.

Hmm? Mm-mm.

Mm-mm-mm-mm.

(LIPS SMACK) Ah...

Joe's police rounds bring him
down this street.

So the plan is we trick him into coming in
and getting an erotic massage.

Then we blackmail him
into dropping Peter's charges.

Right. And if someone makes
a joke about my weight,

I laugh good-naturedly and then
go home and eat my feelings.

Oh... Okay. That's part of
the plan you keep on the inside.

Yeah. Next to the pizza
you had for breakfast.

(LAUGHS)

Here comes Joe. Places.

<i>La, la, la, la,</i><i>unsuspecting song...</i>

Huh. "Miracle Leg Massage.
Walk Again, Joe."

I don't know. What's the name
of this place, anyway?

"Flip Joke Massage Parlor."

Well, tempted as I may be,

there is no way I'm going
in there for a massage.

Ma'am, I assume you're giving me
a great message,

but that's where it stops.

I'll be a monkey's uncle
before I accept a sexual favor.

And that's the story of how
your mother-- my sister--

got into college.

-(BABBLES)
-(LAUGHS) Oh, Barnaby Bananas.

You're certainly my smartest nephew,

but Harvard is only for humans.

No monkey will ever graduate from there.

Barnaby Bananas.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

I tell you, Janine, I sure feel
dumb for what I said earlier.

Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe,

we got pictures of you getting
a sexual favor a while back,

so now you got to drop the charges.

This'll never stick, Peter.
I know a top-notch Harvard-trained lawyer.

(BABBLES)

An M.A. in urban planning?

That's no help. All right, Peter, you win.

-Really?
-Yup, I'm gonna drop all the charges.

And now maybe you could drop
a few LBs, huh?

(ALL LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING ON TELEVISION)

(LAUGHS)

-What?
-What?

I do not laugh like that.

Again, Brian, I'm you.

I can't do it
unless you've already done it.

You can't do it unless
I've already done it?

What is this, <i>Bark to the Future?</i>

(BOTH LAUGH)

Oh, my God, I do do that.

Hey, Brian, I think I put in
a good day of writing.

Check out what I did.

-This is a blank screen.
-Exactly.

-I spent all day working on the margins.
-The margins?

Oh, yeah, you got
to get the margins right.

They frame the page.

They're like the corral, and
the words are my wild horses.

It's my job to break those word horses

and ride them off into the green
pastures of prose and poetry.

Stop! It's just so pretentious.

Well, they're your words.

No way. I would never say that.

Words are my wild horses.

It's my job to break those word horses

and ride them off into the green
pastures of prose and poetry.

Sir, all I said was
your Discover card was declined.

Turn it off, turn it off!

God, I'm such a jerk.

I hate you!

Which means... I hate me.

What did you just say?

I said I hate me. I hate myself.

You've made me realize...

I hate myself.

-What the...
-(SLOW CLAP)

Well done, Brian, well done.

Stewie? What are you doing?
What the hell happened to RB?

-RB served his purpose.
-Which was what?

To show you that the last thing
you need is a detailed account

-of who you are and what you do.
-Excuse me?

Brian, you wanted to write
your autobiography.

And I needed to show you that no one

wants to read your autobiography,
not even you.

-Because...
-Because your best is middling,

your worst is intolerable,
and when you die,

the most you'll want written about you
is "He Was a Good Boy" on your tombstone.

And even that will be a complete lie.

I couldn't do it. I couldn't lie.

It was awesome.
Oh, my God, it was so great

how they thought
that other show was so great.

Yeah, totally.
And that one part of the show

where the guy was talking about
that one part of the other show

and how he didn't see that coming?
I did not see that coming.

This is just too much to process.

I need an after show
after this after show,

just to know what I just saw about
what I just saw about what I just saw.

-Well done, Chris.
-Thank you.

And Brian, you certainly had
yourself an adventure.

I sure did.

Hey, whatever happened
to Robot Brian anyway?

He moved down to the marina.
I hear he's doing pretty well.

(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

It's been like this all morning.

I'm actually starting to get
a little worried, you know?

It's not a bionic robot. It can break.

-(PHONE WHOOSHES)
-What's that swoosh?

He's got a mouth sensor, too.

And remember, Brian, he wouldn't
do anything you wouldn't do.

-He's you.
-(PHONE WHOOSHING, CHIMING)

It's rather musical, isn't it?

Sounds like the "Carol of the Bells."

("CAROL OF THE BELLS" PLAYING OVER PHONE)

-(PHONE VIBRATING)
-Oh, I'm getting a call.

Oh, no, it's Allison Janney.
Decline, decline!

I tell you, Lois, being a masseuse
is a tough job.

But it all just goes to show
that basically

every licensed massage therapist
in this country is a prostitute.

Oh, yeah. You can pretty much
do whatever you want

with any masseuse ever,
because they're all prostitutes.

And it's not just the masseuses.

If you're ever seeing,
like, a physical therapist,

or doing yoga with a private
instructor? Just go for it.

There's, like, an 80% chance
you'll get there.

But Peter, there's-there's
one thing I still don't get.

Why did you take the massage job
in the first place?

For you, Lois.
I did it to earn enough money

to buy a comb for your beautiful hair.

Oh, Peter, didn't you know?

I sold my beautiful hair to buy
you a bottle of massage oil.

Great. So now I'm an unemployed
masseuse with a bald wife.

Merry (BLEEP) Christmas.

ANNOUNCER:<i></i>(OVER PA SYSTEM)
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>let's give a big Boston welcome</i>
<i>to Peter Griffin,</i>

<i>the fist transgender Red Sox fan.</i>

Peter, you used the transgender bathroom,

so now everyone thinks you're transgender.

Cleveland, what are you eating
your Cracker Jacks out of?

Oh, the guy said
they were out of regular boxes,

-so he gave me this box.
-What did he look like?

Like this.

Hey, that's the ice cream guy!

I got a handful, too, Peter.

You want to see who can finish faster?

You're on!

It looks like we've got ourselves
a good old-fashioned Cracker Jack off.

Good morning, Peter.
We saw the game last night,

and, well, we just want you to know

that we wholeheartedly support
all transgender people.

-But I'm not...
-Peter, before you say anything

that might clear all this up,

let me tell you about our stellar
transgender employee benefit package.

Benefits? I'm trans-listening.

Well, as such, you're entitled
to supplemental time off,

our on-site masseuse
and a $60 gift card from Nordstrom Rack.

-Nordstrom?
-Rack.

-Yeah, but Nordstrom!
-Yes, I understand.

But it's just... Rack.

Well, in the words
of trailblazer Caitlyn Jenner,

"I will do anything
for money and attention."

So brave.

Great. We'll send the paperwork
down to your office.

Well, better use
the men's room one last time.

Lot of history in there.

(WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

You.

And you, the Hungry Hungry Hippo.

You'd always swallow it
before I could see what I did.

And one last look at
my crack imprint on the walk of fame.

God, I remember that day.

<i>I would find out later</i>
<i>that when you put your ass</i><i>in wet cement,</i>

<i>you're just sealing it shut forever.</i>

<i>Best they could do was poke holes in it</i>
<i>so it comes out like Play-Doh spaghetti.</i>

<i>Anyway, that's the first act.</i>

Peter, pretending to be transgender
to get time off work

trivializes a real struggle
in this country.

Did the... Did the Space Cats get to you?

I don't know what that is,
but you got to knock this off.

And direct me to Earth's reserve
of sun-dappled window seats.

Lois is right, Peter.

Besides the fact that
you're lying to your employers,

you're taking advantage of a civil liberty

that so many oppressed people
have fought their entire lives for.

Shut your mouth, Brian.
I'm part of a movement.

Hey, what is "transgender," anyway?

Is that the stuff in potato chips
that makes your bum go bam?

(GROANS) It... It's pointless
arguing with you.

Cool. Now, in order to pull this off,
I'm gonna have to look the part.

Lois, which dress may I borrow?

None. My closet is off-limits.

Fine. There's got to be something
in the attic.

I can't even begin to describe

the density of illness
I feel in my bone marrow right now.

That is... That is how appalled
I am by this.

Other guys?

Sorry, Peter. I don't see you
getting away with this one.

Look, Peter, the good news is
you still fit in your wife's wedding gown.

Not every guy can say that.

It's actually Meg's.
She commits murders in it.

What's this, now?

That's just it, Peter,
this whole thing is a joke to you.

Are you forgetting
I have a dad who's a woman?

No, of course not. That's the first thing
everyone thinks of when they see you.

But this isn't like that.

And I thought you guys would support me.

Like we all supported Joe
on that road trip.

-Boy, I am stuffed.
-Oh, I forgot to mention,

one of you guys has to be in charge
of changing my diaper the whole trip.

Why don't we all just switch off?

Oh, there will be other jobs
for other people.

Okay, I guess we should,
like, draw straws or something.

Actually, I've been observing all of you
for the past few hours,

and I choose Quagmire.

-What? Why me?
-You've got long fingers.

And I feel like you wouldn't crack
if things start to go south.

(SIGHS) Fine.
How do I know when it's time?

Well, I'll turn to you, very sincerely,
and I'll look you right in your eyes,

and I'll say,
"Quagmire, I've got poopies."

Ugh.

-Now, Quagmire, I've...
-You got poopies. I know.

No! You're supposed to let me say it!

Quagmire,

I've got poopies.

BOTH: Dad!

How goes the transition, Mr. Griffin?

Like Huma Abedin, I'm trying
to forget about my Weiner.

Whoa, we're doing <i>Cheers, </i>not <i>Frasier.</i>

-(SIGHS HEAVILY)
-Tough day, Dad?

I don't get it. How does Rebel Wilson
always look so fetching?

-Does she, though?
-You could be, too,

if you just let your hair down a little.

Now you just take that beautiful hair
down to the salon, and you'll be a ten.

On a scale of a billion?

Thanks, Chris.

Thanks for helping me
at 11:30 on a school day.

There was a shooting.

-Out.

Now that I'm living as a woman,

I can say whatever I want to men

-Oh, hey, Peter.
-Sully could've made it to an airport.

Hey, you shut your mouth!
That man is a hero!

Ah-ah-ah-ah! Woman.

(SIGHS) Well, it's definitely true
that I respect the boundaries of women.

Oh, hey, Sherry, uh,
just get in the fireplace.

I'll... I'll spit down the chimney.

Hey, Joe. How's the suspension going?

When you get married, you don't think
you'll be home together all day.

It's, uh, trying.

BONNIE: Who's at the door?

(JOE INHALES DEEPLY)

(YELLING) It's my friend!

So, what's up, Peter?

I just wanted to tell you that I'm the one

who planted the evidence
that got you suspended.

-What? I'm gonna kill you!
-Ah-ah-ah! Woman.

Oh, right.

BONNIE: Joe, close the door.
You're letting the bugs in.

Is your daughter still killing people?

She is.

Hey, Chris Brown.

I just wanted to say
I'm a huge fan of your music.

(LOUD SMACK)

This is just gonna make me listen more.

Oh, hey, Ray Rice.
Would you mind pressing "lobby"?

What do you got, potatoes in your ears?
I said press "lobby"!

Now, Peter, one of the perks
of being a woman

is that you get to go out

and have a white wine,
squeak-fart lunch with your friends.

-Did you hear Diane's husband left her?
-(HIGH-PITCHED, SQUEAKY FART)

Oh. "Float like a feather

Dah, dah, dah. Okay.

<i>Flippin' special</i>

<i>But I'm a creep...</i>

What? What happened?

Ah, I knew you'd catch it.

I'm parting my hair on the other side now.

Oh, Peter, thank God you're okay.

Hello, bosses and not my family.

You really gave us a scare there.

Oh, what do you mean?

(LAUGHS) Well, you went into a coma
after you were hit in the head by a fan.

Oh, it was funny.

-And then it wasn't.
-A coma?

Well, I feel tomato now, beige spots.

And since the company was paying
for your medical care anyway,

we fulfilled your letter of medical intent
for your sex reassignment surgery.

-What?
-She's saying that your surgery

to become a woman was a complete success.

It's much easier going that way,
believe me.

Just a chop and a mop.

Congratulations, Peter.

You're officially a woman.

No!

That is one nutty hospital. (CHUCKLES)

Peter, I'm sorry this happened,
but it's your own fault.

You should never have pretended
to be someone else.

That's right, but now that it's done,
maybe I can help you with the transition.

Of course.

Congratulations, you went to a dance club.

I'd say you'd been a woman for years.

Now we just drift off to sleep,

I probably won't be able to sleep

'cause I had two sips of tea

You want me to start a new tab for you?

No, you can just keep ours going.

Your friends left
the minute you came out here,

and they didn't pay their indoor tab.

I feel so alone.

And that bitch stole my hairstyles!

Well, hello.

PETER: That's what he said to me!

IDA: Peter?

-Ida?
-Come, sit.

Well, look at you.

Yeah, look at me.

-What's wrong?
-It's a long story.

Yeah, I've heard.

Peter, everything is gonna be okay.

-I promise.
-Oh... Okay.

Now, I'm going to tell you a story.

When I first met you, Peter,

I was already at the end of a long journey
to find the courage to become a woman.

But before that, I lived for 61 years
as a miserable, miserable man.

I grew up in the small town
of Football, Texas,

and from the age of eight,
I was mercilessly teased

for being different and "dressing funny."

Then, at the age of 14, I had an epiphany.

It was so clear.

I was a girl trapped in a boy's body.

I'm having a hard time focusing
without a drink, but go on.

It took me 47 years from that day
to officially own who I am.

Is there a waiter or...

In those 47 years, I became
an expert at hiding my secret.

I became a war hero and raised a family,

but I was dying inside,

and the deeper I buried it,
the more unhappy I became,

and eventually,
I even thought of ending my own life.

But I couldn't do that to Glenn.

(SNIFFLES) I had no idea.

It's clear you had no idea.

You know nothing about what it means
to feel this struggle.

Yeah, you're right.

I kind of stumbled into all this,

but you've been dealing with it
your whole life.

Yes, I have.

And my story, to one degree or another,

is every transgender person's story,

and all those stories
are the price of admission

to finally feeling at peace
with who you are,

a price you never paid.

Ah, I'm so sorry, Ida.

I feel really awful,

and I'm a really bad person
for what I did.

I deserve what happened to me.

Touching story, other people humans.

Now, could you direct me
to Earth's reserve of other dog butts?

That's right, that's right.
Everybody natural.

Peter, listen to me.

You were a bad person.

But now you've taken a journey.

It just took becoming a woman
to make you a better man.

But I'll never be that better man.

I can't afford the surgery to go back.

I think I might be able
to help you with that, Peter.

-Really?
-Yes.

I've got an idea.

What a day.

Oh, Peter, you started a Kickstarter.

Not exactly.

BRIAN: Oh, that's... that's not a "K."

Look at that. You're up to six inches.

That's two inches past your goal.

It's not important what the goal was.

What's important is, this community cares.

Congratulations, Mr. Griffin.
Your surgery was a success.

You're a man again.

Sully was a hero!

Well, I'm glad
everything's back to normal.

I'll say.

Dad, you lost a wiener

-but came out a winner.
-(GIGGLES)

Well, that does it
for our crossover episode.

Thanks for coming, cast of <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

We didn't get to do anything.

Show's 22 minutes long.
Not everything makes it to air.

But, hey, you have the floor if there's
something hilarious you want to say.

I'll just sit here and be quiet.

Give us two Emmys worth of amazing.

Maybe a funny burger name? No?

Girl in the bunny ears?

Boy, I love it when characters
are expressed by props.

I kind of feel like
this is less of a crossover

and more of a roast.

No, a roast is good-natured.

that gay encounter we had?

God, every time with this guy.

I'm gonna take the stairs.

Oh, my God, I'm never gonna
get up these stairs.

(PANTING)

Okay, it's all right.

I do this every week
in the opening credits.

All right, let's see. How does that go?

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's... a man who</i>

<i>Positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us...</i>

(GRUNTING)

I swear he says the F-word.

(PANTING)

Everything hurts.

Everything's wet.

I'm just gonna stay here.

Was <i>Labyrinth </i>a good movie?

I can't remember.

I don't want to watch it again, though.

Seems like a chore.

Aw, even Slinky from Accounting
can make it up the stairs.

Don't forget to turn in
your time card, Peter.

What are you, allergic to money?

(CHUCKLES) No. No, I want to get paid.

Just forgot.

Ugh, look at me.

I haven't felt this out of shape
since I took surfing lessons.

Boy, this is harder than I thought.

My arms are getting really tired.

Nah, you're fine. Just keep goin'.

Tai, your positivity is infectious!

All right, P-Town, wave comin' in.

I'm just gonna give you a little push,
and you just stand up.

(BARKING)

Okay, so, welcome to the first meeting

of our women's creative writing workshop.

Ladies.

Okay, Donna, you want to read yours?

Oh, I didn't do mine.

Wha... Well, then you can't
have any more snacks.

You just can't.

Well, I guess it's my turn.

"Louise lowered her velvet hood,

"letting loose her flowing red hair.

"Ignoring her friends' obvious
and understandable envy,

"she confidently approached
the mysterious castle.

"The doors blew open,

"as if some magical force
had been expecting her.

"Louise belonged here,

"if only because this is where
Horatio called home.

"Then, through the vegetation,
and past the mist

"that sprinkled
her heaving bosom, she saw him.

"Horatio, with his long, flowing
hair blowing in the breeze,

"his cape fluttering.

-(STOMACH GURGLING)
-"He had only two loves

"in his life: his horses
and Louise's heaving bosom.

"He grabbed her tighter than
she'd ever been held before.

"A way in which her husband,
Paulter, had not held her

-"since before they were married.
-(TOILET FLUSHES)

"Horatio then took Louise by the hand,

"leading her out to his stables
as her bosom heaved.

"Louise's mind was racing in anticipation

"of the dirty hay sex that was
gonna most definitely happen.

"As the two lovers entangled into one

"atop the probably peed-on hay,

"Louise's bosom heaved.

"They spent the next 18 minutes

"fighting off sneezes,
in the throes of ecstasy.

Heaving bosom."

-Damn, that's steamy, Lois.
-Really?

Uh, <i>yeah, </i>really. Phew!

Anybody mind if I open me?

-(HISSING)
-Ah!

See you in the shower, ladies.

What am I gonna do?

I've been here all day, and I can't move.

I got it. I'll do what
James Franco did in <i>127 Hours.</i>

WOMAN: <i>UCLA admissions office.</i>

Yes, I'd like to enroll

JOE: Peter!
I heard you're in some trouble!

I'm stuck! I don't want to die here!

(CRYING) I just want to go to
my desk and surf the Internet.

Hang on, Peter. I'll come up and save you.

Stairs.

Why'd it have to be stairs?

(GRUNTING)

I can't do it. Here, you're just
gonna have to kill me.

Wait. Look, Joe.

A lever to turn the stairs into a slide.

(ALARM RINGING)

Damn it, Peter!

It's just a little water.
What's it gonna hurt?

Oh, God!

Delete... history.

No.

No!

(ALARM RINGING)

Peter, you caused millions of dollars'
worth of water damage,

all because you couldn't
make it up the stairs.

Aw, man. This means I'm the work fatty.

I haven't been this embarrassed
since I forgot

about the silent part
in George Michael's "Faith."

<i>Well, I need someone to hold me</i>

<i>But I wait for something more</i>

I've started using these pills
called Stiff for Hours

<i>A Stable Affair</i> by Lois Griffin.

Okay, another writer in the house.

Oh, my God, this is amazing!

This is basically a guide

to what Lois is looking for in a lover.

Check this out.

Lois is writing a romance novel
about a woman

who is unhappy with her husband

and begins to have a torrid affair

with a caped lover who has horses.

Don't you know what this is?

It's a description
of her every fantasy and desire.

This could finally be my key to...

To what, banging my mom?

You know, you are the worst.

Ladies.

Ugh! You guys, this is so embarrassing.

All this happened

because I'm too fat
to make it up some stairs.

Peter, you got to lose weight.

I know. You guys got to help me, though.

I can't do it on my own. I'm too weak.

All right, we'll help you, Peter,

but we're doing it Quagsberry rules.

What's that?

A woman, or in this case, a man,

has to do anything I say,
no questions asked.

Anything, I promise.

PETER: <i>My dearest Lois,</i>

<i>I've taken Quagmire's place</i>
<i>as a Union soldier in the Civil War.</i>

<i>Shortly after I arrived,</i>
<i>they amputated my leg.</i>

<i>I dared them to, and it was a big mistake.</i>

<i>The other guy in my tent</i>
<i>is a wet dead guy.</i>

<i>Yours, Peter.</i>

All right, Peter, today we start
helping you lose weight.

First, let me just make sure

you're not hiding any food
in your clothes.

(BEEPING)

WHISPERING MALE VOICE:
Taste. Taste. Taste the rainbow.

Peter, are you hiding Skittles
in your pants?

Is that all of 'em?

Just give me a second.

When I turned about 40,
it started breaking up into two.

Weekend plans?

Please don't talk to me. I need to focus.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

Good morrow!

What is thee, uh, up to?

Brian, is that your horse?
When did you get a horse?

Oh, I've been an Equus for a while.

The play with Harry Potter's penis?

Just my trusty steed here.

We have a special connection.

Me being an equestrianist and everything.

I had no idea you were into horses.

Sexy, huh?

No, seems like a hassle, and expensive.

How do you pay for it all?

Well, the costs are meager
when you're able to dominate

and control the beast with
just the slightest glance.

Stop it.

(LAUGHS) What?

This is nuts!

Anyway, I've been speaking to
my horse in the silent language

of knowing, and I... (GRUNTS)

Never walk behind a horse.

You would have to hate horses
not to know that.

...being one with nature.

(GRUNTS)

A mutual bond of trust.

(GRUNTS)

Different species, same heart.

(COMICAL WHIRRING)

(CLICKING)

(MIMICKING DAFFY DUCK)
You're dethspicable.

Welcome to CrossFit, Peter.

How's it different from a regular gym?

Do regular gyms have open garage doors

where members' large dogs
can charge innocent civilians?

No, I... I guess not.

Okay, to start,
why don't you go meet the owner,

Jayce, over there?

He'll help maximize
your nutrition regimen.

Hi, I'm Peter.

Hey, man. Jayce with a "Y."

Yeah, I figured.

(CHUCKLES) So, to start out, like, uh,

tell me, what's your favorite
kind of food?

-Pizza.
-(CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE)

-Oh, man.
-What?

(CHUCKLES) You, uh...

(CHUCKLES) you can't eat pizza.

-Why not?
-(CHUCKLES)

It's, uh... It's...

(CHUCKLES) Uh, it's...

It's bad.

-Why?
-(CHUCKLES)

Because, uh, it's, like, uh...

(CHUCKLES) pretty bad for you.

But what makes it bad?

(CHUCKLES) Oh.

Yeah, no, it's, like, uh...

like, probably one
of the worst things you can eat.

-How come?
-(CHUCKLES)

Uh, uh, because, of, like,
the ingredients in it.

-Which ones?
-(CHUCKLES)

Uh, I mean, yeah, like,

basically, all of them.

-Name one.
-(CHUCKLES)

Yeah, I... yeah, I mean...

(STAMMERS) you said... your-your words,

uh... (CHUCKLES) pizza.

All right, I'm cutting this off right now.

It's clear you're an idiot
and deserve no more of my time.

Oh, Peter, you're home from CrossFit.

Here, have some pizza.

(CHUCKLING) Oh.

Uh, you know what is in that?

It's, like... (CHUCKLES)

-It's very bad.
-What?

(CHUCKLES)

Uh, wow.

Okay, Peter,
a good and conspicuous workout

is to do lunges on the sidewalk.

Just do like I do.

-Step.
-Uh-huh.

-Step. Step.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

-Step.
-Uh-huh.

-Step. Step.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

-Step.
-Uh-huh.

-Step. Step.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Step.

-Step.
-(MOUTH FULL) Uh-huh.

-Step.
-Uh-huh.

-Step. Step.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

-Step. Step.
-(STOMACH GRUMBLING)

Step.

Step. Step.

Okay, Peter, whatever you do,

don't look down the hole.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Oh, God! I looked down the hole!

Oh! I got a sense of what's down there!

Okay, okay. All right,
you can still save this.

Just don't smell.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Oh, God! I smelled everything!

Oh, it's so deep in my nose!

Okay, okay, whatever you do,

do not dip your cupped hand in the water.

-(WATER SPLASHES)
-Oh, God! I'm doing it!

Oh, God! What is wrong with me?!

The chemicals in the water
are not breaking down

the integrity of these movements!

Okay, Peter, you can quit pretending.

-The workout's over.
-Thanks.

I was just in there checking my phone.

My phone!

(DIVING BOARD CREAKING)

(SPLASH)

Okay, Peter, whatever you do,

do not open your eyes underwater.

What the hell?

I thought we were gonna get
a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream

with all the millennials who can afford

ten-dollar scoops of ice cream

but can't afford to move out
of their parents' house.

We are. But first
I need to pick up this wine

that Lois mentioned in her story.

Where's that part about the wine?

"The doors magically opened."

-"Chill came over her."
-(SHUDDERS)

"Through the vegetation."

"Light mist."

Uh, Brian, everything you read
just happened to us.

I think her book
is about the grocery store.

Oh... my... God.

What?

It's the guy, Horatio, from Lois's book.

She's fantasizing about having
an affair with this guy.

Or, who knows, maybe even
<i>is </i>having an affair with him.

Excuse me, where are the crackers?

What? We don't work here.

We're a dog and a baby. I... do I...

Do my clothes
make it look like I work here?

I think it's the overalls, yeah.

Hey, get back to work.

I'll see you back at home, Brian.
I've got to finish my shift.

I don't get it. You've gained 12 pounds.

Looks like we're gonna have
to take more drastic measures.

Peter, say you're
not gonna have sex with me.

-What?
-Just say it.

I'm not gonna have sex with you.

(RUMBLING)

(SHOUTS)

Guys, let me out of here!

No! You said you would do
whatever's necessary

to help you lose weight.

Please, let me out!

Glenn, is it okay if I stay the night?

Oh!

Rancor, what are you doing here?

I'm trying to diet, too.

Eating too many pig guys?

I thought it was the pig guys,
but, you know what,

it was the bread.

PETER: I'm so hungry!

Let me out!

I'll tell you what,
first guy that lets me out

gets his own spin-off.

Not you, Cleveland.

Sorry, Peter, this is for your own good!

Yeah, you told us you would do
anything to lose weight!

I lied! I just want to be free,

like a recently divorced man with no kids!

-(GUNSHOTS)
-(TIRES SCREECHING ON TV)

This is nice.

This is better.

Stewie, I can't believe it.

I mean, do-do you think
Lois could be having an affair

with this Horatio guy?

LOIS: Brian, will you watch Stewie?

I have to go get groceries
and won't be back until later tonight.

Uh, yeah, sure.

Oh, my God, Stewie,
she's going to the store

and won't be back until tonight?

Do you know what that means?

Disguises?

No, but we should follow her
and see what the hell is going on.

WOMAN: Stewie-chan!

(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

I'll meet you there, Brian.
I've got to finish my shift.

All right, Peter, now, I know
you haven't eaten in a while,

so this is something called
the Pocket Diet.

Okay, guys, empty your pockets.

Whatever you got in there, he eats.

Uh, Glenn, can we go somewhere
and just talk for a minute?

Aah!

Guys, stop saying things, all right?

I will say the things.

Oh, my God. He's getting in the car.

He's going in for a hug.

They're hugging! This is insane!

I know. This guy.

This guy is a star.

I can't believe it, Stewie.
She picked him up.

They hugged. Lois is having an affair.

We've got to stop them.

-(TIRES SCREECH)
-Aw, great.

Just great.

Lois, don't do it!

Brian? What the hell are you doing here?

-Don't do what?
-Don't have sex with Horatio!

It's not worth it!

What are you talking about?

Look, I found your book and read it.

I thought that you wrote

everything you were looking for
in a lover,

and, if I could embody some
of those things,

maybe I would have a shot with you.

But then I found out Horatio is real,

and I couldn't bear to see
you do something like this

to the family.

It's not you, Lois.

Wait, let me get this straight.

You, without asking,
read something I wrote?

Then, thinking I was revealing

all my most intimate wants and desires,

you thought that you could exploit

what you read to seduce me?

But when you thought I might be cheating

with someone other than yourself,

you found that, and only that,
morally objectionable?

And you bring Stewie here,

who doesn't understand any of this?

I predict, in the finale,
everyone can understand me.

That'd make a good finale, right?

Brian, this is Horatio.

He's special.

I know you think he's special.

No, he's special.

He's learning disabled.

I like Coldplay.

-Ooh...
-Oh...

I'm not having an affair with him, Brian.

I volunteered at the special
needs living facility,

and Horatio happened to like horses.

So, once a week,
I take him to the stables.

And the cape is from a Darth Vader costume
he had as a kid.

Did you know he's the boss
of the stormtroopers?

Yes, I have fantasies
about him dominating me

with his idiot strength.

But it's just that, a fantasy.

That's why I wrote it in a story,

because I knew
that I would never act on it.

Ugh. I never thought a dog

could be such a genuine piece
of human garbage.

Lois,

I'm truly sorry for what I thought.

It all just made sense to me at the time.

But now that I see what it is,

I'm ashamed of myself.

I hope you can find it in your heart...

-Hey, Bri.
-(NEIGHS)

There's a good girl.

Joe and Cleveland,

are you ready to see your new Peter?

What do you guys think?

I don't believe it.

I'm speechless.

(CRYING)

Hey, look, it's Jonah Hill sometimes!

Wow! Looking good, Peter.

Yes. I might want me
a little taste of that.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, well, Sheila, look out.

Be careful what you ask for,
'cause you never know...

I might... Are you serious?

'Cause I will do this, 100%.

My wife's in, too. I'll call her.
We'll do a whole thing.

Hey, Lois, I got a two-top.

Okay.

She's out, but I'm still in.

Boy, I got to admit,

I feel a little sheepish to get so fooled

by a silly little book that Lois wrote.

Yes, but, you know, I think
what we missed in all of this

is that Lois wrote a beginning,
middle, and end to something.

What have you written lately, Brian?

Well, nothing, but, you know, I think

any writer knows how hard it is
to be staring at that blank page.

(CHUCKLES) Sounds like
you did write something,

your career's obituary.

(LAUGHS)

Well, that's our dog and baby.

Hi, this is Chris Griffin.

Boy, Lois had some
amorous adventures this week.

But you know what really turns me on?

Reading.

Why don't you get yourself
down to the library

and open up a book.

Here's a few of my favorite books.

J.D. Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

<i>The Kite Runner</i> by Khaled Hosseini.

And, of course, <i>The Dirt</i> by Motley Crue.

Seriously, read <i>The Dirt.</i>

They snort a row of live ants
like cocaine.

Remember, kids, a library card is free,

but knowledge is priceless.

Get that <i>Dirt </i>book.

Peter, I think you're getting
your movies mixed up.

Attention, students.

It's time to announce
this year's prom king and queen.

PETER: Natalee Holloway!

And the winners are...

Connie D'Amico and "Kermit Legs" Kyle!

Ah, so close.

Hello, gorgeous.

-How old are you?
-18.

All right, and I just
recorded you saying that.

And hi. I am Glenn Quagmire.

Courtney. Nice to meet you.

You don't look like you're in high school.

I got held back.
You like getting held back?

Sometimes.

All right, youngins.

I dragged this piece of dirty cardboard
in from the alley

I'm just boring myself.

I had a lot of fun
with you tonight, Courtney.

Me too.

(MOAN) Oh, Courtney.

Oh, Glenn.

Oh, oh, giggity!

Wait. Did you just say "giggity"?

Yeah. Sorry.

Sometimes I just blurt that out

Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

What is it, Glenn? What's wrong?

You're... you're my daughter!

Oh, my God!

Wow.

I guess this means
I have a phone call to make.

Hey, it's Glenn Quagmire.

Would you tell Andrew

you are <i>not </i>the father.

Courtney, there's something
I just got to ask.

What the heck was the theme of that dance?

What do you mean?

I mean, like, there was
palm trees like it was Hawaii,

but then there was
a suit of armor in the corner.

There was a big banner with fish on it.

Can we get back to the fact
that you're my dad?

Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Well, let me ask. What's up with your mom?

Actually, I never knew my mom.

I was hoping that you could
tell me about her.

Uh, of course I can.

Your mom...

Your mom was really...

Thing hanging on
the bulletin board behind you.

That's so nice to hear. Tell me more.

Oh, gosh, she was, she was just so...

Word on the bottom of your coffee cup.

I always knew she would be! What else?

I just have some great memories of her...

Numbers to call in case of emergency
or accidental poisoning.

It's like she's here with us right now.

So you don't know your mom?
Who do you live with?

Well, right now I'm on a futon

in the rafters of my friend's garage.

Oh! Actually, I better get going.

I have to feed their ferrets.
They breed them.

It's pretty terrifying. (GIGGLES)

Anyway, thank you so much
for being so nice,

and let's talk soon?

Wait, hold on. You can't live in
a ferret garage. You need a home.

You know, you could move in here.

I have an extra bedroom,
and the bed has a bunch

of different-sized pillows on it.

Hmm. I do love dealing with
those pillows every day,

but are you sure?

I don't want to be a burden.

No, it's no problem.
Hey, you're my daughter.

I want to make sure
you have everything you need.

Thanks. That's sweet.

Um... okay! Yeah. I'll move in.

That's huge for me.

Hey, is that an Instant Pot?

-No, it's a Crock-Pot.
-You got to get an Instant Pot.

You can make short ribs in it.
It falls right off...

Yeah, yeah, falls right off
the bone. I know.

I've had this conversation five times.

-(KNOCK ON WINDOW)
-Hey, Quagmire.

I hear you're considering an Instant Pot.

(SIGHS) Courtney, that's Joe, my neighbor.

Hey, Courtney.
You getting this guy on board?

So, I think I had
a wet nightmare last night.

Is that possible?

-Hello, fellow daddios.
-Did you bang your kid yet?

Okay, Peter, can I talk to you
for a second?

I'm sorry, but I am not going
to stand for any misogyny.

Stop acting like a Neanderthal pig.

Those sound scary.

What were you two ladies talking about?

Joe, can I talk to you for a second?

It's 2019. Time-tested jokes like that

are now offensive and not funny at all.

Okay, I got to go.

I'm taking Courtney
to her first WNBA game.

I got courtside seats.

They're way in the back, but
I'm sitting next to Courtney.

(LAUGHS) I got dad jokes now.

See you, friends.

Yes, 911?

That's right. I made that up.
Now go get 'em, kiddo.

I'll be watching with the other moms.

Here's all the usual suspects.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, you're doing a video.

Okay, okay, here we go. Please.

I get to go again. We do it twice.

See, Meg? That's a thigh gap.

Now, Courtney, I'd like
to awkwardly introduce you

to someone your own age.

Courtney, this is Megan.

Maybe you listen to the same music.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Yo, Courtney, what's your Instagram?

I just got on there
and need some interesting peeps to follow.

Oh, you'll have to ask my dad.

He approves all my follow requests.

Denied! Nice try, ass.

Hey, have you guys seen
the Wonder Woman film?

-Yeah, no.
-Oh, you have to.

It's a triumph.

Courts and I have seen it five times.

It's an important movie, Peter.

You should watch it with Meg.
It's a masterwork.

Oh, I've been wanting to see that.

Okay, we totally will.

Hey, Dad, I just checked the weather,

and it looks like sunny skies all weekend.

-You guys have big plans?
-Yeah, we're going camping.

Hey, you and Meg should
come with us, Peter.

We'll make it a father-daughter
bonding weekend.

-Oh, that's a great idea.
-Yeah, let's go, Dad.

You know who you should take
instead of me?

Uh, Stewie or Chris or Brian.

Maybe Lois.

Or Seamus is fun.

You don't get air like this
back in Quahog, do you, Pete?

Uh, I don't know. Some places, probably.

Hoo-ah! Gosh, being in nature
gives me such great energy.

Hey, Courtney, you ever see
a yellow-headed warbler?

That's the only warbler I haven't seen.

Not for long it's not.

(WHISTLING BIRD CALL)

Don't answer that. We're eating.

They're probably eating.

Okay, we're gonna have
a fun camp competition.

And the first event, worth five points,

is a race down to the lake right now!

Last one there is a stinky poo-poo egg!

Come on, Dad!

What Meg didn't know,
what none of them knew,

is that I already was

a stinky poo-poo egg.

Boy, you don't get stars like this
back in Quahog, do you, Pete?

Well, isn't this a perfect bench
for a sit.

Say, Dad, what are you doing?

Oh, just sitting on the invisible bench,

reading about those North Korea jokesters.

But, Dad, they moved
the invisible bench last week.

Oh. It's over there now.

Whoa!

Ladies and gentlemen,
"The Invisible Bench" skit.

Peter, you're up.

Okay, here's one.
I call it "The Invisible Noose."

First, I throw a rope over this tree limb,

put the noose around my neck.

Now I'll just step onto this rock

and jump off into
the sweet relief of death.

Peter, would you mind flattening your rod?

Fine. I'll <i>Tootsie</i> it between my thighs.

Yeah, okay, whatever gets it
away from my daughter's face.

Are you eating an apple with a knife?

God, that's always so forced.

Hold on. We've been here already.

Yeah, she's right.

That's where I graffitied that rock.

We've changed our minds.
We're going on record.

We're not lost, all right?

We're just two dads
bonding with our daughters,

and getting lost is not part of the plan.

All right, nobody panic.

We just need to get our bearings.

Hey, here comes a hiker.

Excuse me, sir, we're lost.

Ha! Then you must be my car keys, right?

(LAUGHS) It is so nice
to get out of the city

and meet friendly people.

You're not helping, Dad. As usual.

Well, at least I didn't get us lost.

We're not lost! We're just
two dads in the woods,

who love our daughters very, very much.

Okay, so maybe it's not the life we chose.

Well, you chose it. I didn't.
That's for damn sure!

-Dad, will you help him?
-Shh.

I've been waiting for this.
I knew it was fake.

I mean, if it was,
"Oh, What a Knight" with a "K,"

that would've made some sense,

'cause there was a suit of armor there.

What was that about? Answer me!

I think it's possible
to overthink these things.

Ugh, what a mish-mosh.

Damn it, I just want to be home,

not here, lost in the woods,

I don't know.

If I was sitting on the couch,
watching TV,

Courtney, I'm sorry
for what I said earlier.

You mean when you completely
ripped my school dance theme?

No, no, there was no theme to rip.

That's the point. I stand by all of that.

If anything, I'm more angry.

No, I'm-I'm talking about
being your father

<i>Thank you for continuing to hold.</i>

<i>Oh, come on, Lois, you only want to go</i>

<i>to Old Sturbridge Village</i>
<i>'cause you once got</i>

<i>hand-blasted there on a field trip.</i>

<i>Yes, let's just say the candles</i>
<i>weren't the only thing being hot-dipped.</i>

STEWIE: You see, Brian?
That's how you do an ad-lib.

Went right in.

WOMAN: (ON PHONE) <i>Thanks for holding.</i>

<i>How may I help you, Mrs. Griffin?</i>

LOIS: Yeah, I'll tell you how.

You can explain to me why my husband

makes four times as much money as I do.

WOMAN: <i>Oh, um...</i>
<i>Okay, this is awkward.</i>

<i>But I... I, um, I assumed you knew.</i>

<i>Mr. Griffin was able</i>
<i>to negotiate a higher salary</i>

<i>because he's still</i>
<i>paying alimony to his first wife.</i>

LOIS: "First wife"? What?

Peter, you were married before?

SMITH: We actually freelance
all our explosion animation.

STEWIE: Who are you again?

-I'm Shannon Smith.
-STEWIE: Shannon, take a lap.

<i>...never go to church.</i>

How come you never told me
you were married before?

PETER: I don't know. Just never came up.

LOIS: Never came up? Well, who was she?

PETER: Sarah Paulson.
MEG: Who?

LOIS: Wait, isn't she that actress
who's always biting her lip?

PETER: Her very full lip.

CHRIS: I honestly have no idea
who they're talking about.

BRIAN: Come on, Sarah Paulson's
been in a lot of stuff, Chris.

CHRIS: Okay, pulled her up on my phone.

Looks vaguely familiar.

But I would legitimately suggest

that people pause this right now
and google her.

MEG: Wait, wasn't Sarah Paulson
a guest star in this exact episode?

PETER: Yeah, in fact,
she was in this O.J. gag.

Ah, look, Predator just cut her head off.

Not for real, though.
For real, she's actually

coming into the booth right now
to be part of this commentary.

SARAH PAULSON:
Hi, everybody. So sorry I'm late.

I was stuck in the canyon.

STEWIE: Is-is that a euphemism
for lesbian sex?

PAULSON: I don't think I've met everyone.
I'm Sarah.

LOIS: I understand you and Peter
used to be married.

PAULSON: Oh, that.
Feels like ancient history.

CHRIS: I like your shoulder blades,
Ms. Paulson.

They're very...jutty.

BRIAN: Have a seat, Sarah.
Shall I explain what we're doing here?

PAULSON: That's okay. It seems just like

when I would do ADR
for <i>American Horror Story,</i>

for which I have received
five Emmy nominations.

LOIS: Well, some of us have awards,
some of us have children.

PAULSON: What's that supposed to mean?

LOIS: Well, I don't know.

You're the smart award winner.
You figure it out.

<i>Because this is a godless show.</i>

<i>All right, I'll do it.</i>
<i>I'll pretend to be sick</i>

<i>to get out of going</i>
<i>to Old Sturbridge Village.</i>

<i>Mmm, still 126.</i>

<i>Oh, I wish you were feeling</i>
<i>well enough to come.</i>

<i>Maybe I should stay home</i>
<i>and take care of you.</i>

<i>No. Go, Lois.</i>

<i>Go watch dead-eyed pale women make bread.</i>

PAULSON: So, Lois, what will you be
wearing to the Emmys this year?

LOIS: I think you know
I won't be there.

STEWIE: I won a surfboard
at the Teen Choice Awards.

I left it in the kitchen at work,
hoping someone would take it.

No one did.

<i>...eat a meatball sub</i>
<i>and watch football all day.</i>

<i>Man, this is an even better scam</i>
<i>than Ferris Bueller's Day On.</i>

<i>Okay, I need you to file these</i>

<i>and not be working with a shampoo mohawk.</i>

LOIS: So, Sarah, I guess you chose
not to take Peter's name, huh?

Decided to stick with "Paulson"?

PAULSON: Yeah, his name just felt

kind of, I don't know, rough, you know?

(IN GRAVELY VOICE) "Griffin."

(CHUCKLES) Right?

Just sounds kind of brutish and low-class.

I also won an Emmy for
my performance as Marcia Clark

in <i>The People v. O.J. Simpson.</i>

LOIS: You won an Emmy for wearing a wig.

Peter, may I speak with you outside?

PETER: Oh, boy.

(GRUNTS) <i>Uh-oh. I think I'm stuck.</i>

STEWIE: Oh, right, this is where the
fat man got stuck in the banister slats.

BRIAN: Stewie, I'm gonna give you
another crack at that,

because I believe
what you meant to call them was

"baluster slats," not "banister slats."

STEWIE:
"Banister," "baluster." Same thing.

BRIAN: (CHUCKLES) Stewie,

"banister" and "baluster"
are hardly the same things.

A banister is the handrail that
sits atop the upright supports.

A baluster
is the supporting structure itself.

PAULSON: Is this my water?
CHRIS: No, it is not!

STEWIE: Brian, I've heard people say
"banister slats."

BRIAN: Well, those people, like you,
would be incorrect.

STEWIE: So, the baluster is that big,
round thing at the bottom of the stairs

-where the staircase begins?
-BRIAN: "Big, round thing"?

(CHUCKLES) You're...
You're just guessing stuff now.

I believe what you're
referring to is a newel post.

CHRIS: Mom and Dad are still
out there arguing.

Shouldn't they be in here?

SMITH: I'll get 'em.

CHRIS: Wasn't Shannon, like,
a P.A. here once?

STEWIE: Shut your mouth. Shannon's
the only professional in this building.

PETER: ...friends were getting married.

LOIS: How could I not know this?
SMITH: Hey, guys?

We have to deliver this episode
to the network today.

(PETER AND LOIS SIGH)

PAULSON: Oh, you guys are back
just in time for my big role.

LOIS: Hey, take it down a notch, Sarah.

You don't even have an entry
on the <i>Family Guy </i>wiki.

Even Gronk's dad has one.

<i>Welcome to Old Sturbridge Village,</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

<i>Here's a fun fact.</i>

<i>In colonial times, butter</i>
<i>and soap were the same thing.</i>

<i>I get that it's a fact, but how is it fun?</i>

(CHRIS LAUGHING LOUDLY)

CHRIS: Oh, my God! (LAUGHS)

<i>How am I gonna get out of this?</i>

PETER: Shh. nobody talk
for the next minute.

I'm about to sing my big song.

LOIS: Oh, go to hell, Peter.

<i>It's no use.</i>

<i>I guess I'm just stuck...</i>

<i>halfway down the stairs.</i>

<i>♪ Halfway down the stairs ♪</i>

<i>♪ Is a stair where I sit ♪</i>

<i>♪ There isn't any other stair ♪</i>

<i>♪ Quite like it... ♪</i>

LOIS: What the hell is this?

PETER: I'll tell you what it is,

an homage to a classic song
from <i>The Muppet Show,</i>

sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.

LOIS: I guarantee nobody got that.

PAULSON: I know this song!

LOIS: Oh, shut up, Sarah.

<i>♪ Where I always stop ♪</i>

<i>♪ Halfway up the stairs... ♪</i>

LOIS: I don't believe this.

You're just singing
the same song a frog sang.

How the hell
was this not cut from the show?

PETER: I kind of insisted they keep it.

I actually laid
in my parking space as a protest

until they gave in.

<i>♪ And all sorts of funny thoughts run... ♪</i>

LOIS: This is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

CHRIS: Um, are they setting up
a buffet lunch for us after this?

STEWIE: No, I think it's just pizza.

PETER: Can we please
just listen to the song?

LOIS: Are there
even any jokes in the song?

PETER: Do you not understand comedy?

It's a reference.
The joke is I'm singing it.

LOIS: Sorry to break it to you,
that's not a joke.

PETER: Damn it, now it's over.

Thanks a lot, Lois.
You completely ruined it.

LOIS: You better not
take that tone with me,

'cause this has been one hell of a day!

First, I find out you make
four times what I do.

Then I find out you were married before?

I mean, what else don't I know?

PETER: (SIGHS)
Well, if we're being honest, Lois,

you're really bad at having sex
when I'm drunk.

It's like you don't even enjoy it.

LOIS: You're impossible!

<i>Do not speak to the wicked.</i>

<i>Throw heads of cabbage at him.</i>

(GRUNTING)

<i>Damn it, Peter, this is all your fault.</i>

STEWIE: They're not even going to explain
how we all got stuck?

(SIGHS) Season 16, ladies and gentlemen.

Suddenly, the family is stuck
in the banister slats.

BRIAN: Baluster.

STEWIE: Brian, seriously, (BLEEP).

<i>I can get us out of here.</i>

<i>I'm good at figuring things out.</i>

<i>Like when I figured out</i>
<i>the secret of business,</i>

<i>pointing at stuff during meetings.</i>

LOIS: Peter,
there's something you don't know.

-Chris might not even be your son.
-PETER: What?

LOIS: I once slept with
Philip Seymour Hoffman.

CHRIS: You what?

SMITH: These montage-style cutaway gags

provide the animators the freedom

to go "beyond the page," as we say.

PETER: You slept with
Philip Seymour Hoffman?

LOIS: (LAUGHING) I sure did!

It was in his trailer during
that tornado chasing movie!

And all I know is, nine months later,

Chris is born!

CHRIS: Yay! I'm a bastard!

PAULSON: This scene reminds me of the time

I was being honored
at the Kennedy Center...

LOIS: Oh, baloney sandwich, Sarah!

Baloney sandwich!

In fact, you know what?

I'm tired of it, Peter!

You're dishonest, you're disrespectful,

and, frankly, I deserve better!

PETER: So...
So what are you saying, Lois?

LOIS: I'm saying this marriage is over!

Enjoy spending
the rest of your life alone

and enjoy doing the show
without me, 'cause I quit!

(RUSTLING IN BOOTH)

<i>...building a chair with my male friends.</i>

<i>Yeah, I can't believe...</i>

SMITH: Hi. Shannon Smith again.

You know, if you need a new Lois,
I do a pretty good one.

(BAD LOIS IMPERSONATION) Peter!

STEWIE: That was sad.

<i>Well, that was unexpected.</i>

<i>Well, I really regret confiscating </i>
<i>everyone's phones now.</i>

<i>How the hell are we gonna get out of here?</i>

<i>I got no idea, but we're in trouble.</i>

<i>Even more than when we were</i>
<i>literally in the game </i>Trouble.

BRIAN: Welcome back to the DVD
commentary episode.

If you're just joining us,
Lois has stormed out

and announced that she's
quitting the show after learning

that Peter and Sarah Paulson
were once married.

MEG: She also said Chris' dad
might be Philip Seymour Hoffman.

BRIAN: (CHUCKLING) More like
See-less Hoffman these days, right?

STEWIE: Hey, Patrick,
can we edit that out?

CLARK: Yeah.

STEWIE: Okay, good, let's do that.

MAN: <i>I don't see it.</i>

<i>Okay, there's also a real rock</i>
<i>you can throw through the glass.</i>

MAN: <i>I found the fake one.</i>

<i>Great.</i>

<i>Oh, thank God. Can you get us out of...</i>

<i>Man, this is gonna</i>
<i>be easier than I thought.</i>

<i>-Wait, you're robbing us?</i>
<i>-Sure am.</i>

<i>And, apparently, I can take my sweet time.</i>

MEG: Dad,
I'm really worried about Mom.

Should we maybe check on her?

STEWIE: Or be thinking about
a paternity test for Chris?

PETER: (SIGHS)
You're right, Meg. This is awful.

You think your mother's actually serious

about divorcing me and quitting the show?

And what was all that stuff
about Chris not being my son?

That can't be true, right?

<i>-It's a burglar party!</i>
-(LAUGHTER)

CHRIS: Hey, remember the one day
that guy who plays the burglar

was on set, he was passing out postcards
for his one-man show?

-(CHUCKLES): So tacky.
-STEWIE: I went.

Wasn't bad.
I think I sat next to his girlfriend,

'cause she laughed at everything.

<i>I've got a package for a... Brian Griffin.</i>

<i>I'm Brian Griffin.</i>

<i>Great. Sign here.</i>

<i>-Thanks.</i>
-(DEVICE BEEPS)

<i>All right, you guys.</i>

<i>Who's ready to have some fun?</i>

(CHEERING)

<i>Hey, Brian, they used your account</i>
<i>to buy a karaoke machine.</i>

<i>♪ Halfway down the stairs... ♪</i>

PETER: And she said
no one would know that song.

Well, look. The burglars know it.

<i>Oh, you're kidding me.</i>
<i>They're doing my song.</i>

<i>♪ There isn't any other stair</i>
<i>quite like it... ♪</i>

PETER: I-I got to go find your mother,
talk some sense back into her.

SETH MacFARLANE:
No need, Peter. Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

-Seth MacFarlane.
-PETER: Holy crap.

It's the mouse from <i>Sing.</i>

I'd recognize your voice anywhere.

MacFARLANE: Okay, settle down.

CHRIS: Mr. MacFarlane... (CHUCKLES)

What are you doing here?

MacFARLANE: I'm actually here to tell you
there's no need to talk sense into Lois.

Or for a paternity test.

Or for anyone to leave the show,

because none of you are real.

You're all TV characters voiced by me,

Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Mila Kunis.

BORSTEIN: Hey.
GREEN: Hey, what's up?

KUNIS: Hi, everybody.
PETER: Wait. What?

Okay, ha-hang on a second.

If I'm not real, then why does a fat nerd

pretend to be me at every Comic-Con?

MacFARLANE:
Please, please don't mention him.

-It'll only encourage him.
-PETER: And if you're me,

then why do you sound like my dog?

MacFARLANE: Because I'm also
the voce of your dog, Brian.

BRIAN: Wait. You do my voice, too?

MacFARLANE: Yeah, I do your voice.

BRIAN: So, the guy who handles your money,

he knows you by voice, right?

That's usually just a call.

MEG: Wait a second. If Dad's not real,

then he's not really my dad,

which means I'm not real?

KUNIS: That's right, Meg.

You're voiced by me, Mila Kunis.

MEG: Okay, question.

Why is the girl who voices me
super hot and I'm not?

KUNIS: Aw, that's so sweet.

You know, believe it or not,
I've actually had two kids.

CHRIS: Um, Ms. Kunis,
I would just like you to know

that I have no problem with you
breastfeeding in this booth.

(CHUCKLES)
May I ask if you're still...producing?

KUNIS: Uh, I, uh... No, uh, Chris,

I'm-I'm not, uh...
(CLICKS TONGUE) uh, producing.

CHRIS: What about you, Ms. Paulson?
Are you producing?

PAULSON: I can see
coming here was a mistake.

CHRIS: Excuse me, Seth Green...

GREEN: Chris, I'm a man.
I-I can't produce.

CHRIS: Actually, I just wanted to say

I enjoy your brilliant work
on <i>Robot Chicken.</i>

MacFARLANE: Wait, Seth Green,
are you feeding yourself compliments now?

GREEN: Well, let's just hear Chris out.

MacFARLANE: Okay, you know what?
We're getting off track here.

Like I was saying,
none of you actually exists.

STEWIE: Yes, you keep saying that.
Stop telling such horrible lies.

SMITH: Oh, Seth, since you're here,

would you mind recording
episodes 1714, 15, 16,

and an <i>NFL on Fox </i>promo?

MacFARLANE: Shannon, take a lap.

-(BOOTH DOOR OPENS)
-MEG: Oh, hey, look.

-Mom's back.
-LOIS: Don't get excited.

I forgot my paycheck.

PETER: Lois, you can't leave the show.

LOIS: (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah? Why not?

PETER: Well,
the captain of the <i>Orville</i> says

that none of us are real,
we're all cartoon characters.

LOIS: Not real? What-what the hell
are you talking about?

BORSTEIN: He's right, Lois.

Uh, my name's Alex Borstein,
and I do your voice on the show.

LOIS: Are you saying
the rough-edged comedy manager

from <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>
does my voice?

(LAUGHING) I'm so honored.

I love that show. You are hilarious.

PETER: Yeah,
Seth Green already did this bit.

LOIS: So, you're really saying
that we don't exist?

Peter, I-I'm not even sure
what this means,

but it sure makes it seem less important

how much money you make compared to me

or that maybe you neglected to tell me
everything about your past.

PETER: Yeah, none of that stuff matters.

LOIS: You're right, Peter.

I love you, and, whatever we share,

whether it's real or not,

I don't want to give any of it up.

PETER: Me either.

LOIS: It's safe
and familiar here with you.

So let's just bury our troubles
and cling to whatever this is.

I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Philip Seymour Hoffman.

PETER: It's fine. None of that matters.

MacFARLANE: Look, the truth is...
Again, this is Seth, not Brian,

the truth is, you should all be thankful

you're animated characters.

Peter, you can drink as much as you want,
and nothing bad will ever happen.

Lois, you haven't aged in decades.

Stewie, you get to travel through time
and do things no baby could ever do.

And, Brian, you've had sex
with more hot women

than a real dog
could ever reasonably expect.

Meg, I'll admit, you got the shaft.

Your actual life
is better than your cartoon life.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need all the real actors

to form a human shield around me
so I can get out of the building

without the <i>American Dad </i>people seeing me.

LOIS: Well, from now on, Peter,

-I'm not going any...
-PAULSON: Quiet!

My character's talking!

LOIS: Honestly, Peter,
I don't know how you...

PETER: I know. That right there
was the main reason we split up.

<i>...wiped out by the German aphid,</i>

<i>which was oddly brought by the Swedes</i>

<i>during the Great Depression,</i>

<i>which, for those of you who are too young,</i>

<i>was like a decade-long</i>
<i>case of the Mondays.</i>

<i>Well, I'm guessing you folks</i>
<i>are from out of town, too.</i>

-(LAUGHING)
-PETER: I never got that joke.

<i>Well, you guys, I guess</i>
<i>we all learned something</i>

<i>about not letting technology</i>
<i>rule our lives.</i>

<i>And, Mom, next time we get baluster slats,</i>

<i>let's make sure there's enough</i>
<i>room to get our heads out.</i>

(LAUGHING)

PETER: Okay, thanks for watching this
outmoded form of entertainment.

Now let's all go around the horn

and say what our favorite part
of the episode was.

-Chris?
-CHRIS: Pass.

-Meg?
-MEG: Don't care.

PETER: Okay, Stewie's asleep,

and I can see Brian
driving away in his car.

And just so you know,
he doesn't drive a Prius

like you see on the show.

He actually drives
a white convertible Mercedes.

Basically the car
a lady realtor would drive.

Oh, animation producer Shannon Smith,
I see you're still here.

You want to say something?

SMITH: Thanks, Peter. Actually...

PETER: Oh, Fuzzy Door. Bye.

a little while ago.

Huh. All these spray paint cans are empty.

What? Really?

(LAUGHING) H... How could such a thing

Screw this. Quick,

everything in the garbage.

We're throwing all this stuff out.

Wait. You're throwing away

Relax. It's not even his.

I took it from a front lawn
after a rain storm.

I thought they'd never leave, Factory Red.

So, I guess Thanos got the Mind Stone.

Wow. So now he's got all of 'em.

-I guess so.
-What does that mean for us?

I have no idea.

I knew it was gonna be us.

Oh, my God.
There's a hot woman over at the bar.

You know, I never forget

I don't think we've met.

I'm sure that kind of thing works great

Come on, let's get out of here.

Look, I'm not some bimbo

-Hey, Stewie.

Yep. Where are you headed?

Oh, I was just gonna
drive through some puddles

and see how long my tracks stay wet.

It was a soft steamer,
almost impossible to pick up.

Brian, have you seen my Big Wheel?

I can't find it anywhere!

What? No. Did you look...

Oh, wait a minute.

Peter threw out a bunch of stuff
from the garage yesterday.

Maybe it was in there.

Threw it out?
But today is our trash pickup day!

(GASPS) We're too late!

I've got to get that Big Wheel back.

Will you drive me to the town dump?

Really? Can't we just maybe
buy you a new one?

No, Brian. It has to be that Big Wheel.

It's very special to me.

I lost my V-card on that thing.

You what?

Yep, went over a speed bump
really fast and broke my hymen.

Stewie, you don't have a hymen.

-Yeah, not anymore.
-No, you're a boy.

I have to correct you there, Brian.
I'm a man.

'Cause, you know... broken hymen.

Boys don't have hymens!

Okay, then I may have just
ripped my taint.

Either way, I love that bike!

Hi. Can you help us?

We're trying to locate a lost Big Wh...

-(INSECTS BUZZING)
-My God,

there's just so...

much... garbage.

(MOANING)

Yes, we are in search of a Big Wheel

that was erroneously discarded
and collected today.

Oh, then it probably came in
with the morning load.

Sorry. That term always makes me blush.

But if it just came in, that's bad news.

Usually the newest, top layer of trash

just blows right into the ocean.

Yeah, I'm afraid your Big Wheel
may be gones for good.

Dear God, this is horrible!

I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!

Phew. Ooh, something smells good
in this box.

I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!

Damn it. Monica's not responding
to any of my texts.

You're still tryin'
to bang that 44-year-old?

-What are you sending her?
-Mostly porn.

Just shots of rods.

All angles.
Up, down, left, right.

Lois, maybe you could help me
ask out this woman I met.

She's close to your age.

But she won't respond to any of my texts.

Oh, well, that's easy.

Just ask her if she's
all caught up on <i>This Is Us.</i>

(PHONE VIBRATES)

She says, "I'm one behind,
so no spoilers.

Hysterical laughing face,
hysterical laughing face."

How... How is that funny?

It's not, but you're in.

Great. This is exactly
the stuff I need to know.

Lois, will you teach me the ways
of the middle-aged woman?

All right.
I'm a sucker for romance.

Thanks, Lois. This could open up
a whole new world for me.

Like one of those kids
who gets a device

that allows them to hear
for the first time.

Billy, can you hear?

Yes!

Amazing! This is amazing.

Your mom and I are going
to get a divorce.

I'm in love with someone else,

and I didn't want
to say it with the silly hands.

Brian, I've been doing research
on my Big Wheel.

If it ended up in the ocean,

it most likely has traveled
to Garbage Island.

What's Garbage Island?

The other name for the
North Atlantic Garbage Patch,

an enormous cluster of man-made debris

floating in the middle of the ocean.

This is terrible.
We got to raise awareness,

-let people know about it.
-I agree.

It's like a giant garbage whirlpool.

Brian?

You heard me.

Anyway, I'm heading there
to find my Big Wheel.

Perhaps you'll come with me.

Boating to an island of garbage?

I'm in. Maybe Peter will come, too.

Hey, Peter, want to go on a boat ride?

Oh, uh, I can't be in stories
for a couple of episodes.

(WHISPERING) I'm real-life pregnant.

Oh, my God. I had no idea.

(HIGH-PITCHED) I know!

Anyway, Mama's got to get off her feet.

All right, time to retrieve
my Big Wheel from Garbage Island.

Let's do it.

Hey, how'd you get the money
to rent this boat anyway?

Oh, I got a part-time job at Target.

Okay, technically, I work at
the weird, in-store Pizza Hut.

ANNOUNCER:
<i>The Target In-Store Pizza Hut.</i>

<i>Feed it to your fat kid</i>
<i>while you buy off-brand tennis shoes.</i>

Now, Glenn, I'm gonna help you
get into the mind

of a middle-aged woman.

Step one, we all go friggin' nuts
over Yankee Candles,

so to help you learn all the flavors,
I made a little quiz.

I'm gonna give you a name,
and you tell me

if it's the name of
a Yankee Candle or a porn star.

-Okay.
-Black Coconut.

Porn star?

No, that's a candle.
Amber Gold.

-Candle?
-That is a candle.

April Showers.

Um... both?

Very good. I tried to trick you there,
but you got it. Both.

Okay, okay, I'm writing this all down.

But, Lois, Monica agreed
to have dinner with me tomorrow.

That's great!

I suppose.

But I don't think
I can pull it off by myself.

Will you come and just be nearby

to give me tips and help me
get through it?

Fine, but I'll have to
rearrange my schedule.

Friday nights are when
Peter and I do edibles

and go to the aquarium.

This is awesome.

Peter, I'm freaking out.

Yeah, don't... don't...
don't ruin it for me.

Okay, I spy something blue.

Uh... the ocean?

Nope.

The sky?

Hey, you got it in two, bud.

That ties the record.

Stewie, I'm starting to wonder

if we didn't think this
all the way through.

No, it's fine. It'll all be worth it
once we get to Garbage Island.

Not a lot of wind today.

No.

Hey, what causes wind?

Well, if my reading material
has taught me anything,

it's just a cloud with lips.

Blustery...

is a good word.

Uh-huh.

Mm... Moana.

Mm.

I never saw <i>Moana.</i>

You never saw <i>Moana?</i>

(PHONE VIBRATES)

Your blowout looks nice.

Oh, thanks.

So, um, I noticed a yoga mat
in the back of your car.

-How often do you do yoga?
-(PHONE VIBRATES)

-Is everything all right?
-Hmm?

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

My, um... my... my dad
locked himself out of his car.

Oh, sorry. Do you need to help him?

Um, no, uh, no. He, um, he broke, uh...

broke the window with his foot.

High heel. My dad's a woman now.

-Oh.
-(PHONE VIBRATES)

(CHUCKLES)
You're lucky we came here.

I almost suggested Mickey D's.

(LAUGHING) Oh, my God.

That's so informal.

Are you talking about McDonald's?

-(CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah!
-(PHONE VIBRATES)

Another thing
I was just thinking about is...

"AMBER Alert, white Honda Accord,

license plate..." Uh, uh, I mean,

Pinterest sure has
some neat pictures of sinks.

Doesn't it?

Listen, what if we just bail on dinner

and head back to my place?

Great! I'm in.

Wait! You have to pay for the bread.

Hey!

You have to pay for the bread!

You have to pay for the bread!

You have to pay for the bread!

The bread!

(CRYING) You have to pay

for the bread!

(CRYING)

(CREAKING)

(GRUNTING)

Moana?

Oh, my God. Brian.

Look!

We made it!

We made it to Garbage Island!

My God, I don't believe it.

Whoa, look at all the packaging
from Mickey D's.

What? Oh, my God,
I've never heard that.

"Mickey D's." That is just great.

Anyway, let's start looking
for my Big Wheel.

Hey, check it out,
a VCR just sitting here.

I'm taking this sucker home.

(GRUNTS)

(GASPS)

Oh, crap.

Brian, you idiot.

Now how the hell are we supposed
to get back to land?

We're both going to die.

Oh, look, a message in a bottle
is washing up.

Maybe this'll help.

PETER: <i>Dear England,</i>

<i>Enclosed, please find one bottle fart</i>
<i>in exchange for Russell Brand.</i>

<i>We feel this is appropriate compensation.</i>

<i>Yours, et cetera, America.</i>

-(FLATULENCE)
-(GROANING)

Damn it, Brian!
How could you sink our boat?

We're going to die!

MAN: You guys need any help?

-Aah!
-Aah! Who the hell are you?

Name's Taylor. 'Sup?

How the hell did you get here?

Oh, I, uh...

I... I fell off a booze cruise.

-You what?
-Yep, washed up here.

Matter of fact, we all did.

How are you all planning
to get back home?

Get back home?
Why would we want to do that?

Yeah, we've got everything we need here.

There's tons of free,
half-eaten food that washes up.

And we just bang each other all day.

That, uh...

that doesn't sound terrible.

Hey, so, we've been stuck out here
for over 20 years.

Can you catch us up
on all the important things

that we've missed?

So, no way!

Kylie Jenner and Tyga
are no longer together?

How did Robert Kardashian die?

Guilt cancer.

From what?

Oh, boy.

So people thought the dancing
Judge Itos were funny?

For a while, yes.

Is Leno still doing it?

No, he's not hosting anymore.

Oh, so Conan got <i>The Tonight Show?</i>

-(SIGHS)
-Oh, come o...

A... And so what about Craig Kilborn?
Is he still on?

I'm actually right here.

Oh, right. Hey, Craig.

Oh, hi, Glenn.

I haven't seen you in a while.

-H... How are things with Monica?
-Who?

Monica, y... your hot date
from the other night.

Oh, yeah. I plowed her. Thanks again.

But... but I thought she was the one.

Yeah, no, what I realized is

that all those texts you sent me,

they're like my bible now.

I just keep using these same tips
on different women.

I owe you, Lois.

You've opened up a whole world
of middle-aged legs to me.

(HUMMING)

Oh, my God. Quagmire's
terrorizing middle-aged women,

and I'm responsible for it.

I've created a monster.

Oh, no! My LUNA Bar for women.

(HAUNTING MUSIC PLAYING)

I'm stuck in here.

(SEABIRD SQUAWKS IN DISTANCE)

Hey, what day is it?

Trash day.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Brian, look, I found my Big Wheel.

-Cool.
-It's more than cool, Brian.

I believe the Big Wheel
may actually be our ticket

off the island.

You see, I've calculated that,

even with both of our weights,

it will still be capable
of flotation.

My plan is to attach

six Jimmy Buffett
margarita machines to it,

which should be able
to propel us home.

Home? I don't think
I want to go home.

What? What are you talking about?

I'm saying I like it here
on Garbage Island.

O... Okay, I... I don't think
I can talk to you,

because, right now,
you're making less sense

than an M.C. Escher floor plan.

So, how's it coming?

Are we gonna finish on schedule?

I don't know, Mr. Escher.

I've never put six stairways
all in one spot.

And I've lost, like,
ten of my guys in here.

Hey, I need a hammer!

I hate this place!

I quit!

(GRUNTS)

Uh, 'scuse me, I'm...
I'm looking for anything by...

Mike "Bubble"?

LOIS: It's "Bublé," you idiot!

Oh, hey, Lo... Ow!

That feels great!

Glenn Quagmire, I tried
to help you meet a nice woman,

but you just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

What are you talking about?

I thought I was helping you find love,

and, instead, you used me as a tool

to get down every middle-aged
woman's pants in town.

Slacks, Lois.
They call them slacks.

You wouldn't know that
if it wasn't for me!

(SIGHS) You're right.

You were kind to me,
and I took advantage of it.

I owe you an apology.

Well, thank you.

Here, let me make it up to you.

I'll buy you a coffee, and...

do you like the music of Ray...

"LaMountain"?

"LaMontagne."

Thank you.

Hey, beautiful, you want to take
a pointless girl-stride walk

and listen to Ray LaMontagne?

-Sure.
-Great.

See ya, Lois.

Last chance, Brian.

You're really not coming with me?

I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm not.

I know it's weird to say, but...

it's kind of just too perfect for me here.

I see.

Well, I should go.

Fort Lauderdale Tanya found
a four-piece puzzle

TANYA:
Where does the cow go?

It's all corners, babe.

(SIGHS) I have to say,

I never imagined
saying goodbye to you, Brian.

So long take very good care

dear friend of mine farewell.

That's odd phrasing.

Sorry, it's been hard to think straight.

From the moment we arrived,

I've either been drunk or ejaculating.

These are things you don't say to a baby.

Goodbye, Brian.

Goodbye, Stewie.

You're an enormously important
part of my life, Brian,

and I couldn't bear
the thought of losing you.

I assumed it unlikely
you'd change your mind,

so I added the fans
from many, many Dell laptops

to the back of my Big Wheel

so I could simply
tow everyone back to land.

Wow.

Thank you.

That means a lot to me.

Well, our journey taught me
something, Brian.

You can throw away just about
anything in this world,

but you can't throw away a friendship.

No, you can't, Stewie.

Cool if I say goodbye to the garbage?

Let's welcome our first guest,

my colleague at Channel 5
and now a best-selling author,

-Tricia Takanawa.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

So, Tricia, tell us about your book.

I understand it's been number one
on Amazon for many weeks, long time.

It's called <i>Throw It Away:</i>
<i>The Life-Improving Art of De-cluttering.</i>

People nowadays own too much stuff.
I am encouraging them to throw it away.

Genius! So just throw everything out?

Not quite. If it kindles joy, you keep it.

But if no joy, you throw it away.

-Can I look at your phone?
-No. Use your activity book.

I already did all the fun ones at church.

It's very simple.

I came up with it after hiking
to the top of Mount Asia

and meditating on Epiphany Bridge.

Ah! Peter, these are Asian techniques,
and they're new to me.

I have to buy this book,
read two chapters,

then leave it on my nightstand for a year.

That fart was the lady next to me.

Whatever. I'm getting that book, Peter.

And it's for reading,
not for killing spiders.

Oh, don't worry, Lois.
I got a better method for doing that now.

I'm really excited
you're humanely relocating me

to outside your house.

Oh, yeah. Me and the fellas
thought it was time.

Oh, no...

Kids! Peter! Get down here!

Everyone, I just read
Tricia Takanawa's book,

and it was really inspiring.

She says that when you
de-clutter your house,

you de-clutter your mind
and clear a path to true happiness.

How about a clear path to dinner, bitch.

So I want everyone to go through
every single item you own,

and if it doesn't kindle joy,
throw it away.

See? This sweater, it's okay,
but it doesn't kindle joy.

I'm throwing it out.

Now, get to it.

Wow, she's really all in on this.

Well, she's searching for something
to fill her empty life.

You remember when she thought the solution

was putting a lemon slice
in a plain glass of water

for a "very simple kind of pleasure"?

Ah. Perfection.

And just the thing to wash down six Xanax
from four different prescriptions.

Mm.

Tomorrow, this will seem
like a new idea again.

Oh, my voodoo doll of Mom.

Yeah, totally throw.
It never worked, anyway.

LOIS: (IN DISTANCE)
Ow! What the hell was that?

Oh. Keep.

on that umbrella. Keep.

Woody and Buzz,
who definitely are not alive,

so I can turn my back... on them!

Well, I guess they passed the test.

They're really... not alive!

LOIS: Peter, what are you doing up there?

Oh, nothing, Lois. I was just making sure
I kept my Woody and Bu...

I knew it.

Peter, there's nothing
in your throwaway pile.

I know. I'm keeping everything.

-Everything kindles joy!
-That can't be true.

Even this old tin can on a string?

I mean, what are you even doing with this?
You're a grown man!

Why would you possibly need this?
If anything is garbage, this is garbage.

Sounds like things aren't going well
at the Griffins.

This is why no girls allowed.

I hate to do this, guys,
but Peter's been compromised.

Oh, look, my box of ribbons
I've saved from various presents.

Oh, I'm not throwing that out.
That's a good ribbon.

This is a good ribbon, too.
These are all very usable ribbons.

-Hey, little guy. How's the sorting going?
-I'm not getting rid of my ribbons!

(GRUNTS)

if I could borrow a ribbon.

Whoa. You drunk already, bro?

What's your next fake writing project,

(CHUCKLES) No, Lois,
that would be ridiculous.

Lois, you could just pee in these
like a space suit, right?

-Peter, you don't kindle joy.
-What?

I'm sorry, but I'm looking at you,
and I'm just not feeling joy.

What... what are you saying?

Peter, I don't think I can have you
in the house right now.

You're throwing me away?

Yes.

I'm so sorry, Peter.

I just feel like if you don't kindle joy,
and that's what the book said...

You can't kick me out of my own house.

The house that I pay for?

That I semi-pay for
with help from your parents?

That your parents pay for entirely,

Okay.

-What's happening again?
-I'm asking you to leave the house.

The house that I pay for?

Thanks for letting me
crash here, Quagmire.

No problem, Peter.

I'm sure Lois'll cool down
in a few days, and you'll be back home.

Yeah, she'll be fine.
And you won't even know I'm here.

I mean, I need to keep up
with my workouts.

But, yeah, this'll be great.

Hi, kids. Do you need those hats?

-I mean...
-It's the foundation of my look,

but we can discuss it.

I feel like they're clutter.
I feel like you don't need them.

Let's just see what you look like
without... Whoa! You kids are Legos?

Sorry you had to find out this way, Mom.

Oh. Hi, Brian. You're carrying clutter,
I'll just throw it out.

Ha! A clean house means a clean soul,
and a clean soul is a happy one.

That was a whole pizza.
And I didn't even start eating it yet.

You're surprised about a pizza?
She threw out a whole guy.

Yeah, Lois might be starting to lose it.

Even her cutaways are getting
a little too minimalist. Have you noticed?

Donald Trump's hair is unusual.

Oh, hey, don't use the toilet.
I'm making wine.

Peter, you got to get out.

The truth is, I should have asked you
to leave after the other night.

-Hello?
-PETER: Quagmire?

Yeah?

-PETER: I can't sleep.
-So?

-PETER: I can't sleep.
-What do you want me to do?

PETER: Will you read me a story?

Peter, (STUTTERS) I'm in the middle
of something here.

-Like, maybe a <i>Clifford?</i>
-Peter, get out of here!

<i>-Clifford?</i>
-No! Not now!

Quagmire, <i>Clifford </i>now?

Ugh! Just read him the story.

"Clifford was just too big
for the bathtub."

-Isn't he big, Peter?
-Clifford big!

"So they decided
to hose him in the yard instead,

"but Clifford couldn't fit
through the door."

See that, Peter?

(SNORING)

Finally. All right, ladies,
I guess we can...

Wouldn't you know it.

Oh, my God, they took the whole roof off.

Everybody thinks they can kick me out?

Well, who gets the last laugh now?

I get to sleep with all my stuff

in a storage unit
on the highway access road.

Okay, can't go to bed till you make one.

(SIGHS)

All right, just got to make one.

-What the (BLEEP) is this?

-I've never seen it before.
-I don't know.

Stewie, she's got your time machine.

Well, don't drag that
down the stairs or else...

(LOIS GRUNTING)

(ROARS)

Thank God, everything's back to normal.

Pe-tew. Gross.

I tell you to clean your rooms,
and the first thing you do,

is put all your science projects
in Stewie's closet?

-Mom, we didn't...
-Stop arguing and get rid of it.

And give me those glasses.
They're cluttering up your face.

-I need them to see.
-They're not bringing me joy!

You realize there are four of us
and one of her.

-If we rushed her all at once...
-That's not gonna work.

She's clearly developed
the strength of the insane.

-What did you say, Chris?
-Uh, nothing. I'm sorry!

Chris, I will not have
your comic strip anger

cluttering up my house.

It's negative, and it ruins my joy.

-Get it out of here!
-Now you've done it.

You've made me 1930s work whistle angry!

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

Shut up, Meg!

-What? I didn't say anything.
-You just did.

Your voice, it's cluttering up
my space. Get out.

-But...
-Get out of my house!

You know, Lois, one could argue
that your bra is clutter.

Nice try, dirtbag. Leave.

Figured it was gonna happen, anyway.
Might as well go out on my terms.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

I cluttered my pants.
It did not kindle joy.

(FOOTSTEPS ECHOING)

(SIGHS) Well, that does it.

I got rid of all the clutter.

I made order out of chaos,
(IN SING-SONG VOICE) and it's beautiful.

Ah, there's even an echo in here now.

I'm so happy!

LOIS' ECHO: I'm very unhappy!

My house is at peace, so I am at peace.

LOIS' ECHO: You're all alone and sad.

Simplicity is good for the soul.

LOIS' ECHO:
Your soul is as empty as this house,

this house, this house.

(PANTING)

(PANTING)

But I did what the book said.
I did it all.

Why didn't it work?
Why am I still not happy?

What have I done?

Looks like there's only one thing left
to get rid of.

The mirror.

(GRUNTS)

-Look. Towels!
-They don't even match.

Who cares? They're still thirsty.

She's not here. Come on.

(ECHOING) Wow. Everything's gone.

What's that?

Words, letters, letters and words,

mm-hmm, mm-hmm, more words and letters.

Chris, can't you read?

No, I know the letters
when they're on their own,

but, you know,
when they team up like this,

I'm just, uh... I'm sort of outmatched.

"It was my fault, not yours.

"I'm so sorry,
and I love you all. Goodbye.

"P.S. Please throw this note out.
It is clutter."

Oh, my God. Where could she be?

You don't think
she killed herself, do you?

We're gonna need professional help.

Oh, when Mommy's unstable, I feel unsafe.

We're so glad you didn't kill yourself.

I wasn't gonna jump, you idiot.
I just came here to think.

You made me lose my balance,

but when I landed in all that garbage,
I realized it saved my life.

Literally, yes, but also
it saves my life every day.

The joy that you find in everything,

the fact that every little thing
you see kindles joy for you,

that's the right attitude, Peter.

And I'm gonna try to have
that attitude from now on.

-I love you.
-I love you, too, Lois.

Oh, okay. Thanks, Mom.

Yeah, that de-cluttering thing
was nice for a while,

but I definitely went overboard.

I don't know. Somehow, an idea

<i>Refrigerator Meg here.</i>

<i>If diabetes has you down,</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>Pancresta may cause</i>

<i>Do not take Pancresta if you are pregnant </i>
<i>or plan on becoming pregnant.</i>

<i>If you have a problem with addiction,</i>

<i>Chopping up and snorting</i>
<i>Pancresta may amplify</i>

<i>Rock concerts on Pancresta may</i>

<i>Pancresta may cause intense philosophical </i>

<i>Pancresta can be delivered</i>
<i>directly to your home,</i>

(NEEDLE SQUEAKS)

Meg, like everyone
who doesn't have diabetes,

I'm not sure how it works,
but I do know you could go blind,

you could have organ failure,
you could lose your feet.

No amount of fame is worth this.

<i>James Woods High School</i>
<i>will also be saluting</i>

<i>their own diabetic Internet celebrity</i>

You know,
I think you like driving this Hummer.

You're a Hummer guy.

I'm not a Hummer guy, Stewie.
I'm a responsible Prius driver

who's making the best of a bad situation.

I didn't ask for this car.

I also didn't ask for these
slowpokes in front of me.

What's happened to you?

I-I don't know.
All I know is I love this Hummer.

God, the power.

I deserved a sweet ride
for a little while.

It felt so good.

Well, let's see,
I drive about 4,000 a year,

so when this car goes, I'll be...

Dead for 18 years.

Let me just say goodbye to the Hummer.

I'll miss you, Mark McGrath.

I'll miss scaring the hell
out of homeless people

with your cruise-ship-grade air horn.

I'll miss catching the eye of women

smoking outside of government buildings.

But mostly,
I'll miss driving a military vehicle

45 miles an hour through a school zone

-(GLASS SHATTERS)

The back side of this car is all wrecked.

Who fixed this thing, your wife?

-No, she can't fix a car.
-That's my point.

She passed away last month.
She was addicted to Pancresta,

so she didn't so much pass away as elevate

to a higher level of consciousness.

Just turned into a smiling beam
of light right before my eyes.

She told me to be at peace, and I was.

I'm hearing a lot of good stuff
about this Pancresta.

Sorry, Mr. Griffin.
I don't know what happened.

Looks like you got the Hummer

for another couple of days at least.

Stewie, why did you do it?

Oh, you were having so much fun, Bri.

Besides, the Earth is on fire.

One dog driving a Prius won't fix that.

-MAN: (WHOOPS) I love you, Carol!

We're glad you could come over
for dinner tonight, Carol.

Thank you for having me.

I've been having such a hard
time since Adam passed away.

-STUDIO AUDIENCE: Aw...
-(MAN WHOOPS)

I want to squeeze your butt
and then take your pants down

and look at your butt!

We still can't believe he's gone.

He was such a great mayor,
and a great uncle to the kids.

Wait, Uncle Adam is dead?

Yeesh. How many people
has this show killed?

-Yeah, we're all gonna miss...
-MAN: Hey, don't touch me, man!

I'm leaving. I know...
I know what I did. I'm leaving.

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

Yeah, we're all gonna miss Mayor West.

You know what'll make you feel better,
Aunt Carol?

Doing an Indian guy.

Meg, stop eating with the serving spoon.

Nah.

I just wish there was some way
we could honor

Adam's memory here in town.

You know what we should do?

We should rename the high school
for Mayor West.

What, you mean change it
from James Woods High?

Yeah. James Woods
is an embarrassment to Quahog.

He's a political troll
and a maniac on Twitter.

I think that's a great idea, Brian.

You should meet with Principal Shepherd
and suggest it.

Awesome. And while you do that,

I'll make a special video
dedication reminding people

of how great Mayor West was.

Yes. To Adam West High.

You probably know what you're doing.

Let's do it.

-(CROWD GASPS OVER SPEAKERPHONE)

The only thing that's left to do now

is for you to pay the normal

Principal Shepherd,
someone named Eddie Payups

is here to see you.

Tell him I need one minute.

Anyway, great idea. We'll have a ceremony

to change the name
of the school this week.

What's the score of that game right now?

It's, uh, 85-75.

Ugh! Not enough.

Wow, we did it.

We changed the name of the school.

Well, you know,
it was the right thing to do, Brian.

Like when I had to give bad news
to that improv team.

I called you here to tell you
that you're all 45-years-old.

Go home and be with your children.

Thank you, everybody, for coming today

as we honor one
of Quahog's finest citizens,

Mayor Adam West.

We will start today's ceremony

with the traditional
21-cat launcher salute

to honor our wacky but beloved mayor.

Ready! Aim! Meow!

-Brian, wait.
-Oh, hey, Carol.

Do you need me to walk you to your car
in case the studio audience guy shows up?

No, he killed himself
in my downstairs shower.

Oh, good. That's good.

I just wanted to thank you
for what you did today for Adam.

He was a great man.

You know, I see a lot of him in you.

Oh, no. Are we gonna kiss?

-We're gonna kiss, aren't we?
-I came here to say

that what you did was very honorable.

It showed real leadership,

and I think you should be
the next mayor of Quahog.

Ah, damn it!

Oh, I couldn't do that.
I don't know anything about politics.

Although crazier things have happened.

Harry Truman didn't have any experience.

Of course he did. He was vice president,
and before that, a United States senator.

Oh, word?

Brian, is this gonna be
a politics episode?

I... I think it might be.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

No one likes those.

So, Carol was just going on and on
about how I should be mayor.

And it's got me thinking,
it is an interesting idea.

-You think I should do it?
-Absolutely not.

-I mean, if not me, who?
-Anyone.

-If not now, when?
-Never.

-You know, why not me?
-A million reasons.

I mean, who do you want in there,
some career politician?

-Yes.
-What are they gonna do?

-Govern.
-Thanks, Stewie. Your support means a lot.

-You don't have it.
-You know what? I'm gonna do it.

Guys, I have an announcement.

-I'm gonna run for mayor.
-That's a terrible idea.

You idiot, Brian. Meg, fart on Brian.

I can't. I don't have one in the chamber.

The one time I give you a chance,
you're not ready.

Chris, tag in for Meg.

(FARTS)

(GASPING)

See that kid? He's a gamer.

Great job, Chris. Now, go hit the showers.

Meg, you miss 100%
of the farts you don't take.

That kid's going places.
He's going all the way.

If only they knew.

(FARTING)

PETER: That's my boy!

Welcome back, Quahog. And now it's time

for a new segment on our show
called "On the Same Sofa,"

in which a guest and I have a conversation

while sitting on the same sofa.

My guest tonight is mayoral
candidate Brian Griffin.

-Thank you for coming, Brian.
-Pleasure, Tom.

And thank you for allowing me
up on the furniture.

-I don't always get to do that.
-Oh, word?

Now, I understand
you're running unopposed.

That gives you a bit
of an advantage, doesn't it?

Well, Tom, I welcome a challenger.

Not the one that exploded, but, um...

That's probably gonna get me
in trouble right there.

Good thing I'm running unopposed.

Well, we've now reached
the middle of the interview,

where I ask the guest,
"How's the sofa so far?"

So, Brian, how's the sofa so far?

So far, so-so.

I see. Sophie?

So far we've got a so-so sofa.

SOPHIE: Great.
Okay, Tom, we go live in three,

-two...
-What? None of that aired?

It's all right, we can recreate it.

SOPHIE: And you're on.

So, Brian, I understand
you like eating your own poop.

What's that about?

Ugh. Turn that off.

I can't believe
we're gonna have a dog for mayor.

We're gonna be the laughing stock
of the whole country.

Even Sean Hannity's talking about us.

He's a weird-looking guy.

-Put up a picture of Sean Hannity.
-Can we do that?

Yeah, Tosh does it all the time.
Put it up.

JOE: Yeah, he does look weird.

QUAGMIRE: Yeah. Who does he look like?

CLEVELAND: I'm seeing Mr. Doubtfire.

PETER: High-sodium Superman?

JOE: He looks like an angry face
drawn on a thumb.

QUAGMIRE: The richest guy at Rite Aid?

CLEVELAND: Or the mayor who won't close
the beaches in <i>Jaws.</i>

JOE: Wreck-It Ralph at a job interview.

QUAGMIRE: You know that's a guy

who's roughly led his wife
out of parties by the elbow.

PETER: A guy whose ice-cream
parlor just went broke.

CLEVELAND: He looks like
a handsome Weeble.

JOE: Or a hot Frankenstein.

QUAGMIRE: Yeah, but either way,
he's that Little League coach

the parents hope their kids don't get.

PETER: He looks like a fish
that inflates to scare predators.

JOE: The inside trader who kills himself

the day his prison sentence
is supposed to start.

CLEVELAND: I'm thinking
Fred and Barney's son.

QUAGMIRE: Trust me on this.
Strip club lunch regular.

JOE: I feel like that's a dad who's ripped
his kid's posters off the wall.

CLEVELAND: And sleeps in pajamas
buttoned to the top.

JOE: 72-ounce steak contest entrant.

PETER: Drowned-in-the-lake-last-month
Colin Farrell.

All right, that was fun.
Hey, let's do Matthew Perry. I'll start.

He looks like a pelican
trying to swallow a fish that's too big.

JOE: Barn owl in human skin.

-he wished to be a pool noodle.

Uh, can you hang on?
I'm finishing a phone interview.

And that's why I would never joke

about the Space Shuttle
<i>Challenger </i>tragedy.

I can't believe I said that twice.

Now, how can I help you, Brian?

Why are you doing this?
Why are you running for mayor?

Uh, let me think. Oh, yeah. Out of spite.

-Spite for you.
-That's not a reason to get into politics.

It's the only reason to get into politics.

Well, you're just wasting your time,
because you're not gonna win.

I don't know about that.
You seem pretty afraid.

(SCOFFS) The only thing I'm afraid of

are fire truck sirens
and things that look like faces.

-Fine. See you at the debate.
-Fine!

-What are you gonna wear?
-I don't know.

I was thinking, like,
a collared shirt, jacket, no tie.

-Yeah, yeah, no tie.
-Yeah, definitely no tie.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

That son of a bitch.

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker,
and I will be your moderator

for tonight's mayoral debate.

Not because I want to,
but because it counts

as community service
for open-hand smacking

an Uber Eats guy.

Let's meet our candidates.

First, the impeccably-dressed
Glenn Quagmire.

-Thank you, Tom.
-Is that a Windsor knot?

Double Windsor, Tom.

Excellent. Some might describe
that tie as "mayoral."

Next up, we have super-caj Brian Griffin.

I was gonna wear a tie. He told me not to.

He's already losing,
and it hasn't started yet.

First question: as candidates for mayor,
how do I put my apps into a folder?

I know how to get them shaky,
I just can't get them in a folder.

You just drag them into each other.
But you know what else is shaky?

My opponent's economic plan.

It's irresponsible for the town
to get two credit cards

and just swap the balance
back and forth each month.

But... But the town would get miles.

Whoa, so I can just name
the folder whatever I want?

"Tom's Stuff."

SOPHIE: Okay, Tom,
we go live in three, two...

Good evening, Quahog,
and welcome to your mayoral debate.

What the... None of that aired?
I was totally winning.

That's okay, we'll recreate it.

Now, Mr. Quagmire,
you're a dirty sex fiend.

Why would you wear a tie
to a casual debate?

Good question, Tom.

And I'll answer that with one word: pizza!

(CHEERING)

Damn it, he burned me twice.

And, you're not gonna, like,
bring pizza for everyone, right?

No, it's a debate.
They'll have food there.

Right, they'll have food there.
Okay, so, no tie, no pizza.

I'll see you there.

Open the door, Quagmire.

Hey, Brian.
I was just emptying my bus garbage.

Would you like to eat it first?

What's the catch?

God, you're a dumb beast.

Come on in.

-Have a seat, Brian.
-I'm fine standing, thank you.

Let's cut the crap. The only
reason you're running is...

-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-...to make me look ridiculous.

And I am not just some idiot

to be laughed at and not taken seriously.

Ha! Sit down, Snoopy.

What did you say?

I said, "Sit, Ubu, sit. Good dog."

Well, sure it does. Googardo?

Say something if you're okay, Googardo.

The more you say it,
the more it doesn't sound like anything.

Googardo? Move something
if you're alive, Googardo.

-Oh, my God!
-Oh, look, there's his jacket.

Oh, yeah, his name was Frank.

I can't believe this.
I'm gonna die with Glenn Quagmire.

Hey, dying with Glenn Quagmire
was good enough for Googardo.

<i>Vaya con Dios, </i>Googy.

Please don't use the familiar form
of a guy's name you never knew.

What was I thinking getting
on this bus with you?

It was dumber than when Peter
hired that raccoon accountant.

PETER: All right, well,
you're the money guy.

Let's put it
all in to slightly-open trash cans.

You have anything to eat in here?

Yeah, there's some edible underwear
in that bag over there.

Ugh, isn't there anything else?

I have a ball of peanut butter
with a pill inside.

Hmm, wish you hadn't told me
about the pill.

(SNIFFING)

You know, this underwear's not bad.

Are they for your political groupies?

No, these... These are men's.

They're... They're mine.

Quagmire, why did you
even want to be mayor?

Honestly? I just want
a street named after me.

I think that's kind of cool.

Actually, that is kind of cool.

Why did you want to be mayor?

Mayor West told me he went
to 65 pancake breakfasts a year.

That number... That... That stuck with me.

What, like, the...
Like, the pancakes were free?

-Yeah.
-65.

That... That's, like, pancakes
every Saturday morning

and probably some Sundays.

And sometimes it's, like,
kids making the pancakes,

and you get these mondo huge ones.

Wow.

Probably no chocolate
chip pancakes, though.

Are you kidding me?
65 a year, you're gonna get

at least eight to ten
chocolate chip pancake events.

-You think eight to ten?
-Yes.

And now that I say it out loud,
eight to ten sounds low.

So, pancakes is why
you wanted to be mayor?

Well, pancakes and...
Look at the people in our town.

-Who else is gonna do it?
-I know.

This is such a garbage town.

You know, when you think about it,

we're really
the only two viable candidates.

I mean, you're a pilot.
You're responsible for people's lives.

You make quick decisions.

Or the machinery in the plane
makes quick decisions.

My point is, you're a smart guy.

Thank you.

And now you say something nice about me.

-Like what?
-Like I'm good company,

and I'm smart and funny,

and I'm invited to all your pool parties.

And I should just come over
if I hear one of them going on.

-No, thank you.
-But... But you have to.

I'm not gonna say something I don't mean

just because your ego needs to hear it.

See? That's why I ran against you.

Because I know that's the only
reason you were doing this.

You're a complete tool!

WOMAN: <i>You do sound</i><i>like kind of a tool.</i>

See? Even Melissa from OnStar
thinks you're a tool.

You've been listening this whole time?

<i>There's nothing to do at OnStar.</i>
<i>People have iPhones now.</i>

<i>I just listen in to cars.</i>
<i>Sometimes there's sex.</i>

Screw this.
We just got to get out of this bus.

Regardless of what we think of each other,
this is no way for us to die.

I'm gonna try and climb up to the street

-and see if I can get help.
-Just be careful.

I don't know how stable this thing is.

(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)

Oh, my God. You just got hit in the throat

with a gentleman's dildo.

-Hey, Melissa.
<i>-What? What happened?</i>

He got hit in the throat
with a gentleman's dildo.

(LAUGHS) <i>See,</i><i>this is why I listen.</i>

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

(GRUNTING)

(QUAGMIRE GRUNTS)

(BOTH SCREAM)

(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

Mayor West?

(GRUNTING)

Hey, guys. Don't mind me.

I'm gonna go steal
that bus driver's identity.

The Celtics are free money tonight!

Well, Lois, you almost had
a female president.

I almost had a dog mayor.

I can't believe they canceled the election

after they thought Brian
and Mr. Quagmire were dead.

Does that mean we still need a mayor?

ANNOUNCER: <i>It sure does, America.</i>

<i>Who do you think should be</i>
<i>the next mayor of Quahog?</i>

<i>Register your votes at fox.com/family-guy.</i>

Your votes don't count. It's a trick.

They're just tracking your data.

<i>No, it's not. No, it's not.</i>

Is Mr. Quagmire okay after the accident?

Yeah, he's fine. He's having one
of his private pool parties.

(WHISPERING)
Hey, girls. Thanks for coming.

Is your voice still broken
from the accident?

No, no, I... I'm just trying to be quiet.
Grab yourself a drink.

I'm gonna have some chips first.

No, no, no!

Is that a pool party I hear?

Cannonball!

<i>And that was the moment I remembered...</i>

<i>Quagmire doesn't have a swimming pool.</i>

(GROANING)

I want to be a mayor in real life.

So I'm here to ask you
to make me the mayor of your town.

Vote for me. Adam West.

It'll be a home run.

Ugh.

It'll be a home run.

-Pow!
-(CROWD CHEERING)
