(SINGING)<i> It seems today</i>
<i>that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies</i>
<i>and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

Come on, kids, people are
gonna start showing up

for the costume party
any minute.

Hey, nice Snoopy costume, Brian.

Thanks.

Oh, I guess it's not true what they say,

you can punch Snoopy in the
stomach as hard as you can

and he won't feel it. That's Houdini.

No, Brian. Now get up and do the dance.

Oh, no, I'm not gonna do the dance.

Do the dance!
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, Quagmire.
Ah, cool,

you dressed like
Napoleon Dynamite.

Hey, do you say
anything funny?

No, I just do quirky things
for the sake of being quirky.

You strike me as someone
I wouldn't enjoy,

but others might.

Who are you dressed as, Peter?

I'm Laura Bush.

And I'm the guy she killed.

That's right. I forgot.

Laura Bush killed a guy.

Yes, she did.

Laura Bush killed a guy.

Laura Bush killed a guy.

Well, come on in.

Oh, you know, this is why...

Brian, you remember,
the last couple of weeks

I kept saying, "Can I have a
couple minutes of your time

"to talk to you about something?"

This is what it was about.

This evening is ru-ined.

Look... wait, what?

This evening is ru-ined.

The whole evening
is ru-ined.

-Why are you saying it like that?
-Saying what?

I'm just pointing out
the party's ru-ined.

You know, I'm not gonna
get sucked into this.

Okay, just so I'm sure, really?

Are you just trying to piss me off

or is that really how you say that?

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about
this ru-ined evening.

-That's not how you say "ruined."
-What? Ru-ined?

What do you call the remains
of ancient Greek structures?

Ruins.

-And how would you describe this evening?
-Ru-ined, of course.

This evening is ru-ined.

-Say "ruined."
-Ru-ined.

-Ruined.
-Ru-ined.

-Ruined.
-Ru-ined.

-Dumbass.
-Oh, Brian, don't be crue-el.

That's a great costume, Joe.

Are you FDR?

No, I'm Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz.

Oh, you mean like if he dove
into the shallow end?

No.
Regular Mark Spitz.

Wait, are you Stephen
Hawking at the beach?

No, I'm Mark Spitz!

He won seven gold medals!

Oh, I get it.
You're crippled Magnum P.I.

I'm...!

Fine, I'm crippled Magnum P.I.

(GASPS) Brian, there's that girl
from my yoga class

I wanted you to meet.

Oh, look, Lois, I appreciate it,

but I'm not into fix-ups.

Oh, come on, you gotta get
yourself back out there.

Jane, this is Brian.

Oh, Brian!

Lois has told me so much about you.

Wow, you're even more
handsome than she said.

Hey, thanks.

So, uh, that's a great costume.

What are you, one of
Freddy Krueger's victims?

I'm a victim of the liberal agenda.

I'm a murdered fetus.

Did you know that Democrats

murder thousands of babies every year?

And sometimes babies are
put back into the womb

just so that they can be aborted again.

Have you ever had any sex
that was voluntary?

-No, I have not.
-Yup, have a good evening.

Come on, buddy. Let's go.

-(CHIRPS)
-Yeah, with a capital "C."

Oh, stop looking so depressed, Brian.

I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl

who loves abortion as much as you do.

That's not the point, Stewie.

I'm just tired of every
girl I meet being crazy.

Aw, things will work out for you.

Now come on, let's forget our problems

and get lost in the world of books.

Ooh, <i>Horton Hears Domestic Violence in</i>
<i>the Next Apartment</i><i>And Doesn't Call 911.</i>

MAN: (YELLING) You think it's
easy working all day?

-WOMAN: No! I... You think I like it?
-I don't think it's easy,

but, yes, I do think you like it.

Yeah, I like being away from you

'cause I can't stand looking at you!

-You... Aah!
-(LOUD THUD)

(CRYING) Yeah!

You think I want to do that?

You think I want to hurt you?

Not in front of the baby!

(SCREAMS) I don't want to hurt you!

I'm sure there's two sides to this.

-Whoops.
-I'm sorry.

I don't think you want this book.

It's all about atheism.

Oh, I know. I'm an atheist.

Really? So am I.

It's all yours.

I feel bad taking the last copy.

Well, there's one way to settle this.

If there is a god,
send another copy.

I guess that's our answer.

(CHUCKLING)

Tell you what. How about I take it

and then send it to you after I read it?

Swear to God?

(LAUGHS) Stop it.

I know, I'm just messin'...

well, uh, listen, uh,
here-here's my address.

Thanks.

See ya later.

God, still no mail for me, huh?

Jeez, Brian, you've been
going through the mail

every day for a week.
What are you looking for?

I'm expecting a very important package.

Another one? You haven't even opened

the one that came for you a week ago.

You idiot, why didn't you
tell me this was here?

Because I've been using it
as a hat weight.

-A what?
-A hat weight, Brian.

My hat kept blowing away,

so I put the package on it
so I wouldn't lose it.

That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

You don't wear a hat and
there's no wind in here.

You, sir, owe me
one new hat.

You know, uh, I was really glad
you sent me the book.

I won't lie to you, I came this close

to praying that I'd see you again.

Good thing you didn't because...

BOTH: Who would hear it, right?

(LAUGHING)

Can I interest you folks

in some of our heavenly cheesecake?

No, but I'll have some of our
"there's no afterlife" souffl√©.

-(CHUCKLING)
-(CHUCKLING)

Now we got the waiter involved, eh?

(LAUGHING) I love being a part of things.

I'll bring your dessert now.

You know, Carolyn,

I rarely find myself
connecting with another person

like I have with you.

I'm really enjoying your company.

Oh, me, too, Brian.

(MAN SINGING)
<i>The boat rides we would take</i>

<i>The moonlight on the lake</i>

<i>The way we danced</i>
<i>and hummed our favorite song</i>

<i>The things we did</i><i>last summer</i>

<i>I'll remember</i>

<i>All winter long</i>

<i>The midway and the fun</i>

<i>The Kewpie dolls we won</i>

<i>The bell I rang to prove</i><i>that I was strong</i>

<i>The things we did</i><i>last summer</i>

<i>I'll remember</i><i>all winter long...</i>

I had a really great time tonight, Brian.

Well, is there any reason it has to end?

STEWIE: (WHISPERING) Don't do it, Brian.

What the hell?

Excuse me for a second.

Stewie, have you been hiding
in the back all evening?

Yes, I'm saving you
from yourself, Brian.

You almost went in there

and tried to have sex with that girl.

So, what's wrong with that?

That's why you can't
maintain a relationship.

You always try too soon
and end up blowing it.

Think about it.

God, you know, maybe you're right.

I do. I always try and jump
into the sex right away.

Maybe that's what screws things up.

You know, I'm gonna
take it slow this time.

Listen, um, I-I gotta go.

Really?

Don't worry. You'll see me again.

Good job, Brian.

Don't worry. I'll help you through this.

(ENGINE STARTS)

So, you wanna get something to eat?

Can we go someplace

where the menus have pictures of the food?

Ooh, let's go someplace
where the menus have pictures of food!

Gosh, I really enjoyed the movie tonight.

Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be a touching comedy

because Robin Williams had a beard.

Ooh, my back is so stiff from
sitting in that theater chair.

I could probably use a back rub.

Do you mind?

Oh, not at all.

You know, I, uh, took a Thai massage class

at the Learning Annex.

STEWIE: Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

Boy, that's an awfully loud owl.

Hoo-hoo!

Don't do it, Brian!

Hoo-hoo!
Take it slow! Hoo-hoo!

Uh, of course, I'll tell you
what'd really set you right

is a couple of Aleve
and a good night's sleep.

Oh.

Well, all right, if you say so.

Well, I guess I should say good night.

Ho-hoo-hoo! Good job, Brian!

Hoo-hoo!

-Hi there.
-Not interested.

Okay.

Ooh, tandem bike.

You gonna take a ride out in the country

and let the AIDS blow through your hair?

Get lost, Stewie.

I am getting laid tonight.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
happened to taking it slow?

I have been taking it slow.

We've been going out for three weeks

and I haven't tried anything,

even though she's been giving me

some pretty strong signals.

So, do you have any thoughts

on what you might want to do tonight?

Oh, I don't know.

Eww, I don't know, Brian.

You don't want to mess things up.

Well, we'll find out tonight, won't we?

All right, but just one
last piece of advice.

Remember, listen to her body,

and respond the way you'd
want her to respond to you.

Uh, okay. Thanks.

That's very helpful.

You'll be a wonderful lover, Brian.

What are you doing?

Oh, sorry, you-you just had
a little, uh, something.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, my God!

Carolyn?

-Cleveland?
-Oh, hey, Brian.

Close that window.

You're letting all the stank out.

I don't believe this.

Cleveland, you're sleeping
with my girlfriend?

Nobody told me
Carolyn was your girlfriend.

I'm not his girlfriend.

Carolyn, what are you talking about?

We've been dating for three weeks.

Well, you never made a move on me,

so I thought you just
wanted to be friends.

Then I met Cleveland, and
things just kinda took off.

Wha...? H-how did you even
meet each other?

We met at the Starbucks.

She started going on
about her new Brazilian wax

and not wearing
any underpants and whatnot.

I'd have to be a homosexual
to ignore a signal like that.

But, Carolyn, you
completely misunderstood me.

I-I wanted you like crazy,

but I just figured if I
showed a little restraint,

you'd respect me.

-I do.
-As do I.

Now why don't you go hop
on that gay bike of yours

and go get yourself a lollipop
or a cupcake or something.

(LAUGHING)

We good, Brian. We good.

So, Carolyn.

(CLICKS TONGUE)
Guess you should've hit that

when you had the chance, huh, Brian?

What? You're the one who told me to wait!

Oh, you're crazy, bitch.
I didn't say that, bitch.

Yeah, well, thanks to you,
I lost her to Cleveland.

You know what you need?
You need to stop

pointing fingers and get out of the house.

Have some fun. Real fun.

Not like 37-year-old-woman-
on-a-blind-date fun.

(LAUGHING)
This is fun, right? We're having fun.

I mean, so what if you forgot your wallet?

I'll pay. I'm gonna pay for us.

You'll get it next time! Yeah!

So, you were in prison, right?

Killed a man?

Aw, I'm sure it was
in self-defense.

No. I just felt like killing.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, you tell the best stories!

Me and my three eggs
are having the best time!

We are gonna get you
back on your feet, Brian.

I know what always makes <i>me </i>feel better:

delicious sweets.

Halloo! Welcome to Fjurg's Backery.

Would you like a hot pis of pee?

It's on the hoose!

What?

Oh, noo! You're covered in my hot pee!

You can wash yourself off
in the waiter clooset.

(SENSUAL MOANING, KISSING)

Uh, you know, I can just
wash it off when I get home.

Why? What's in there?

-CLEVELAND: Oh. Mmm. Oh, yeah.
-Mmm. Mmm.

-Mmm. Mmm. Oh.
-Mmm. Mmm.

-CLEVELAND: Wait.
-Mmm.

Wait. Wait.

(CLEVELAND EXCLAIMS)

And boom goes the dynamite.

Okay, look, next time
we'll go to another store.

How about that?

Just forget it, all right?

I just want to sit here, watch the
ball game, and have a few beers.

ANNOUNCER 1:<i> It's ball three,</i>
<i>low and outside to Ramirez.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Wait a minute. What's this?</i>

<i>There appears to be</i><i>an interracial couple</i>

<i>making love on second base.</i>

ANNOUNCER 1: <i>The crowd's enjoying it,</i>

<i>and it looks like the umpire's</i>
<i>gonna let 'em finish.</i>

CLEVELAND: (EXCLAIMS)
<i>And boom goes the dynamite.</i>

ANNOUNCER: There it is!

ANNOUNCER 2: I'll tell you what.

<i>This would be painful to watch</i>
<i>if you loved that girl.</i>

Boy, what are the odds

of running into Cleveland and Carolyn
everywhere we went, huh?

Well, as long as we just stay here

in the house, we're safe, right?

Oh, that was a great game!

Carolyn, it's been so nice
getting to know you.

Yeah, Cleveland, she's way more fun

than that wife you used to have.

Wh-What was her name?

Weezy or Florida or something?

Jennifer Hudson?

Loretta.

You know, it's amazing, Cleveland.

You went from a black woman
to a white woman

without having to take that
Hispanic woman step in between.

(LAUGHTER)

Loretta! That's our answer!

-What do you mean?
-We've just got to go talk to Loretta.

If we can get her
back with Cleveland,

-Carolyn's all yours.
-Well, it's a long shot,

but so was the "Shouting
Arab-Gram" business.

(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

From Joan and Keith.

You know what? This is
never gonna work, Stewie.

Loretta cheated on Cleveland.

She's not gonna want to go back to him.

Oh, she can be convinced, Brian.
Just let me do the talking.

No, I think I can communicate
with her better.

She's only gonna get the gist
of what you're saying.

Really? Isn't she one of those people

outside the family
who can understand me?

No, I think because of Cleveland,
she's close enough to the main cast

-that it might be a little weird.
-Really?

-MAN: We're filming!
-Okay, okay.

Sorry, sorry.
Ring the doorbell.

(RINGS DOORBELL)

Uh... hi, Loretta.

Brian! Stubbie!

What are you doing here?

Uh, well, to be honest, Loretta,

uh, Cleveland sent us.

-He... really wants you back.
-What?

Yeah, he says he misses that...

(STRAINING) Uh, perfect... figure.

Well, I get the gist
of what you're saying, Stoolie,

but I can never go back to Cleveland,

not after all the pain I caused him.

I'm sorry.

Hey, Brian, did you see that
treadmill in the living room?

(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Brian, may I speak with you?

Oh. Cleveland.

I didn't recognize you
without my girlfriend

wrapped around your waist.

She and I are both
to a point of great soreness,

so we took a break.

Listen, I just want to clear
any bad feelings you may have

about me and Carolyn.

(SIGHS)

I guess it's okay.

These are... passing flings,
nothing to get upset about.

Good. Because we're gonna elope
in Hawaii tomorrow night!

-What?
-You got a problem with that,

you can go (BLEEP) yourself.

Loretta?

Hello, Cleveland.

What are <i>you </i>doing here?

Cleveland, I've been doing
some thinking lately

about how much I miss you.

I'm sorry for hurting you.

I want us to be together
again as a family,

and I promise I'll never betray you again.

I love you, Cleveland.

Uh... I'm no meteorologist,

but I'm pretty sure it's rainin' bitches.

I-I don't know what to do.

Carolyn and I are supposed
to elope tomorrow,

but here comes Loretta all apologetic

and wanting to get our family
back together and whatnot.

I wouldn't forgive her so fast, Cleveland.

Remember, she slept with Quagmire.

Yeah, she really acted crazy.

Well, now, just-just
wait a minute, you guys.

Let's not be so quick
to demonize Loretta.

I mean, whatever happened
to "forgive and forget"?

Oh, you just want Cleveland
out of the picture

so you can get back with Carolyn.

You know, Brian, sometimes...

I don't believe I know you.

Th-That's not it at all.

I-I happen to think
Loretta is very beautiful.

With her... sassy wisdom,

and... speed-bag arm fat.

Hmm. I guess at
the very least,

I could go talk to her
tomorrow and see how I feel.

Thanks for your help, Griffins.

Brian, do you really think
Loretta is beautiful?

Absolutely. That's really how I feel.

Now, it is true
her personality is abrasive.

Slightly abrasive.

But overall, Loretta
is a delightful person,

very pleasant to be around,

and free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

I'm really concerned
about Cleveland.

What Loretta did was unforgivable.

I hope he doesn't go back to her.

I hear you, Lois.

You know, there might be a way

to drive the point home
that she hasn't changed.

-How would we do that?
-Hang on.

Hey, Quagmire!

-Quagmire!
-What?

-You busy right now?
-No, I got a hand free. What's up?

Would you mind getting Loretta
to sleep with you again?

Uh, I... Possibly.

I mean, in what context?

Well, we're trying to make
Cleveland see that she's no good

and that he can't trust her,

and if he catches you guys
in the act, then...

Oh, okay, oh, no, no, okay,
no, I'm-I'm with you now.

Yeah, no, yeah, you know,
I can probably work that in.

Terrific. Thank you!

This is perfect, Lois.

We'll expose Loretta
for who she is.

Just like Cyrano was exposed
for being anti-Semitic.

I love you for all that you are...

(INAUDIBLE WHISPERING)

...in spite of the fact
that your people control

a disproportionate amount
of the world's wealth...

(INAUDIBLE WHISPERING)

...and in all likelihood
are probably responsible

for starting every major war
since the dawn of t...

Dude, again with this?
What's your problem?

Who's in the bush?

CYRANO: Mind your own business,
you stupid Jew!

Room service.

I didn't order no room service.

It's complimentary.

We have a club sandwich,
a fruit plate and a side of...

Hot beefsteak!
Giggedy-giggedy-goo!

(GASPS) Glenn Quagmire!
You get out of here!

Come on, baby.
Time for round two!

(LORETTA YELLING)

You're the devil!

You ruined my marriage!

Oh, you can't resist the Q-man

and my super-powered genitalia.

Apache Penis, Ee-nay-chok!

(LOW WHIRRING)

Aah! You go on and beat it, little neck!

I'm a changed woman!

I don't mess with your kind anymore!

You're a meanie!

(SOBBING)

Hey, Quagmire.

Uh... hey, Cleveland.

Why are you staying in a hotel?

Uh... my...

house burned down.

Oh. Why are you naked?

Naked? Wha... But
everybody's been telling me

I'm wearing magnificent robes
made from the finest silk. Oh!

(GASPS) Cleveland!

Hello, Loretta.

Oh, come in, baby.

Have you thought
about what I said?

Yes, I have, and I still
love you, Loretta.

Oh, Cleveland!

But... I-I can't take you back.

Wh-Why not?

Loretta, I came over here
wanting to believe

that there was still
a chance for us.

But on the way, I passed a lake,

skipped a few rocks and had
some black-guy thinking time...

L-Loretta, we leave
certain parts of our lives

in the past for a reason.

What you and I...

You can go ahead and put
your clothes back on...

What you and I had was a wonderful thing,

and as much as I still have
a great deal of love for you,

our time is over.

I love somebody else.

Oh, Cleveland, isn't
there anything I can do

to make you happy?

Yes, there is.

You can live
your life, Loretta.

Live it as full
and as wonderful as you can.

I love you.

(GASPS) Oh, my God! Carolyn?

Quagmire?

Cleveland, close the window!

You're letting the stank out!

Well, we both got screwed
by the same girl.

Yup.

I guess it's all right, though.

You and I will find true love someday.

(SIGHS) Yeah, I suppose.

So, how was it having sex with Carolyn?

I think I'm gonna remember it forever.

Oh, yeah? How so?

Brian, do you think you could
identify a genital wart?

I... I-I-I...
I would think

that would be something you'd
check with your doctor about.

-Okay.
-Okay?

-Yeah.
-All right, 'cause I'm not a doctor.

-I can't...
-No, I understand.

-Okay, so we're... we're still friends?
-Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Well, summer's coming on.

It hurts.

Boy, am I going to enjoy this meal.

Not like last night when
I didn't have time to poop

before the guests arrived.

Do I have time? You know what?
I'm going to go for it.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Son of a bitch!

Looks like I'm gonna have
to pile dinner on top of that.

Hey, guys! How are you?

Look at this place.

They don't serve any
of this 1950s food anymore...

Hamburgers, French fries, Cokes...

(CHUCKLES) You kids
don't know what I'm talking about.

I love how all the servers look
like celebrities from the '50s.

Marilyn Monroe...

Elvis...

And look, there's James Dean
after the accident.

Let me tell you about
tonight's specials.

-(DOOR OPENS)
-Oh, look, Cleveland finally made it.

Oh, hey there, Griffins.

(BARKING)

Oh, that takes me back.

Hey, what are you, a robot?

Oh, no, son.

It's the 1950s, and I have polio.

Wow, I never heard of that before.

Oh, yeah, Chris, polio back then
was like AIDS today,

except people who have polio
get into heaven.

(SINGING)
<i>A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird</i>

Oh, my God,
this is <i>"Surfin' Bird" </i>by the Trashmen.

This is my favorite song of all time!

Again! Again! I love repetition!

-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(RECORD SCRATCHES)

Hey, what's the big idea?

This song's from the 1960s.
It shouldn't be in this jukebox.

Wait, can I have that record?

I'll let you have sex with my daughter.

I don't know.

Let's see
what your daughter looks like.

She's, uh...

Right there.

Okay, I'll do her.

But can you tell her to cry
and beg me to stop?

I think that can be arranged.

You've been playing it
ever since we got home.

No way, Lois, it's my new
favorite thing in the world.

-(GROANS)

Lois, I'm going to ask
you this only once.

Do you or do you not

Peter, I have a mammogram in the morning.

Brian, can I see that paper for a sec?

Huh, that's odd.

I thought that would be big news.

You thought what
would be big news?

Well, there seems to be an absence
of a certain ornithological piece.

A headline regarding
mass awareness

of a certain avian variety.

What are you talking about?

Oh, have you not heard?

It was my understanding
that everyone had heard.

-Heard what?
-Brian, don't!

Peter, I was just at the bank

and they told me you withdrew
$6,000 cash from our savings.

That's almost everything we have.

What the hell was it for?

I bought some local TV airtime, Lois,

and I did a public service
announcement of vital importance.

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.</i>

<i>You know, there's an issue</i>
<i>facing many Americans today</i>

<i>that I know concerns</i>
<i>a great number of us.</i>

According to Gallup polls,

one in 12 Americans is unaware
that the bird is the word.

I, for one, dream of an America

where everybody knows
that the bird is the word.

(SINGING)
<i>A-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word</i>

<i>A-well-a bird, bird, bird</i>
<i>Well, the bird is the word</i>

My God, is it possible?

Have the boys in the lab confirm this.

Sir, our math shows

that the bird is equal to
or greater than the word.

Check it again!

<i>("BIRD SURFIN'"</i> PLAYING)

-Brian?
-Yeah?

I don't feel so good.

All right, that's it.
We gotta do something about this.

We have got to get that
record and destroy it.

Just like that fat person surgery
destroyed Star Jones's arms.

I look so good! I lost all this weight.

Taxi!

Coming to show the people
how good I look!

Don't you know about the bird?

(LOUDER) Everybody knows
that the bird is the word.

(PETER SCREAMS)

(GROWLS) Who did it?

-Who did what, Pop?
-Yes, Peter, what has you upset?

<i>"Surfin' Bird"</i> is gone.

I took it to bed, had sex with it,

it fell asleep in my arms
and this morning it's gone.

Well, Peter, nobody here
would steal from you.

Oh, no one had a motive, Lois?

You all had a motive.
Every one of you!

You knew that I changed my will
and left everything to the record.

And that's why you wanted
the record out of the way.

Meg wanted to get a passport
for her twin sister

to get her out of the country,
but the record wouldn't allow it.

But Meg didn't count on me
discovering she has no twin sister.

And that Meg herself was recently
released from the sanitarium.

And that's where Chris
came into the picture.

So, you got it all figured out, do ya?

You couldn't leave well enough alone.

You won't fire at me, Chris,
you don't got the stomach for it.

(CACKLES) I'm sorry, Dad.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Well, it sure is odd.

A record doesn't just get up
and walk away.

Except for my old
Allen Sherman record.

If you ain't gonna play me,
don't complain when I try to split.

There's a lot of Jews out there
still get a laugh off of

<i>"Hello Muddah, hello Faddah."</i>

Ooh, such heat this morning.
I don't need this jacket.

Well, the hell with all of you!

I'm going downtown
and buy another copy

of <i>"Surfin' Bird."</i>

Peter, that's not necessary.
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

I wouldn't count on it, Lois.

No.

No.

Okay, so what are you doing here?

Well, believe it or not,
I pop in every hundred years or so,

kind of incognito,
just to get away from the family.

Plus the timing seemed good,

'cause my dad just quit smoking
and he's a little on edge.

Ellen?

Why is there a pen cap and no pen?

You're the first person

Hey, why don't you come over
to my house for dinner tonight?

Ah-ha-ha! He's doing that thing
he did in the storybook.

So, Jesus, finish that
story you were telling us.

Oh. All right, all right.

So there I was,
they'd just beaten me senseless,

stuck thorns in my head,
nailed me to a piece of wood,

shoved a sponge full of vinegar
in my mouth and killed me.

Then they put me in a hole
with a rock in front of it

for two whole days,
and come Sunday, bam,

I rise from the dead.

Okay, that sounds like a nutty weekend,
but I can top it.

So, me and Cleveland and Joe are just
wrecked on Southern Comfort, right?

We know we're gonna puke, but Joe says,

"Hey, let's go see <i>Chronicles of Riddick."</i>

Sat through the whole thing
without puking,

then I get home...
Wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.

Huh? Peter one, Jesus zero.

You know, Jesus,
if I go get my cell phone,

would you mind talking to
my friend Muriel Goldman?

I really just want to rub
her Jewish nose in this.

All right, I'll be the one to say it.

How do we know you're really Jesus?

Can you perform miracles?

Sure. How about this?

Oh, boy! Sundaes!

I love you, Jesus!

to keep a low profile,

but there's one person
I really want you to meet.

Oh, Yeah? Who's that?

The American people
may have turned against the war,

but I answer to a higher power.

I answer to the power of Jesus Christ.

Oh, well, uh, that's funny,

because I happen to have
Jesus Christ right here.

I... I heard what you were saying.

You know nothing of my work.

How you ever got to be president
of anything is totally amazing.

Boy, wouldn't it be great
if life were like this?

Hey, listen, Jesus, thanks
for coming by tonight

and hanging out with us.

You may look like a bum,

but you got a lot of talent, young man.

Yeah, I'd forgotten how great it is
interacting with other people.

Well, I better get some sleep.
I got to open the store tomorrow.

Aw, you don't want to go
back to that record store.

You got to get back out there,
coloring eggs and hiding 'em for kids.

What, you mean... Reveal myself?

Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus.

It needs you like a guy who
can't get it up needs a distraction.

I am so ready to have sex with you.

Oh, hey, is that my phone?

I don't hear anything.

Is that John Astin?

I don't see anyone out there.

Oh. Well, now there's so much going on.

You know, you're right, Peter...
it may be time.

But how do we do it?

Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

I would like to introduce you
to the one, the only...

Jesus Christ.

That's right.
That's Jesus Christ right here.

he became famous,
and when I did it,

I got suspended for five days?

You know, I owe this all to you, Peter.

You gave me the confidence I needed.

Aw, never mind about that, pal.

And you're, like, "Why didn't
you warn me that's so cold?"

And he's, like, "It's ice cream, dude."

And you're, like, "Oh, man!"

But chicks don't do that,

I only hung around with one whore.

JESUS: Come on, guys,
let's head over to my crib.

Hey, you guys mind
scooting over a little bit?

Ooh, sorry, Peter,
doesn't look like there's any room.

Wha... What do you mean?

Well, there's only one space left,
and I promised it to that cow.

(LISPING) This is gonna be so much fun!

I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof

and wave my arms and go,
"Whoo! I'm in Hollywood!"

Whoo! I'm in Hollywood!
See? I said I'd do it!

Peter, would you put that thing away.
We're trying to eat dinner.

I can't believe Jesus
hasn't called me back.

I left him a message,
like, four hours ago.

Well, maybe he doesn't
have his phone with him.

No, no, it rang twice,
and then the voice mail picked up.

If it had gone straight to voice mail,

that means the phone was off.

If it rang, like, six times,
that means he didn't hear it.

But it rang twice, Lois...
That means the phone rang,

he saw it was me,
and then he pressed a button

and sent it straight to voice mail.

You know what? Give me your phone.
I bet he'll pick up.

Hey, hey, Lois!

Hey, you, it's Peter. What the hell?

We were supposed to do something today.

Uh, I forgot to tell you,

I have a doctor's appointment today.

I'm actually there now.

I got to go.

Can you believe the way
Jesus is treating me?

I thought he was my friend.

Look, fame and success do
crazy things to people, Peter.

I'm sure, deep down,
he's still the same old Jesus.

He may just need to figure
that out in his own way.

Maybe. But one thing's for sure, Lois...

You want the truth?

I think it's time for me to go.

This world's not ready for me yet,

and I'm not ready for it.

I don't know,
maybe I'll try coming back

in another thousand years,
when I'm a little more mature.

Well, that's a very mature
thing to say right there.

I think you're on your way.

Well, before I go, Peter,
there's something I want to give you.

Hold out your hands.

(HIGH-PITCHED ZAPPING)

Well, I guess that's it, then.
Jesus is gone.

I sure am gonna miss him.

Me, too. Although he did give me something

right before he disappeared.

-What?
-Something very special, Lois.

What is it, Dad?

-What, you haven't heard?
-Crap!

MAN ON TV:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Scarlett Johansson,</i>

<i>and for some reason, Steve Buscemi.</i>

Man, look at that Steve Buscemi.

Every one of his teeth is
in business for itself.

You know, Steve, the art director's job
is never an easy one.

That's right, Scarlett, but this year...

-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm going to the Elton John party.

What the hell? I told you
we were staying for the Governors Ball.

And I told you, Tim, we would
see how the evening plays out.

Peter, may I use your restroom?

I took a laxative and a stool hardener,
and they're fighting it out in there.

Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort.

Oh, boy, I hope there's a scale in there.

I'd like to have a "before"
and "after" on this one.

-I'll be out in a minute.
-I really need to go.

She said she'll be out in a minute!

I hope there's another bathroom in here.
Oh, God.

Oh, thank God, a Porta-Potty.

(SCREAMING)

Dad, Mr. Goldman never drank his Ensure.

Can I have it,
even though it's dinnertime?

Sure, Chris. "Drink Ensure as a meal,
or in-between meals.

"Or when you're on the go!"

-Is Mort still in the bathroom?
-I'll go see if he's all right.

Mort? Hello? Mort?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing in my room?

Don't touch my stuff with
your dirty walking-on-the-street paws.

I'm looking for Mort.

He came up here an hour ago
and never came back down.

Uh-oh.

-What?
-My time machine has been activated.

Time machine?
I didn't know you had a time machine.

Yeah, I built it after I got bored
with that European See 'n Say.

ELECTRONIC VOICE:<i> The pig goes, "Wenk."</i>

<i>The cow goes, "Sha-zooo."</i>

It most certainly does not.

<i>The rooster goes, "Gickery-gee."</i>

Where? Where does the rooster say that?

<i>The monkey goes, "Ma-cock."</i>

No, no, no, no, it does not.

<i>The elephant goes, "Fwaamp."</i>

Yeah, kind of.

Stewie, do you think Mort might have
accidentally stumbled

into the time machine?

Well, I suppose it's possible.
Let's ask Rick Moranis

and the backup singers
from <i>Little Shop of Horrors.</i>

(SINGING) <i>Da-doo</i>

I saw a red-headed guy come up here
about an hour ago.

<i>Mort the Jew</i>

He seemed to be in a rush
and had a pained look on his face.

<i>Had to poo</i>

<i>Sha-doop-a-doop-a-doo</i>

And he stepped into that box there and
suddenly there was a big flash of light.

<i>That's when he went back in time</i>

Oh, my God, Stewie,
we have to get him back.

-When did the machine send him?
-I don't know.

How can you not know?
It's a time machine.

Doesn't it have, like, a display
that tells you the year or something?

Oh, I'm sorry, Brian, is my time machine
not as good as your time machine?

Oh, yeah. Oh, no, you've probably got
a way better time machine. Yeah.

Stupid dog.

Well, then, can't you just press
a couple buttons and bring him back?

No, he can't just come back.
He needs the return pad.

Well, we can't just leave Mort
back in time.

That'd be more irresponsible
than silent movie porn.

(INAUDIBLE)

All right, we'll go get him.

But remember, Brian, don't touch
anything when we're in the past.

Even stepping on a mosquito
could create a chain reaction

-that drastically alters the present.
-Really?

No, you can do whatever you want.
Come on.

Okay, if everything worked properly,

this should be the exact time
and place that Mort was sent to.

Now, we've just gotta figure out
where we are.

Or when we are.

That's such a douche time-traveler thing
to say.

Sha-zooo.

Okay, we're somewhere in Europe.
Aha! Look, Brian.

This trail of used tissues should lead us
right to Mort.

Or to Quagmire.

(LAUGHING)

He's gross.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

Warsaw.
Well, at least we know where we are.

And so we had him crucified.
But that doesn't leave this room.

Anyway, the point is,

may Chaim and Sarah have
many wonderful years together. Amen.

Excuse me?
We're looking for a Mr. Goldman.

Mr. Mort Goldman?

He's a small business owner.
Tends to whine a lot.

Kind of a hypochondriac.

Oh, no, you can't put your hand back up
after you've put it down.

You know what, never mind.

Stewie, look at this. September 1, 1939.

There's something about that date.

I now pronounce you man and wife.
<i>Mazel tov.</i> Now, step on the glass.

Oh. But be careful, though.
At my wedding, I cut myself on the glass.

And when I got to Palm Beach
for the honeymoon,

I had to put a Wonder Bread bag
on my foot to keep the sand out.

ALL: <i>Mazel tov!</i>

Oh, Mort. Thank God.

Brian and Stewie? You're in Heaven, too?

Mort, this isn't Heaven.
You've time-traveled into the past.

What? How is that possible?

Just... Just trust me.
We're here to bring you back home.

But it's gotta be Heaven, Brian.

Look, there's my frugal Aunt Ruth,
my thrifty Uncle Isaac,

my bargain-hunting Aunt Flo,
and my Great Aunt Vera,

who didn't like to spend
a lot on anything.

Come on, Mort, we gotta get out of here.

But Brian,
when am I gonna have another chance

to see my Grandpa Chaim's wedding
with my own eyes?

Yes, you know, he's right, Brian.

Besides, I've never been
to a Hebrew wedding.

Well, I guess we could
stay a little longer.

Oh, wonderful!

I want to be hoisted up on the chair
and see what it feels like to be top Jew.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(PLANE ENGINES WHIRRING)

(LOUD EXPLOSION)

Uh-oh.

(GUNS FIRING)

I knew there was something
about this date.

September 1, 1939.
This is the German invasion of Poland.

It's also the exact day and year
that Rene Russo was born.

Stewie, we gotta get out of here fast.

Quick, set up the return pad
and let's get back to our own time.

Right.

-What's wrong? Why are we still here?
-I don't know.

Stewie, it's not working.

Yeah, and you know
what's not gonna fix it?

Your shouting.

Oh, God,
should we ask somebody for help?

Yeah, right, how many Polacks does it take
to fix a time machine? Let's find out.

Well, we can't stay here.
We'll have to get Mort to England.

It's the only place
he'll be safe from the Nazis.

Oh, they're awful, those Nazis.

If they catch me,
they'll beat me unmerciful

and rub dirt in my assneck
and all over my assy nipples.

What?

<i>Juden! Rubben wir Schmutzen</i>
<i>auf deine Arschneck.</i>

All right, there's the checkpoint.

If we can get past it,
we're out of occupied Poland.

Right. Mort, you all set?

Oh, God, I hope this works.

Hello. We'd like to leave Poland now,

and we'll be bringing our friend
who is absolutely, 100% not Jewish.

Hey, how about that Jesus, huh?
What a guy.

Father, we're so glad you're here.

We need you to conduct last rites
for our friend over there.

(STAMMERING) Well, I suppose.

Dear God,

non-Jewish God, be a <i>mensch.</i>

(BRIAN AND STEWIE CLEARING THROAT)

I mean, a good guy,
'cause it says in the Old Book...

Not so old, though.
You know, still good. Still good.

Still some things, good things to say...

(BRIAN AND STEWIE COUGHING)

We, we pray in the name of you

who died in a freak accident
that you can't really blame on anyone.

(CLEARING THROAT)

Take this man up
to your retail-paying place.

Are you sure you're a real priest?

Yeah, yeah, I can vouch for him.
He's real.

He's molested me many, many times.

Sorry I'm late. I was busy doing
innocent, non-molesty things.

Wait a minute. Two priests?
That is impossible.

This collar comes right off.

He's a filthy Jew!

Oh, boy. You, you are...
You should be glad

your human resources person
was not around to hear that.

Run!

Hey, buddy, I need to borrow this.

Oh. Nazis. That's refreshing.

All right, on three,
we'll make for the closest U-boat.

<i>und baby und Art Garfunkel!</i>

Everybody hang on.

We're being pursued by two objects.
Looks like one's another U-boat.

(RADAR BEEPING)

The other appears
to be Terence Trent D'Arby.

(BEEPING MELODICALLY)

Fire!

Uh-oh.

-What?
-Hold on to something.

(RUMBLING)

Brian, I've got an idea.
It's a long shot, but it just might work.

-See that newspaper?
-Yeah.

Stuff it in the waste tube.

(SCREAMING)

(SIRENS WAILING)

Oh, my God! It's England!

We've reached England! We're saved!

Ah, London in wartime.
This is history right here, Brian.

And look, there's Winston Churchill!

Maybe we'll get an up-close look
at his legendary wit.

Oh, Winston, drunk again, I see.

Yeah, well, you're a fat bitch.

(LAUGHING) Wickedly funny.

Hmm. I guess history has just
whittled it down to the gems.

-Why isn't the time machine working?
-I'm working on it, Mort, all right?

-Oh. Here's the problem.
-What? What is it?

The transfer circuits are powered
by uranium, and this thing is tapped out.

Wait a minute. Are you saying
we need to find some uranium?

I'm afraid so.

But where do we find uranium
in World War II Europe?

There's only one place.

At the top-secret atomic
research facility in Berlin.

Wait a minute. Germany's building
weapons of mass destruction?

Well, why doesn't America go in there
and kick their asses?

I don't know.
Maybe because they don't have any oil.

Oh.

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

I don't know! I don't want to do this!

Mort, Berlin is the closest place
we're gonna find uranium in this time.

It's the only way to get home.

Men, as officers of the Royal Air Force,
you're the very best in the world.

However, this mission
to Germany will not be an easy one.

Four-and-a-half
of every five of you will not return.

Half of Jensen there can tell you,
it gets pretty sticky.

But I never lost me good spirits,
I haven't!

So, let's get up there, be safe

and get back to the big, fat pigs of wives
we have waiting at home.

-Pardon me, sir. I'd like to join.
-What are your qualifications?

I have a British accent,
I'm possibly homosexual,

I never brush my teeth
and my wife is ghastly.

Bombs away!

-Talk to me, Goose.
-Please don't call me that.

You're my eyes, Goose.
Keep an eye out for those Krauts.

Uh-oh! Germans dead ahead!

Quick, get the parachutes!

There are no parachutes!
All I could find was this!

A raft? We're not sinking. We're crashing!

(SCREAMING)

BRIAN: There it is, Berlin.

So, this is Berlin, huh?
Doesn't seem so bad.

Dear God, this place is nightmarish.

Look at the offensive way
they draw Jewish people.

-Hitler!

How's it going, Mr. Hitler?

It's a dog-eat-dog Reich,

So, how's the atomic bomb coming?

It's coming, it's coming.
There are some problems.

We're having much better luck

developing this impressive collection
of 100 <i>Luftballons.</i>

Oh, damn.

Well, I guess we'll just
let you get back to work.

Oh, I almost forgot.

I don't suppose you boys
have some uranium I could borrow?

Oh, of course. Give him some uranium,
Mean Joe Greene.

Hey, kid, catch.

Thanks, Mean Joe!
He's not really mean at all.

No, he's a nice guy.

Okay, the time machine is refueled.

Let's find a safe spot
and make the trip back home.

(SPUTTERS)

Arrest him! Arrest all three!

These filths are making a mockery
of our Reich.

Execute them.

-Unless what?

Unless they can sing

(SINGING) <i>Wherever...</i>

Damn it, will you two
just get in the (BLEEP) time machine?

We did it! We're home! Everything's fine!

-Well, not quite.
-What do you mean?

Aren't you a little nervous
that Mort knows all about this stuff?

Oh, I'm one step ahead of you, Brian.

You see, we've arrived 30 seconds
before Mort came up to use the bathroom.

Only this time, things are gonna
play out a bit differently.

Can I poop in here?

-No!
-No!

Too late.

That's not what it's about, Chris.
It's about the quest.

Well, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm

-Well, today, in gym class,

I noticed one of my testicles
went up inside my body

and it hasn't come back out yet,
and I'm a little scared.

Sir, this employee just made
a sexual remark to me.

No, Dad, I'm really worried.
See? Look. Is that normal?

Sir, sir!
Your employee is exposing himself to me!

-But, Dad...
-You got a lawsuit on your hands, mister.

Whoa, whoa! Okay, look, look.

If you'd be willing to forget
this whole thing happened,

-I'll give you this gas card.
-Unlimited free gas for a year?

Just 'cause I threatened to sue you?

Well, that,
and you're not the worst-looking guy

-who's ever come in here.
-That's what I wanted to hear.

Wow, Peter, a free gas card.
This could save us a lot of money.

Or... I don't know, man,

but you're lucky you're not doing that
over here in the ocean.

-Or else... Or I would stop you.
-For God sakes, help! Do something!

If you don't like starfish,

you're gonna be mad

Oh! God, help!

You're in for it now, buddy!

-Help! He's hurting me!

Well, maybe you shouldn't
have led him on.

-Peter, what the hell is that?
-It's a space shuttle, Lois.

I figured, with unlimited free gas,
I can finally afford to go into space.

Why is it every time I open this door,

you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle
you've inexplicably acquired?

I got this at a NASA auction
for next to nothing.

They were gonna scrap it

'cause of some minor
mechanical problems or something.

Instead, they sold it to me.
Very simple explanation.

I do not want you
trying to fly that thing.

You're not even a trained astronaut.

Relax, Lois. Nothing bad ever happens
to space shuttles. Now stand back.

-Mind-boggling, Chris.

watching the sun rise
over the Sea of Japan.

It's indescribable.

Plus, I had lots of time to rub one out,
which, in space, is great,

except after a while
it's like living in a snow globe.

Peter, instead of wasting your free gas
on a series of comedic stunts,

why don't you use it more constructively?
I mean, we could take a family vacation.

Yeah, that's a great idea, Mom.

Hey, maybe we can go
to the island from <i>Lost.</i>

No, I don't want to listen
to Matthew Fox's heavy breathing.

you can bring the stupid birds.

(CHEERING)

You're letting me be myself!
All right, everybody, let's go!

All right, everybody, off we go.
We are gonna have such a great time.

Hey, Quagmire.
Just taking the family on vacation.

<i>That's good. Hang on a second.</i>

<i>I'm stuck behind some fatass</i>
<i>driving too slow.</i>

<i>Come on, stupid, move it!</i>

(CAR HORN HONKING)

Hang on, Quagmire.
Some jerk behind me is honking his horn.

QUAGMIRE:<i> You should totally flip him off.</i>

<i>Hang on a sec,</i>
<i>some fatass just flipped me off.</i>

<i>Hey, up yours, you jerk!</i>

PETER: Hang on, Quagmire,
I gotta kick this guy's ass.

QUAGMIRE:<i> Yeah, I gotta</i>

PETER: Hey, I'll call you back
after the fight.

QUAGMIRE:<i> Yeah, me, too.</i>

-PETER: Good luck in yours.
<i>-Good luck in yours.</i>

Lois? I'm awake, Lois.

Lois!

Lois? Where the devil is everyone?

This place is more deserted
than James Gandolfini's workout room.

Just waiting for my breakfast...

Lois!

I know how to get her attention.

Lois, I'm about to drink my first soda!
Better come stop me!

That must be the sugar.
Oh, God, that's good!

Rupert, suddenly I want to run! Chase me!

(GIGGLING)

(CONTINUES GIGGLING)

Now I'm sad.

Brian, do me a favor and check on Stewie,
would you?

He's fine.

Hey, what do you say
we sing a driving song?

Okay, that was good. That was good.

Chris, I think you were a little early
at the start of bar four.

I don't know,
how'd that sound from your end?

<i>Sounded great out here,</i>
<i>you want another?</i>

-No, if that works for you, we're fine.
<i>-All good on my end.</i>

All right, that's a take.

There's no sign of them anywhere.
Meg? Chris? Brian?

They're gone. I'm all alone.

I can do whatever I want!

(CHUCKLES) I'm going to take Brian's novel

and replace every use of the word "and"
with the word "fart."

"The young soldier fart his brother
looked at each other, fart both knew that,

"with love fart truth fart courage,

"they would both emerge
st-fart-ing on their feet."

(GROANS) That one didn't work.

Well, let's see
what fascinating pubescent treasures

Chris has got hidden away.

Ooh!

<i>Hustler</i> magazine. I finally get to see
what a vagina looks...

God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

You can't hurt anyone anymore.

Why are we in New York?

I thought we were going
to the Grand Canyon.

Well, I just thought we should stop
and pay our respects.

Ground Zero.
So this is where the first guy got AIDS.

Peter, this is the site
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

-So Saddam Hussein did this?
-No.

-The Iraqi army?
-No.

-Some guys from Iraq?
-No.

That one lady
who visited Iraq that one time?

No. Peter,
Iraq had nothing to do with this.

It was a bunch of Saudi Arabians,
Lebanese and Egyptians

financed by a Saudi Arabian guy
living in Afghanistan

and sheltered by Pakistanis.

So you're saying we need to invade Iran?

Wake up, Stewie.

Let's get you out of that seat
and into a fresh diaper.

(GASPS) Oh, my God!
Peter, Stewie's not in the car!

Oh, my God!
We must have left him at home!

Oh, my God. That is hilarious.
He is probably freaking out.

God! I would give anything
to see his face right now.

He's probably all, like,
"Where the deuce is everyone?"

Well, I can't really do a good Stewie.

Oh, my God! What kind of a mother am I?
Peter, we gotta go home right now!

Great, Lois.
Now we gotta bail on the whole vacation!

This sucks!
Now, every time I come back to this place,

it's going to be associated
with one particular bad memory.

Actually, we could call
Quagmire and Cleveland.

They can go over and check on Stewie.

They'd probably even be willing
to look after him till we got home.

Well, okay. I guess so.

Yeah. Quagmire and Cleveland
are great with kids.

Like Robin Williams in <i>Patch Adams.</i>

Oh! Everybody's lying around in here.
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

What am I, in Congress?
See? Laughter is the best medicine.

-Please, sir, I'm in so much pain.
-Shut up and listen to my material!

What's this? Bedpan? Peter Pan.
Next stop is Neverland.

Come, Wendy, fly with me.

(BEEPING)

Hmm.

I've never executed
a diaper change before.

Of course, how hard can it be?

You just unfasten these things,
then lay back with your legs in the air,

and let nature do the rest.

It's still there.

Usually, the doody's disappeared by now,
but it hasn't.

-(GASPS) Intruders!
-Stewie, you in there?

You think he's here?

God! It's Cleveland and Bob Hope.
Oh, well. The damage is done.

Better get them out of here.
Perhaps I'll shackle them in the basement

with a 24-hour broadcast
of the DirecTV help channel.

What the hell? Where are we?

-Yeah. Not even a wiggle down there.

ANNOUNCER ON TV: <i>...your shows </i>

Peter, it's been eight hours,

and I haven't heard back
from Cleveland or Quagmire.

I even tried Joe.

This is my wheelchair!

There are many like it,

Without me, my wheelchair is useless!
Without my wheelchair, I am useless!

(PHONE RINGS)

-Shut up!
-Okay.

This sucks!
I want to see the Grand Canyon!

I'm sorry, but we are not
leaving Stewie by himself.

We're going home.

No way!
Those guys have a TV in their car!

(LAUGHS) They're watching
<i>Operation Dumbo Sex</i> with Don Knotts.

Peter, watch the road!

Lois, get off my back, will you?
I'm trying to watch TV.

I swear to God, sometimes I think
your head's screwed on backwards.

I mean, do you have any idea...

(GASPS)

(LAUGHING)

(SCREAMING)

(GROANING)

Hey, crashy,
what are you doing down there?

Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers,

and just about everything else.
Which means I've got to get a job.

Otherwise, we'll be in worse shape
than Morbidly Obese Albert.

Hey, Morbidly Obese Albert,
we brought you some chocolates.

I can't eat those chocolates
on account of my diabetes.

-Remember, they had to take my foot?
-Look on the bright side.

Now you get your shoes half price.

(LAUGHS)

All right. Maybe I'll have one.

Welcome to McBurgertown.
Can I take your order?

-Stewie, you've got to clean the bathroom.
-No! No! I'm not going back in there!

Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice.
You've gotta go clean that up.

No! No! It was literally
only on the floor, all right?

There was no attempt
to get near the toilet.

It's like they just pressed their buttocks
against the wall.

The only part of the floor
that didn't have poo on it

-was the part that had a baby on it.
-Go!

-Peter, did you get the train tickets?
-Actually, no, Lois.

There was a guy inside
selling shower curtain rings,

-so I bought a bunch of those.
-Peter, that was the last of our cash!

These ones have helium in them,
so they're very light.

You are unbelievable! The last four days
have been a living hell!

Our baby is at home all by himself,
yet, instead of getting us home,

you've managed to make things worse
at every turn!

A monkey would be
a refreshing step up from you.

A monkey would talk less.

Here's a little tip.

If your instinct tells you
to do something, don't do it!

If your instinct tells you
not to do something,

it's probably the right thing to do!

You wanna hurt me?

Go right ahead,
if it makes you feel any better.

I'm an easy target.
Yeah, you're right. I talk too much.

I also listen too much.
I could be a coldhearted cynic like you,

but I don't like
to hurt peoples' feelings.

Well, you think what you want about me.
I'm not changing.

I like... I like me. My kids like me.
My friends like me.

'Cause I'm the real article.
What you see is what you get.

(LAUGHS)

Movie references.

Guys, I found us a ride to Quahog
in the back of a truck! Hurry!

Oh! Thank God!

Come on.
Let's head home before Stewie gets hurt,

like Fozzie Bear
when he went to Saudi Arabia.

It's good to worship Allah,

'cause I used to worship summer!
Wocka, wocka.

(MEN CHATTERING)

I once knew a guy who was so Arab...

How Arab was he?

He was so Arab that everybody liked him,

and there was nothing funny
about him at all.

Stewie, can I see you in my office
for a second?

-Yeah. What's up, Eric? Everything okay?
-Yeah. Just come into my office.

Stewie, Shawanda said
she saw you sneaking food.

What?

She said she saw you
in the back of the kitchen

-sneaking a fish sandwich.
-Come on, dude!

Yes. Okay. But the thing was
five minutes past the throw-out time.

Well, be that as it may,

Shawanda took these pictures
on her cell phone.

You're fired.

We're broke, Rupert.
I'm jobless, there's no food left,

I'm out of diapers,
and I'm down to Meg's last hat.

We're doomed, you know.
Let it be written on my tombstone

that my life was considerably better
with my family around,

and I didn't realize it
until it was too late.

(HORN HONKS)

Mommy! Daddy! Chris! Dog! Brian!
They're home!

-Mommy! Thank God you're home!
-Stewie, my baby!

I promise with all my heart

that I'll never say or do
anything bad to you

for the rest of the evening.

By the way, I disabled the V-chip,
and I watched so much porn.

Sweetie, I'm so glad you're all right.

Yeah. No thanks
to Cleveland and Quagmire.

Wonder what the hell happened to them.

You know, Peter,
I'd expect this kind of behavior from you,

endangering Brian like that.

-Thank you, Lois.
-I mean, he jumped into that lake

to try and save your life,
and he's eight years old, Peter.

-Eight! That's 56 in human years!
-Okay, Lois.

I mean, why do you think
he almost drowned? He's old, Peter!

Plus, he drinks
and he smokes all the time,

so take that 56 and make it 79, at least!

Why are you making
such a big deal out of this, Lois?

-I was just a little tired.
-Yeah? Well, that's how it begins, Brian.

Then the next thing you know,
I'm making Peter dig a hole in the yard,

and you're in a pillowcase.

Peter, what's wrong?
You've been so quiet all day.

It's just what you said
the other day, Lois.

I'm starting to think
you might be right.

Brian's getting old.

He's not the dog he used to be,
and I'll have to get used to it.

Well, look, Peter, don't worry.

New Brian's here
to take some of the load off.

Can he do tricks?

You bet! He's trained to fetch, roll over,

and make you feel
really good about yourself.

Wow, Meg and Chris,

I can't decide
which one of your hats I like better!

(BOTH GASP)

I can't believe you got a new dog.
What about me?

Hey, you're still my buddy.

New Brian is just a new friend
for the family.

Trust me,
you guys are gonna get along better

than Abraham Lincoln and his neighbor.

Hey, Dale, I noticed
your lawn's getting a little high.

Yeah. I used to have a guy for that. Dick.

Okay, now, you have a good one.

My word,
what a gorgeous way to wake up.

I hope you don't mind.

I checked the time
your alarm was set for, and I shut it off.

I figured this might be
a more gentle way to start off the day.

That is so thoughtful, New Brian.

(WHISPERING)
I'll start up again in nine minutes.

Hey, Meg, I know how you like
to let off steam once in a while,

Actually, I got you two of them,
my right ear and my left ear.

I saw a picture in <i>National Geographic</i>

-And, suddenly, I didn't feel so alone.
-You know what it sounds like to me?

Sounds like the woman in that picture
was pretty beautiful.

All right, I'll see you at dinner.

-Think fast!
-Wow! Deodorant!

-Are you sure I'm old enough?
-I think so.

I'm gonna make you
a little less gross every day.

-Hey, New Brian. You have a guitar!
-Yep. In fact, I wrote a new song today.

-Wow. Thanks a lot.

And I got you some of this.

I don't smoke it myself,

Well, you know, I wasn't sure

he's a really terrific guy.

drunk Orson Welles
doing that commercial,

Sylvester Stallone in that porno,
and Bill Cosby beating up that midget.

Wait, I don't remember that last one.

Yeah, it's freaking brutal,
for no reason, you know?

The poor little guy's just sitting there
eating his Snack Pack.

Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere
and just starts wailing on him.

Didn't that guy die?

No, no, these are home movies
from when I was a puppy.

-He died.
-Okay, look, just watch.

ALL: Aw!

-Look at him sleep.
-I wonder what he's dreaming about.

Shut up, Meg.

(FARTS)

-Did you hear that?
-He farted.

Just like in the song.

(LOUD FART)

What the hell is the matter with you?
Outside! Outside now!

Well, I hate to say I told you so, but...

Wait a minute.
I love saying I told you so!

Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet Stewie Griffin.
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

-Great outfit. Go on. No, it is.
-So what if there's a new dog?

Lots of families have two dogs.

Hey, Brian, I thought maybe
we could spend the afternoon together.

-Really? That'd be great!
-Awesome, 'cause I got this new gun...

Here we go.

...and I thought we could go
deep in the woods,

-where no one would ever think to look...
-Oh, boy.

-...and just shoot it.
-Awkward.

You know, like so far in
that no one can hear gunfire...

-A little on the nose.
-...or screaming.

I don't think so, Peter.

Jeez, it's like he thinks
I'm gonna shoot him.

He's acting all crazy like Quagmire
when he drunk-dials me.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

QUAGMIRE: (SLURRING)<i> Hey,</i>
<i>what are you... What are you doing?</i>

-Quagmire, I'm sleeping.
<i>-Yeah, I was just out with Joe.</i>

<i>-What are you doing?</i>
-I just told you.

<i>That's right.</i>
<i>I just... I just asked that. I forgot.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, this song made me think of you,</i>
<i>so, wait, listen to this song.</i>

(STATIC BUZZING)

-Isn't that awesome?
-JOE:<i> You said you weren't gonna call him.</i>

QUAGMIRE:<i> It's not him, you big bully.</i>
<i>Joe told me not to call you.</i>

<i>So what... So what are you doing?</i>

(SIGHS)

Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

-I've decided I'm leaving.
-What? Leaving? Brian, why?

Well, you know, I feel like
I've sort of run my course here,

and, you know, besides,
there's a whole big world out there,

and it's time I saw it.

But, Brian, you live here.
This is your home.

I know, but I've thought about this
long and hard, and...

(LAUGHS) "Long and hard." I'm sorry.
Brian, please, please continue.

-This is just something I have to do.
-Well, where will you go?

Well, I haven't decided that yet,
but I promise I'll be in touch.

(LAUGHS)

Wait. How is that one dirty?

It's... I was
remembering "long and hard."

Well, if your mind is made up about this,
Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.

I hope this move won't be a boner for you.

-Peter?
-What?

I was just saying to Brian,
"I hope this move won't be a boner."

I would agree.
I hope he finds what he's looking for.

Okay.

Well, we're gonna miss you, Brian.

NEW BRIAN: Hey, everybody,
let's watch this tape.

Okay, now there's the midget
just sitting there.

Now watch the left side of the screen.

BILL COSBY:<i> I'm in a bad mood,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna take it out on you!</i>

LOIS: Oh, my God!
Well, he's obviously drunk.

MAN:<i> You're hurting me!</i>

BILL COSBY:<i> About which</i>
<i>I do not care very much.</i>

-Pancake?
-Just a small one, thanks.

My God,
these are the best pancakes I've ever had!

I bet Brian would love these pancakes.

-I wonder where he is.
-He's next door with Cleveland.

I saw him on my morning paper route.

You know,
I appreciate you letting me stay with you,

but I'm perfectly capable
of going to the bathroom by myself.

Sorry, but there's a leash law
in this neighborhood,

and you never know who's watching.

(EVIL LAUGH)

I'm watching you make stool.

Hey, New Brian. I see you're having pie.

You know,
pie isn't really pie without Cool Whip.

Everything's better with Cool Whip.

-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah. What about it?

It doesn't bother you
the way I pronounce it?

-Cool Whip?
-No. Why would it?

Cool Whip.
I'm putting emphasis on the "H."

-Sounds right to me.
-Nothing ever bothers you, does it?

No, not really. I like everything.

God, he's a bigger buzzkill
than Buzz Killington.

Stewie, do you know why
W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk

-on his transatlantic crossings?
-No.

Because he was quartered
on the port side.

(CHUCKLES)

Now that I've got you,

let's both revisit the birth
of The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.

(SIGHS)

(SINGING)<i> Everybody hurts</i>

Two, three...

<i>Sometimes</i>

(ALL LAUGHING)

Okay, New Brian, you're next!

(LAUGHS) Oh, no. Oh, boy.
All right, well, I can't do this alone.

-Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.
-Oh, my God. Okay.

Rita Coolidge's less-talented sister here.

(ALL LAUGH)

In what way is that a joke?

-Okay, you start.
-All right. I don't know...

Am I blue or am I red? This is crazy.

-You're blue. You're blue.
-Okay, I'll do it, then.

(SINGING)<i> Summer lovin' had me a blast</i>

<i>Summer lovin' happened so fast</i>

<i>-To uh-oh those summer nights</i>

<i>Tell me more, tell me more</i>

Thanks for letting me stay here, Glenn.
I hope I'm not in the way.

No, no, it should be fine.
But, listen, Brian,

I'm gonna be bringing
a Puerto Rican girl over here later.

And she's super hot and real nice,
but when she was five years old,

her dad ran over
one of her legs with his van,

and it's still kind of messed up in a
pretty obvious, instantly visible way.

Please don't say anything.

And try to make eye contact with her
when she wobbles in,

because I want this to work.

Yeah, sure. No problem.

I'm serious, Brian.
That leg is a train wreck.

I mean, she herself is so pretty,

but that thing
just looks like a string of sausages

-with one empty casing in it.
-I get it.

I mean, it's quite a sight, you know?

I mean, when she's not looking,
you should take a look at it,

-but, good God, be discreet.
-Yeah, I'll check that out.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

-Stewie, what are you doing here?
-Brian, you gotta come back.

-Why?
-Because New Brian is such a tool.

I mean, he's so damn sweet
and saccharine and perfect,

and he's turning the family
into a bunch of douches.

Big deal.
You always told me I was a douche.

Yeah, but you were my douche, Brian.
My douche.

-Come back and be my douche again.
-Hi, I'm looking for Glenn?

Oh! What happened to your leg?

(CRYING)

-Damn it, Brian!
-Come back home, Brian.

I tell you what. When this is all over,
I'll make you some pie

-with a nice dollop of Cool Whip.
-There it is again.

Why are you putting
so much emphasis on the "H"?

(SIGHS)

-That's exactly why I miss you, Brian.
-Forget it.

I'm not going back
as long as that new dog is there.

As long as he's a part of that family,
there's no place for me.

Well, I can't say I blame you.
I hate him as much as you do, Brian.

He's a bad fit,
like a crocodile at an alligator rally.

Yeah! Lurking in the water
with our eyes poking out!

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

Sneaking up on a crane or an egret
and snapping our jaws on it!

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

And sometimes walking out
onto a dry plain or dusty field

because it's nice to get out
of the swamp now and then!

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

-What?
-Dry plain? Dusty field?

-Nice to get out of the swamp?
-What a croc!

And that's where we get the term.

Hey, New Brian. Bad news.
You gotta leave.

Huh? What are you talking about?
This is my home.

Nobody likes you here, man.

Well, I disagree.
I think everybody likes me.

No, we don't.

We don't like your cooking,
your stupid karaoke nights,

and we especially don't like
the way you hump that chair

-in the den.
-Well, Rupert seems to like my humping.

-What did you say?
-Rupert.

Humped him for two hours yesterday.
He just laid there and took it.

-Did he?
-Yeah.

And now every time
you're sleeping with him,

he's gonna be thinking of me.

"And that is why I killed myself,
chopped myself up

"and put myself in the garbage."
Wow, he must've had some demons.

My God, suicide.

How could we have misjudged him
so severely?

Oftentimes,
it's the ones who seem the happiest.

Well, the upside is,
at least we have our old Brian back.

From now on, buddy,
you're the only animal I care about.

Hey, everybody, I'm Bernie the hamster.

-Would you like to be my friend?
-Oh, my God!

-It's okay, Peter.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's a hamster!

(WATER RUNNING)

We'll talk about it
when you want to talk about it.

I don't blame you. I don't blame you.

Do you charge a lot

No, I just keep the tips.

(LAUGHING)

All right, where's the CEO's office?

I've always wanted to see the inside

-Executive bathroom, sir?
-Yes.

Right this way.

-So where is this executive bathroom?
-There.

<i>(JURASSIC PARK</i> THEME PLAYING)

Welcome to Executive Bathroom Island.

Well, this is peaceful.

Good morning, Lois.

Wow, Peter, since when do you get
so dressed up for work?

Since I got tired of getting nowhere
in this world, Lois.

I have decided to do whatever it takes
to become an executive.

Well, it would certainly be great
if you got a promotion.

You'd earn more money,
get better health insurance...

Lois, I am doing this for the bathroom.

And I'm not giving up on my dream,

like I did with that
indoor hot-air balloon.

PETER: And away we go.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

I like everything, including ginger ale.

(HISSING) That's my way
of ordering a ginger ale.

Sorry I can't pay you more, guys,
but business has been bad.

I'm actually looking to sell the joint.

You can't sell this place.
So few clubs play real music anymore.

Well, you wanna buy it?
I'll give you a good deal.

You know, that's not a bad idea.

Yeah, we could really

Yep, I'm working extra hard
so you'll promote me.

Well, based on your track record,

you'll understand
if I have trouble believing you.

Believe it, Angela.
I hate being just a cog around here.

Almost as much as I hate homeless people
asking me for money.

-Spare some change?
-Sure.

-You didn't put anything in there.
-Yes, I did.

I put hope in there. Hope.
Don't spend it all in one place, Raggy.

Griffin, what the hell is this?

It's a robot that I built
to save this company money.

one, it has no human emotions,

and two, its prime directive
is never to harm people.

Oh, God, it's harming people!

ROBOT:<i> Angry! Angry!</i>

Oh, God! It's got human emotions, too!

It's using tools!

Oh, good Lord, save them. Bless their...

Oh, okay. Yeah! There we go.
All right, everything worked out.

Stewie, guess what.

Frank and I just closed a deal
to buy the Quahog Cabana Club.

Oh, wow, Brian, what else are you doing
that's terrible and stupid?

Just wait. In a few weeks,

that club will be the hottest spot
in Quahog.

You're deluding yourself.

You're gonna fail faster than
John Madden's wedding video business.

Griffin, I've got good news.

A management-level position
has become available,

and I've seen
that you've been working very hard lately.

I am recommending you for a promotion.

-Will I get to use the executive bathroom?
-Of course.

Holy crap! You know, last week
I ate a fortune cookie that said,

"Obvious lesbian will bring great news."

It also said
a grand piano will fall on me.

Well, good day to you. And I will...

Yeah, I mean, we're... We're done.

Just squeeze by you here.

Is this where I get the poop pass
to use the executive bathroom?

Sit down, Mr. Griffin. We need to talk.

Okay, well, make it fast
'cause I'm starting to crown.

Mr. Griffin, all our executives require
a high school education.

And your file says
that you never passed the third grade.

If you want this promotion, you're going
to have to go back and finish.

Well, that sounds hilarious,

but it also sounds
like it might take a while.

I'm afraid that's your only option.

Well, I mean, if that's what I got to do,
then I guess I...

Next time you get a fortune cookie,
don't open it.

(ACCORDION PLAYING)

-Bye, you guys. Have fun at school.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, Peter, stop pouting.

All you got to do is finish third grade
and you'll get that promotion.

(GROANING) This is gonna be
a bigger pain in the ass

than getting into a last clap contest
with Cleveland.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Quahog Men's Chorus.</i>

Hey, hey, hey. Clap one more time,
you're not coming to my birthday.

-Who did that?
-QUAGMIRE: Giggity.

Good morning, class.
Starting today, we have a new student.

Peter, would you like
to introduce yourself?

Hi. My name's Peter Griffin.

I was actually in third grade
a long time ago,

but I never finished.

Back then,
we had a teacher named Mrs. Wilson.

Except we had
this funny little nickname for her.

We called her Mrs. "Killson"
'cause she had an abortion.

I know, I know, it's kind of silly,

but we were, you know,
we were just a bunch of kids.

-I'm sorry, go ahead, Mrs...
-Wilson. Thank you, Peter.

Why don't you sit over there,
next to Omar?

Omar is our top student,

and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory
next week in the district spelling bee.

What are you doing in our class?
You're old.

-Are you stupid or something?
-Picking on the new kid, huh?

Well, at least my parents
didn't name me Gaymar!

(LAUGHING)

Wow, I never knew you could make fun
of someone for being homosexual.

And by laughing
at other people's sexuality,

somehow I feel better about my own.

Hey, Brian, where are all the people?

They'll be here, Frank.
We just got to give them time.

And wouldn't you know it,
there's our first customer.

I'll entertain him
while we wait for more to arrive.

<i>So thanks for coming.</i>
<i>How you doing tonight?</i>

Good.

-Glad to hear it. Any requests?
-Play <i>On the Dark Side</i>

by John Cafferty
and the Beaver Brown Band.

Give it up, Brian.

No one wants to go
to a stupid big band club anymore.

You know, I could help you
make some changes around here

that would bring in customers.

You know, Brian,
we should give Stewie a shot.

-It can't hurt.
-Well, what'd you have in mind?

Just trust me, Brian.
I know exactly what to do.

You've got to be aggressive,

even more aggressive
than Michael Jackson's treatment

of his own groin on stage.

(GRUNTING)

(WHOOPS)

(SCREAMING)

Thank you.

All right, Susie, what have you brought in
for show-and-tell?

This is my Malibu Barbie doll
that I got for Christmas this year.

She comes with a hairbrush, a pocketbook
and two different dresses.

Oh, my God. Who the hell cares?

Peter, I would like to remind you
that you are in a classroom.

Not for long.

Can I help you, sir?

Hi there. My name's Glenn Griffin.

I'm here to pick up my son Peter
for a ball game...

Doctor's appointment.

-Peter is your son?
-That is affirmative.

Because you look a lot more
like that child over there.

-Daddy?
-Oh, God!

-Daddy?
-Oh, God!

<i>-Pap√°?</i>
-Oh, God!

-Hey, there are no kids in here, right?
-Nope. Just me.

Oh, thank God.
You wanna have unprotected sex?

Hmm...

(EXCLAIMING)

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

What the hell did Stewie do to this place?

Hey, get a load
of Maynard G. Krebs over here.

He's rubbing the records with his hand.

Hey, hey, you're gonna ruin that,
you know.

Hey, hey, there they are!

Stewie, what is all this?
What did you do to the Cabana Club?

We don't call it
the Cabana Club anymore, Frank.

It's now called pLace.
Little "p," big "L."

Congratulations. You two now own
the hottest spot in town.

Wow, that's a lot of people.
I hope we have enough rye.

How'd you pay for all this?

I got a job as a field reporter
for Channel 5 News.

And all the juice
is being collected underneath?

Yes, and whoever collects the most

is gonna win a free weekend
here at the chateau

with international foods
and wine tastings.

Stop!

(STEWIE EXCLAIMS)

(THUDS)

(STEWIE SCREAMING)

I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

(EXCLAIMING) Oh, gosh,
I hope he's all right.

Well, we'll have to send someone
to make sure that he is.

-Hey, Omar, want a Hertz Donut?
-Okay.

Hurts, don't it? Dumbass.

Wow, he effectively silenced Omar
by hitting him in the face.

My dad hits me.

But I bet if I hit others, the pain stops.

Someday, I'll use what I've learned here
on my wife.

Peter, is this your homework?

Hold on.
Let me take out my reading glasses.

(LAUGHING)

-Yeah, that's mine.
-I could flunk you for this,

but "buttlickers" is
a three-syllable word.

Not even Omar can spell those.

So you're joining him
at next week's district spelling bee.

If you lead our school to victory,
I'll let you pass third grade.

But if you lose, you fail.

I accept that challenge.

-Late '70s Bruce Jenner, take me home.
-Hop on, Peter.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

So, Brian, how's it feel
to own the coolest club in Quahog?

You think this is cool?
Look at these people.

I'd rather go bankrupt
than cater to pretentious jerks like this.

Whoa, Brian, slow down, man.
We're making money now.

And besides, this place ain't all bad.

Hey, you girls thirsty?

Could I interest you
in a couple of Rob Roys?

-What's a Rob Roy?
-Only the drink of Mr. Peter Lawford.

Who's Peter Lawford?

-What am I hitting on, Lou Costello here?
-Who's Lou Costello?

Sorry, my friend's a little new
to the club scene.

Geez, what the hell's with these broads?

Look at you two. Tuxes in a nightclub?

God, you're more out of place
than Prince was on <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

And what's your bid
on the dining room set, Prince?

-(SOFTLY) $350.
-I'm sorry?

-(SOFTLY) $350.
-Can you speak up, please?

(SOFTLY) $350.

All right. And the actual retail price
of the dining room set is $350.

(SOFTLY) Yay.

(SNORING)

-Peter, wake up!
-Who? What?

Lois. I just had the weirdest dream

that Lewis Black told jokes
that were so funny,

he had to shout them
so everyone could hear.

Peter, you got to stay awake.
The spelling bee's tomorrow!

But, Lois, I'm scared.

There's no way
I can compete against those other kids.

It's like trying to beat schpupel champion
Fjurg Van Der Ploeg

at a game of schpupel.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Schpupel!

(GROANING)

Don't be sad, Peter.
That's why they call it "schpupel."

God, we look like idiots.

Hey, hey, that's more like it!
Where'd you get the threads?

We went to Barney's.

I heard that's where
all the famous people shop

for skinny-leg jeans.

Whoa! These are the tightest,
penis-compressingest,

sperm-killingest, testicle-grippingest
jeans I ever tried on!

Brian, Frank,
meet Dakota and New Bedford.

-Hey, how's it hanging, Dakota?
-What's up, New Bedford?

You look like rappers,
but you're not black,

so that's the perfect amount of danger.

Oh, God. Hey, listen,
you guys get to know each other.

Looks like my doorman
let another gazelle in here.

I'm sorry, but we've been over this
before. We don't serve your kind here.

-You're gonna hear from my lawyer.
-Yeah, you know, I would welcome that.

I would welcome the opportunity
to hear from a lawyer

that represents a gazelle.

-What's his name?
-Yeah, I don't have a lawyer.

And I'll tell you something
about Dean Martin.

He was the only guy on a golf course

who had a five-iron
with a cork on the end of it.

So who wants to come back to the hotel
and take a whack at my genitals?

-Cool!
-Awesome!

All right, we got a ball game.

Hang on, girls.
I'll get you a couple appletinis.

This is going great, Frank.

This club and these clothes,
my God, there's nothing that can stop us.

(SHOUTING) Hey, party people,
I'm ready to get 86ed!

-Andy Dick?
-Oh, no!

Come on! Let's get out of here!

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

-What the hell just happened?
-Andy Dick happened.

As soon as that guy shows up any place,

it gets a worse rap
than John Wilkes Booth.

(LAUGHING)

Stupid hat. Damn it!
I paid 15 cents for this ticket.

-No, he didn't!
-God, could he be any more annoying?

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, hey, it's Tom! Tommy!

Hey, hey,
I hear you took that black chick home.

Hey, hey, you're welcome.

Angela, I did it. I finished the

Griffin, you blew up
a children's hospital.

-You're going to jail.
-What?

What, you think everyone just forgot
about that?

There was an investigation,
fingerprints, forensic reports.

Nineteen children died, Peter,
and the FBI knows it was you.

Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty
and sentences you to seven days in prison.

You'll be out next Sunday at 9:00.

God, I can't believe
we bought these ridiculous clothes

for a club that didn't even last.

Hey, come on, we had a great 72-hour run,

and in this business
that's all you can ask for.

Besides, I've already opened a new club
that's even more exclusive than this one.

Really? Where is it?

Brian, it's so exclusive
that it doesn't even have a location.

It's in here. Human heart.
I think that's a beat we can all dance to.

Wow. I weirdly feel a lot better.

Hey, Brian, what do you say

You bet!

God, Joe! Finally!
Is your watch paralyzed, too?

Guys, I don't think I can make it today.

It's looking like Bonnie might go
into labor any minute.

So I think I should stick close to home.

It's your fault for knocking her up.

That's why I always use a condom.

(LAUGHING)

Sorry. I'm sorry. I can't even
say that with a straight face.

Sorry, fellows, have a good time.

Man, I am so sick of this.

Joe is just gonna keep bailing on us until
that baby comes out of Bonnie's butt.

-Babies come out of the butt, right?
-(HESITANTLY) Yeah.

Well, we are gonna do something about it.

We are gonna figure out a way
to induce labor

and make Bonnie have that baby.

Yeah, the sooner that kid comes out,
the sooner we get Joe back.

Yeah, we're not complete without Joe.

You remember when he bailed on us
for that trip to the spa

and we had to find
another handicapped guy?

God, Seamus.
I've never seen you this naked.

(EXCLAIMS) It's good
to let the old midsection breathe.

What... How the hell are you alive?

Hi, Peter, how are you?

Never mind that, Bonnie,
I'm here to induce birth. Follow me.

Now, I'm gonna put the TV remote
down by your feet,

and I'm gonna turn on <i>Two and a Half Men.</i>

If your baby isn't totally brain-dead,

it'll come rushing out
to change the channel.

And when he does, I'll grab his hand

-Yes, awesome! That would be splendid.

Yeah, this isn't working out.
All right, sorry,

Guys, Bonnie's going into labor!
We gotta get her to the hospital.

Quick, Peter, get the car!

No way, I don't want
a pregnant mess in my backseat.

Oh, come on.
You're the guy who soiled his pants

while test-driving that sports car.

(TIRES SCREECH)

I don't want it.

All right, Mrs. Swanson.
You're doing fine.

Hey, Peter, don't you want to watch this?
It's a beautiful miracle of nature.

I can't look.

I didn't look when Lois gave birth
and I can't look now.

You can just tell me what it looks like.

Okay, Mrs. Swanson, you're almost there.

Oh, Bonnie, I'm so happy for you!

She's beautiful.

-(SNIFFLING) Isn't she, sweetheart?

It's hard to believe she's already 18.

Aw, Susie's so cute!

I can't wait to have a baby someday.

Oh, Meg, we've talked about this.

a man has to be able to become aroused.

-Sorry, Dad, I forgot.
-That's all right, sweetie.

Now you run along and play in the mud.

better than Hannity and Colmes.

My problem with liberals, Alan,

is that liberals hate America.

Sean, I don't know if that's true.

You just contradicted me!
You hate America!

If I could just get a word in...

You hate America! You like the terrorists!

Well, I guess you're right again.

-Bonnie, we got a problem.
-What's the matter, Joe?

I'll tell you
while we're doing the diaper change.

Here's the reality of the situation.

I got our hospital bill this morning.

-How bad is it?
-It's $20,000.

Oh, my God! Where are we going to get
that kind of money?

I don't know,
but we've got to figure that out soon.

Well, I'm not worried, Joe,
you'll think of something.

I gotta tell you,

not being able to pay
my child's hospital bills

somehow makes me feel like

-less of a man.
-Oh, honey, that's silly.

I have to, Quagmire.

The baby's hospital bill
drained all our savings,

so I've had no choice
but to take this job.

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing

-Uh, yeah, kind of.
-Well, I might be able to help you out.

-How much you need?
-Look, I'm a police officer.

I can't afford to get mixed up

Hey, you should listen to this guy, Joe.

He's flipping a nickel

Well, I do really need the money.

And I don't have the credit

Do it, Joe, 'cause if you gotta

Well, sounds like
we need another loan shark.

Don't worry, Joe, we're all gonna pitch in
and help you raise that money.

(KIDS CHATTERING)

Wow, Peter, I gotta say,

this lemonade stand
was a really good idea.

It's selling really well.

That's because
it has my secret ingredient in it.

Vodka!

(SLURRING) You know what we should do?

You know what we should do?
We should just...

We should just get on our bikes
and just go.

Just go and start a business.

(SLURRING) You know, I never...
I never told anyone this,

but you're so good at cursive.

I don't know, Peter,
we've been out here all day

and we haven't managed to interest
a single woman in our massage parlor.

Wait a minute, here comes somebody.

Excuse me, stressed-out lady.

May I interest you in
a full-release relaxation massage?

Oh, yeah, just what I need,

to be rubbed down by a big fatty,

an old black guy, a cripple and a pervert.

Now, we don't have any money
and our feelings are hurt.

So that's pretty much it,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Joe's getting desperate,
and we haven't raised nearly enough.

Is there any way you could help us out?

Of course, I could.

But it's funnier to me if I don't.

All right, Joe, we're here.

All right, Peter, Quagmire,

Cleveland, find that door.

PETER:<i> Check.</i>

Hey, fellows,
knock off all that high-society crap

Father, you're covered in dough.

Aw! You spoiled the surprise.

I'm making you a cake out of dough.

All right, boys, pack up the dough
and get out of there.

-Joe, stop!
-Lois, what are you doing here?

I'm here to try
to talk some sense into you.

Do you really want
to go through with this?

I have to, Lois, for my family.
I don't know where else to get $20,000.

But you know Daddy'll find out.

He'll put his best people on the job,
and believe me, he'll catch you.

That's a risk I'm willing to take.

But think about
your beautiful little girl.

You can't watch her grow up from jail.

You'll miss running after her
as she learns to walk...

(STAMMERING) I mean,

I mean, dancing at her wedding...

Look, my point is,
you know what you're doing is wrong,

-So, how'd Susie like your video?
-I don't care about her anymore.

I'm in love with Bryan Adams.

Peter, I want you to promise me you'll
never do anything that stupid again.

Lois, after what you did for Joe,
I'll promise you anything.

How the hell did you get your dad
to give him that 20 grand?

I told him it was for me.
I said I wanted to hire a divorce lawyer.

You're joking about that, right?

I don't know!

Peter, there's something
off about that horse.

You have an eye for animals, Lois.

This horse is brain-damaged.

That's why
I got it so cheap.

Peter, I don't think
it's wise to have

a brain-damaged horse
as a house pet.

Shut up!

You don't know nothing.

'Bout anything.

(SIGHS) Whatever, Peter.

Fine. Keep the horse.

Good. This family works

Oh, thanks for reminding me.

Everyone, some of the milk

is not milk.
It's horse sperm.

I'm a horse breeder now.

Peter, no one's gonna want

You don't have to do anything,
Mr. Griffin.

We're isolating and studying the effects

of various types of genes.

We're just going to
give you a series

of experimental injections
and record the results.

What's this one?

We call this
the squirrel gene.

Its effects will become
apparent shortly.

(CHITTERING)

Okay, what's next?

This is the
Seth Rogen gene.

It will give you the
appearance of being funny

even though you haven't
actually done anything funny.

Hey, Doc, are we gonna be much longer?

I got to get some beers
with the fellas

before I go out on this date.

(LAUGHS)

How charming and chubby.

I'm rooting for you.

All right, Mr. Griffin, at this time,
we're going to inject you

with what we believe
we've isolated as the gay gene.

I don't understand.

Well, if we're correct,
we will have successfully proven

that homosexuality is genetic

and not a matter of choice or environment.

Are you crazy?

I don't want to take
a chance on being gay.

We'll give you $125.

All right, I'll do it.

Boy, you're more persuasive
than James Bond.

(SILENCED GUNSHOTS)

Now, time for some
unfinished business.

-No, James.
-Yes.

No, James.

Yes. You are going
to have sex with me.

No, James, I don't want to!

Yes, you do.

No, I don't.

Yes, you do.

No, I don't!

Yes, you do!

Okay, yes.

See that?

Fifty nos and a yes means yes.

Hi.

So how'd the medical
experiments go?

So good, Lois.

So good.

I'm gonna squeeze right in here,
if my thighs will let me!

(LAUGHS)

Peter, what exactly
did they inject you with?

Oh, all sorts of things.

Hepatitis vaccine,
a couple of steroids,

the gay gene, calcium,
a vitamin B extract...

What did you just say?

The gay gene.

I assume that's
the one you meant,

even though it wasn't literally
the last thing I said

when you said,
"What did you just say?"

It's just that clearly
it was the most unusual.

Yes, that's the one I meant.

Peter, are you... gay?

undo whatever he did.

-(OVEN DINGS)
-Oh, my muffins are ready!

You made muffins?

Well, it wasn't the muffin fairy.

Or was it?

(LAUGHS)

-Go ahead. Try it.
-Peter...

Try it.

Dad, I think Mom's right.

Maybe you should go back
to that doctor.

Well, now, wait a minute, Meg.

Let's not be too hasty.

These are delicious!

(MUMBLES) I know what you mean.

What?

I said homosexuality
is wrong.

Are you... Are you
being serious right now?

Just keep it in the bedroom, you know?

I mean, I'm not all
in your face with my heterosexuality.

Uh... No, you are not.

Darn it!

Knock, knock.
What's the problem, champ?

Why is math so hard?

Well, you know,
it doesn't have to be.

One trick I used to use

is turning things
into a word problem.

For example,
if there are three glory holes

in the bathroom at the club,

and 28 guys at the circuit party,

how many rotations
of guys will it take

before everybody's had a turn?

I don't know.

Nine, with a remainder of Brent.

You're... Wait a minute.

You mean we can't have sex?

Uh, no!

Peter, we're married!

Tony Randall was married, Lois.

Rock Hudson was married.

Ronald Reagan was married.

Mr. President,
did you reach a missile pact?

Well, you could say that.

There was a missile.

And something definitely got "pact."

(BOTH GIGGLING)

Just tell me, Doctor.

Is there anything you can do
to remove this gene?

Well, Mrs. Griffin, it doesn't really
work that way.

We just have to wait for
the effects to wear off.

Well, how long will that take?

A week? A month? A year?
525,600 minutes?

Oh! <i>Rent! Rent! Rent!</i>

For all we know,
he could be this way

for the rest of his life.

I don't see what the big deal is.

So Dad's going to be gay forever?

Possibly, Meg.

So we're all just going
to have to get used to this

and learn to accept
your father for who he is now.

Oh, great plan, Lois.

Hey, here's a nutty idea.

Ever read the Bible?

Leviticus 18:22.

Stewie, you're judgmentally
quoting Bible verses,

and you don't even

Welcome to America, Brian.

Hi, everybody.

This is Scott.

Oh. Who's Scott?

My soul mate, Lois.

I'm here, I'm queer,
but don't get used to it

'cause I'm leaving you.

-What?
-I'm sorry, Lois.

I can't deny who I am
any longer.

I am Peter Griffin, homosexual,

and that's how I'm going
to live my life.

Chris, you're the man
of the house now.

Take the lessons
I've taught you,

and be the best leader
of this household you can.

I will, Dad!

(BREAKS WIND)

Oh, God! I miss Peter so much.

Gay or not,
I just wish he was still here.

I miss Dad, too, Mom,
but we'll manage somehow.

We're still a family, right?

Yeah. I mean, we're tighter
than an Asian family.

You doctor yet?

No, Dad. I'm 12.

Talk to me
when you doctor!

I am so gay for you, Scott.

I'm so gay for you, Peter.

Penis for your thoughts.

I just... You complete me.
You know that?

You just make me want
to be a gayer man.

Oh, come here.

And you don't miss
your wife at all?

Well, sure I do,

but this is a whole new chapter
in my life, Scott,

and that chapter
is all about you.

Oh, Peter, let's snuggle

Well, there is, Brian.
I looked into it.

-Straight Camp.
-Straight Camp?

Yeah. It's where gays go
to get cured.

This is dated last year.

Oh, yeah. I just... I... I...
I just had it lying around.

I don't know.

It goes against everything
I believe in,

but, at this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD)

(KNOCKING)

Oh, for the love of penis!

What the... Where am I?

This is Straight Camp, Peter.

I'm sorry,

By the time you get out of here,

you're going to be back
to your old self again.

Welcome to Straight Camp, everyone.

You're all here
because you've made a choice

to renounce your evil,
sinful ways,

and redeem yourselves
in the eyes

of your Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ,

who hates many people,
but none more than homosexuals.

And, through our carefully
structured program,

you will succeed.

All right, men,
this is Harry the Homosexual.

Say hi to everyone, Harry.

Hi, fellas. I sure
do love being gay!

Harry's choice
of lifestyle is wrong,

so we're going
to beat him up for it.

Now, take these baseball bats
and get to it.

All right. Good so far.

No, no, no!
Don't use the bats like that!

No, no! Don't use them
like that either!

All right, look.

Just put them down
and use your fists.

No, no, no! Not like that!

All right, this next exercise

will train you to talk
like a straight man.

Peter, we'll start with you.

Repeat every word I say
exactly as I say it.

"Then we'll play

"Then we're gathering at Alan

-Peter!
-Oh, don't give me that look, Tony.

That's exactly what you said.

I said it right back to you.

(KNOCKING)

Excuse me. I'm sorry
to bother you people,

but I didn't know
where else to go.

I haven't seen Peter
in two days,

and I just thought
he might be here.

What?
Oh, my God! Peter's missing?

Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

Before anyone gets too worked up,
I know where Peter is.

-Where?
-I put him in a Straight Camp.

-You what?
-Oh! You bastard!

Brian, why...
Why did you do that?

Well, it's just that
you seem so unhappy,

and I just wanted to help you
get your husband back.

Who knows? By now,

Peter could be completely
heterosexual again.

Lois! What are
you doing here?

I'm here to get you out
of this place, Peter.

I'm taking you back to Scott.

Really? You're not still
upset about my leaving?

Peter, there's nothing I'd want
more than to have you back,

but your place is in Scott now.

I mean, a person's sexual identity
is no more a choice

than the color of his skin.

This is who you are.

I can't change you.

And it would be wrong
for me to try.

Oh, Lois, you've made me happier

All right,
I think we're all in agreement.

I'm in charge here.

I have a welcome-home

your ultimate fantasy

Oh, my God! Yes, I do.

Oh, but I did.

Yoo-hoo! Guys!

Oh! Here are my notes

Huh. It wears off after

So, Stewie, tell us about that
new project you have coming up.

What are you talking about?
Get me down, you douche!

No, first you tell me

We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn

And even if I wanted to, the TV's out.

There must be something wrong
with the dish.

It's all right, it's all right,
I'll fix the dish.

Where's my screwdriver?

Holy crap.

You are not gonna believe
what I just found.

A yellow piece of paper?

A raffle ticket, Brian,
but not just any raffle ticket.

I won this in 1989 from a Honey
Nut Cheerios sweepstakes,

and I totally forgot to cash it in.

It's one free round of golf
with a famous celebrity.

Wow. Who's the celebrity?

I'll give you a hint:
famous football player,

had a bit part in <i>Roots,</i>

a couple of great scenes
in <i>The Towering Inferno.</i>

-Wait a minute.
-Chuck Connors?

He was a basketball player,
and he was in <i>Roots.</i>

Yeah, he wasn't in <i>The Towering Inferno,</i>
you dumb beaver.

What? I didn't say nothin'!

-Dad, who is it?
-O.J. Simpson.

Who's that?

O.J. Simpson on Spooner Street?

Now that's a story
I can sink my teeth into.

Stick around!

Peter, why in the world

would you want to play golf
with O.J. Simpson?

Why not, Lois? He's the Juice!

One of the greatest
football players ever!

Peter, he murdered two people.

What?

He brutally killed his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson,

and her friend, Ron Goldman.

-O.J. Simpson?
-Yes!

Was this in the news?

Yes, Peter.
It was all over the news.

Well, now wait a minute,
if he killed two people,

how come he's not in jail?

He was acquitted.

Oh, well, there you go.
Everything's fine.

Well, Peter, it's generally believed
that the jury made a mistake.

You're saying all those guys
in their powdery wigs

and their Pilgrim hats and their big,
gross wives were wrong?

Man, they'd have to be stupider than
you are when you fart yourself awake.

(FARTS) Hello? What the... What...
Who's there? What's goin' on?

Whatever's happening here...

Just knock it off.

So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing
one free round of golf tomorrow

with the one and only O.J. Simpson.

What? Peter, you can't play
golf with O.J. Simpson.

-He's a murderer!
-Oh, you sound just like Lois.

-No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.
-Oh, yeah?

Well, say that after
a soul-searching walk

around town to<i> "Dust In The Wind."</i>

Oh, my God, Joe, you're right!
O.J. Simpson is a murderer!

What am I gonna do?
I'm playing golf with him tomorrow!

Well, now, wait a minute, Peter.

This may be an unprecedented opportunity.

Maybe you could wear a wire,
get O.J. to confess,

and we could tape the whole thing.

Wow, imagine it.

Peter Griffin,
the guy who took down O.J.

Marcia Clark sure couldn't do it,
that dumb beaver.

Hey, I wasn't even there.

I was building
a Canadian dam at the time.

Did you know that beavers
affect their ecosystem

more than any other animal?

-Except man.
-(LAUGHS)

He was in our house earlier.

Now, remember, Peter, we're gonna be

right here in the van
if anything goes wrong.

Just try to get O.J.
talking about the murders.

Do you think he'd be offended
if I asked him to sign this basketball?

Yeah, I think he'd be very offended.

Oh.

-All right Joe, can you hear me?
-JOE: <i>Loud and clear, Peter.</i>

Hi. Are you Peter Griffin?

-That's my name, don't put a knife in it.
-Nice to meet you. Come on, let's tee off.

Damn it,
will you look at these golf shoes?

They're all scuffed up.

My wife was supposed to polish them,
but clearly she forgot.

Man, sometimes I just feel like
I could just stab her repeatedly.

(SCOFFS) White women, huh?

Jewish waiters, too.

I got this Jewish waiter one time,
he was awful. Didn't tip him.

You, uh, you ever do anything
bad to a Jewish waiter?

What's that, Peter?
I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.

You're doing great, Peter.
Just don't let him intimidate you.

Guys, guys.

Someone's getting frogged
in the clubhouse.

-Quagmire!
-She sounds fat.

Hey, you know what I like
to do sometimes, Juice?

I like to just confess things
I've done to people.

You know?
Just clear my conscience.

Makes me feel a whole lot better.

-Anything you'd like to confess?
-No, not really.

JOE: <i>Peter, we're not really</i>
<i>hearing him very well.</i>

<i>Can you get closer?</i>

Um, are you sure, O.J.?

Are you sure you wouldn't
like to confess

to the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ron Goldman?

-What?
-(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

What the hell is that?

(GASPS) You're wearing a wire!

-(ENGINE REVVING)
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

-I am so murdered.
-Peter, I'm hurt.

How could you deceive me like this?

Oh, God, O.J., please don't kill me!

Wait a minute.

Is this about that
whole business back in 1994?

-Well, yeah.
-Darn it.

That's been chasing me for 13 years.

And here I was, looking forward
to a nice day of golf,

away from all those people
who have demonized me

and made me out to be
some kind of boogey man,

even though I was found innocent
by a jury of my peers.

But what about the civil trial?

Believe me, Peter,
there was nothing civil about it.

(LAUGHS)

Well, that makes up for one murder!

The only thing I'm guilty
of is a few bad movies.

And that makes up for the other murder.
I am sold.

You are so witty and charming.

That's nice of you to say, Peter.

It's been so long since I've had a friend.

(SOBBING)

You poor fella.

Gosh, there's no way
you could've killed anybody.

Not with those sad eyes.

I'm gonna make sure
everything's gonna be all right.

Hey, everybody, look who I brought home.

10,000 rushing yards, six pro bowls,
two arrests and no convictions.

-Orenthal James Simpson!
-Hi, Griffins.

-Oh, my God.
-BRIAN: What the...

I just think you're terrific.

O.J., this is my family.
Family, O.J.

It's nice to meet you all.

Hey, Peter,
you mind if I use your restroom?

No, it's upstairs and to the left.

Peter, are you out of your mind

bringing O.J. Simpson into our home?

Look, don't make that
face at me, Lois.

O.J. is innocent, all right?

-Peter, we know he did it.
-Oh, you were there?

Oh, I didn't realize that.

Oh, and you didn't do
anything to stop it?

Oh, accessory to murder!

Why are you so quick to defend this guy?

Because he was a childhood hero, Brian.

Yes, he had a few marital problems,
but I... I used to look up to him.

That's it, isn't it?
You idolized O.J. Simpson as a boy,

and you just can't accept the fact
that he's not who you thought he was.

All right, enough with the yappity-yap.

O.J. is gonna stay here
with us in Quahog

until I can help him
get his life back on track.

-Hi, Lois.
-(GASPS) Oh. Hello, O.J.

Anything I can do to help make dinner?

Um, sure.
You can take the lasagna out of the oven.

You got it.

Oh, wouldn't you know it?
It won't fit.

Well, it's all right. How hot can it be?

Ah, ooh, ooh, ow, ow, ow!
Aw, Lois, I'm so sorry!

Oh, it's all right, O.J.
Let me get something to clean that up.

-(GRUNTS)
-(SCREAMS)

-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Brian, what's the matter?

(SIGHS) Oh. Oh, you're alive.

Yeah, we just had
a little pasta spill.

Oh, thank God. (SIGHS)

It's okay, Brian.

It's not the first accident
we've had in this house.

Okay, one, two...
Oh, uh, hang on, hang on, Brian.

Stop the wheel, stop the wheel. I BM'd.

Hey, Juice.

Is it all right
if I call you Juice? Great.

Listen, I was wondering if you
could give me a little advice

on how to murder a woman
and get away with it.

Aw, cool, look at that.

Hey, Chris, go long!

(SCREAMING)

-(GRUNTS)
-Touchdown!

Good grief.

What are you doing, O.J.?

Well, I got no money left
to pay off my civil suit debt,

so I'm making a God's eye
to send to Fred Goldman.

It's kind of nice, right?
Better than nothing.

He's got money to buy
tongue depressors and yarn,

but not enough to pay us back?

You know how much mustache cream
that could've bought?

I don't like the mustache, Fred.
Nobody likes the mustache.

you how to live your life.

You've been running for too long.

I say you let people get
to know you the way I have.

You really think that's possible, Peter?

Of course it is.

We'll even throw a big party
and invite everybody in town.

And I promise they'll accept you.

Peter, I really appreciate this,
but are you sure people are ready?

Absolutely, O.J.

This party will give you a chance
to get to know everybody

and give them a chance to get
to know the real O.J. Simpson.

Peter, do you really expect
anyone to show up?

Sure I do.
Look, here comes a bunch of people.

(ANGRY CLAMORING)

Wow, what a turnout!

Uh, Peter, that's not a group
of enthusiastic party guests,

that's an angry mob.

We don't want you in our town, Simpson.
We don't love you like we did in 1993.

-D'oh!
-And as for you, O.J.,

we don't want you here, either!

(ANGRY CLAMORING)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Anyone who wants a piece of O.J.
has to get by me!

No, Peter. This is my fight.
And I'll be the one to fight it.

Look at you all.
Look what you're doing.

Why, you're no better than
what you made me out to be.

Sure, I've made some mistakes in my life.

I forget to take the trash out some days.

I've left the toothpaste cap
on the bathroom counter.

I've taped football games without

the expressed written consent
of the National Football League.

I... I guess what I'm saying is,
I'm not perfect.

The only difference is,
I have the courage to admit it.

Does anyone else have the courage?

If so, why don't you just
come on up here and join me.

He's right. I'm not perfect.

I suppose I'm not either.

I guess none of us are perfect.

Boy, do I feel like a jerk.

Me, too.

I think we owe you an apology, O.J.

You see? None of us are perfect!

(CHEERING)

(CROWD GASPS)

Oh, I guess he did do it.

Check it out, guys,
new driver's license.

What's wrong with
your picture?

Well, see, I got drunk
and then got my picture taken,

so that way when I get pulled
over for drunk driving,

I look the same
as on my license.

You know, and then the copper'll say,

"Oh, you're fine,
you're not drunk.

"This is you normal.
I can tell by the picture."

I wish I'd thought of that.

I just got my new
license a month ago.

What's with the big grin?

Oh, I had just gotten a
new tube of Aquafresh,

and I was feeling cocky.

Hey, let's see yours, Quagmire.

Wait a second,
you were born in 1948?

Uh, yeah.

You're 61 years old?

Uh, yes, sir.

What's your secret?

Uh, carrots.

Sometimes I grind 'em up into
juice or just eat 'em raw...

or insert them anally.

Long as I get 'em
into my body somehow.

Chicka-chickah.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now back to</i>
<i>the</i> Fox News Report <i>with Rhonda Latimer.</i>

Oh, God, that new <i>Fox News</i>
reporter is so freaking hot.

<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>I'm Rhonda Latimer for </i>Fox News.

<i>Here are tonight's top stories.</i>

Oh, she is just
so smoking hot.

God, I would do things
to her that...

she would probably
laugh at.

You bitch!

Change it to <i>Fox News.</i>
It's time for Rhonda Latimer.

-(SIGHS)
<i>-...and we also want to remind you</i>

<i>that </i>Fox News <i>switches to</i>
<i>high-definition starting Monday.</i>

Aw, crap, does this mean
we got to get a new TV?

Looks that way.

Great, I need another expense
like I need a hole in the head,

and I don't need that.

I'm telling you,
this thing has turned out

to be nothing but a burden.

Oh, my God, Peter!

When did you get that?

Ah, a few of the fellas
at work talked me into it,

said it was something
I might need.

It's horrible.

And the worst thing is,

I found out I got it
on the gay side.

Hey, are you coming out
tonight?

I'm not gay, they put the
hole on the wrong side.

All right, family, the wait is over.

I give you high-def television.

Ooh, can I have the box?

Look at me, I'm an Iraq War vet
in ten years.

No, we're going
to take good care of them.

(REMOTE CLICKS)

Wow, look at that HD picture.

Yeah, it's so clear,

you can even see
Ellen DeGeneres' breath.

<i>Well, my guest today</i>
<i>is, uh, Seth Rogen,</i>

<i>who's got a</i>
<i>new movie out.</i>

<i>Now, Seth, this movie is hot.</i>

<i>It's just hot, hot, hot.</i>

<i>How does it feel to have the</i>
<i>hottest film in Hollywood?</i>

<i>What the </i>(BLEEP)?

And now, the real reason
to have an HDTV.

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>And now, the </i>Fox News
<i>6:00 report with Rhonda Latimer.</i>

<i>In high-definition.</i>

<i>Good evening, everyone,</i>
<i>and I hope you're as thrilled</i>

ALL: Aah!

-Aah!
-Aah!

-Aah!
-Aah!

-Oh, no.

Oh...

Aah...

I'll get all of the "A"s
out of my body.

Aah...

<i>We interrupt this report</i>
<i>to inform you</i>

<i>Rhonda Latimer has been</i>
<i>relocated to Guantanamo Bay.</i>

<i>Coming up, the new format</i>
<i>that makes HD obsolete.</i>

PETER: Son of a bitch!

Mom, do you ever feel...
not so fresh down there?

No, there must be
something wrong with you.

Really?

Yeah, I've never
had that problem

and I don't know
any woman who has.

Hey, look at this.

<i>Fox News</i> is looking
for a replacement

for Rhonda Latimer.

Hey, Mom,
you should try out.

I mean,
you majored in journalism

and you've never done
anything with it.

Well, I did write
for my college newspaper.

Yeah, didn't you do an interview

with that fast-talking FedEx guy?

Yeah, I ended up dating him
for three months.

That's a beautiful shade
of lipstick.

I bet you enjoy
the music of Men At Work.

You're incredibly foxy,
take off your shirt,

take off your pants. Wow,
what a body, that feels good.

I'll give you a call.
You'd better get tested.

Yeah, Mom,
you should be a reporter.

Well, I mean, I guess
there's no harm in trying out.

Hey, Lois,
little less yakety-yak,

little more cutting up
my banana.

What am I supposed to do,
stick the whole thing in my mouth?

I mean-- Oh, hello.

Lois, you can't
possibly be considering

working for <i>Fox News.</i>

Well, why not?

Why not? Because they're evil
and they distort the truth

and they do the bidding
of the Republican Party.

I mean, what other reasons
do you need?

Don't listen to Brian, Lois.
You'd be great on camera,

like I was when I played
that dead body on <i>Law & Order...</i>

Well, until I got
that itch in my crotch.

The contusion
on his left temple implies

he was hit by a blunt object,
and the cuts imply a struggle.

So it was murder.

But the question is who?

Well, whoever it was wears nail polish.

We found traces in the wounds.

Well, that narrows it down.

At least we know it wasn't the father.

Yeah, but we still
got to find out...

PETER: Oh... thank God.

All right, <i>Fox News </i>auditions,
take one.

And even though this
Iraqi veteran lost his hands,

he didn't lose his ability to feel.

I'm Lois Griffin for <i>Fox News.</i>

Great story, Lois.

Thanks, I just made it up.

You know, I've been doing
this job a long time,

and I think
you've got what it takes.

(CHUCKLING)
You're kidding, really?

Yes, how would you like to be
our newest on-air reporter?

Wow.

You know, I came down here

not even thinking I had a shot,

and now you're telling me this.

Gosh, it's an
awfully big decision.

Lois, please,
take the job, for Fox sake.

Well... all right, I'll do it.

Great, here's your contract.

Now, run home, Lois,
run as fast as you can.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC STOPS)

(WINCES)

Ah!

(WINCES)

Ah!

(WINCES)

Ah!

(WINCES)

Ah!

(WINCES)

Ah!

Good morning, everyone.

Well, do I look TV-ready?

Lois, I can't believe
you're doing this.

If you work for Fox News,

you're going to be
selling your soul.

Oh, Brian, come on.

They're a major news network.

I would think you'd be excited for me.

Are you kidding?
They're a lie factory.

They report whatever
they damn well please.

You know, Brian,
you're welcome to come with me

and see for yourself
that it's all on the level.

You know, I just might
take you up on that, Lois.

And I know another way
we can take advantage of this.

Chris, Meg, meet me in
the living room in ten minutes.

Bring a pencil and paper.

Dad, what are we doing?

Meg, now that Lois has
connections at Fox,

we are going to invent
our own cartoon show.

And we are here
to brainstorm ideas.

All right, go.

Anything that pops
into your head.

Ooh, how about a show about
a bunch of disabled ducks

and we'll call it <i>Handi-Quacks?</i>

Wow, caught fire a little earlier

than I thought we would, perfect.

All right, let's spend
many hours on this.

All right, the main duck,
what's his name?

I don't know,
uh, Red Hiney Monkey?

(LAUGHS)
I love it! I love it!

All right, now,
what's his wacky neighbor duck's name?

Giddy Goose?

Meg, please try to formulate ideas

clearly before you vocalize them.

I'm not sure you're getting
the show, Meg.

All right, names, names,
names, come on, now.

(GASPS) Poopyface Tomato Nose!

Yes! Write it down!

Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!

Maybe they live in a pond?

Chris, can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a sec?

PETER: (WHISPERING)
I don't think she's getting it.

CHRIS: I know
she's not she's getting it, but...

PETER: Shh, there's no but.
She's not getting it.

-Well, what the hell do you want to do?
-She's poison.

-Absolutely, she's dead weight.
-She doesn't understand.

But without her,
the staff is too small.

-I mean, she's just not funny.
-She's completely ruining it.

Yeah, but I think it's important to have
a female perspective in the room.

All right, well, then I think
we're gonna have to expect nothing.

-Right.
-And then maybe be pleasantly surprised.

Okay.

Welcome to <i>Fox News,</i> Lois.

We're very excited
to have you.

Well, I'm excited to be here.

Oh, this is my dog, Brian.

He was just dying to see
the studio.

Well, hi there, Brian.

How's it going, Adolf?

I'll have you know
my grandparents

died in the Holocaust.

(LAUGHS)
No, I'm just joking.

They were there, though.

This whole place just feels
like a warm blanket.

I'll show you to our
day care facility shortly.

But first,
let's have a look around.

This is our control room,

where we have the ability
to monitor up to 500 different

news stories
in any given hour.

What's that
big button do?

Oh, that's kind of fun.

It emits a noise that only
Al Gore can hear.

There it is again!

WOMAN: It's probably
just wind, honey.

It's not the wind!

And this is the kitchen.

We've got all kinds of snacks
and cold drinks in here.

I don't see
the refrigerator.

Oh, we just use
Ann Coulter.

Hmm... There's never
anything good in here.

All right, here we go.

<i>Handi-Quacks, </i>episode one, scene one.

Let's get 'em laughing
right off the bat.

Interior, Red Hiney Monkey's house.

What's Red Hiney Monkey doing?

Um, maybe he just got up,
he's making breakfast?

Eh, I don't think people
eat breakfast anymore.

More suggestions.

Ooh, what if Red Hiney Monkey
and Poopyface Tomato Nose

are trying to build
a house of cards,

and it keeps falling down?

Oh, Jiminy Christmas!
We have all been there.

That's going in.

Oh, we are cooking, cooking,
cooking, cooking now.

All right, now let's take
a walk down this road,

see where it leads us.

Dialogue. What are they saying?

Um, maybe
Poopyface Tomato Nose says, uh...

"Boy, this house of cards
just doesn't want to stay up."

Well, I mean, yeah,
if you want to go right at it

like a Neanderthal, sure,
but I think we're

shooting for a little more
subtlety here, you know.

You know, I don't...
I don't believe that.

I don't believe that that's

a real conversation
when I hear it.

People don't talk like that, Meg.

Ooh! Ooh! What if they just
bought a new wood stove,

and Red Hiney Monkey says,
"Boy, it's so hot in here

"because we just bought
that new wood stove, and..."

BOTH: "We're sweating,
and our hands are all slippery,

"and that's why we can't get
the card house to stay up."

Thank you, Chris, we have liftoff!
(LAUGHS)

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but none of this
stuff seems to make sense.

I mean, we haven't even
referenced the fact

that they're ducks
or that they're handicapped,

but the show is called
<i>Handi-Quacks.</i>

Uh-huh.

Chris, can I see you
in the kitchen?

PETER: (WHISPERING)
This is not working out.

-Dad, Dad, look, she's trying...
-No, no.

She gets along with everybody.

She does not get along with everybody.

-She's kind of hot.
-She's office hot, all right.

-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-She's the only woman around here.

Yeah, in the real world,
she doesn't hold up.

And in addition to everything else,
she's got BO!

She's got BO.

All right, Lois,
for your first assignment,

we want you to do
an investigative expos√©

on one of America's greatest enemies.

Oh, that sounds important.

Who is it?

Michael Moore.

Oh, here we go.
This is exactly

what I was talking about, Lois.

Fox News will take down anyone

who doesn't agree with them.

Well, now, wait a minute, Brian.

Give him a chance.

What exactly do you
want me to do?

We have reason
to suspect

that Michael Moore
may be a closet homosexual.

We need you to get the proof.

Well, if you think Michael Moore's

possible homosexuality
is newsworthy,

I'll do my best
to get the story.

All right, I have come up

with a design for
Red Hiney Monkey,

the head of the Handi-Quacks.

I want only positive feedback, please.

Why does he have such a big red bum?

Because it's funny, Meg.

People will tune in to
<i>Handi-Quacks </i>each week

and see that big red bum

and get a big laugh out of it.

Why? Because it's relatable.

They'll see themselves in it.

I think the design is great, Dad.

Good note, good note.

Okay, now, I also had a thought

for a female character
who's always nagging

at Red Hiney Monkey
and telling him

not to leave his beer cans
lying around and whatnot.

And her name is Bitch Duck.

That kind of looks like Mom.

Not finished talking, Meg.

Okay, and this is Poopyface Tomato Nose.

You can see I gave him
a funny little suitcase.

Now, see, the joke is
most people

only carry a suitcase
when they're going on vacation,

but Poopyface Tomato Nose
carries one all the time.

And see, he's got a sleeve
hanging out.

He didn't pack it right.

Oh, well, you know
what could be funny?

Maybe one week,
he actually goes on vacation.

And he's already got the suitcase.

Chris, can I see you in
the kitchen for a sec?

PETER: (WHISPERING)
Your writing partner is out of her mind.

CHRIS: Okay, first of all,
stop calling her my partner.

-She's terrible.
-I know that!

-And you know what, it's not...
-What?

-It's not fair to her.
-Well, that's sort of a...

Having her here is not fair to her.

Well, if you want to fire her,

you go ahead and fire her,

but don't pretend
you're doing it for her benefit.

Don't put that on me.

-She's firing herself.
-She can't fire herself.

Yeah, she's firing herself

with her lack of talent
and her lack of funniness.

I just... you know,
I just feel like you and I

have captured lightning in a bottle

with <i>Handi-Quacks,</i>
and she's just coming in,

unscrewing the top
and letting it all out.

Meg, your services will
no longer be needed.

(SIGHS) Still nothing.

I don't understand.
The lights are on.

Somebody must be home.

(GASPS) Get down!

Rush Limbaugh?

What's he doing coming out

of Michael Moore's house
at this hour?

Unless...

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God,
it's true.

Michael Moore is gay
with Rush Limbaugh.

And I just laid in dog poop.

That's not dog poop.

Sorry. We've been out
here a long time.

LOIS: And look, there's Rush Limbaugh

coming out of Michael Moore's house

at 2:00 in the morning.

I wouldn't believe it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

Well, your dog was right, Lois.

Looks like there's no story here.

Michael Moore is clearly not gay.

What... No story?

What are you talking about?

You're the one who sent me
to investigate,

and now I'm showing you proof,
and you're dismissing it?

I don't understand.

Lois, I'll be honest.

Rush Limbaugh is one of us.

We have no wish to smear
a fellow conservative.

That would be as foolish as FDR

hiring that midget press secretary.

The president has just confirmed
a devastating surprise attack

by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.

Much of our Naval fleet
has been destroyed,

and the death toll is believed
to be in the thousands.

MAN: He's adorable!

Okay, actors,

welcome to the first voice record
for <i>Handi-Quacks.</i>

All right, episode one,
"What the Duck?"

Take one.

Oh, darn it, Poopyface Tomato Nose.

I know,
Red Hiney Monkey.

This card house won't stay up.

Probably because
the wood stove is so warm.

It's making our hands
sweaty and slippery.

It's all coming together.

It's all coming together.

This is it. Our vision come to life.

I know.

Just listen to that voice,

and then picture him holding that suitcase
with the sleeve sticking out.

(LAUGHING)

(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
Hi, everybody.

Hello, Colonel Tushfinger.

I just built a spaceship.

Want to come up
in space with me in it?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, cut, cut, cut.

Cleveland, what are you doing?

I just figured I'd give Colonel Tushfinger

an Australian thing.

Colonel Tushfinger lives on the moon,
you idiot.

He talks with a moon accent,
you know?

(STRANGE ACCENT)
He talks like this with a moon accent.

You understand?

I am Colonel Tushfinger,
and I live on the moon,

so I talk like this with a moon accent.
Do that.

You know, Bonnie also acts.

Oh, here we go.

So, they want me to drop
the story completely

because they don't want
to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

Now do you see what I was
saying about <i>Fox News?</i>

They have an incredibly
biased agenda.

-You should do the story anyway.
-You think so?

Absolutely. They're hypocrites.

They wanted you to do
the story when they thought

it would embarrass Michael Moore,

but they don't want you to do it

if it's going to
embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

But you didn't want me
to do the story

when it was gonna
embarrass Michael Moore,

but you want me
to do the story

if it's gonna embarrass
Rush Limbaugh?

Can you picture
the two of those guys

poking each other in the chops?

(GROANING)

Be like sticking your arm
in a backed-up sink.

Okay, you're right, I'm...

I'm a little biased myself,

but at least I'm willing to admit it.

Imagine that,
the two of them going at it.

An oversized Armani suit

and an oversized cheap windbreaker

tossed casually on the floor?

Look, they started this, Lois,

but it's up to you to finish it.

I guess you're right, Brian.

Next day at work,

Limbaugh finds a Detroit Tigers
ball cap up in there?

Stewie, shut up!

What? It's just a weird image,

like the way
Commissioner Gordon tells Batman

that he just took a poop.

Ugh! I don't need
to know about that.

Thanks for hearing our pitch, Mr. Chernin.

You realize the only reason

I'm taking this meeting is

that your wife is a reporter
for our news division.

You have absolutely no prior credits.

Sir, I promise you won't regret it.

<i>Handi-Quacks </i>is gonna
be the next <i>Simpsons.</i>

We fire the jokes at ya

like an automatic weapon of comedy.

We throw a curveball joke at you,

hits you right in the head, you go,

-"Wow! What happened?"
-Hmm.

We take you on a little
trolley ride down

Story Lane, you're having a good time
enjoying our little tale,

think you know what's coming--
Boom! Left turn!

You don't know how it happened,

you don't know where you are,
but you like it!

-Uh-huh.
-You're watchin' the show,

the ducks're sayin' stuff,
you're yukkin' it up,

you're laughing,
your sides are hurting,

and all of a sudden you realize
you're feelin' something, too.

When did that happen?

When did the Handi-Quacks
become people I care about?

When did they become like welcome guests
in your home

whose weekly visits
the whole family eagerly awaits?

Take a look at what we got, Peter.

JOE: Why won't
this card house stay up?

GLENN: Our palms
are slippery and sweaty

because of the heat from that
new wood stove we just bought.

(SNICKERS)
That's gonna be his catchphrase.

CLEVELAND: How did you
afford that wood stove?

Easy. I just walked
into the wood stove store

and said,
"Put it on my bill."

(LAUGHING)

(LAUGHS)
Huh? You with me?

I sure am.

-You're with me now?
-I love it.

You know you love it.

I just have one small change.

Oh?

Could Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose
be a plum?

How dare you!

It's a small change.

And if you do it,
we'll really get behind this show.

A plum?
What is this, 1986?

Well, if you're gonna
be a TV producer,

you've gotta be open
to collaboration.

So everybody just gets
to stick their big chef's spoon

into my comedy gumbo, eh?
Well, no deal!

You know something?
I like your passion.

Okay. We'll do the show,
and we'll do it your way.

No.

Well, that was a miscalculation.

All right, there it is.
Stay close to me.

(GASPS) This is it. Let's go.

Mr. Moore! Mr. Limbaugh!

Do you have anything to say
to <i>Fox News </i>about this...

What the hell?

Who are you?

What's that suit on the bed?

And what have you done with your
gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?

(SIGHS) I am Rush Limbaugh.

That's a costume.

Wait a minute.
You mean, all these years,

Rush Limbaugh has just been
Michael Moore in disguise?

Well, it's a little more
complex than that.

What are you talking about?

Fred Savage?

Wait a minute.

You're Rush Limbaugh
and Michael Moore?

Yes, I am.
They're both characters I created.

But why?

Well, after <i>The Wonder Years,</i>

I was hungry to do more acting,
but the pickings were slim.

So I came up with this scheme
to satisfy my need to perform,

and I guess it got
a little out of hand.

-This is unbelievable.
-Well, that's not the end of it.

I'm also Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim,

Malcolm-Jamal Warner,
Kevin Nealon,

John Forsythe
and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.

Wow. Fred Savage is
the greatest actor

in the history of the world.

That's all I ever wanted
people to know.

Well, if you let us run this story,

I promise you they will.

You got a deal.

DANIEL STERN:
<i>Well, it finally happened.</i>

<i>I had finally gotten the</i>
<i>recognition I deserved.</i>

I don't need you anymore!

ANNOUNCER: <i>This Sunday on Fox,</i>
<i>it's the new hit comedy</i>

<i>starring America's greatest actor,</i>
<i>Fred Savage!</i>

Well, Lois, you did
a good thing for a talented guy.

Yeah, but that should have been
our time slot.

I'm just glad everything's
back to normal.

I don't think I was cut out
to be a TV reporter.

Yeah, how did you lose
your job there, anyway?

Oh, I don't know.
Do you really care, Peter?

I mean, does anyone really care?

Yeah, you're right.
The story's over.

Everything'll be back
to normal next week,

so, yeah, who gives a damn?

Anybody got
any more jokes? Stewie?

Anything funny?
No? Brian?

Meg? Chris? No?

All right. See ya, folks.

(SINGING)
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

ALL: <i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry</i>

ALL: <i>He's a family guy!</i>

Ah, the annual
Quahog <i>Star Trek </i>Convention,

where once a year, sci-fi buffs

take their lips off the barrel
of a loaded gun

and spend half a day adjusting
their eyes to sunlight.

Brian, look... I've purchased

authentic blueprints to build
a <i>Star Trek </i>transporter.

Well, that's great, Stewie.

You should get William Shatner
to sign 'em for you.

No way! I'm getting
Patrick Stewart to sign it.

Picard has it all over Kirk.

He's poised and measured
and doesn't wear a cheap rug.

Rather, he accepts even
baldness with a quiet cool

that says, "I am in command.
You are safe with me.

"I will cradle you in my arms
through any crisis in any galaxy."

-Are you queer?
-Probably.

Dad, this is stupid. I'm so bored!

How can you be bored?
This convention has everything.

You can even try on
LeVar Burton's visor.

(SCREAMING)

Why would he wear these?

Who would invent these for him?

And in conclusion,

whether your dreams are
earthbound or set in the stars,

follow your heart and make it so.

Ooh-hoo-hoo, boy, oh, he said
the thing he says on TV!

Now, the cast and I would be
happy to answer a few questions.

Oh, yes, so many questions!

Me! Me! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!

M-Stewart! M-Stewart! Stew! Stew!

Stuh! Stuh! Stuh! Stuh!

-Yes? You there.
-Oh!

Yes, I have a question.

Um, oftentimes, my household sponges

accumulate an awful amount of buildup.

What can I do to prevent this?

That's an excellent question.
It's very important

to thoroughly wring out
your sponges after every usage.

This will prevent the accumulation
of grime and bacteria.

A dry sponge is a happy sponge.

That's not a <i>Star Trek </i>question!

I have a question
for Jonathan Frakes.

I have this itch
on the back of my leg,

and I can't figure out
if it's a bug bite or dry skin.

-Do you take hot showers?
-Yes.

-Dry skin.
-Thanks.

These aren't <i>Star Trek </i>questions!
What the hell?

I have a question for Gates McFadden.

I've got an artesian well on my property,

and the water pressure is lousy.
Any suggestions?

I would check the point first,
before re-priming it.

But remember that the summer months

take a particular toll
on any region's aquifer,

depending on the local climate.

-This is horse (BLEEP)
-And that's the last question.

Thank you for coming.
You've been wonderful.

(CHEERING, SHOUTING)

(QUIETLY) You bastards!

I'll get my question answered
one way or another!

Oh, my God, what a great costume!

Meg, Meg, come take your picture
with this space alien guy!

No, Dad! I don't want to!

Come on! It'll be funny!

(SIGHS)

Ha-ha-ha! What a wonderful
novelty photo this will make!

Thanks so much, buddy.

Hey, how'd you make that awesome mask?

It's not a mask... I have the mumps.

What? You came to a <i>Star Trek</i>
convention with the mumps?

You could be infecting people
with a disease!

Yeah, like that old gypsy
did to Britney Spears

in that Stephen King book.

(SOFTLY) Thicker!

Well, Meg has the mumps, all right.

How is it she was
never immunized?

Well, it was 1992,
and I couldn't be bothered

with anything that didn't
involve Dan Cortese.

Besides, what's the big deal?
I never got a mumps shot.

Really? Well, I'd caution
you that getting the mumps

as an adult could result
in serious complications.

In some cases, the symptoms could
spread to the testicular glands.

Big deal... So I'll wear socks.

Mr. Griffin, your testicles
are not in your feet.

-Well, where are they?
-Under your penis.

Are you kidding? I always thought
those were two little sandbags

to keep floodwaters from
floating into my bum.

(CHUCKLES) No, no,
I'm just poking at your funny bone.

I am quite alarmed.

I don't think you realize the danger.

Like the people who think it's okay
to bring shampoo on an airplane!

So, I told Brenda, I work hard,

I like a clean house when I come home.

And now I'm the bad guy.

Oh, I know exactly where you're coming...

Ow! It's in my eyes!

See, Chris?
Come here, come here, look.

Check it out.

Holy crap, no way!

-(LAUGHS)
-I know, huh? Classic.

-(SHUTTER CLICKS)
-I got to forward this to my bud.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

Meg, I know you hate having
to be in bed all day,

but your father's
bringing in the old TV.

(ECHOING) Hey, Meg.

Peter, what the hell?

I don't want to catch the mumps, Lois.
Here's your TV, Meg.

It's a little old and there's no remote
and it only gets one channel

and it's not on that channel right now.

Chris, check it out.
<i>Jackass Number Two.</i>

Finally!

-TV ANNOUNCER: <i>Up next, Kirk Cameron...</i>
-Ooh!

<i>-...to talk about God.</i>
-Oh.

<i>Hi. Welcome to the Religion</i>
<i>Channel's number one show,</i>

Kirk and the Lord... Just Hangin'.

<i>With me, Kirk Cameron.</i>

<i>Today, I'm gonna tell you why</i>
<i>God will always be there for you,</i>

<i>even in the worst of times.</i>

No, thanks.

<i>But first...</i>
<i>Are you lonely, unappreciated,</i>

<i>not totally happy</i>
<i>with your physical appearance?</i>

Go on.

<i>Are you unloved?</i>

<i>Do you feel like</i>
<i>no one cares about you?</i>

Meg, your mother made soup for you.

-Here you go, honey.
-(YELLS)

<i>Well, you know who does love you?</i>

<i>The Lord.</i>

PETER: Here's your milk.

Rupert, my transporter is complete.

If my calculations are correct,

the cast of <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Next Generation</i>

will soon be here
to answer all my questions.

-(TRANSPORTER WHIRS)
-(STATIC CRACKLES)

Wait a minute, something's wrong.

(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

All right, you girls ready?

-(WOMEN SPEAK FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
-What's going on?

(WOMEN GIGGLING)

Don't you laugh at it!

(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

Good morning, Mom and Dad.

Wow! Look who's finally
out of her room after five days.

-So, you feel better, Meg?
-All better, Mom.

I was made well by the hand of God.

"This is the day that the Lord hath made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it!"

Meg, what are you talking about?

I'm talking about God, Mom!
I've been reborn!

That's right, folks,
it's gonna be a Meg episode.

Stick around for the fun.

Here's the clicker. No one'd blame you.

Wh... What do you mean
you found the Lord?

I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb.
Kirk Cameron explained it all to me.

The Lord is my savior!

It's that damn Religion Channel.

She was watching it all day
while she was bedridden.

I want to share the Word
of God with everyone I know,

starting with my family.

Now, everyone hold hands,

because we are gonna say grace
before we eat.

Dad, would you like to do the honors?

Are you kiddin'?
I'd love a chance to shine!

All right, Peter, this is it.

Dear Lord, please give
me the cheat codes

for <i>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</i>

I have been stuck on
"Bald Bull" for four years.

I tried left, left, up,
B, dodge, uppercut,

but he still knocks me out.

And, you know, they say
you're supposed to go

right, B, up, dodge, left, uppercut...

(CHUCKLES) Listen to me
telling you how to play the game.

All right, let's try this again.

(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

It's them! I did it!

The cast of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>

is here to answer my questions!

-What the hell? Where am I?
-What's going on?

Greetings, everyone.
My name is Stewie Griffin.

I've transported you all
here against your will.

I'm a huge fan,

and you're going
to answer all my questions.

But you're a baby.

Yes, that's right, Denise Crosby.

(CAST GASPS)

That was a warning.

Please do not speak
unless you're spoken to.

Now, question number one...

What's it like on the set?

The show's been off the air
for 15 years.

Although I will say,
it was an awful lot of fun.

You know, when Patrick
wasn't hogging the limelight.

Oh, (BLEEP) you, Michael!

15 years later
you've still got that attitude!

Oh, my God, I'm already
having a fantastic time.

Ooh, hey, let's spend the day together.

Hey, that sounds like fun.

-Ow!
-Shut up, Wil!

Stop it, Patrick!

You know, I think you should
all be nicer to Whhil Whheaton.

The way I treat my colleagues...
Wait. What?

I said you ought to be nicer
to Whhil Whheaton.

-You mean Wil Wheaton.
-Yes, Whhil Whheaton.

-Why are you saying it like that?
-What? I'm just saying

you should be nicer to Whhil Whheaton.

-Whhil Whheaton seems like a nice guy.
-Say "wheat."

-Wheat.
-Now, say "Wil Wheaton."

-Whhil Whheaton.
-Wil Wheaton.

-Whhil Whheaton.
-Wil Wheaton.

-Whhil Whheaton.
-Wil Wheaton.

-Whhil Whheaton.
-Wil Wheaton.

Hey, did you hook up with
Whhoopi Goldberg on the show?

All the time.

Meg, what the hell?
I was watching that!

It's time for Kirk Cameron.

And I think it's important
for all of you to hear

his inspiring message
about the Word of God.

(GROANS) Oh, again, Meg?

You know, I think it's wonderful
you found something to have faith in,

but there's such
a thing as moderation.

Ugh, Mom! You sound like a nonbeliever!

Brian, you're a thoughtful person...

Are you willing to open
yourself up to God's truth?

Oh, you're barking up the wrong tree, Meg.
I'm an atheist.

-(ALL GASP)
-What's that?

I don't believe in God.

What?

Brian, how can you say that?

Why, I just thought you knew.

I mean, I never go to church...
You know how I feel about that.

No, Brian, it's one thing
to bash organized religion,

but we believe in God in this house.

I mean, an atheist?

That's just about the worst
thing a person can be.

You're not gonna get anything
for Christmas, Brian!

-Guys, I'm just trying to say...
-Shut up, beast!

I have dominion over you,

and I command you to believe in God!

I'm sorry, I just don't see any evidence.

I mean, look at the Hubble Telescope.

It's discovered untold wonders of a vast,

unexplored universe, but not one picture

of a guy with a beard
sitting around on a cloud.

I mean, what's he doing up there?

(SINGING)
<i>God!</i>

<i>Ah, ah</i>

<i>He's a miracle</i>

You know, you keep talking like that,
God's gonna get you, Brian.

He's gonna get you with the Kodak Disc.

(SINGING)
<i>Oh, God's gonna getcha with the Kodak Disc</i>

I'm sorry, what were
we talking about?

Hey! Where the hell is my van?

Stewie, I'm not really
much of a fast food eater.

Yeah? Can you read my mind?
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now?

I'm thinking, "Shut up and get a salad."

-I want some McNuggets.
-We'll get to you, Brent!

I want a hamburger...
No, a Cheeseburger.

I want a hot dog, I want a milkshake.

You'll get nothing and like it!

Uh, hello?

MAN: <i>Yes, welcome to McDonald's.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

Oh, hailing frequencies open, huh?
(LAUGHS)

Okay. Uh, yeah, we're gonna get, uh,

two McChicken sandwiches
and a Diet Coke and...

-Uh, uh, what do you want, Michael?
-A McDLT.

No, I already told you,
they don't make those anymore.

You know, sometimes it's a regional thing.
You could ask.

No McDonald's anywhere
makes a McDLT anymore.

I'd love a Shamrock Shake,
if they've got any of those.

It's September, Jonathan!

Stewie, can I take this
(BLEEP) headband off?

No, LeVar. You're blind.
That's the only way you can see.

I'm just saying, they have all
the ingredients for a McDL...

-(CAR HORN BLARES)
-Just hang on, all right?

There's a lot of us,
there's a lot of... It's a big order!

What time do they stop
serving breakfast?

It's 3:00.

Some of them serve breakfast all day.

None of them serve breakfast all day!

Do they have beer?

Hey, Brian, in hopes that
you'll open your heart to God,

I wanted to give you this cross.

No, I don't want a cross.

Would you want it
if I threw it over there?

-No, please don't do that.
-You gonna get it, boy?

-No. Please, no.
-Go get it, boy!

(BARKING)

Okay, give it back now.

(GROWLS)

(GROWLS)

(GROWLS)

(GROWLS)

(CONTINUES GROWLING)

(GROWLING <i>"THE RIGHT STUFF"</i>
BY NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK)

Brian, Kirk Cameron
is the one who converted me,

but unfortunately, he's not available.

So, I got his younger brother
from <i>Growing Pains.</i>

Will you guys buy me
a case of Sudafed?

Don't you want
to tell Brian about Jesus?

They got my picture up at the drug store,

and they won't sell me any Sudafed.

I'll make it worth your while.

-Ben!
-Dad!

Ben, what have I told you

about trading sexual favors for Sudafed?

Look, Meg, I've had enough of this.
You're not gonna convert me.

But, Brian, I just want you
to feel the joy that I feel.

I mean, the church makes
me feel accepted and safe

and part of something
bigger than myself.

But, Meg, you don't need an outside voice

to feel those feelings.
They're inside you.

What you call God is inside you,
all of us.

And I just hate to see people
hating and killing each other

over their own interpretation

of what they're not
smart enough to understand.

You see what I'm saying?

Oh, I do, Brian.

And I think I know just what to do.

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story tonight,
just when you thought the world

couldn't be any more dangerous,
Channel Five News has discovered

that there is an atheist among us.

Local churchgoer and Junior
Christian Soldier Meg Griffin

has identified the atheist as
Brian Griffin of Spooner Street.

Here's the reaction from City Hall.

Shocking, to say the least.

I'd rather have a terrorist
living in our midst.

At least they believe in a god.

Even if it's a smelly, brown god.

Meg, how the hell could you
do something like this?

"If a man hath ears, let him hear," Brian!

All right, what's...
What's the worst that can happen?

This is the 21st century.
People are tolerant.

Well, this is nothing.

Probably just a random act of violence.

I thought only he without sin
could cast the first Prius.

Ha!

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

Oh, my God, that was a close one.

-Brian, what happened?
-I'm a pariah, Lois.

Ever since Meg told everyone
I'm an atheist,

I'm the most hated person in town.

I tried to rent a movie
and they threw me out.

I tried to buy a pack of cigarettes
and they threw me out.

But the most serious part of it is,
no bar would serve me a drink.

Well, if you ask me,
I think laying off the sauce

-could do you some good, Brian.
-Yeah, right.

If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen.

Oh, I hope he finds faith of some kind.

You know who doesn't
have all these problems?

Marmaduke.

All he does is eat pies
off the high counter.

Next time around,
we're gonna get ourselves

a big, tall pie-eating dog, Lois.

-Okay, Peter.
-Or Howard Huge.

Let's get Howard Huge.
Great, we have a game plan.

(SIGHS) Hold it together, Brian.
Hold it together.

Come on, you know you want a drink.

Yeah, come on, Brian, drink us.

(LIKE SCHWARZENEGGER) Come on! Drink me!

What are you waiting for?

(LISPING) Yeah, you big silly ass.

Just wrap your lips around
me and take a big gulp.

Get to the chopper!

All right, everybody got
your bowling shoes?

-Everybody got your balls?
-I don't have my shoes.

Jonathan, we were just up at the counter.

-Why didn't you get your shoes?
-I don't have my shoes either.

What the hell...
You need your shoes to bowl!

Now, why exactly
can I not wear my loafers?

What is the danger there?

Because, Patrick, because,
Patrick, those are the rules.

Well, I think it's just because
they want another $1.50 from me.

All right, I'm putting
our names in. Brent...

-No, no, don't put "Brent."
-(SIGHS)

Put "Rock Kickass."

I don't know how to change it.
I already typed it in!

For mine, put "Dirk Diggler."

I'm not gonna put everyone as a fake name!

How do you want to do the teams?

How about the white guys
against the black guys?

-Patrick, don't be an instigator.
-I have to pee.

Brent, take Michael
to the bathroom, please.

Okay.

Look at me, I've got girl boobs!

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

Hey, Meg, guess what? I've seen the light.

-Really?
-Yes. Hallelujah, I believe in God!

Lordy, Lordy, I believe.

Oh, Brian, that's fantastic news!

I know, I know.

Hey, you mind spreading
the news around town?

Say, maybe down at the liquor store,
maybe down at The Clam.

Of course, Brian.

But first, we have work to do...
God's work.

And God will be happy
that you're joining me.

Then I say let's celebrate the way

they did in the <i>Bible,</i> with wine.

Red wine, you know, like Jesus drank.

-Do you like the wine?
-Very much. What is it?

Take a guess.

-I have to leave.
-(LOCK CLICKS)

Nah, sit down.

(SIGHS) Thanks for setting
everyone straight, Meg.

I feel the warm, healing, liquid presence

of God's genuine, cold-filtered grace.

It was my pleasure, Brian.

And now we get to do the work of the Lord.

Come on!

-What? What are we doing?
-God's will, Brian.

-A book burning?
-Come on, grab an armful!

We have to destroy everything
that's harmful to God!

Meg, I can't be a part of this,
and neither should you!

What are you talking about?
I thought you'd seen the light, Brian.

Well, to be honest, I lied for booze.
But, Meg, you're a smart girl.

You ought to be able to see that
what's going on here is wrong.

You are not gonna turn me
from my faith, Brian.

Okay, fine. Then let me just ask you this.

If there were a God, would
He have put you here on Earth

with a flat chest and a fat ass?

-I'm made in His image.
-Really?

Would He give you
a smoking hot mom like Lois,

and then have you grow up
looking like Peter?

Well...

And what kind of God
would put you in a house

where no one respects or cares about you,

not even enough to get you
a damn mumps shot?

Oh, no.

You're right, Brian.

You're right.

I'm sorry, Meg.

But what is there
to believe in without God?

Where do the answers come from?

Well, that's all part
of the human experience.

It's what we're here to find out.

And I bet you that the real answer

to the nature of our existence

is gonna be more unimaginably amazing

than we can possibly conceive.

Rob.

Did you hear that?

Hear what?

I swear I heard something.

(SIGHS WEARILY) Oh, Adam,
we've been over and over this.

There is nothing under your bed,

there is nothing in the closet,

there are no such things
as monsters, all right?

All right, I guess.

Good.

Now try to go to sleep,
'cause we got to get up

in the morning and make movies.

We're big Hollywood actors.

Yeah, we are!

(CHUCKLES)

This was exhausting.

This whole experience
was absolutely exhausting.

You people have ruined
<i>Star Trek: The Next</i><i>Generation </i>for me.

You are absolutely the most
insufferable group of jackasses

I have ever had the misfortune of
spending an extended period of time with.

I hope you all (BLEEP) die.

I still have five prize tickets
from the carnival.

There was nothing for five tickets!
We've been over this!

Well, but LeVar and I
were going to pool ours

for the fuzzy troll pencil topper.

Oh, yeah? You gonna share that?

Yeah, we were gonna share it.

Really? How's that gonna work?

Three days at my house,

three days at LeVar's
and alternating Sundays.

For a pencil topper?

I have to pee again.

That's it. Good-bye.

-We're drinking. What for?
-Just... Just come over.

-I want you to see something.
-(SIGHS) All right.

Come on, guys.
We're going to Quagmire's.

All right, hang on.

I got to go to the
bathroom first.

Okay, let's go.

(KNOCKS)

Oh, finally.
Come on, come on. Come on inside.

Well, what is it?

What's the big damn deal?

Look.

It's a cat.

Yeah! I just
got him today.

His name's James.

Isn't he just the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

Hi, James.

(MEOWS)

Oh, my God!

Watch when I scratch his bottom,
he sticks his fanny in the air.

Uh, oh, we have liftoff.

We have liftoff.

(LAUGHS)

Oh, come here, James.

What the hell we doing?

Quagmire, since when
do you like cats?

Since I found this little guy
living under my house.

I'll tell you this,
I understand now

why the pharaohs
worshipped these animals.

Oh, look, Joe, he's
making friends.

Oh, sorry.

You know, you know what?
It's all right, Quagmire.

That leg is... Is mostly pus.

<i>(MARY TYLER MOORE</i>

Oh, okay.

Here it comes, James.

Here comes the part
I was telling you about.

(MEOWS)

Ah!

You're one of those!

I hate Quagmire
lately.

Me, too.

That cat has totally
changed his personality.

Yeah, like when I went over
to his house the other day.

(KNOCKS)

QUAGMIRE: (HIGH VOICE)
Who is it?

It's me, Quagmire.

I need to borrow
your lawn mower.

Oh, Quagmire's not here.

It's just me, James.
I'm supposed to watch the house.

Come on, Quagmire.

It's 97 degrees out here.
We're two grown men.

Are you selling yarn?

'Cause I love yarn!

No, I need to borrow
your lawn mower.

Oh, I don't think
Quagmire wants me to do that.

Oh, come on.

I don't think
Quagmire appreciated

the condition
you returned it in last time.

Glenn, can
I just...

(NORMAL VOICE)
No, you can't have it.

Hey, guys, it's James'
birthday tomorrow.

Would you all
sign his card?

You want us to sign
a card for your cat?

Yeah, and don't just put your
name, write something clever.

God, I hate having to come up
with something on the spot.

Um...

"Have a mice day.

"Best fishes.
Peter."

(SIGHS)
Thanks. That's great.

Well, I got
to get going.

I'm heading off to Vermont to
get James' birthday present.

There's this neat little
store called Cattitudes

that makes all this
neat cat stuff.

See you guys later.

What a queer.

He's going
all the way to Vermont

for cat gifts and whatnot?

You can get a scratching post

down at Walmart
for two dollars.

Pair of Lee jeans
for nine dollars.

You know, they got seats
for children now

you put them right in your car?

Supposed to make them safer.

Only problem is, you can't lean
your seat all the way back. Oh.

We got to do something
about this.

His whole life is
about that stupid cat.

Hey, you know, the cat's alone
at Quagmire's right now.

You know what
we should do?

We should go over
there and shave it.

That's a great idea.

Let's do it!
Let's shave the cat!

Oh, boy, I usually
only get this excited

when they say the title
of a movie in the movie.

MAN: <i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>these drug dealers represent</i>

<i>a clear and present danger</i>
<i>to the United States.</i>

Ah! Ah!
He said it! He said it!

MAN 2: <i>All I'm saying is what if</i>
<i>this is as good as it gets?</i>

Ah! Ah!
There it is! There it is!

MAN 3: <i>The only way for me</i>
<i>to solve this crisis</i>

<i>is to be </i>Superman IV:

Oh, that's why
they call it that.

All right, the cat's
got to be in here.

Hey, let's take a man-sized poop
in his cat box

so he thinks there's something
really wrong with him.

There it is!

Rock and roll!

Yeah! Shaving time!

All right,
hand me the razor.

(CAT SHRIEKS)

-Oh, my God!
-Peter, you killed it!

Will you guys relax.

He's got eight more lives.

Okay, seven more lives.

Six.

Five.

Four. Three.

Peter, stop doing
what you're doing.

What do we do?

All right, all right,
I have an idea.

How about we hide the cat's body
and leave that window open?

And that way, it'll seem
like the cat ran away.

We'll never get away with that.

Oh, we just might.

You see, I've got
a lucky cat's foot.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

You know, Peter, it's sort of
adding insult to injury,

raiding Quagmire's fridge for
beer after you killed his cat.

Or is it?

Is my response.

(SIREN BLARING)

Aw, crap.

God, I hate cops.

Almost as much as I hated
my overly sensitive car alarm.

(BED CREAKS)

-(CAR ALARM BLARING)
-Son of a bitch!

What do we got,
partner?

Empty alcohol containers.

The driver is inebriated
and covered in blood.

He's got scratches
on his face and arms.

There's a blood-soaked corpse
in the backseat.

Got shovels in there
and a hand-drawn map titled

"This Is Where
We'll Hide the Body."

Well, that all
seems fine.

Sorry to bother
you, sir.

Pot! Small amount of pot!

You're under arrest, dirtbag!

Oh, come on!

I don't appreciate
drug addicts in my town!

I'm a family guy.

Ah! Ah! Ah!
He said it!

All right, Brian, your
family's here to bail you out.

Brian, if you don't mind,
we'll start thinking up

our prison rape jokes
immediately.

I'll break the ice.

Hey, Brian, did you do
hard time or hardly working?

Penis.

All right, well,
all the pieces are there.

Somebody make something
out of that.

Hey, Brian, who's your
favorite baseball player?

Albert Pujols?

Chris, stop it!
Come on.

Brian, we're happy
you're out of jail.

And when we get
to the car,

would you like a
doughnut to sit on?

(LAUGHING)
You see, I'm part of it!

I'm part of it
like everyone else!

(LAUGHING)

I can't believe they threw me in
jail for a quarter ounce of pot.

Well, Brian,
it's your own fault.

I mean, pot is illegal
for a reason.

Lois, don't be a hypocrite.

You've smoked pot.

Well, sure, Brian,

but I'm thinking
about the children.

Pot's illegal mainly
to protect them.

No, no, pot is illegal

because William Randolph Hearst
ran a smear campaign

against marijuana in the 1930s

to protect his interests
in the timber industry

because hemp was poised
to replace wood

as an inexpensive raw material
for the manufacture of paper.

(FARTING)

There's your smear campaign
right there, Brian.

(LAUGHS)

Mom's right.
Drugs are bad, Brian.

I mean, haven't you seen
those commercials?

(KNOCKING)

-JOE: Open up, Brian. It's Joe.
-Crap.

Uh, uh, j... Just a sec.

Brian,
under your probation,

you're required to submit
to random drug tests.

I need some urine.

You mean
right now?

Yes, right now.

Here are some magazines
to get you going.

Uh, how'
that gonna...?

Oh, sorry,
it's, uh, been a while.

Look, I don't really feel
comfortable doing this in front of you.

Fine, I'll wait outside.

-Here's a bottle of lotion.
-Uh, Joe...

Right, sorry.

-Stewie, I need your urine.
-(GASPS)

Really?

Yeah, Joe's doing a drug test,
and if I give him some of mine,

he's going to know
I've been smoking pot,

so I need some of your urine
so I can...

Uh, you don't have
to be naked for this.

But I don't have to <i>not</i>
be naked for it either.

A-ha.

Come on, Stewie.
Hurry up and pee.

Joe's waiting for me.

Brian, you know I can't go
unless you stare at it.

Brian, what the hell?

-Uh... Hey, Lois.
-(GASPS)

The jig's up, Brian.
Run!

Brian, is this how you're trying
to pass your drug test,

by stealing a baby's urine?

My God, that is just sick.

No, what's sick
is making marijuana illegal

when it's been proven

that it does less damage
to you than alcohol.

No, what's sick is the plot
of the movie <i>Baby Mama.</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>What happens</i>
<i>when a 40-year-old woman</i>

<i>asks her 41-year-old friend</i>
<i>to carry her baby?</i>

Push, Angie, push, push
harde... Oh, it's dead.

Brian, when you have
to go to these lengths

just to get away
with smoking pot,

it's time to
make a change.

You're right, Lois.
It is time to make a change.

Thank you.

It's time for Quahog
to legalize marijuana.

Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

"Hey, check out the size
of Stewie's penis."

Oh, come on, guys.
It's just the way God made me.

No more oppression!

We, as American adults
with free will,

have the right to use marijuana
if we choose to!

Enough government profiteering
under the guise of morality!

Enough with this phony war
on drugs!

You know, you're going
about this all wrong, Brian.

If you want to
win people over,

you can't just drone
on like Ben Stein.

You've got to have a
little more showmanship.

Here, watch.

the legalization of marijuana.

Good evening, everyone.

marijuana is now legal.

Legal in Quahog.

And it's made
everything...

Just so great.

can read the next one.

-No, you can.
-No, you.

Okay, okay, okay.

L... Let's... Let's read
it both together.

-Okay... Okay.
-Ready?

BOTH: Here's Ollie Williams
with a BlaccuWeather forecast.

How's the weather
look, Ollie?

Not too bad.

Right on.

See, Lois?

Tell me things in Quahog
aren't better now.

It's just weird, Brian.

I still don't think
I'm comfortable

with the whole idea.

Look, Lois, ever since
marijuana was legalized,

crime has gone down,
productivity is up,

and ratings for <i>Doctor Who</i>
are through the roof.

Yeah, but Peter's
so baked lately,

he can hardly set up

Uh, no, wait.

No, this is

Hello, Griffin.

Mr. Pewterschmidt?

Hey, how you been?

-Not good.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Wow, a limo, huh?

Hey, are these Diet Rites
just to take?

No!
Those are my Diet Rites.

Now, listen, Griffin.

Thanks to your dog's
stupid marijuana crusade,

people are using hemp
for everything:

fabric, fuel, and paper.

Which means
I'm losing billions

in timber dollars.

I had to sell
my Bangles records.

I was still working
on memorizing all the words.

<i>My back is hurting</i>
<i>From the chair I'm sitting on</i>

<i>Where's the Tylenol?</i>

<i>If I lay down flat on the floor</i>

<i>It usually kind of fixes it</i>

<i>Tony Danza from Who's the Boss says</i>

<i>A-oh, a-oh</i>

<i>Oh-a, oh-a, oh</i>

I'm losing money,
and it's your dog's fault.

Now I have to get hemp
illegalized again,

and the only way
to do that

is to start
a fear campaign

designed to turn people
against pot.

Will you help me?

Gosh, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

I could never go
against Brian like that.

I'll give you this light-up
butterfly yo-yo.

(GASPS)
To keep?

Not to keep!
You can use it today

and one more day
in the summer.

-Yeah!
-Pull over.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Bye.

All right, Carter.

I finished cutting together
our anti-pot video.

Take a look.

PETER: (OVER TV)
<i>Hey, I got a great idea.</i>

<i>Let's kill six million Jews.</i>

CARTER: <i>Hooray! Yeah!</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm on board.</i>

<i>How did you come up with that?</i>

PETER:
<i>I got the idea from...</i>

<i>From... While...</i>
<i>From while I was smoking pot.</i>

<i>Anybody else who likes pot,</i>
<i>reach for my joint.</i>

CARTER:
<i>Oh, there it is.</i>

<i>Give us some of that.</i>

(PETER LAUGHING)

<i>Perhaps later.</i>

<i>Now let's go to France</i>

<i>and steal all their</i>
<i>objects d'art.</i>

CARTER: <i>Yay, all right.</i>
<i>Let's go to France.</i>

Not bad, huh?

Ah, damn it.
That was <i>Fox News.</i>

Apparently, they own the rights
to Hitler's likeness,

and they won't have
him slandered.

Hi, I'm Peter.

You know me from the movie,

<i>Harold, Kumar, and Peter</i>
<i>Go to White Castle.</i>

As you can see, I'm enjoying
a White Castle burger.

Why?

Because I don't do drugs.

Took me five minutes
to get to White Castle.

I didn't get diverted
by all those crazy high jinks.

'Cause I don't get high.

It was a good movie, though.

You know, Neil Patrick Harris
got the job

on <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>
'cause of that movie.

You know, I've only seen
that show once,

but I got to tell you,
what's really weird to me is

why is the voice of the guy
from the future Bob Saget?

I mean, the guy on the show...
He's already an adult.

You know, so it's not like he's
going to grow into Bob Saget.

Doesn't make sense.

Thank you for your time.

Well, what do you think?

Look, Daddy, I agree with
what you're trying to do,

but I just don't think
this is going to work.

It's so artificial.

You're asking
for a spanking, young lady.

-Yeah.
-QUAGMIRE: All right!

Peter, the reason Brian
succeeded in his cause

is that he spoke
with such passion.

No offense,
but you two

just don't have
that talent.

Are you kidding?

I can be very persuasive.

That's how I used to lure
wayward sailors

to their deaths
with my siren song.

(HUMMING)

Hello, Brian.

You're looking good.

Nice shiny coat.

Don't try to butter
me up, Carter.

Why did you call me here?

Come inside.

There's something
I want to show you.

What's this?

It's your
novel, Brian.

<i>Faster than the</i>
<i>Speed of Love.</i>

Ready to ship
out tomorrow.

All you have to do

is publicly come
out against pot.

Forget it, Carter.

I'm not going
to take your bribe.

I don't care if you printed
a million copies.

I printed two million.

And I even commissioned
an oil painting

for your author's photo.

And what's this?

Is this an Oprah
Book Club sticker?

I think it is.

Wait, really?

Oh, my God.

Plus, I can get you
a night in bed with Oprah.

-Uh...
-Okay, just the sticker, then.

So, what do you say?
Is it a deal?

You don't have to sell out
like this, Brian.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Your novel is good enough

to be published
on its own merits.

-You think so?
-Yeah, you bet.

This is your
shot, Brian.

You can be a
superstar author.

All you got
to do is make

an impassioned anti-pot
speech in public.

Forget it, Carter.

Even Stewie says the book
is good enough on its own.

-Right, Stewie?
-Uh...

Maybe do a song
about why pot is bad.

<i>And that's why pot is bad</i>

(APPLAUSE)

I've heard all I need
to make an informed decision.

Marijuana is hereby
re-illegalized.

In other news,
a local Quahog author

has set a record for the worst
selling novel of all time.

Brian Griffin's
<i>Faster than the Speed of Love</i>

has astonishingly not sold
a single copy,

thanks to universal panning
by literary critics.

Coming up: children
are getting sexier,

and that's...

That's pretty cool.

This is so humiliating.

I sold out everything
I believed in,

and I have nothing
to show for it.

My book's a bomb.

Well, look
at it this way.

You did accomplish
something.

Marijuana is illegal
because of you.

And Stewie got to build
a nice little fort

with all of your
unsold books.

My house is made of mediocrity.

Hey, guys,
I want you to know

I'm raising
my reward to $50

for anyone who can
help me find James.

No questions asked.

I killed your cat.

Oh, Joe, thank you so much

for inviting us
to your barbecue.

Well, it's my pleasure, Lois.

Hey, can one
of you other men come over here

and comment on the meat
while I'm cooking it?

Yeah, I got it.

Oh, yeah, oh,
those are looking good.

Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

Yeah, don't flip 'em
too often, now.

You don't want
to lose the juices.

Yeah, yeah,
coming along nicely.

Oh, those are cooking just fine.

Scoop that one up

and put it back down
in the exact same spot.

All right, they're done.
Time to eat.

Oh boy, I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse.

I, uh... I misspoke.

(WHINNYING)

Wow, Bonnie, you've really took
off the baby weight quickly.

Oh, thanks, Lois.

Hey, do you mind rubbing some
of that sunblock on my back?

Of course, Bonnie.

Ooh, but I don't want
to get any on my shirt.

Mmm, that feels good.

Um, you're going
a little low there, Lois.

(LAUGHING)
Okay, I'm sorry.

GLENN: Giggity.

Aw, Joe, Susie's
such a cute baby.

Hey, whatever happened
to your son, Kevin?

-He died in Iraq.
-Sad.-

I won't let you walk out of here
without that dress.

Oh, I don't know.
Will I ever wear it?

Yes, you will.
You've got that thing

for the opening
of the library next week.

It's perfect for that.

Hey, everybody.

Oh, look, it's Black Barbie.

Why are you all alone?

Oh, they discontinued
my boyfriend.

Mom says I'm the one
whose hair it's okay to cut.

Hey! I was playing
with that!

Hey, come back here!

All right, you asked for it.

(RUSTLING, BLOW LANDING)

-(THUDDING)
-Holy crap!

All right, let's try
that one again.

(GRUNTING)

(CRYING)

Oh, my God, Stewie!

Ha! Your kid got beat up
by a baby girl.

Aw, man, this is more painful
to watch

than when <i>Family Ties </i>does
a Tina Yothers episode.

MEREDITH BAXTER-BIRNEY:
Jennifer, what happened in school today?

TINA YOTHERS:
I got my period!

And I will see the Keaton family
next week.

Okay, now, sweetie,
this isn't gonna hurt at all.

Aah! Those lying bastards
at Johnson & Johnson!

We'll put "no more tears"
on the label.

But it does make you cry.

I know.

(BOTH LAUGH MANIACALLY)

(THUNDER CRASHING)

Lois, you should just let
those wounds get infected.

It'll teach him a lesson
about being tough.

Peter, he's just a baby.

You got to let this go.

My baby boy got beat up
by a girl.

What was weird was
that she was crying,

but the way she was standing
over me made it look

like I was crying,
which was weird.

Peter, what exactly
are you worried

is gonna happen
because of this?

World War V.

Peter, we've been over this.

There has to be a World War III
and IV first.

Oh, no. Oh, no. That's the beauty
of World War V, Lois.

It's so intense,
it skips over the other two.

Peter, it doesn't work...

I have spoken!

(GASPS)

There's Connie D'Amico.

Chris, don't walk next to me.

Hi, Connie.

Uh, so I heard you talking
in the hall the other day

about how much you liked
<i>High School Musical 2,</i>

so I burned you the soundtrack.

Okay, prepare
for itemized insults.

A. Don't ever listen
to me talk.

You don't deserve my words.

B. When I said I enjoyed it,
I was speaking ironically.

And C. You actually like
<i>High School Musical?</i>

What are you, eight?

No, that's impossible,
because I've seen that big,

hairy mud-flap ass of yours
in the locker room.

Questions?

Hey, Meg, take that!

(FARTS)

(LAUGHTER)

That was awesome!

The joke's kind of on us,
'cause we're smelling it!

-Yeah!
-Awesome!

-Oh, way to go!
-Sweet!

Ugh! Scott
is such an idiot.

I'm totally
breaking up with him.

I'm gonna switch to one
of the other popular guys.

But, Connie,
you've gone out

with, like, every popular
boy in this school.

(SIGHS)
Yeah, you're right.

God, they all suck so much.

I need a new challenge.

What if-- Wait, now,
bear with me on this.

What if I date a loser

and make him over
into a popular guy?

Wow, great idea. I'm
glad I hung in there.

Now, who are the biggest losers
in this school?

Well, there's Smiley McGee.

Hello!

CONNIE: Nah.
I hear he's a bed-wetter.

GINA: And Chris Griffin.

Oh, my God,
I can smell him from here.

He's perfect.

God, you're right.

He smells like Fred Flintstone's ass!

Hey! No one's asking you
to smell it.

All right, Stewie,

your dad's gonna help
you learn how to be a man.

Real men have a couple of beers,

and then project their
inadequacies on their kids.

-Okay.
-What's that?

-You think you're better than me?
-What?

No, I didn't say that.

So I guess you think

you would have been some
kind of big shot by my age, huh?

Done things differently?
Gotten that promotion?

I don't even
know what you do.

Well, let me tell you something.

You're nothing,
and you're never gonna be nothing.

Now let's sit here
and watch Spike TV.

MAN: (ON TV) <i>Spike TV!</i>

Yeah, that stuff.

Wow, my favorite.

PB and J with the
crusts cut off.

What did you get?

-Your crusts.
-That's it?

No, I also got
an orange peel

and a picture of Mom
eating a turkey leg.

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, Connie's coming over
to talk to me.

Sit up straight.

Hey, Meg, nice posture. Get lost.

Thank you.

Chris Griffin,
you are undoubtedly

the most unpopular
boy in school.

I am? What about Smiley McGee
over there?

Hello!

You and I are going on
a date Saturday night.

Um... okay.

I'll see you then.

Why would she go out with me?

She must be more drunk

than Santa Claus
when he got that DUI.

Oh, no, it wasn't my fault.

Some guy in a Plymouth
totally cut me off.

Sir, they don't make
Plymouths anymore.

Are you Jewish?

Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the sleigh.

All right, Stewie, we're gonna
get you nice and pumped up.

Now you see that
barbell over there?

Go ahead and try
and lift that.

(GRUNTING)

Uh oh, spadoodie-ohs.

I notice your kid
is having some trouble.

You're telling me.

Oh, your kid just needs
a little help.

I got something
that'll get him going.

Well, if there's
anyone I can trust,

it's a stranger at the gym
holding a dirty needle.

Here, Stewie, try this.

Aah! What the hell
are you do...

Whoa! Oh, my!

Suddenly I'm full of energy!

All right, fat man,
let's do this!

(INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Wow, Stewie,
you look like a new man.

Well, will you look at me?

I have the power!

Oh, my God!

What the hell
happened to Stewie?

Yeah, looks good,
doesn't he?

Let's see that lesbo,

Susie Swanson, beat him up now.

Wait a minute,
how do you know she's gay?

Short haircut,
stubby legs,

doesn't respond to my advances.

You haven't answered
my question!

Why the hell does
Stewie look like this?

Well, I took him
to the gym and the colorful gent there

advised me
that I put him on steroids.

-And you listened to him?
-Yeah, I believe everything

everyone tells me anywhere.

What's going on, B-minus?

-What's the haps?
-Stewie, you look gross.

You look like
Lou Ferrigno's poop.

I look like a guy
who's been hitting the gym.

It has nothing to do with the gym,
you're on drugs.

Doesn't matter how you find
the pot of gold, B-to-the-ryan.

All that matters is that
you beat the leprechauns.

That doesn't
make any sense.

Doesn't have to make sense
when you look like this.

(GRUNTS)

I am hotter than phone sex
with a blind girl.

You sound hot.

What are you wearing?

I don't know.

We have a lot of work to do

All right, if I'm going

Now, take that hat off.

Oh, heavens,
I look like a rake.

No, you look like you don't care,
and that's good.

Oh, okay.

Um, if we're dating,
does that mean when

-we go in there, I can hold your hand?
-Good idea.

Then everyone will
think you're popular.

Well, I don't really
care about that.

I want to hold your hand
'cause I like you.

I don't understand.

Well, I think you're nice,

and I like spending time
with you.

You're really pretty,

and I hope I get to be
with you for a long time.

Wow, um...

no guy's ever said anything
that nice to me before.

Well, maybe you've been
hanging around with jerks.

Yeah, maybe I have.

Hey, forget the pep rally.

You want to go see a movie?

Cool! Maybe we can go see that

Chazz Palminteri/Paul Sorvino

-I say,

we may have to bring in
our friend from Yonkers!

Hey, what the hell?

Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Is there a problem? Huh?

You want to go?
You want to go?

"Go?" What are you talking about?

I'm talking about "go."

That's what
I'm talking about.

-First one's on the house.
-I got things to do.

-Uh, where do you think you're going?
-I'm going downstairs.

Oh, there's a toll in the hall now.

-I... Just...
-Uhp. Uhp.

-You...

-This is...

-Can I...
-Uhp.

Ah, I'm just messing
with you, man!

You can do
whatever you want!

I was just kidding you!

Why you so serious?

All right, Chrissy,
here we go.

(GASPING) Look!

Oh, my God!

Is that Chris Griffin
with Connie D'Amico?

-I think it is!
-Wow, that makes him popular.

Hey, Griffin.

-Griff-a!
-Griff-a-Mano!

(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

Wow, the jocks have never
said hello to me before.

Hi, you guys!

Wow, you did it, Connie.

Chris Griffin is popular.

So, you going
to dump him now?

No, Gina, I'm not.

-You're not?
-No.

There's something about him.

He's not like the other guys.

-I actually really like him.
-You do?

Yeah, in fact,
I'm going to his house

for dinner tonight,
so I can meet his parents.

Wow, Connie D'Amico is coming
to my house for dinner!

I just hope Dad
doesn't embarrass us,

like he did when that
one-legged guy came over.

All right, well,
if you like movie trivia,

I got one that'll
stump you-- Uh...

Of course, you're probably not
really into tibia-- Trivia.

Uh... boy that
global warming, huh?

They say we lost a foot of snow
last winter-- Uh...

Hey, how about another beer,
huh?

I bet you like
the taste of hops...

Uh...

You only have one leg, sir.

Oh, Connie,
it's so nice to meet you.

We're so excited
that Chris is finally

bringing a girl
home for dinner.

It's really nice to meet you,
too, Mrs. Griffin.

Um, do you mind if I ask
what's up with your baby?

I'm going to go work out.

Again? That's like
the eighth time today.

I'm not satisfied
until every vein

is forced up against my skin.

Look how vascular I am, Brian.

If there's one thing women love,
it's a vascular man.

<i>I've got veins</i>

<i>They carry blood</i>
<i>all over my "bahdy."</i>

That's how John Mayer
would say it.

"Bahdy."

I'm really into him now.

You better be okay with it!

Well, to answer
your question, Connie,

apparently I'm married
to a man who thinks

it's okay to inject
an infant with steroids.

Wait, Lois,
knock it off for a sec.

Connie, you are really pretty.

I mean, you have filled out
something wacky.

Oh. Thanks, Mr. Griffin.

-I like what you're doing with your boobs.
-Dad!

So, Connie, now that
you're dating my brother,

maybe we can hang out,
you know?

Hey, after dinner,
you want to come up to my room

and give each other makeovers?

I don't use makeup, Meg.

Of course you don't,
you're all natural.

Man, your dad must be proud.

Actually, my dad passed away
four years ago.

Yeah, yeah, he did.

He sure did.

You going to shower
before dessert?

Greggy! Fitzy!

T-bone! Gabagoo!

Nazi guy!

Griffa!

Hey, we're totally stoked

for your party this weekend!

(LAUGHS) You know it, brother.

It's going to be awesome.

But keep it on the down-low
so the spazoids don't catch wind.

(LAUGHS)

(GROANS) Speaking of spazoids.

Wow, can you believe it, Connie?

You and I are going
to be at the same party this weekend!

Oh, this is so cool!

Hey, what are you wearing

so I make sure I don't
wear the same thing?

-Um, you're not invited, Meg.
-What?

But... it's at my house.

Uh, Connie, let me handle this.

I'm sorry, Meg,
you can't come.

There's an ass-to-boob ratio
that you're way off of.

Hey, Chris, come on,
let's corner the nerds

and call them gay and make them
show us their penises.

Won't that be gay of them?

(LAUGHTER)
Yeah, that is bro-tacular.

-Way to go, man.
-Awesome, bro.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Man, our boy, Chris,
partying with the cool kids.

I am a very proud
dad right now.

And look at that Connie,

so young and lithe.

Look at the shape
of that body.

Look at the shape of
that body!

That's it, Brian!

That's where One-Eyed Willie
buried his gold!

(CRYING)

Oh, Meg, sweetheart,
why don't you just

go downstairs and
join the party?

I wasn't invited!

I hate Chris!

He's such a jerk!

Oh, look, honey,
he's just a little confused

about who he is right now.

I'm sure deep down,
he still loves his big sister.

I hate my school!

I hate everyone!

I hate my life!

(SIGHS) Okay, look, Meg,
I've been at this for 45 minutes.

I don't know what
else I can say.

Here's a Sylvia Plath book
and a bottle of Ambien.

I'm going to look
the other way,

and whatever happens, happens.

(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

Gina, have you seen Chris?

Yeah, he's over there.

Chris, what are you doing?

Getting scraped to death
by my zipper.

You bastard!

How the hell can you be
cheating on me?

I'm the one
who made you popular!

No, Connie, beating up
that Jewish kid made me popular.

Come on, girls,
let's go upstairs and make out.

Oh, no, Connie's been hurt!

I guess I should lie
on top of her to keep her warm.

What are you looking at?
It's a cartoon!

Chris, I can't believe
you dissed Connie at your party.

-That was awesome!
-Yeah, I heard about it

when I was making that
gay nerd spoon with me.

Hey, guys.
Room for one more?

I don't think so.

-(COUGHS) Loser.
-(COUGHS) Reject.

(COUGHS) Everyone's gay but me.

My God, he's practically ruined me.

I've created a monster.

Meg, we've got to do something.

"We"? Are you kidding?

Do you really think
I would help you out

in any way after everything
you've done to me?

What are you talking about?

You see this, Connie?

This is from when you called me
"sticky ass-cow" in sixth grade.

This one is from when
you made a plaster cast

of my vagina freshmen year.

You want my help?

You can go (BLEEP) yourself!

CHRIS: Hey, Meg, think fast!

Ha-ha! Loser!

All right, let's do it.

When we're done with him,
he'll be more of an outcast

than a seagull
at an Adam Sandler movie.

This is my old bicycle
that I had from when I was ten.

(SCREECHING LAUGH)

<i>Sometimes the banana seat</i>

You shut up, man,
it's a comedy!

<i>Ring, ring, ring!</i>

(SCREECHING LAUGH)

Ah, another day of being huge.

Good morning, guns of Navaro--
(GASPS)

Oh, no!

What's happening?

I'll tell you
what's happening.

Your steroids have worn off.

You're weak like everyone else.

And guess what?

There's a toll in the hall now.

Stay away from me!

-Stay away from me!
-Stewie, no!

And now, here's something
we hope you'll really like.

Settle down, everyone.

Okay, let's get
this assembly started.

Is everything set, Meg?

Once Chris gets up there,
my friend in the AV department

will take care of everything.

Okay, Meg,
remember our deal.

I do this for you,
and I have your permission

to think about you later tonight
when I'm in the tub.

Fine, Neil.

Awesome! I might even
go lefty tonight.

Stranger in the tub.

Before we begin,
Chris Griffin

has an announcement
for the cool kids.

Yeah, hey, guys.

The meeting of the cool kids
club will be at 3:15,

leaning up against
Tim Breckner's SUV

in the parking lot.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

Would you do me?

I'd do me.

I'd do me so hard.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Hey, Chris. What's that?

Did you sit on something?

(GASPING, GRUNTING)

(LAUGHTER)

Chris Griffin's a freak!

-What a loser!
-I'm gay, all right!

Ah, come on, it's me.
Griffa!

You don't get to talk
like that anymore!

Connie, the person
who humiliated you

has himself
been humiliated.

By the rules
of high school,

you are now popular again.

Well, we did it, Connie.

Thanks for your help, Meg.

There's no chance we're
going to be friends now, is there?

Absolutely not.

Can I at least think
about you in the tub later?

No.

I'm still gonna.

Well, Chris, you must feel ridiculous.

I do, Dad.

And, Meg, I'm really sorry
I was such a douche.

Well, there is a way
you can make it up to me.

-How?
-Tell me what it was like,

being one of them.

It was like basking
in the warm glow

of a higher intelligence
as it envelops you

and allows you to become part
of its everlasting glory.

I flew today.

Hey, everybody.
Look what came in the mail.

We got invitations
to Jillian's wedding.

"Jillian's wedding"?
She's getting married?

Wow, that's great.

It looks like
she finally found someone

after dating that last loser.

She dated someone after me?

No. See how I set up my own joke?

You walked right into it, Brian.

<i>Walk right in</i>

<i>Sit right down</i>

<i>Stewie's gonna</i>
<i>make you the fool</i>

Peter, here's your invite.

Chris, Meg,

Stewie and me.

Uh... probably
one more in there.

No, doesn't look like it.

Oh, yeah, here it is. Brian.

Oh, no, wait, it's for "B-Ryan."

Aw, cool, Mrs. G.

Thanks for letting me stay here
the last couple weeks.

I've enjoyed his company.

She invited everybody except me?

What the hell?
We dated for six months.

Ouch. Well, Brian, looks like
you're the odd man out,

like a non-praying mantis.

Bless us, O Lord, for these
gifts we are about to receive.

Help us to be mindful
of all our blessings and...

(LOUD CHEWING)

Brian, I'm filling
out my RSVP card

and I don't know
whether I should get

the salmon or the Snausages.

They're having Snausages?

Yeah, it sounds like fun.

Big deal. I could care less
about going to that wedding.

Well, look on the bright side,
it frees you up

to go to Cleveland's barbecue.

Cleveland's having a barbecue?

Oh, boy, this is really awkward.

None of this is awkward.

I've moved on from Jillian.

I've dated plenty
of other girls since her.

I never do computer dating.

Yeah, me neither.

So, you're 27?

Well, that picture was, you know,

it was posted
a couple years ago.

So, you're...
You're a golden retriever?

Well, it's a retriever mix

...esapeake bay...
bra-doodle.

Where is that waitress?

Fine, if you're so over her,
we should all go out to dinner.

You, me, Jillian,
and her fianc√©,

unless you're uncomfortable.

I would have no problem with that.

I'd love to meet the fianc√©.

Great, and I'm sure
DeShawn would love to meet you.

-"DeShawn"?
-Ahh, his name's Derek!

But look at your face!

Hi, guys.

-Hi, Jillian.
-Oh, hey, Jillian.

Congratulations on
your upcoming nuptials.

Oh, are they showing?

It's a really thin bra.

Peter, I came over
to ask you something.

Will you give me away
at my wedding?

Wow, sure.
That'd be great.

Jillian, don't you
want your own father to give you away?

Lois, don't ruin this for me.

Don't ruin this
like you ruined Kix cereal.

Mmm, this Kix cereal
is good-tasting.

And it's good for you.

Nyah!

My father can't give me away
'cause he's dead.

-(LAUGHS)
-Peter would be happy to do the honors.

Plus, when's the next time you're going

to get to give a bride away?

I know!
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

You can give me away
when I get married, Dad.

Nyah!

(FRENCH ACCENT) Merci, mademoiselle,
and for the gentlemen?

Yeah, can I have, uh,
this third thing down please?

Ah, very good, sir,
and for you?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(LAUGHS) Ah, <i>bon, </i>excellent.
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

Wow, Derek, that's...

pretty good French you speak there.

He also speaks orange!

-Mandarin, honey.
-Mandolin!

Whoa!

Hey, hey, hey,
what luck, huh?

Wow, sweetie,
that was amazing!

I don't think I could do that
again in a million years.

-Ow!
-Ow!

(BOTH GROANING)

I caught this piece.

Oh, my God, sir,
are you all right?

I don't know.

I actually just had
elbow surgery.

I wasn't even supposed
to come in to work today.

Why would you trip me
deliberately?

-(STUTTERING) I'm sorry.
-Dinner's going great.

You know, I can probably
help you with that elbow.

Does that feel better?

Yeah, it feels a lot better.

-Wow, you're the best man ever!
-Oh, hardly.

Excuse me, I'm just going to use
the restroom really quick.

-I'll go with you.
-Oh, my God, gay.

Shut up. He's obviously
some sort of superman.

I just...
I just need to know

if he has any shortcomings.

-It'll make me feel better.
-You are not even...

You're going in there to look...

That's even gayer.

BRIAN: Oh, come on!

Can I have another bourbon, please?

Hey, blondie.

You want to get together
with my dogwood?

-What?
-"Dogwood."

You know, like, like
Dogwood and Blondie.

-Like in the funnies?
-You mean Dagwood?

Dagwood, that's what it is.

Hey, how about this one?

You want to take
a Wizard on my Id?

(LAUGHS)

You remind me of my stepdad.

Oh, man.

What the hell
did I do last night?

Good morning.

Oh, my God!
You're Lauren Conrad!

-Yeah.
-From <i>The Hills.</i>

Yeah, you seem surprised.

No, no, it's just, I...

I mean, I probably had
a lot to drink last night,

so if I did anything that
might've offended you,

-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

I have a dog, so I've had to cut poop
out of his fur before.

Oh. Oh, thanks.

Well, otherwise, it was
a fun night though, right?

So fun.

You know, I had a really fun night, Brian.

You seem like a really cool guy.

Yeah, um, hey, you know,
if you don't mind,

I'm sort of a low-profile
kind of person.

So I'm going to take off

before anybody gets
the wrong idea here.

STEWIE: Hey!

Brian, is that you?
Is that Lauren Con...

Oh, yeah, My Go...
I was shopping for hats.

Hang on. I'm coming over!

Oh, no.

Don't go anywhere!
Stay right there!

Who's that? Oh, it's just this jerk
that goes to my school.

You go to school?

No, I just lied to you
and I'm not really sure why.

Is this the longest light ever or what?

Ah, there we go!

(EXCITED MURMURING)

Oh, my God, how do you two
know each other?

Uh, we actually just met.

Well, I'm Stewie.

I'm Lauren.
It's good to meet you.

I love the show. Do you need
a gay friend on the show--

-A friend on the show?
-Hey, you know what?

I'm actually on my way
to go shoot now.

If you want, you guys can tag along.

Oh, I don't know if we have time.

Yes, we would love to!

Brian, don't wreck this for me.

Oh, my God,
I have the perfect hat for this!

Listen, Lauren, I'm not super
comfortable being on camera.

Oh, relax, after a little while,

you'll forget they're even there.

What's everybody looking at?

The salesman told me
it was unisex.

Hey, those people look familiar.

That's Heidi and Spencer.

I don't really talk to them.

Wow, Spencer does
look like a monkey.

Spencer, I am so over
your selfishness.

What do you want?
I came out to Hollywood.

I'm on camera all day,
and I turned my back on my own kind.

Ugh, look,
there's Brody Jenner.

God, what a douchebag.

I can't believe that

came out of Bruce Jenner's vagina.

-Bruce Jenner is a man.
-No, Brian.

That's what the press
would have you believe, but he's not.

Bruce Jenner is a woman.

An elegant, beautiful Dutch woman.

This is where they edit
the show together.

Lauren, we got a rough cut
of next week's episode.

-Can you cue that up, Terry?
-Sure.

I need to be, like, fine

to be alone and, like, not even
want to date someone, and then

I'll know I'll be fine to get
into a relationship.

That's it?

-That was like five seconds.
-It's okay.

They fill the rest
with shots of street signs,

and fronts of restaurants,

and old footage from <i>The A-Team.</i>

(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, Brian, where were
you last night, buddy?

Oh, I was, um, I was out.

I got a little wrecked after dinner

-and I didn't want to drive home.
-Oh, yeah?

Did you stay in town
or did you...

head for the hills?

(LAUGHTER)

Wait a minute, how the hell do

you guys know about that already?

It's all over the Internet! Look!

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Does Lauren Conrad have a new beau?</i>

<i>An anonymous source</i>
<i>has the answers.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, I know that guy.</i>
<i>His name's Brian Griffin.</i>

<i>And he definitely boned</i>
<i>Lauren last night.</i>

Great. Great, that's...
That's fantastic.

Well, I think it's wonderful
that you're dating

such a classy, well-educated
girl like Lauren Con...

(LAUGHING)
She's such an idiot, Brian!

She's such an idiot!

Yeah, hey, you know something, Brian.

I bet you make
the late night monologues.

I mean, it's a little weird,
isn't it?

This new Lauren Conrad
relationship?

When asked about their sex life,
Brian was quoted as saying,

"Oh, yeah, we just do it me style."

(LAUGHTER)

Have you seen the news about
Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin?

You know, a lot of these
young Hollywood girls

carry their little dogs around
in their purse,

but Lauren carries one
in her pants.

(LAUGHTER)

Yeah, so Lauren Conrad

and Brian Griffin
are now a couple.

Apparently, she gave
that dog a bone,

and he gave it right back.

(LAUGHTER)

Look, I was drunk
out of my mind.

I didn't know what I was doing.

It was a one-night thing.

I have no interest in dating
one of those shallow,

idiot celebrities who's only
famous for being famous.

I'm going over
to let her down easy.

Hey, tell her
I like her work in <i>Jake and the Fatman.</i>

Oh, no, wait, that was William Conrad.

Tell her I like <i>Jake and the Fatman.</i>

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Can I help you?

Yeah, I'm Brian.

I'm, uh... the guy all

-the comedians have been talking about.
-Oh, <i>si.</i>

(LAUGHS)

Lauren is in the back.

Just follow the music
and you will find her.

Thanks.

(CLASSICAL VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS)

Oh, hi, Brian.

Wow, hi.

That's beautiful.
What was that?

It's Mozart's
<i>Violin Concerto No. 1 in B Flat.</i>

Plato's <i>Symposium.</i>
This yours?

-Oh, yeah.
-It's pretty worn out.

Yeah, I've read it, like, 100 times.

I find Aristophanes'
quasi-satirical origin myth

regarding the three genders
both fantastic and serious.

Yeah, that, uh...

That always cracked me up.

So you read a lot, huh?

Yeah, but I try not
to let it interfere

with my biomolecular research.

Biomolec...
I don't understand.

Come on, I'll show you
what I did yesterday.

It'll make you feel... young,

as when the world was new.

(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)

You did all this in a day?

The matrix formed in a day.

The life forms grew later

at a substantially accelerated rate.

Can I cook, or can't I?

This doesn't make any sense.

If you're so smart,
why do you hide it?

Come on, Brian, you know
America doesn't like smart people.

They elected Bush twice.

Yeah, once, but...

So, this whole persona
is just a publicity stunt?

Publicity is what keeps this
franchise running, Brian.

We're even using state-of-the-art
computer animation

to create a fake sex tape
with me and Bill Cosby.

Now you will get ready
for the zim-zam

and the bappity-bippity.

And you will take off
your clothes like...

(MAKING STRANGE SOUNDS)

And get ready for
the most splendiferous

pudding pop
you have ever seen.

All right, Jillian,
since I'm giving you away

on your wedding day, I want to make sure
it all goes off without a hitch.

Now, what are your thoughts
on a wedding singer?

Oh, I thought that
maybe I would just

deejay the wedding myself.

I already made
a playlist on this.

A box of Junior Mints?

This isn't an iPod?

Your Junior Mints play mp3s?

My iPod is chocolate?

Well, be that as it
may or not be that,

I was thinking I could
be your wedding singer.

(GASPS)
That's a great idea, Peter.

Sweet. And I promise you'll be able
to understand all the words.

Not like Sting,

where you can only
understand the last three.

(SINGING GIBBERISH)

<i>...brand-new day</i>

So, did you break up with Lauren?

No, I didn't.
As a matter of fact,

she's coming over
for dinner tonight.

Say what?

Well, Lauren,
it's a real pleasure

having you here for dinner.

Of course, I'm sure
this isn't as exciting

as your usual cuisine.

You know, all that caviar
with the little silver spoons.

Actually, Mrs. Griffin,

caviar spoons
are carved from bone.

They don't use metal
because it reacts chemically

with the fish eggs
and changes their taste.

Oh, well,
that's fascinating.

You could've just
complimented the free food,

but one-upping me
is another way to go.

-So, you know, guys...
-Bitch.

Lauren just finished
a fascinating

doctoral thesis on suborbital
propulsion mechanisms

that NASA is using for the next generation
of space shuttles.

(BOTH GASPING)

-Ahh...
-Ahh...

So, Lauren, um, whenever
I'm watching your show,

you give me wood.

Where do we go from here?

Well, I could sign
a picture for you.

(SIGHS) Yeah, sure.

That'd be fine. Thank you.

So, Lauren, do you and Paris Hilton

and Lindsay Lohan all hang out
and go drunk driving together?

I heard that Lindsay Lohan
wasn't driving that night.

She was taking the rap
for a friend.

-Road hog!
-(SIREN WAILING)

Oh, no! I already have two strikes!

I'll take the wheel,
Mr. Magoo.

I'm too old
to go to prison.

They'll rape me!

And I'll never see 'em coming,
no, I won't.

Well, uh, Lauren and I

had a great time today
at the art museum.

There was a special exhibition
of rare Monet paintings and...

-Manet, honey.
-What?

It was actually the Manet exhibit.

Not Monet, but no big deal.

People make that mistake all the time.

Oh, right.

You know, I don't mean to be rude,

but do you have a more
comfortable chair?

This one's really hurting my back.

(GASPS)
Oh, my God, Quagmire!

You come out
from under there.

I'm sorry, everybody.

I just wanted
to meet her so bad.

I can't do anything right.

I'll go have a talk with him.

Hey, buddy.
Where are all your pals?

Playing baseball.

Well, why aren't you
playing with them?

'Cause I don't have a glove.

Oh, yeah?

Gee! Just for me?
No foolin'?

Nah, just kidding.
It's mine.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

Oh, sweetie, dinner with your family

was so much fun tonight.

Yeah, I think they really liked you.

(GIGGLES) It was so cute

when you thought Manet was Monet.

Yeah. Yeah, that was--
That was... That was a hoot.

Oh, hey, how are you liking that

unabridged history
of Second World War

naval tactics in the Pacific theater?

Oh, it's really, um, interesting.

I'm-- I'm at the part
where they detail

the account of Admiral Halsey's
victory at Midway.

-You mean Admiral Spruance, sweetie.
-Huh?

Well, Halsey was hospitalized
with psoriasis

at the outset of the battle,
so Spruance,

who, prior to June of 1941,
was primarily a desk admiral,

was charged with leading
the naval fleet at Midway against Japan.

A victory which surprised
even his peers and, in fact,

was the turning point for
the American naval forces in the Pacific.

No, yeah, that's...
That's the part I'm at.

Oh, my God,
you're so cute

when you don't know
what you're talking about.

Now wait a minute.
What the hell does that mean?

Are you saying I'm not smart?

You don't have to be.
You're adorable.

Like those calendars
that have monkeys in clothes.

Look, why don't
we talk about this in the morning.

I want to finish that book.

Sweetie, since when
do you wear reading glasses?

What, these?
I've had these forever.

-Honey, those aren't real.
-Sure they are.

No, they're not.

I can see the little
Austin Powers logo on the side.

What are you talking about?
These are my glasses.

(AMUSING MUSIC PLAYING)

AUSTIN POWERS: <i>Yeah, baby!</i>

All right, I can't do this!

-Can't do what?
-I can't date someone

who's smarter than I am.
I feel like Jillian.

Oh...

What? (STUTTERING) What is that?

I think I get it.

This isn't about me
being smarter than you.

This is about you still
being in love with Jillian.

-How do you know that?
-Because I'm smarter than you, Brian.

Oh, my God!

You're right.

You know, I thought I was over her, but...

I'm not.

Somewhere along the line,

she must've gotten
under my skin.

I'm in love with her.

How could I have been so "my-o-pic"?

"My-ah-pic."

Thank you, Lauren.

My God, Lauren,
what am I going do?

I'm still in love with Jillian.

Well, there's only one
thing you can do, Brian.

Tell her how you feel.

What's the use?
It's over.

She's moved on.

Well, who knows?

Women are complex creatures,
Brian.

Maybe she just needs
to be reminded

how much she misses you.

And I know exactly
how to do that, Brian.

She needs to see you on the arm

of a beautiful woman.

What is this going to do?

It's going to make her jealous.

You out on the town
with a hot date.

How are you a hot date?

Whoa! You're angry at her, not me.

No wonder you're alone.

This isn't working at all.

-She doesn't even know we're here.
-Oh, she will, Brian.

And she's going to be upset that your
date is so into you.

Okay, ready? I've been reading up
on things that sound sexy.

Oh, Brian, I can't wait
till after dinner,

'cause then we'll go home,
and you can watch me

-have my period.
-What the hell's wrong with you?

-That's not sexy.
-Hey, Brian.

I just noticed you over here.

Hi, I'm Jillian.

-Desiree.
-Charmed.

Well, I wish we could stay,

but we have quite
an exciting evening planned.

Oh, oh, yeah, right.

We're really hitting the town.

Yes, we're going
douche the night away.

Oh. Well, have fun.

You two are a really cute couple.

Hey, Desiree.

Oh. Hey, Lee.

Brian, this is Lee.

Lee, this is Brian.

I know Lee from... Starbucks.

MAN: Hey, is that Desiree?

That's it. I mean...

I don't know
what else I can do.

The wedding's tomorrow,

and she hasn't shown
any signs of leaving Derek.

I've completely
run out of options.

Not quite, Brian.
There's still one thing you can do.

What's that?

Go for broke.

Just throw all your cards
on the table at once.

Show her that you love her

in a way she can't possibly ignore.

-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-Hello?

Oh, hey, Lee!

No, it's not a bad time.

Yeah, I still have those boots.

Well, maybe I'll wear 'em
and maybe I won't.

(ORGAN PLAYING)

And now, Jillian,
do you take Derek...

Wait!

Jillian, I'm in love with you.

I want you--
No, I need you...

with all my heart and soul.

And my only regret is that

I didn't realize it
when we were together.

Those were the happiest
days of my life,

and I want more of those days.

Please, Jillian...
I love you.

Will you please take me back?

Brian... no.

You had your chance.

I mean, I thought
you were my soul train,

but you didn't want me.

-Soul mate.
-Soul food.

I'm sorry,

but I'm in love
with Derek now.

I see.

And you really feel that way?

Yeah. I mean,
he's everything I have,

especially since my mom
died of cancer.

(PETER LAUGHS)

All right, party people,
please clear the dance floor

I still feel like crap, though.

Well, look at it this way.
You may have lost Jillian,

but you can at least
be happy that she's happy.

Plus, you can always call Lauren.

-No, I can't.
-Why not?

She's never going
to speak to me again.

I gave her worms.

Hi, it's me, Peter, your TV cartoon pal.

You know, Lois has been bitching lately
that I watch too much TV

and don't read enough books.

So, I went to the library
and picked up three books

by the greatest author
of the last thousand years:

Stephen King.

And tonight, I'd like
to share them with you.

We begin with a little tale
called <i>"Stand By Me,"</i>

about four young boys
who went looking for a dead body

and instead found themselves.

And also a dead body.

<i>The year was 1955.</i>

<i>And the voice in my head</i>
<i>was that of Richard Dreyfuss.</i>

RICHARD DREYFUSS: <i>I never had friends</i>
<i>like the ones I had when I was 12.</i>

<i>There was me, Petey LeChance...</i>

Anyone else fed up with this
oversaturation of media?

Three channels and still nothing on.

DREYFUSS: <i>Then there was Joey Duchamps.</i>

<i>The voice in his head was Roy Scheider.</i>

ROY SCHEIDER: <i>How are you, Richard?</i>

DREYFUSS: <i>Fine, Roy, how are you?</i>

SCHEIDER: <i>Good, good.</i>

<i>We should grab a drink sometime</i>
<i>and catch up,</i>

<i>maybe reminisce about </i>Jaws.

DREYFUSS: <i>Great, you should</i>
<i>give me</i><i>a call sometime.</i>

<i>My number's 555...</i>

SCHEIDER: <i>Wait, wait. What? 555?</i>
DREYFUSS: <i>Uh, yeah.</i>

SCHEIDER: <i>You know what, Richard,</i>

<i>if you don't want to have drinks,</i>
<i>just say so.</i>

<i>You don't have to be a dick about it.</i>

Oh, please, make the voices stop!

DREYFUSS: <i>And then</i>
<i>there was</i><i>Quag Chambers.</i>

<i>He was the leader of our gang.</i>

<i>He had sex when he was five</i>

<i>and committed his first rape</i>
<i>when he was ten.</i>

<i>Rape, of course, being legal in the '50s.</i>

(CHUCKLES) Beat those cards, fellas!

(LAUGHS)

Giggity, giggity, '50s giggity.

Hey, you guys...

DREYFUSS: <i>Finally, there was Cleve Brown,</i>
<i>my pudgy, Black friend.</i>

<i>I can still see him now,</i>
<i>all pudgy and Black.</i>

Cleve, please,
we're busy looking at <i>Playboy.</i>

Look at the way these women
starve themselves.

This one can't be more than 180 pounds.

This is way better than <i>Playboy.</i>

Do you guys want to see a dead body?

Cleve, it's 1955.

Please reenter the clubhouse

in a more stereotypically
animated fashion.

Lord Almighty, I done seen me
a dead body down by the lake!

Sure 'nough,
I thought I'd go deaf and dumb

when I saw me that dead bod...

Cleve, calm down!
You're not making any sense!

BUDDY HOLLY: (SINGING)
<i>Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer</i>

DREYFUSS: <i>Anything was possible</i>
<i>as we set out that day.</i>

<i>Except contracting AIDS,</i>
<i>because AIDS had not yet</i>

<i>been invented by the government</i>
<i>in an effort</i>

<i>to eradicate the homosexual community.</i>

Okay, I got another one.

(SINGING)<i> Show me that smile again</i>

<i>Ooh, show me that smile</i>

<i>Don't waste another minute on your crying</i>

DREYFUSS: <i>We decided to cut through</i>
<i>Old Man Pressman's junkyard,</i>

<i>even though legend had it</i>

<i>that any kid caught</i>
<i>scaling the fence ran the risk</i>

<i>of being attacked by</i>
<i>the old man's dog,</i>

<i>who would charge to the cry</i>
<i>of</i><i>"Chopper, sic balls."</i>

I got a bad feeling about this.

Hey! What are you kids doing?

Oh, no, it's him!

That's right. I'm Old Man Pressman.
I own the junkyard.

I'm cranky 'cause all my stuff is junk.
Why can't I have nice things?

Chopper, sic 'em! Sic 'em, boy!

-(BARKING)
-(ALL SCREAMING)

DREYFUSS: <i>Now, he said, "Sic 'em, boy,"</i>
<i>but what I heard was,</i>

<i>"Chopper, talk to</i><i>disfigured</i>
<i>World War II veterans</i>

<i>"who aren't as bitter as they should be."</i>

Glad I could do my part.

I think you may have done too much.

Thanks for going all the way back
to the junkyard to get me this wheelchair.

Boy, was Old Man Pressman angry.

Ooh!

Well, there it is.

DREYFUSS: <i>None of us could breathe.</i>

<i>The twisted and mangled body</i>
<i>we had come to see</i>

<i>was far more disgusting</i>
<i>than any of us</i>

<i>could ever have imagined.</i>

Kiss my grits, you cheap dime store hood.

This ain't over, LeChance.

I mean, you have a gun

I'll get a gun and come
to your house and kill you.

Oh.

Yeah, I guess you could do that, huh?

I mean, we live in the same town.

And I can't just be on my guard
for the rest of my life.

Boy, that is a major hole in this story.
Okay, take the body.

DREYFUSS: <i>We never forgot</i>

<i>without the use of his legs,</i>

<i>Cleve grew up and went on</i>
<i>to marry Rebecca Romjin.</i>

<i>Actually, I'm not even joking about that.</i>

<i>Can you believe that? I swear to God.</i>
<i>Look it up on the Internet.</i>

<i>Doesn't that piss you off?</i>

Um, Paul, quick question,

But I couldn't help but notice the new
<i>Snuggly Jeff </i>manuscript in your bag,

and I was wondering if I could read it,
then kill you if I hate it?

Well, I guess that'd be okay.

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

Can I read it while I touch

something more serious.

Well, you are gonna write Snuggly Jeff

No, no, no. This won't do, Paul.

You can't just have Snuggly Jeff

magically brought back to life
by a child's wish.

-It's insulting to the reader.
-What do you mean?

Well, it's just bad storytelling.

Let's see. How can I explain this to you?

-Did you ever see the movie <i>Contact?</i>
-Yeah.

So, like, they spent a trillion
dollars building this mile-high

space machine and Jake Busey blows it up,
so now, they're all like,

"Oh, no. We can't use the space machine."

But then this other guy's like,
"Hey, it just so happens,

"I built another identical
trillion-dollar space machine

"at my own expense
on the other side of the world."

And we're supposed to believe
no one noticed that?

Well, I stood up in the theater,
and I said,

"No! You can't go into space
because the machine

"already got blown up
by Jake cock-a-doody Busey!"

Can I go now?

Oh, no, Paul. I'm not stupid.

If I let you go, you'll just
run straight to the police

and tell them I kidnapped you
and held you hostage

and fondled you while you were asleep.

No, I won't... Wait. What?

You'll tell them that

-Wait, what are you...

Wait, hey! (BLOWING AIR)
Hey get out of here!

Hey, uh... (SCREAMING)

(CRYING) He was my neighbor
and he violated me!

Now I'll never end up in a fancy pie!

What do you say, Joe,
you want your past life read?

-It'll be fun.
-Sure, why not.

Okay, dear, close your eyes
and clear your mind.

Okay, I'm seeing something...

<i>Joe, you were an octopus.</i>

Yes! Yes! this is so awesome!

Damn it!

Oh, that's so cool, that's so cool.
Do me next.

I'm getting something.
I see you in London.

I think it's the 1800's.

Oh, my, you were Jack the Ripper!

(FOOTSTEPS)

Giggity.

-What about Peter?
-Yeah, Peter next.

Oh, I don't think there's anything
in the black bag for me.

You're wrong, Peter. Let us begin.

Oh my, you were a very important man.

You were Griffin Peterson.

The founder of the city of Quahog.

Now wait a second, Cool Runnings.

We learned in school that
Miles "Chatterbox" Musket

founded Quahog after
he was saved by the Magic Clam.

No, that is a myth.

Peter, you were the founder of Quahog.

I see... I see England a long time ago.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>It is a crisp,</i>
<i>clear spring morning,</i>

<i>and Griffin Peterson is riding</i>
<i>to the home of his beloved.</i>

Peterson, what are you doing here?

Shouldn't you be down at your job

making oblong bricks
out of manure and straw?

No, we're off. It's Martin Luther Day.

-(CHUCKLES)
-Yes, that's a very smart joke.

Isn't that right, comedy professors?

-Ah. Well done.
-Indeed.

-Now what do you want?
-I want to marry your daughter,

and I'm here to ask for your blessing.

What could you possibly have
to offer my daughter?

Well, I'm one of the few
guys in this town

who isn't dying a slow,
painful diarrhea death.

All right, come on in.

Knock, knock. Lady Redbush?

Griffin! It's so good to see you.

I'm so horny. Kiss my hand.

What are you doing here?

I was just walking off
the rotted goose anus

I had for breakfast,
and I thought I'd come by

and ask you a little question.

What's that?

-Will you marry me?
-(GASPS)

Oh, my God, yes! Yes, I will, Griffin.

Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

-Did you do it?
-I did it.

(CHEERING)

MADAME CLAUDE:
<i>But in another part</i><i>of London,</i>

<i>there was a man who was not</i>
<i>in such good spirits.</i>

<i>The King of England... Stewart the T'ird.</i>

Oh, I'm so bored.
I wish to be entertained.

Where's my troupe of actors?

(PLAYING FANFARE)

Presenting the cast
of <i>How I Met Your Mother.</i>

You told her I told you I kissed her?

Dude, you broke the bro code.

-That's not against the bro code.
-Yes, it is. Article 15-B.

That's the heart of the bro code, man.

Well, you're right.
I guess I did break the bro code.

Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What is this? Are these jokes?

Do people in other castles
think this is funny?

Well, yeah, we get a pretty sizable
chunk of princes, 18 to 34.

I think I'd like to delete
this from my TiVo.

Are you sure you want
to delete this program?

Yes.

Bring me my mid-season
replacement fool.

-Hi there.
-I want to hear some jokes, fool.

Well, you know, I don't really tell jokes.

I like to tell stories from my life

and let the humor just flow organically
from everyday situations.

(CLEARING THROAT)

Yeah, my Aunt Frida was a real card.

She always had the most
wonderful spirit.

Even when her mind started to go.

I remember once she wrote
a letter to my Uncle Tom

from whom she'd been
divorced for several years.

And in the letter she
misspelled his name T-O-M-M.

And I said, "Frida, you've spelled
Tom's name wrong.

"You need to take out
one of the M's."

And she said, "Which one?"

You know, you're going to be
(BLEEP) dead in five seconds

if Aunt Frida doesn't throw
a pie at somebody.

I mean, part of that is you sort
of have to know my family...

Make me laugh!

Hey, look, keys.

(LAUGHING)

That's so satirical.
What social commentary.

Well, now I'm in a wonderful humor.
I wish to go for a walk into town.

Hey, coachman, let's drive
on the left side of the road

and see if that catches on.

Good Lord! Who is that?

That's Lady Redbush

and her husband-to-be, Griffin Peterson.

That piece of ass is marrying
that tall glass of poop juice?

Well, not if I have
anything to say about it.

A woman of that caliber
should be married to a king.

Well, what are you
going to do about him?

I'm the king, jester.

I'm going to have him exiled
to the farthest corner of the world.

And then she'll be all mine.

Why is he such a jerk to everybody?

Because he has a very, very small penis.

I've seen it actually, and it's like,

you don't even want
to make fun of it, you know.

It's just medically fascinating.

I kind of want to see it.

Yeah, it's like that
one grape in the bunch

that never got to be a grape.

(CHURCH BELL RINGING)

I wonder what's keeping Griffin?

Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, sweetie.

Remember he's tubby.
It takes him a while to move around.

I hope he didn't get diarrhea and die.

Can I feel those boobs?

No, Daddy! What, are you sick?

Hey, it's a different time.

What a wonderfully exciting day.

I'm young, I'm all dressed up

and I'm on my way to marry
the woman I love.

And there's 290 years
separating me

from the films of Kevin Smith.

KING STEWART: Hey, Peterson.

-Who are you?
-I'm King Stewart.

Don't you recognize me from the coins?

Oh, yeah, the ones with your profile.

You know, you look
really weird from the side.

Well, that's something we didn't really
think out too well when we started.

But never mind that!
You're going into exile, Peterson.

I'm shipping you out
on the first boat to the New World.

But I'm supposed to get married today.

Oh, yeah? Where you going
for your honeymoon?

-That medium-sized hill.
-Wrong. Seize him.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>And King Stewart's</i>
<i>cruelty</i><i>was only just beginning.</i>

Maybe he changed his mind.

Maybe he's not coming.

Oh, come on, now.

There, feel better after I just said that?

-Give me one little touch.
-No!

I hate this! I... I... I hate my life!

-(GASPS) The King!
-The King is here!

(MONTY PYTHON-STYLE SHREWISH VOICE)
I didn't vote for him.

Your Majesty, this is a real honor.

Carter Redbush. Very glad to meet you.

(AS PAUL LYNDE) Hello. Harry McAfee.

As a citizen, I'm proud
to have you reign over me

and the McAfee Fertilizer Company.

Lady Redbush, I wish
I was here on a happier errand,

but I'm afraid I must inform you
that Griffin Peterson is dead.

(GASPS) What?

Now that some time has passed,
do you want to go out?

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>With Griffin Peterson</i>
<i>exiled to the New World</i>

<i>and Lady Redbush</i>
<i>believing he was dead,</i>

<i>King Stewart was now free to marry her.</i>

The bride and groom
have written their own vows.

Our love is like two figs
hanging from a fig tree,

cradled by Cupid's own hand.

You and I are like...

Oh, I'm sorry. Is my wedding
interrupting your promotion?

We're right in the middle
of our show, okay?

Right now.
You have a time slot. Go there.

Maybe finish this candy bar
before you open another one.

Well, at least it wasn't
one of those promos

where they have the whole cast
shoving each other playfully

like they're all good pals.

Oh, look, there we go.

Oh, look at them jostling
each other around.

Oh, they give each other a hard time,
but they're friends.

-Is that a real show?
-No, it's just...

No, somebody's making a joke. Forget it.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Griffin Peterson</i><i>and the other exiles</i>

<i>pass the time on the ship</i>
<i>to the New World.</i>

Aw, crap, a splinter.

Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.

So what'd you do to get exiled?

I got caught pleasuring myself

to a painstakingly-etched
engraving of <i>"The Wife of Bath."</i>

What'd you do?

I slept with an underage virgin
to cure my puff penis.

Hey, fellas, you want to join me
in a game of mumble peg?

-Oh, no thanks.
-Fine. I'll play by myself.

(MUMBLING)

One-nothing.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>Eventually,</i>
<i>after</i><i>many months at sea,</i>

<i>Griffin Peterson and his shipmates</i>
<i>finally reached the New World.</i>

I declare this land Quahog.

This place is nothing but a wilderness.
What are we going to do?

We're going to build a new settlement.

We'll have a happy new life
and we'll have equal rights for all.

Except blacks, Asians, Hispanics,
Jews, gays, women, Muslims...

Um, everybody who's not a white man.

And I mean, white-white,
so no Italians, no Polish...

Just people from Ireland,
England, and Scotland.

But only certain parts
of Scotland and Ireland.

Just full-blooded whites.

No, you know what? Not even whites.
Nobody gets any rights.

Ah, America.

How's your stewed fox quail, my dear?

Oh, it's quite good.
I'm also enjoying the turtled hen.

Isn't the turtled hen good?

So, listen. You and I need
to have a conversation

about you not bearing me a son.

Well, my lord, we've discussed this.

We have to have sex in order
for me to bear you a son.

Oh, I know. I've just been so tired
and I've had so much work,

and I think I wanted to the other day,
but I couldn't find you, so...

You know, it's like both of us
and our schedules, you know?

Well, why don't we do it tonight?

Maybe. Tonight might work. Yeah...

Oh, no! I got that thing in the morning.

Oh, how about tomorrow at 4:00?

You know I'm with my mother
tomorrow at 4:00.

Oh, darn it. I'm going to be
so horny tomorrow at 4:00.

You know, I got to say,
I'm a little mad at you

for not being more available.

Well, we can have sex
right now on the table.

Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

We eat here.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>Griffin Peterson</i>
<i>and the other</i><i>colonists</i>

<i>worked day and night</i>

<i>to build their new settlement</i>
<i>until finally, after much hard work,</i>

<i>the colony of Quahog was complete.</i>

<i>It didn't take long before Quahog</i>

<i>was a thriving New World settlement,</i>
<i>bustling with life.</i>

Boy, everything's shaping up real nice.

Yeah, and we finally finished
the town abortion clinic.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>Time had helped</i>
<i>Griffin</i><i>forget Lady Redbush</i>

<i>and soon he found himself</i>
<i>a hearty new wife.</i>

Boy, that was fantastic.

You must have had a lot of practice.

No, not really.
I've been saving myself for marriage.

(SIGHS)

We should probably
open up some windows.

I don't know what to do, Jester.

I can't be married to the king anymore.

My heart still belongs
to Griffin Peterson.

-But he's dead.
-(SIGHS)

-No, he's not.
-What?

I was ordered to keep silent by the king
under threat of execution,

but you're going to see this anyway.

(GASPS) Oh, my God!

He's alive!
Jester, I've got to get to him.

I'll help you,
but only if I can go with you.

If I stay here, the king will execute me
for telling you all this.

Well, okay,
but how are we going to get there?

We'll hitch a ride on one
of the slave ships tomorrow night.

After an all new <i>Shovin' Buddies.</i>

Followed by an all new
<i>Slowly Rotating Black Man.</i>

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>And so,</i>
<i>Lady Redbush sailed off</i>

<i>to the New World to find her beloved.</i>

<i>And the timing was good because</i>
<i>his new wife</i><i>was a pain in him ass.</i>

And then I finished scrubbing the kettle,

but then I saw that I'd missed
a spot and, oh, I was so worried

that the whole thing wasn't
clean enough, so I went back

and started washing it again
and sure enough,

I'd missed another spot.

And there was a clump
of cornmeal under the rim

-from when I made breakfast.
-Shut up, Meg! I prithee, shut up!

Griffin!

Lady Redbush.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>And so,</i>
<i>Griffin Peterson</i><i>and Lady Redbush</i>

<i>were happily reunited.</i>

<i>Of course, Griffin had to go through</i>

<i>the complex, extensive</i>
<i>divorce procedure</i>

<i>required by 18th century society.</i>

Gone? What do you mean, she's gone?

Sire, Lady Redbush has been
gone these six months.

-Six months?
-Yes.

Forgive me, sire, but how
could you not be aware of this?

Don't you share a bedchamber with her?

Well, I mean, sometimes.
I mean, we sleep...

We... We... We go to different...

Uh, we got to bed at different times.

We've both been so busy.
It's been ridiculous.

I thought she was taking
a class or something.

Oh, man, that sucks
because I'm so horny!

Damn it! Oh, I wanted
to do sex to her tonight.

Well, then, I guess
we've got to go get her.

Yeah, all right.

MADAME CLAUDE: <i>Months rolled by</i>
<i>and Griffin and Lady Redbush</i>

<i>continued to flourish happily</i>
<i>in the colony of Quahog,</i>

<i>completely unaware that</i>
<i>King Stewart was on the march.</i>

(SINGING)
<i>There was a peaceful town called Quahog</i>

<i>Where people lived in harmony</i>

<i>They never had no kind of trouble</i>

<i>There was no hint of misery</i>

<i>Then all at once the trouble started</i>

<i>A pack of murderers and thieves</i>

<i>Like swarms of locusts they descended</i>

<i>Their aim to make the town folk flee</i>

They've got to be here somewhere.

Where's my first lieutenant?

Here I am, sir. Yes, sir. Right, indeed.

Here, indeed. Yes, I am, sir.

I want you to turn this
settlement upside down

until you find Lady Redbush
and Griffin Peterson.

That fat bastard thinks

he can steal my bride
and get away with it?

I wouldn't bet a corn
farthing on him escaping.

No, I wouldn't. Not a corn
farthing would I bet. No, sir.

What's wrong with you?

Little wrong in the head, I am,
from eating some bad sausages.

Yes, sir, bad sausages did I eat,
indeed, sir.

Yes, I did. Some bad sausages, ate I.

Oh, Griffin, this time together
has been the happiest of my life.

Me, too, Lady Redbush.

All those months I was without you,

I never stopped seeing your face
in the back of my wife's head.

And all those months
I was sailing for the New World,

I saw your face in
every slave's stomach.

Tell me we'll be together forever.

We will.

(BOTH GASP)

I found 'em, Your Majesty.
Indeed, yes I did.

Found 'em did I.
Indeed, yes, sir, I did.

Yeah, okay, okay, whatever.
All right, Peterson,

two things are gonna happen here.

I'm gonna take my wife back
and then I'm gonna kill you.

All right, all right, Mr. King, sir.

You win. I'm sorry, Lady Redbush,
but he is your husband.

Let me just, uh, walk over here
and get your things for you.

Nyah-ha! All right, Your Majesty.

If you want to leave with
your pal in one piece,

I suggest you throw
down your weapons.

-Aah!
-Go ahead and kill him, Griffin.

You kill him and I'll kill her.

Go ahead. You kill her, I'll kill him.

Go ahead. You kill him, I'll kill her.

Knock yourself out.
You kill her, I'll kill him.

(LAUGHS) This is me laughing.

You kill him, I'll kill her.

(LAUGHS) This is me before
Ultra Slim-Fast.

You kill her, I'll kill him.

Wait, wait! There's got to be
a better way to settle this.

-Talent show?
-Talent show.

Hear ye, hear ye.

This talent competition will
decide rightful possession

of the good Lady Redbush and
control of the Colony of Quahog.

We first present King Stewart of England

with some observational humor.

Hi, there, everybody.

You know,
my Aunt Frida was a real card.

She always had the most
wonderful spirit...

Even when her mind started to go.

What the (BLEEP)

I remember once she wrote
a letter to my Uncle Tom

from whom she'd been
divorced for several years.

And in the letter,
she misspelled his name T-O-M-M.

This is my bit.
These are all my bits.

-Shh. This is funny.
-Unbelievable.

And I said,
"Frida, you've spelled Tom's name wrong.

"You need to take out one of the M's."

And she said, "Which one?"

Oh, Griffin, I love you.

Let's grow old into our 30s together.

I want to have a baby with you.

Step right up. Step right up.
You won't believe your eyes.

Step right up and see
the amazing half man, half clam.

What a rip-off. It's just Kim Cattrall
sitting Indian style.

Boy, they've got some very unusual prizes
at the carnival this year.

A winner! Congratulations, son.
You've won a genuine, live homosexual.

Where are we going? Wait! Don't tell me!

-Oh, boy! Mom, can I keep him?
-Well, it's a big responsibility, Chris.

That means you'll have to
clean up after him and feed him.

-What do you eat?
-Attention.

-I like your hair.
-Still hungry.

-You have a beautiful speaking voice.
-I'm full.

Let's see, I guess 185 pounds.

Wrong. I'm 95% helium.

-Brian, look what I won.
-Wow, what'd you win that for?

For having the best pig
in the competition.

-Wait, you bred a pig?
-Sure did.

Most genetically perfect one
in the contest.

Oink.

Oh, my God!

-Yes. He's something, isn't he?
-Are those fists?

Damn right. Show him, pig.

How the hell did you do this?

I'll let you in on a little secret, Brian.

I didn't do it. I got it from a farm.

What the hell kind of farm
breeds pigs like this?

Would you like to see it for yourself,
Brian?

-Yeah, I would.
-Good.

Because it's gonna blow your mind like
the stereopticon did to Americans in 1910.

Hey, I'm in New York City! No, I'm not.
Yes, I am. No, I'm not. Yes, I am!

What's going on here?

(CLANKING)

-This is it, Brian.
-What's that?

It's how I got the pig.

You ever heard of
the Multiverse Theory, Brian?

Of course I have,
but I'm wondering if you have.

Oh, my God! So transparent.

Well, the theory states that there are
an infinite number of universes

coexisting with ours
on parallel dimensional planes.

-Dimensional planes, right.
-Oh, don't do that.

Don't repeat the last two words

like you already kind of knew
what I was talking about.

You have no idea what I'm talking about.

Now, in each of these alternate universes,
the reality is different than our own.

Sometimes only slightly,
sometimes quite radically.

The point is
every possible eventuality exists.

And that's where you got the pig,
in a parallel universe.

Prepare yourself, Brian,
and I'll show you.

(BEEPING)

(WHIRRING)

BRIAN: Where are we?
STEWIE: This is Quahog, Brian.

Same year, same time.

But in this universe,
Christianity never existed.

Which means the Dark Ages
of scientific repression never occurred

and thus, humanity is
1,000 years more advanced.

-Ergo, muscular, genetically perfect pigs.
-Hey, look. There's Quagmire.

Thanks, honey. Say hi to your husband.

(CHIMING)

Well, I got AIDS again.
Better take my NyQuil Cold, Flu and AIDS.

All gone.

-What time do you suppose it is, Brian?
-I don't know. About 3:30.

Watch the sidewalk.

My God! Is that Meg?

36-D, Brian.

And you know what's amazing?

In this universe,
she's still one of the ugly ones.

If you saw Lois, you'd have to
put your penis in a wheelchair.

Come on. I'll show you around.

-Hey, is there a bathroom around here?
-You need to go pee or poop?

-Poop.
-One poop removal.

(POPPING)

-Wow, did I just go poop?
-You sure did. All digital.

-Where does it go?
-It gets beamed to another dimension.

Let me ask you this.

What about all the Renaissance art
that Christianity inspired?

That was my first question, too. Come on.
Have a look at the Sistine Chapel.

Wow.

Yep. With no Christianity
to inspire Michelangelo,

they gave the job to John Hinckley.

-All right. You ready to go home now?
-Are you kidding? This is amazing.

Can we see more universes?

Hmm. Well, I haven't tried yet,
but I don't see why not.

-Whoa! What's this place?
-Yeah. This universe looks weird.

Yeah, it's cheap and somehow lazy.

ROCK-PETER: Yabba dabba...

-Rock-Peter?
-Yes, Rock-Lois?

That was wonderful rock-sex
we had last rock-night.

Yes. I enjoyed rocking you
up the rock last night.

I know. I'm glad you wore that rock-ring.

But we still always use a rock-phylactic.

I'm ribbeted for your pleasure.

Hey, Brian, want to get the rock
out of here?

Rock, yeah.

Oh, this looks like Spooner St.,
only something's not quite right.

According to the Multiverse Guide,

this is a universe where the United States
never dropped the atomic bomb

on Hiroshima.
So the Japanese just never quit.

(ALL SPEAKING JAPANESE)

(FARTING)

(GIGGLING)

Well, I think I've seen enough.
Let's get back to our universe.

All right. Off we go.

(SIGHING) Home sweet home.

HAPPY LOIS: Peter.
SAD LOIS: Peter.

HAPPY PETER: What?
SAD PETER: What?

HAPPY LOIS: Can you take out the trash?
SAD LOIS: 'Cause it stinks in the kitchen.

-Sure thing, Lois. Delighted to.
-I get tired when I stand.

(GASPING)

What the hell is this?
This isn't our universe.

Apparently, this is a universe
where everyone has two heads.

One happy, one sad.

-Honey, have you seen Stewie?
-I can't find him anywhere.

-I sure have!
-He's over there playing in the corner.

-I want you to know I love you!
-I'm trying to get excited about it.

This is too freaky.
Why didn't that thing take us home?

I don't know! I told you,
it hasn't been fully tested yet.

Well, we can't stay here, that's for sure.

HAPPY REPORTER:<i> And now back</i>
<i>to Channel Five News at Six!</i>

SAD REPORTER:
<i>Quahog's lowest-rated newscast.</i>

<i>-The president's dog just had puppies!</i>
<i>-There was a plane crash.</i>

Stewie, please tell me
you know how to get us home.

Of course I know how to get us home!

What the hell? Stewie, what's going on?

From the look of it,
I'm guessing this is Quahog

but during some sort of ice age.

Well, press the button!
Get us out of here!

-Uh-oh. I can't reach the device.
-What? You're kidding!

Yep, get comfortable.
I think we're gonna be here for a while.

Oh, look.
There's your poop from the other universe.

Stewie, you got to get us out of here.

If we stay in here much longer,
we're either gonna freeze or starve.

I know. But I can't reach the device.
You try. You're closer to it.

Besides, you're stronger than I am.

-Hey, what was that?
-Well, you said I was stronger than you.

And that must have made me happy,
so my tail started wagging.

Looks like it
carved through the ice a bit.

Yeah, it did! Keep going.

Okay, let's see.
You want to go for a walk?

-It's working. Do more!
-You want a treat? You want a treat, boy?

That's good! That's good!
But you really have one, right?

-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-And we're going for that walk?

Oh, yeah, definitely.
And I'll give you a bath!

-No, no, no!
-Sorry, sorry.

I'll let you go for a ride in the car!

-Oh, you better not be lying!
-You want to sleep in the bed with us?

Yes! I never get to!
It must be a special occasion.

-You got it! You're through!
-Yes. All right, what do I do?

-Just press the red button.
-Okay, which one's red?

Press the big button!

This can't be it.
This doesn't look familiar.

You're right, Brian.

Apparently, this is a universe

where everyone has to take a poop
right just now.

(ALL GROANING)

-Okay, Bill, you got those numbers?
-Yeah, yeah.

-Okay, just leave them on my desk.
-Okay, that works out fine for me.

-Where's your desk?
-Doug knows where my desk is.

Craig, are you good with this?

Yeah, that should work out
pretty good for me, too.

-What the hell? What's happened to us?
-I don't know.

But suddenly,
I feel all sweet and warm and fuzzy.

It seems we're in a universe
where everything is drawn by Disney.

Look, there's our house!

(LAUGHING)

Look how gaily we run!

Oh, Stewie and Brian,
you're just in time for pie.

Did somebody say pie?

(SINGING) <i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>

<i>You can ask all the birds in the sky</i>

<i>And they'll tell you real sweet</i>
<i>With a musical tweet</i>

<i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>

<i>-For pie</i>
<i>-For pie</i>

<i>For pie</i>

<i>For pie</i>

<i>For pie</i>

This is wonderful, Brian.
Oh, let's live in this universe.

Gosh, it's pretty intoxicating, isn't it?

I want to hear more music about pie.

(SINGING) <i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>

<i>And it smells a lot better than I</i>

<i>-Everyone in the house</i>
<i>-And this Adam West mouse</i>

<i>-The bees making honey</i>
<i>-This Tom Tucker bunny</i>

<i>We all sing with glee</i>
<i>'Cause we all agree</i>

<i>It's a wonderful, wonderful day for pie</i>

You want a nice, shiny red apple
to put in that pie?

ALL: No!

Brian, we could spend
the rest of our lives here!

-It's perfect!
-Sounds good to me.

Doesn't seem to be
a thing wrong with this place.

Hello, everybody!

ALL: Jew!

(SCREAMING)

(PUNCHING)

Oh, yeah, I forgot.
This is a Disney universe.

Oh, but look how shiny
my buttons are here!

-Just push the...
-Yeah, okay, okay. I'll push the thing.

-Whoa! This is trippy.
-I should say so.

We're in the <i>Robot Chicken</i> universe.

Would you guys move?
You're blocking the TV!

Look! G.I. Joe, Transformers,
ThunderCats, He-Man!

(CHEERING) Those shows existed!

How does it feel to be on a major network
for 30 seconds?

-(BLEEP) you.
-Bye.

My God! This place looks terrible.

It looks like Quahog
was vaporized or something.

It says that in this universe,
Frank Sinatra was never born.

And therefore, he was unable to use
his influence to get Kennedy elected.

So Nixon won the 1960 election

and totally botched
the Cuban missile crisis,

causing World War III.

Wow, so I guess Lee Harvey Oswald
never shot Kennedy?

No. He shot Mayor McCheese.

(SPECTATORS CHEERING)

(GUNSHOT)

(SPECTATORS SCREAMING)

-That joke's not in bad taste, right?
-Oh, who cares? He's a cheeseburger.

-(GROANING) Where are we?
-I don't know.

The device can't make
heads or tails of it.

It's just some sort of weird,
low-resolution, blocky universe.

-Lois, where is my supper?
-Still in the oven!

-Will I have it soon?
-Quite soon!

-Thank you!
-You're welcome!

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

-I'm frightened.
-Let's go.

-Love it.
-Hate it.

-Love it.
-Hate it.

-Brian, this feels weird.
-Hit the button!

Oh, God, what is this?
I feel like I'm on acid or something.

According to the Multiverse Guide,
this is a universe

where everything is depicted as
a <i>Washington Post</i> political cartoon.

Good Lord, I'm naked!

And why am I holding a dinner platter
that says "McCain-Feingold"?

(LAUGHING)

That's pretty good. That's funny.

-You don't get it.
-No, no. I totally get it.

Oh, God! Let's go, quick.
Here comes an overweight cat

with dollar signs for eyes,
and a hat that says "Social Security"

pouring a bucket that says
"Alternative Minimum Tax"

over a sad Statue of Liberty
holding a "Democracy" umbrella.

(LAUGHING)

-Yes! That ought to wake people up!
-Shut the (BLEEP) up.

-Oh, my God! Now we're nowhere!
-Not quite, Brian. This is a universe.

But its only inhabitant is one really
far-away guy who yells compliments.

-I like your shirt!
-Thank you! This was nice.

We did it! We're back!

No. This is the universe
of misleading portraiture.

(GROANING)

Oh, wait! It's not so bad.
There's the compliment guy.

Hello!

Oh, they got both of us!

We're finished.
We're never gonna get home.

We're never gonna see our Peter and Lois
or anyone else we know ever again.

-You got your pal Stewie.
-Great.

Oh, you could learn something
from compliment guy.

And, you know,
it's not as bad as you think.

I may have finally figured this out.

I just need to make
a few more calculations.

(SNIFFING)

Whoa!

Sorry about that.
Bad girl, Holly. No jumpies!

Oh, it's... It's quite all right.

-Wow, okay, this is ridiculous.
-And you go here.

You, you naughty little wire,
you're supposed to be over here.

How did you get over there?

Oh, yeah.

Come on, Holly. Let's go.
This guy's a freak.

And that should do it. Now let's go home.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

I just don't think we should be too hasty.

I mean, we have a unique opportunity
to study alternate universes in depth.

-Brian, give me the damn device! Give it!
-No!

-Give it!
-Knock it off! No! Stop! Stop it!

-Come on, give it! Come on!
-Come on!

What the hell, man? What the hell?
Look what you did!

You better put that thing on a leash, sir,
or I'm gonna have to fine you.

Take your stinking paws off me,
you damn dirty dog!

What the hell were you thinking, Brian?
We're never gonna get home now!

Why the hell would you break
the damn device?

Look, it was an accident, all right?

And besides, look at this place.
It's a world run by dogs.

I mean, I kind of want to explore
this universe.

Oh, you like role reversal? Okay.

Wait. What are you doing?

(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Come on!

-Pick up my poop! Pick up my poop!
-I'm not picking up your poop!

-Hey, you! Pick up that poop.
-You heard him, Brian. Pick up my poop.

Go on. Pick it up. Do it. Pick up my poop!

I need a plastic bag.

Here's a thin napkin.

Okay, I'm a new neighbor and
you're my pet human, Hotchkiss. Got it?

I'm not so crazy about Hotchkiss anymore.

What do you mean?
You came up with Hotchkiss.

I know, but how about Axel,
or Maximillian, or Dex, you know?

It's got to have an "X" in it
because that means I have cool parents

who take me on expensive ski trips
on spring break,

and I get to drink wine with dinner
even though I'm only 14 and...

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, my God! I know that sound!

It means there's a potential intruder
at the front door or one of my pals!

Either way,
I'm really excited and ready for anything!

-Hello!
-Hello. My name is Blake Carrington.

Oh!

-And this is my human, Gabe.
-Oh, no. What?

We just moved in down the street

and thought we'd stop in
and say hi to our new neighbors.

Well, great to meet you.
Come on in. I'm Peter.

This is my family.
My wife, Lois. My son, Chris.

Chris, stop licking yourself
and come up and say hi!

My daughter, Meg. Our puppy, Stewie.

-And this is our human, Brian.
-Nice to meet you.

-Say hi to human Brian, Blake, says Gabe.
-Hi.

Mommy, I want to play
with the new human!

Only if it's okay with Blake.

Yeah, sure. It's fine.
Gabe is great with puppies.

I swear to God, I hope the next universe
we go to is all Koreans.

-I know who you are, Stewie.
-I beg your pardon?

I've perfected multiverse travel as well.

In fact, I've figured out how to navigate
with absolute precision.

Really? I haven't. We've been jumping
randomly from one universe to the next.

-Did you have the "shuffle" button on?
-Oh, my God!

-There you go.
-That's why that little symbol

with the two crossed arrows
is up there in the corner.

-There's your problem.
-Oh, my God! I feel silly.

But I can't do anything about it.
My device has been destroyed.

Well, I've got one of my own.
I can use it to send you back.

Hold on, I'll get it.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, my God! Who is it? I got it!

-Morning, Peter.
-Hey, Joe.

Bonnie and I are having company tonight.

Wondering if I could borrow
some wet food.

Yeah, sure thing. That's Joe.
He's our local human catcher.

So, don't misbehave or the human catcher
will come after you, Gabe.

My name's not Gabe!

(SCREAMING)

You're in big trouble, you little crap!

You shouldn't have done that,
little fellow.

You just earned yourself
a trip to the pound!

Who the hell do you think you are?
Brian! Brian, do something.

Look, I'm sorry about this.
Let me just pay the fine or whatever

and I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.

-You can pick him up tomorrow.
-Oh, okay.

Just bring a trash bag.

What did he mean by that?

Any human that bites a dog
gets euthanized. You know that.

No. He doesn't. He's from another universe
where dogs are subservient to humans.

-Oh, you mean like that time we...
-Yeah.

-When we bounced around between...
-Yeah.

-And you couldn't figure out how to...
-Yes!

They're gonna kill him!
We got to get him out of there!

It's a tough world here. You hear about it
every night on the dog news.

Coming up. That bush in the park
is my bush! It's my bush!

(SNORING)

Look, there he is!

Oh, thank God, I'm saved!

Come on. Let's get out of here.

All right. The two of you stand over there
and I'll send you back where you belong.

Gosh, Brian! I sure hope this next leap
will be the leap home.

Wait! Take me with you.

What do you mean?
You can't go back to our universe.

Come on, a place where humans
are in charge? I can't pass that up.

Hey! Get away from there!

(GRUNTING)

-Well, this looks like home.
-Is there any way we can be sure?

Hmm.

Mom, have you seen my Trapper Keeper?

(FARTING)

(PETER LAUGHING)

BOTH: Yeah, we're home!

(LAUGHING)

Well, now what do we do about this guy?
We got two Brians in our universe now.

Don't worry.
I don't plan to stay in Quahog.

I'm gonna go out into the world
and see what I can make of myself.

I can be somebody here.

And it should be easy for you
because, I mean, what luck, you're white!

You have no idea how big that is here.

Goodbye, Stewie. Goodbye, Brian.
Maybe our paths will cross again someday.

(SIGHING) Look at him go.

Free in a world of his own kind where
he can finally reach the full potential...

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Oh, my God! He got hit by a car!

Hey, Quagmire. What you got there?

It's the new <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
Swimsuit Issue. Check it out.

Those swimsuit issues don't excite me
like they used to.

I've been spoiled by Internet porn.

-It's true.
-Totally.

-What do you mean, "Internet porn"?
-You don't know about Internet porn?

Don't know what?
I'm not really a computer guy.

Quagmire, I would think you, of all
people, would know about Internet porn.

They've got, like, thousands,
literally millions of naked pictures

on the Internet.

-What?
-And videos. Thousands of them.

-You guys are messing with me.
-Quagmire, you don't use the Internet?

You mean that crappy dial-up thing
that's a pain in the ass?

No, I don't use the damn Internet.
I thought that was for nerds.

Why didn't you guys tell me?

Oh, yeah. You can even see Tonya
Harding's honeymoon video on there.

I mean, it's gross,
but it's, like, famous gross.

You know, these women don't compare

to the old swimsuit issues
with Kathy Ireland.

Yeah, she had it going on.

You know, Horace still has one of those
old beer promotion cutouts of her

from, like, 1994, in the back room.
Don't you, Horace?

You mean this thing?
I was about to throw it out.

If anyone wants it, it's theirs.

I'm taking you home with me.

Hey, Dad.
Where are you going with that cutout?

Oh, hey, kids. This is Kathy.

We're designing
lifestyle products together.

It's completely legitimate,
but don't tell your mother.

I had a great time today at the museum.
You were the most beautiful woman there.

You know, Lois won't be home
from groceries for a while.

I have an idea.

Knock, knock. Anyone in the bathroom?

(SCREAMING)

I love the time we've spent together,
you know that?

Hey, Kathy, guess what? I'm out.

Under the table right now. I'm out.

-Peter?
-Oh, no.

What the hell is going on?
I sent you to pick up dinner an hour ago.

What are you doing with that cutout?

You know what, Lois?
I'm glad you found out.

I can't carry on the charade anymore.
I have an announcement to make.

No, no. I'll do it. I'll do it. I know
I've been able to keep this a secret.

But Kathy and I are not actually working
on a project together.

We're in love.

-You're an idiot.
-My lawyer will call your lawyer.

Oh, this is the stupidest thing he's done
since he got in a turf war with that cat.

(BOTH SNARLING)

(CAT HISSING)

MAN: Hey, shut up!

(PETER AND CAT HISSING)

Now, kids, you don't have to call her
Mom right away,

but I do want you guys to get along.

Just give her a chance.
I think you'll like her.

Maybe she'll let us do things
that Lois won't let us do.

Yeah. Hey, Mom,
can I pull my pants down?

If she doesn't answer, does that mean yes?

That's what I've been going with.

(CHEERING)

I want to get in on that.

Mine's better. Mine's better.
Mine's better!

Oh, hello, Lois.

I would have thought you'd have moved in
with your mother by now.

No, Peter. I'm just pretty much
letting this run its course.

Well, I'm sorry you're handling this
so poorly, but have you seen Kathy?

We were gonna go get
her passport renewed.

Oh, Chris took her into his room
about 10 minutes ago.

What? That whore!

She's betrayed me worse than
Lady Macbeth betrayed Duncan.

(ROARING)

I... I don't know Shakespeare very well.

Kathy! Kathy!

There you are.
Oh, don't give me that look.

You don't think I know where you've been?

How dare you make a fool of me?
Did you have sex with that fat kid?

Did you? Answer me!
Oh, my God. Look what you made me do.

(CRYING) Why did you have
to provoke me? Why did you...

Quagmire? There you are.
Nobody's seen you in days.

Hey, Peter. I've just been

checking out some of that Internet porn.

-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

I'm just gonna go and check my mail
over there.

-You been lifting weights?
-No.

No, I don't... I don't think... No.

I'm... I'm sorry, Peter. I...
I got to... I got to get back.

I'm sorry, Lois. I was a fool.
I'm done with Kathy.

Can you ever forgive me?

(CRYING)

Peter, settle down. Yes, I forgive you.

Just as long as you're done
with that stupid cutout.

I just want you to know that every time
I was with her, I was thinking of you.

Peter, stop. Come on. I'm not in the mood.

(LAUGHING)

-Oh, Peter.
-Oh, Lois, I missed you.

PETER: You and your wonderful smile,
and your beautiful eyes,

and your awesome third boob
that's on top of the other boob.

LOIS: What? Oh, my God.

-Peter, that's not a boob. That's a lump.
-PETER: A lump? Holy crap!

Peter, stop that! We're not having sex.
I just told you I have a lump.

PETER: I got a lump, too.
And mine's easier to get rid of.

Mrs. Griffin, I've got good news.
Your test results came back negative.

It appears the lump in your breast
is not black gross boob death.

-Breast cancer?
-That's the layman's term, yes.

-Oh, thank God. What a relief.
-Yeah. That was scary.

Now, Mrs. Griffin, although
you're in the clear for the moment,

we need to have a look
at your family medical history

to determine your future risk.

That's curious. I didn't realize
your mother was a Holocaust survivor.

My mother? Oh, no. That's...
That's impossible. She's not Jewish.

According to her birth certificate,
she is.

Oh, my God.

Wow. Breast cancer's starting to look
pretty good.

-Mom, you're Jewish?
-I'm sorry I never told you, dear.

When we were married,
your father made me conceal the fact

so he could get into country clubs.

-It was the right thing to do.
-It was the right thing to do, dear.

Oh, my God. So Grandma Hebrewberg
is actually Jewish?

Yes. When she moved to America,
her family changed their name.

It was originally
Hebrewbergmoneygrabber.

That makes you Jewish, Lois.
And your children, too.

This kind of rocks my world,

even more than the time
I went to that pediatrician.

Whoa, Stewie.
You're getting to be a big boy.

I think somebody's gonna be
a football star.

-Oh, you.
-Forgot your chart. Be right back.

Whoa, Jason.
You're getting to be a big boy.

I think somebody's gonna be
a football star.

I can't believe I fell for that line.

I actually let myself believe
I could be a doctor's wife.

You're just fat, Stewie. Silly and fat.

Thank you for coming over, Max.

I really need some advice
from an actual Jewish person.

Oh, it's my pleasure, Lois.

I'm sure this all must be
very overwhelming.

I just don't know what to do
with this information.

I've spent my whole life as a Christian.

I'll tell you what you should do with it.
Absolutely nothing.

That's the problem with this world.

Too many people go overboard
with what they believe.

Like Quagmire when he thought
he was the one getting the spinoff.

See you later, bitches.

Have fun with your stupid,
(BLEEP) giant chicken jokes

and your Conway Twitty...

Hey, why is there a moving truck
outside Cleveland's house?

Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that,
but, essentially, Brian's right.

Being Jewish doesn't really have
to change you or your family's life.

Well, I guess you're right.

There's no reason things should be
any different around here.

<i>Shalom,</i> Jews.

Wow, Dad! Where did you get all that
glistening chest hair?

It came with my Star of David.

Peter, what is all this?

Look, this is my way of letting you know
that I'm embracing who you are.

Oh, and I don't respond to Peter.

From now on,
I want you to use my Hebrew name.

(HISSING)

Well, I caution you...

(HISSING)

...that becoming Jewish
doesn't happen overnight.

It's a process that involves
spiritual education and good works.

So what you're saying is
that it happens overnight?

Look, Peter, I'm the one
with the Jewish heritage

and I really don't want to make
a big deal out of this.

Leave it to a Jew
to take all the fun out of being a Jew.

Now, listen up. I like the hat
and I like the scarf, so we're doing this.

Kids, from now on this is where
we'll celebrate the Sabbath.

Peter, this is all unnecessary.
Our life was fine the way it was.

Check it out.
I'm one of you guys now, huh?

I'm Jewish! Yeah!
Holocaust! We're number one!

Look at all these short, hairy men.

God, I feel like I'm on
the forest moon of Endor.

Good afternoon.
As we approach the Passover holiday,

let us remember the struggle of our people

as they labored under the yoke
of Pharaoh's despotic rule.

Hey, if anyone appreciates a good yoke,
it's the "Yews."

(LAUGHING)

That's my Jewish laugh.
I'm working on a Jewish laugh.

Peter, I'm so embarrassed right now.
Can we please just go?

-Hi, you're pretty.
-Oh, thank you.

(INAUDIBLE)

-Mom, is sodomy illegal if you're Jewish?
-I hope so, Meg. I really do.

It's not, Lois. It's not.

-Dad, this isn't the way to school.
-Yes, it is, Chris.

One of the best parts about being Jewish

is getting to take advantage
of their excellent schools.

I'm not going to no Jewish school.

Sitting around all day
with a bunch of short, hairy guys.

I'll feel like I'm on
the forest moon of Endor.

Didn't you...
Didn't you make that joke the other day?

Oh, yeah. No, I just...
I wasn't sure if everybody had...

...had heard.

And instead of lasting for one day,
the oil in the lamp lasted for eight days.

-And that is why we celebrate Hanukkah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

How long before we play "Pin the eviction
notice on the black guy's door"?

-Now, does anyone have any questions?
-Yeah, I have a question.

What are you gonna do
when Jesus comes back

and puts a boot up your ass?

And it's also why many families give
their children eight days of presents.

-Wait. Did she say eight days of presents?
-Yeah.

Well, this Judaism thing is gonna be
better than I thought.

All right, class.
That's all for today's lesson.

Now, everyone off to gym class.

All right. Today we're gonna play soccer.

Huh. That was easy.

-Hey, Lois, the kids are all asleep.
-I suppose they are.

You know what else?

I picked out a sexy little Jewish outfit
for you at the store.

-What is that?
-Oh, my God, Lois.

If you put on this long, thick dress
right now, I will lose it!

Peter, I'm not wearing that thing.

And if you put this shawl
over your head...

Do you have any clunky,
unfashionable peasant shoes?

Oh, I swear to God, Lois.
I swear to God, I would lose it.

Peter, get off me!

Tell me I don't earn as much
as your friend's husband.

Peter, stop it. I'm going to sleep.

Fine. I'll just sit here and watch TV.

<i>What the...</i>

PETER'S DAD: Peter!

Dad?

What do you think you're doing, Peter?
You were raised Catholic.

If you forsake your religion,
you'll spend eternity in hell.

Oh, God. I don't want that!

Then you better knock off
all the Jewish stuff.

Well, all right.
If that's what you think is best.

Wait. Dad, before you go, can you say,

"Peter, you must go
to the Dagobah System"?

Peter, you must go
to the Dagobah System.

(SIGHING) Thanks.

Anybody want toast or a bagel?

Peter, what the hell?

Lois, last night my father came to me
and reminded me that I'm a good Catholic.

If I don't rid the house
of this Jewish curse,

this family is gonna go to hell,
and I won't let that happen.

Peter, you were the only one
who was even taking this thing seriously.

Jews are gross, Lois.

It's the only religion
with the word "ew" in it.

Oh, come on.

You're acting crazier than when you were
going through your Parker Lewis phase.

Peter, you ready for dinner?

That's just like the <i>Parker Lewis</i> episode
when Parker Lewis ate dinner.

Peter, nobody cares about
your canceled show.

Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose.
Don't even try and make him lose

'cause it's just gonna be
that much more embarrassing for you

when you realize that he can't lose.

Would he win in a fight with Batman?

Well, Chris,
think about what you're saying.

Parker Lewis can't lose.
Heretofore, Batman can suck on that.

Suck on that? Suck on this. Tic Tacs
have only one-and-a-half calories.

-Well played.
-I love you, Dad.

I love you too, son.

Huh? What the... What the hell?

How do you like it, huh?
How do you like it?

Peter, what in God's name is this?

Wait a minute.
Are these pieces of Stewie's crib?

I hate it here.

Oh, thanks for spending time
with me today, Mom.

I just had to get out of that house.
Peter's being such a jackass.

Lois, I think this is more serious
than you realize.

-Don't you see what he's doing?
-He's just being immature.

It's happened before. And it'll pass.

Lois, what Peter is doing to you is
exactly what Carter did to me for years.

He's repressing your Jewish identity.

(CARTER GIGGLING)

But, Mom, I don't really care
about being Jewish,

or even Christian for that matter.

I just want to be a good person
on my own.

(CARTER GIGGLING)

All I'm saying is I let your father
take my Jewish identity,

and I've regretted it ever since.

I don't want to see you make
the same mistake.

I don't know, Mom. I'll think about it.

(CARTER GIGGLING)

Carter, knock it off!

CARTER: Come on.
You know you Jew girls want that dollar.

Follow the dollar and it'll lead you to...
What do Jews like?

Salmon! There's salmon over here.

Is there really salmon over there?

No. You walk over there
and he squirts you with a squirt gun.

(LAUGHING)

(GUNSHOT)

What the hell?

(SIGHING)

Are you out of your (BLEEP) mind?

Relax, Lois. I was aiming for the mailbox.
I'm just trying to make a point.

Good morning, Lois.

(GUNSHOT)

Peter, for God's sake!
I am so sorry, Mort.

No problem, Lois.
That's just how people say hello to me.

(GUNSHOT)

-Hey, Joe!
-JOE: Hey, Mort!

Peter, you and I are gonna have
a conversation.

-I am very angry with you.
-Geez, what's your problem?

What you did this morning was
so far out of line, I just...

Let me tell you this. Mom was right.

I can't just sit here
and let you dump all over my heritage.

I'm not gonna make the mistake she did.
I'm Jewish, and I'm proud of it.

And this weekend,
we're having a Passover seder.

-You can't do that. It's Easter.
-Not in this house.

Lois, this family believes
in the Easter Bunny.

He died for our sins
in that helicopter crash.

Now, if you want to go to hell,
that's fine.

But don't drag the rest of us
down with you

like a mentally handicapped rooster.

(CROWING)

Good night, everybody!

Okay, everyone.
This is my first time doing a seder,

which is where we tell the story of
the Jews' escape from bondage in Egypt.

Doesn't it seem like every Jewish holiday
has to do with them escaping from stuff?

No, Chris.

And, you know, tricking some bigger,
more athletic people?

Lois, not that I'm rushing you,
but when do we get to the wine drinking?

Hang on. Hang on. Before we do anything,

I'd like to say a blessing
over the candles, if I may.

Bear with me.
I haven't had much rehearsal time.

(CLEARING THROAT)

(PRAYING IN HEBREW)

Can't we just eat?

And now I shall continue the prayer.

<i>Kali Maa. Kali Maa.</i>
<i>Kali Maa!</i>

<i>Om Namah Shivayah. Om Namah Shivayah.</i>
<i>Om Namah Shivayah.</i>

<i>Om Namah Shivayah.</i>
<i>Om Namah Shivayah.</i>

Now let's move on
to the washing of the hands.

This is a very important part of the...

Hey, hey, hey. The Easter Bunny is here.
Happy Easter!

Peter, what the hell are you doing
in that? Have you been drinking?

Not since I got out of the car.
Who here thinks they can kick my ass?

Peter, you are not gonna ruin this seder.
Now, get out of here!

I'm sorry, kids.
I just wanted to help Brian run for mayor.

I guess I forgot
what was really important.

-Peter, just go lie down.
-All right. I'm gonna go lie down.

And then I'm gonna come back
and mess up your seder.

All right, I'm back.
And I'm much more sober.

Lois, what you're doing is wrong.

I want you to get all this Jew food
off the table.

-I most certainly will not.
-It's me or your religion, Lois.

I'm a Catholic, and I want to live
in a Catholic house.

Well, I'm a Jew, and I want to live
in a nicer house.

BRIAN: You really think
I should run for mayor?

Peter, you've got to stop living
in your own stupid world.

I'm sorry, but I can't be with someone
who doesn't believe in Jesus.

Hey, hey. Heard my name.

Wow, Jesus! Oh, you're dead now, Lois.
Jesus is gonna kill you.

And then we're gonna bury you in the yard
next to Kathy Ireland.

I mean...
I mean, nice weather we're having.

Look, Peter, I thought it might
interest you to know that I'm Jewish.

-What?
-He's Jewish, Peter.

Jewish? Like full on?
Like you practice "Jewiism"?

-I am a Jew.
-Prove it!

-What's a 9% tip on a $200 bill?
-$18. Which is fair.

Oh, my God, it's true!
But I'm so confused.

Peter, it really doesn't matter.

Catholicism and Judaism
are not that different.

They're two sides of the same coin.

In fact, the Last Supper, one of the most
iconic images of the Catholic faith,

was a Passover seder.

And if I'm not mistaken, Islam is also
in that same spiritual family.

Let's not muddy things up here.

The most important thing is
to treat other people the same way

-you would want to be treated.
-Oh! An eye for an eye.

Well, Lois, I guess I owe you an apology.

I was scared because my dad
convinced me I was going to hell.

And I was doing it to make up
for my mother's mistake.

Look, I don't know if being Jewish
is the right thing for our family.

I just wanted the chance to explore it
so I could know for sure.

But to tell you the truth,
I thought we were fine before.

But then, Jesus,
which religion should our family be?

-Six of one, they're all complete crap.
-BRIAN: Thank you!

-You using the bathroom?

I was just curious. Before you go,
I want to ask you a question.

Is there something on my elbow or...

First, me first, me first.

Peter, I'm going first!

-JOE: Sure.

Peter, where have you been?

Let's just say I've been at Cleveland's

is the greatest discovery

since fat women discovered Diet Coke.

Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
What are you doing? That's my bathroom!

What are you talking about?
We just rented this place.

Holy crap! Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase!

What the hell are you guys
doing in Quahog?

We're just doing research for a movie.

Oh, my God, that's amazing.

Listen, I got to tell you guys,

I've watched all your movies,
like, 1,000 times.

-You saw <i>Cops and Robbersons?</i>
-And <i>My Stepmother is an Alien?</i>

Almost all of them.

Boy, I sure would love it if you guys

would come to our house

My wife's cooking sucks,
but I just want to look at you.

-Yeah. Sure.

All right, see you at 8:00.

Actually, I wasn't in that.

Look at these guys!
They can't take a compliment!

You know, you guys are funny,
but I got a confession to make.

I'm a pretty funny guy myself.

Maybe I say a few things here,
maybe I get a few laughs,

maybe you guys put me
in one of your pictures.

Well, yeah, I suppose it's possible.

Yeah, we've got all kinds of
roles available.

Speaking roles, background roles.
Background would be good for you.

Yeah. Speaking role or background role,
either one would be good.

You know, I'm really good at sight gags.

Oh! I didn't mean to do that.

Now it's everywhere!

That's comedy.

(STEWIE LAUGHING)

Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?
That's not funny.

Oh, well, interesting opinion, Lois.

Gee, I wonder if
there's anyone else at this table

who's maybe more qualified to say
what's funny than you are.

Well, we'd need to see
a little bit more, but...

(LAUGHING)

Is that the time? I can't believe
that's the time. It's late.

What? I don't understand.
You're not wearing a watch.

Well, you see,
that's sort of a joke, Peter.

-Oh. Well, that's not that funny.
-It's kind of funny, you know.

No, it's not funny.
See, if you had said something like,

"It's half past a freckle."

(LAUGHING)

You know, I'm thinking,

I'm... I'm thinking this guy.

Where's this guy been?

Well, Mr. Griffin,
this has been a lot of fun.

-A lot of fun.
-But we got to get back over to our place

and kind of do... What do we have to do?

-Roll some joints and get high.
-Yeah, we got to do those things.

That's not funny. Drugs aren't funny.

-They ruin lives.
-Amen.

-No, Peter. You're not funny.
-I'm afraid Dan's right.

-You're not funny at all.
-I don't get it.

You're painfully unfunny.

Get the (BLEEP) out of my house!

Hey, Stewie, can I talk to you for a sec?

Look, Brian,
I've colored Sebastian the crab blue!

If that isn't a middle finger to society,
I don't know what is.

I don't like it anymore.
I wish I'd colored him red.

Do you think it's a little odd

that Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd
have moved into Quahog together?

I mean, why here? Why now?

I don't know.
Maybe we go over there and find out.

Maybe we do.

Hey. Hi, there. Can you guys tell Meg
I'm seeing someone?

-BRIAN: You see anything?
-Doesn't look like anybody's home.

Yell, yell, yell. Yell, yell, yell.

What the... What the hell is this place?

Welcome to DUMP,

Deep Underground
Military Protection Facility.

-Wouldn't that be DUMPF?
-The "F" is silent, like in "knife."

We're actually working for the federal
government, and we need your help.

Do you want to be spies like us?

Can we be spies like them?

We've actually resolved our differences.

Wait a minute. I don't understand.

What do you mean
you guys work for the government?

Well, Brian, it turns out <i>Spies Like Us</i>
was Ronald Reagan's favorite movie,

so he actually appointed us
honorary spies back in the '80s.

That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

You see, Brian, during the Cold War,

the Soviet Union brainwashed
dozens of American civilians,

effectively making them sleeper agents

who could be activated at anytime
to do the work of the KGB.

Activated how?

The agents could be activated
by uttering a predetermined phrase.

At which point,
they would snap into a trance

and mindlessly carry out whatever orders
they were given by their KGB handlers.

Well, I mean,
what if they encountered somebody

-who said the phrase accidentally?
-Not possible.

The activation phrase was something
that no one would ever think to utter.

-What is it?
-The phrase is,

"Gosh, that Italian family
at the next table sure is quiet."

You see, the U.S. government believes
that one of these sleeper agents

is right here in Quahog.

Now, you two individuals live here.

Are there any local residents
whom you've seen acting strangely?

Well, there's a pedophile up the street

that nobody seems to be
doing anything about,

but it's mainly because he's so funny.

Well, look, we'd be happy to
help in any way we can.

Hey, is Ron Howard's
weird-looking brother

one of these lab technicians?

Of course he is. It's an '80s movie.

Hey, there's something on the screen.

And those two bums turned to me
and said, "You're not funny, Peter."

-In my own house!
-Well, what was the bit?

Okay, ready?

I'm John Wayne
at the first Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

(LAUGHING)

-Oh, God.
-Oh, my.

Oh, my God, Peter!

I'll tell you, and I'm your friend
and I'll be honest with you, that's funny.

That is funny.

And you know what I appreciate
about your joke, Peter?

It's clean. It's clean funny!

I just wish there was some way
I could show them how wrong they are.

Show them that we know comedy
better than they do.

Hey, I got an idea.

What's the most consistently funny form
of comedy in existence?

-Improv?
-Improv!

-Improv!
-Improv!

-Improv!
-Improv!

We'll start our own improv group
and put on a show.

All right!

Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice, Mayor West.

No problem, gentlemen.

-May I call you "gentlemen"?
-Yeah.

Now, you say this spy is located
somewhere in Quahog?

That's right. We need you to set up
some roadblocks to help us contain him.

Do you have any clues
regarding the identity of the spy?

It's a little tricky, sir.

See, the operative is completely unaware
that he's been programmed,

and the only way to activate him

and discover his identity
is by saying the phrase,

"Gosh, that Italian family
at the next table sure is quiet!"

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

It's him!

(BEEPING)

(MOANING)

I haven't been this... Since I...

I don't... I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing, but...

Oh, there's track star Wilma Rudolph.

Obviously, she had something to do
with the gag,

but I didn't hear the setup,
so I don't really know the context...

Hey, I wonder what Peter's up to!

Okay, so we got to come up with
a name for our improv group.

-Anybody got anything?
-BOTH: Um...

-How about the Jokeridge Boys?
-Not bad.

-Wait. How about Funny Side Up?
-No, no, no. Guys, guys, we got the name.

It's Improv-de-Colon-
the-Truth-is-Ad Libbed.

-What about Deliveries in Rear?
-Oh, yes!

No, no! No, you can't just jam jokes in
for no reason!

It has to be organic to the situation!

What the hell you being
so frigging comedy Hitler about?

I was in three improv groups
in college, Peter.

I was in Improvidence,
I was in the Wackadamia Nuts,

and I know I'm dating myself here,
but Three Smile Island.

My point being that I am the only
experienced member of this group.

I can already tell
this is not gonna be fun.

How do we know where to start looking?

The tracking beacon I shot
into Mayor West's ankle

will allow us to locate him.

Wow. Those are the Russian people?

I mean, granted,
you do think of bears on unicycles

when you think of the Russian people,
but they're all bears on unicycles?

Bears on unicycles, every one.

So what do we do now?

We're undercover U.S. agents
in a hostile foreign territory.

We just got to make sure we don't
do anything that makes us stick out.

Hey, they're not bears on unicycles!

-You are under arrest.
-Time to lose this costume.

(LAUGHING) 'Cause we're in Russia!

Here are the American spies we captured,
Mr. Prime Minister.

(GASPING)

(SIGHING)

(GASPING)

(SIGHING)

(GASPING)

(SIGHING)

He was "Putin" us on, huh? Right?

What do you think of that? Chevy?

Right? That would have passed for funny
in one of your movies, right?

Okay, moving on.

Gentlemen, let me put your minds at ease.
I know why you are here,

and I mean to help you.

(LAUGHING)

Well, terrific.

The truth is the reactivation
of a Cold War sleeper spy

would be an embarrassment
to my government.

On the scale of our 1981 failed
Czechoslovakian occupation outpost,

which was penetrated by Bill Murray,

Harold Ramis,
and their ragtag band of misfit soldiers

who didn't even graduate!

They slept through
the graduation ceremony and somehow

managed to come out of the manhole
wearing clean, pressed suit, as you say.

So the long and the veiny of it is,
you're gonna help us out, right?

I will provide you with transportation,
passports, food, supplies,

everything from "A" to backwards "R."

Wow! Thank you so much for your help,
Mr. Putin.

Would you like to see
Russian cutaway gag?

-Yeah, sure.
-Here is Russian cutaway gag.

(EXCLAIMING IN RUSSIAN)

(LAUGHING)

Where the hell is Quagmire?

I don't know.
He said improv rehearsal at 7:00, right?

Yeah, where is Quagmire?
I haven't seen him all day.

You know what?
I think he went down to the bank.

What was that? What did you hit me for?

I'm passing the story on to you.
Keep it going. Keep the story going.

-Huh?
-What's Quagmire doing at the bank?

It's improv, Peter. You don't think.

You don't think.
You just keep talking. You don't think.

Don't think. Don't think.
What comes to mind?

Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk!

I get it. Tap me, Quagmire, tap me!

Quagmire went to the bank to donate
sperm because it's a sperm bank.

Yes, there you go. He's moving it forward.

He's moving it forward. See, Peter?
Now tap Peter.

Hey, pilgrims.
Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

It's me, John Wayne.

Oh, no. All right, you know what?
You're not loosened up yet.

All right, let's do
some warm-up exercises.

Okay, this is one we call
"Going Bananas." Okay.

(SINGING) <i>I'm a banana</i>
<i>I'm a banana</i>

<i>Peel the banana</i>
<i>Peel the banana</i>

<i>Now go bananas!</i>
<i>Go, go bananas!</i>

<i>Go!</i>

Come on, you guys. Do it with me.
Go bananas. Yeah!

(SHOUTING)

Whole body, Joe. Whole body.

Come on. Go bananas.

Am I doing it? Am I doing it?

(BLEEP) the matter with you guys?

All right, let's try something else.
Okay, this is a warm-up exercise

called "One-Word Story."

Now, I start a story with one word,

and then you each continue
with one word at a time.

-Okay, ready?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm into this now.

-Okay. The...
-Dog...

-And...
-My...

-Mom...
-And...

-This...
-Handkerchief...

-And...
-Twenty...

-Birds...
-And...

-Peter.
-Geez.

-And...
-Peter, hang on a sec.

-You're not contributing.
-I'm doing it.

You're not adding information.

Well, one of you guys says "Thanksgiving,"

I got a good idea where to go with it.

Okay, Peter,
let's try something different.

Okay, close your eyes.
What's the first thing you see?

-Uh...
-Don't think, just say it. First thing.

-Pelican.
-Okay, what's he doing?

He's complaining
about some undercooked food.

Who's he complaining to?

A snooty French waiter
who's really mean to his customers.

But then when he goes home,
his own life's sad

because his girlfriend's mean to him,
and his apartment isn't so very nice,

and he's always running out
of paper towels.

(GASPING)

I saw it... I seen it, Quagmire.
I was there in the apartment!

We're ready.

If these signatures are correct,

Mayor West is located
one-third of a kilometer that way.

Just over this rise.

Yeah, that's what you told us
a third of a kilometer ago, you douche.

Perhaps you'd like to do
something besides

criticizing me and quoting my movies?

You just watch your mouth, mister!

Look!

(GASPING)

Anyway, I'd be happy to help you
conduct a search of Quahog and find...

What the hell? Where am I?

I didn't just bite into
a YORK peppermint patty, did I?

Mayor West, you're in Russia.

You've just launched a nuclear missile
against the United States.

Well, this day has taken a bad turn,
like Mike Brady's first marriage.

Here's your beer, honey.

I don't remember asking for a warm beer.

Well, I didn't want to quit working.
You made me.

You don't talk to me that way!

-Alice, what did you see?
-Enough to know I'm getting a raise.

What the... Oh, man.
We're supposed to do a show tonight.

Where's the audience?
I don't see them anywhere.

If only they could make some noise
to let me know they're here.

-MAN 1: We're here.
-Oh, there you are. Thank God.

Well, we're Room for Improv-ment.
So without further ado, I need a place.

-MAN 1: Your ass!
-Okay, come on now.

-Something serious.
-MAN 1: Your mom's ass!

Hey, let's get that guy out of here, huh?
Okay, a real place.

MAN 2: Goldman's Pharmacy
on Third and Maple.

WOMAN: Give them the hours.

-MAN 2: 8:00 a.m. to...
-Okay, I heard "pharmacy."

-Who's in the pharmacy?
-PETER: John Wayne!

What the... Peter, you're not supposed
to be in the audience.

Get the hell up onstage.

All right. Hey there, sir.
Welcome to my pharmacy. Can I help you?

Here's John Wayne
at the first Thanksgiving.

"Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

You like that? Okay, here's John Wayne
Bobbitt at the first Thanksgiving.

"Where's my penis, pilgrims?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And here's John Wayne Gacy
at the first Thanksgiving.

"I want to dress up like a clown

"and have sex with children
and kill them, pilgrims."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-Guys, I got to split. I took a wet duke.
-And...

Okay, this is not something that should
ever have been attempted.

Thank you very much.
Good night, everybody.

Improv!

I wish there was some way
I could have prevented this.

It wasn't your fault, Mayor West.
There's nothing you could have done.

To be honest, I don't remember a thing,

except how much I love
the Michael Jackson <i>Thriller</i> video.

Boy, could that guy dance.

Guy dance? Guidance!
Source programmable guidance!

We can reprogram
and disarm the missile from here.

From here? Well, our arms
would have to be 40-feet long, Dan.

No, yutz, not from right here.
We go over there and do it.

-Oh, right.
-Oh, come on, Chevy.

You should have known
what he was talking about.

All I have to do is bypass the primary
navigational-guidance circuits,

deprogram the hardwired safety overrides,
and reconfigure the motherboard

so that the missile's primary
central-processing unit tells itself

to eject its own warhead while still
safely above the Earth's atmosphere.

Hey, Dan, when this is all over,

you may get a call asking you
to evaluate my performance.

Can I count on you to give me a 10?

And that should do it.

You did it, Dan. My God, you did it!

Yes. Oh, my God. You did it. You did it.

Mission accomplished, gentlemen.
Warhead has been destroyed.

We've saved millions of lives.

Let's just hope the fuselage doesn't fall
where it can cause too much damage.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

I... I don't get it.

So, what's the deal with Chris?
Is he actually, like, still in Africa?

No, no, he's not.

-So that was all... That was just a bit?
-Yeah, he'll be back next week.

Great. Boy, who would have thought
all this trouble could be caused

by simply uttering the phrase,

"Gosh, that Italian family
at the next table sure is quiet."

Why are they selling all those DVDs

Because, Chris, DVDs are outdated

I have high hopes for this.
I had a Clif Bar before we started.

Everybody else!

No, I get it.
He's resting his head on pancakes.

It looks hilarious.

<i>Road House.</i>

That was awesome,
and its message is timeless.

Peter, the only message in that movie is

that every problem in life
can be solved by kicking.

(GASPS)

Oh, my God! Brian, you're right.

Peter, I'm joking.

-What did you say to me?
-Peter, what are you doing?

I think I can get on board with that.

-Probably a little blame on our side, too.
-PETER: <i>Road House?</i>

Well, I guess we're just lucky
nobody got hurt.

Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

But, you know,
I sort of have one other problem.

-Maybe you can help me out.
-What's that?

I have a dinner reservation for two
tonight at Dominic's, and it's just me.

I see your problem.
I think I might be able to help.

Ma'am, you want me to kick
those dents out for you?

Peter, we've had complaints
from all over town.

You're gonna have to stop
with the kicking.

Oh, yeah? I think my scary, otherworldly,
shadowy spirit friends

might have something to say about that.

-Can I help you?
-Hi, I'm Brian.

I'm here to pick up Nicole.

Oh, hi. I'm Rita, her mom.

You must be the one
she had that fender bender with.

Well, I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer
to think of it as a happy accident.

-Is she ready?
-Oh, well...

Unfortunately, she left for dinner
with another guy about half an hour ago.

What? We had a date.

Yeah. I'm afraid that's Nicole.
She's 21 and gorgeous.

Guys ask her out all the time
and I think she loses track.

Oh, for God's sake!

Well, let me at least leave
my car-insurance information for her.

-Is that your condom?
-No! I mean...

I mean, I wasn't gonna use that
on your daughter.

I mean, I wouldn't... I would not
use a condom on your daughter.

I mean,
I would if I was having sex with her,

which obviously I would not do.
But if... I mean...

I'm safe and all, you know? I get
an AIDS test once every three months.

And not because I...

You know, it's not
because I have a lot of sex. I just...

I just eat a lot of poo off the street.

Come to think of it, how did this
get in my wallet in the first place?

STEWIE:<i> "Dear Brian,</i>

<i>"somewhere between the point</i>
<i>when you're excited enough to want it</i>

<i>"and too excited to care,</i>
<i>think about your future.</i>

<i>"Your friend, Stewie."</i>

Well, I think I've been humiliated enough
for one evening.

-Sorry to bother you.
-If it's any consolation,

I would never have stood you up.

Well, I guess that makes you
one of the rare ones nowadays.

-Your husband's a lucky guy.
-Divorced.

Oh.

Well, at the risk of humiliating myself
once again,

-I still have a reservation.
-Well, I don't have plans.

Well, terrific.

Hey, maybe I'll get to use this after all,
huh? I'm just... I'm kidding.

Oh, please. At my age,
I don't have to worry about pregnancy.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

-How old are you?
-Oh, you don't want to know.

-I kind of do.
-Hang on.

Just let me get my purse and we can go.

Wow, she seems great!

We're getting along better than
Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.

-I love you.
-I love you.

Get the (BLEEP) crack!

Brian, you want some lasagna?

No, thanks.
Rita and I grabbed a bite already.

Gosh, you've been seeing this Rita
for weeks now

and you still haven't brought her over
to the house.

(LAUGHING) When are we gonna meet
the lovely lady, huh?

Oh, she's being ironic.

What are you saying?
I don't date lovely women?

Yeah, you got it. You got it.

No. It just seems like
some of your past girlfriends

have been a little dumb and trampy.

First of all, that's not true,
and second of all, she's not like that.

She's wonderful. She's smart.
She's pretty.

And, you know, the only reason I haven't
brought her around

is that you guys don't always make
the best impression with girls I date.

Especially Peter.

Hey, aren't you that chick
from the bathroom door?

Come on, Peter.
She doesn't want to talk about work.

What's it like in there?

I assume it's like how it is
in the men's room.

Oh, there's a long trough
with a big poo in it?

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

You know, Brian,
the past few weeks have been great.

I can't remember the last time
I've had this much fun dating somebody.

I can remember the last time I have.

Never.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

That's the writer in you, Brian.

Did you always know
that's what you wanted to do?

Well, actually, I really thought
I was gonna be an actor at one point.

I even got a few high-profile gigs.

Really? Anything I've seen?

Oh, you ever heard of a tiny little
independent movie called <i>Die Hard?</i>

Wow! You were in that?

Sure was. Hey, what do you say we go
back to my place and I'll show it to you?

Sounds good to me.

We'll have to be a little quiet.
Everyone's asleep. Have a seat.

Okay, watch this. This is my scene.

McCLANE: <i>Doesn't make sense, man.</i>

Hey, don't ask me, man.

I'm just a desk jockey who was
on my way home when you rang.

I figured you for the street, Al.

-AL:<i> In my youth. In my youth...</i>

Sir, the FBI is here.

-Oh, the FBI is here now?
-Yes, sir. Right over there.

-Hold this.
-Want a breath mint?

(LAUGHING)

Breath mint.

I was dating a famous actor.

-Should we go upstairs?
-Sounds good to me.

Okay, the coast is clear.

Oh. Good morning.

-Who's... Who's your friend?

-Rita, this is Lois. Lois, Rita.
-So great to meet you.

-Lovely to meet you.
-Perfect. Everyone hits it off.

Listen, Rita,
why don't you wait in the car?

-I'll be out in a minute.
-Okay, sweetie.

Well, you met her. What do you think?

(SNICKERING)

-What?
-What do I think? She's 100!

Oh, my God! Peter, did you see her?

PETER: I'm looking at her now!
I can see her from the window up here.

Hey, anybody make
a Jessica Tandy joke yet?

-No!
-PETER: Awesome. I'll be right down.

Hey, Brian, who are you dating?
Jessica Tandy?

Son of a bitch! Damn it, Chris,
I called that from upstairs!

What are you guys talking about?
She's a beautiful woman.

You know, Lois, you, of all people,
should be pleased.

I mean, all the crap I take
for dating young bimbos.

How old is she, Brian?

What difference does it make?
Age has nothing to do with anything.

Okay, you know what?
I'll bring her to dinner

and you can see for yourself what
a bright, fun and charming woman she is.

Wonderful. I'll cook something
that's not too binding.

Well, Rita,
I'm so glad you could join us for dinner.

Thanks for having me, Lois.
This food is delicious.

Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad you can taste it.

Hey, you know what we haven't done
for a while?

Go around the table and everybody says
what year they were born.

So, kids, how was your day?

-Well, the sandbox was...
-It was great!

Guess he's going first.

We got a new pencil sharpener
in math class!

Well, that's nice.

Say, Rita, who was President
when you were born?

-Great pot roast, Lois.
-Thank you, Brian.

Rita, would you like me to cut yours up
a little smaller?

Oh, I'm fine.

Boy! Speaking of that, I don't know
how many people have asked me today

where I was when Martin Luther King
was shot.

I'm sure you've been asked.
What do you tell them?

Who can forget?
I remember just crying like a baby.

Crying like a baby?
Or crying like someone in college?

Say, Brian, on her answering machine,
how long after her message is the beep?

Wow. This has just been a delight.

You can't go yet. We haven't had dessert.

Interesting. You know, the first time
I had dessert was 36 years ago today.

How about you, Rita?
You remember your first dessert?

Lord, no! It was so many years ago.

Like 40 years ago?

-Peter...
-What were stagecoaches like?

Fifty years ago?
Would that be a good guess?

-Oh, dear.
-Peter!

-How old are you? How old are you?
-Fifty! Okay? I'm 50!

Happy now?

(SOBBING)

You people are awful!

You know, this is what's wrong
with society!

Nobody bats an eye
if a woman dates an older man,

but God forbid it's the other way around!

There is nothing wrong
with me dating Rita.

She's beautiful, she's a charming woman,
and I love her!

(RITA CRYING)

-Rita.
-Oh, Brian, please leave me alone.

They're right. I'm just an old fool
thinking we could be together.

Will you stop that? They're insane.

They don't know
what they're talking about.

-You're an amazing woman.
-You're just saying that.

No, I'm not. The only thing that matters
is how I feel about you.

-Rita, I love you.
-I love you, too, Brian.

I think you're the most wonderful woman
I've ever met.

-Will you marry me?
-What did you just say?

Come on. You're only 50. You heard me.
Will you marry me?

Oh, Brian. Yes!
Yes, Brian, I'll marry you!

Hey, Mom. Hey, Brian. We'll be upstairs.

-Yo, Rita. You want in on this?
-No, thanks. We just got engaged.

-I'm faithful to Brian now.
-Whatever. This ain't even my whole night.

-You're engaged?
-Yes.

Rita and I are getting married.

My God! I can't even react big enough.

Here's Mrs. Garrett.

(IN SHOCKED TONE) What?

Look, if my happiness
means so little to you all

that you have Charlotte Rae
just standing by to crack a joke,

then you really disappoint me.

Look, Brian, I apologize for the other
night. We were all very insensitive.

And if this is what you want,
we as a family support your decision.

I don't. I'd rather you marry a...

(STAMMERING)

-A Japanese or something.
-I'm with you, too, buddy.

In 20 years, she'll be 70,
and you'll have been dead for 15 years.

God bless the both of you.

Hey, it's 4:30.

Isn't there an early-bird special
you should be running off to?

She's 50, Stewie! She's not an old woman.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello? Hey, Rita.

No, I'm not hungry yet.

Well, if we get there by 5:30,
I'm sure they'll honor it.

Brian, is she calling dinner "supper"?

So, what are you doing this afternoon?

(IN WOMAN'S VOICE) "Oh, I'm just sorting
out my pills for the week, sweetie."

Well, you do that
and I'll be over a little later.

Did I get it?
Was she sorting out her pills for the week

in that little plastic thing
with the seven boxes?

Actually, she just got back from the gym
and she's jumping in the shower.

-She got a chair in that shower?
-Shut up!

Have archaeologists ever discovered
ancient Egyptian pottery in her vagina?

You know what? That one was too wordy.

That one was too wordy.
That was flawed from the ground up.

It wasn't funny,
and we'll work on it and get back to you.

-BRIAN: Hey, Rita?
-Yeah?

Where do you keep your toothpaste?

-What are you looking for? Tooth polish?
-Toothpaste, yeah.

-Just use the baking soda.
-Baking soda?

What the hell, I can skip a night.

Oh, I've never noticed
this picture before.

Is that you when you were a little girl?

Oh, yeah. That's the summer
my family went to DC.

That flag's missing some stars, there.

Why don't you come to bed, Brian?

What do you say
we make a little whoopee?

Yeah, sure. Why not?

(BOTH MOANING)

BRIAN: You okay?
I'm not hurting you, am I?

RITA: No, I'm fine.
What are you talking about?

I just want to make sure
you're comfortable.

(BOTH MOANING)

-I love you, Brian. Sock it to me!
-What?

(RITA EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

-What's wrong?
-Oh, nothing.

When I'm on my back, sometimes
my breast can slide in my armpit.

-Just got pinched, that's all.
-Okay.

(BOTH MOANING)

(RITA SCREAMING)

-Was that your boob?
-God, no! I think I broke my hip.

Oh, my God, what should I do?

Call the number on my bracelet.

It says "Murray Hill 4185."
That's not enough numbers!

That's the number, Brian.
Just dial 0 and read it to Sarah.

For God's sake, Rita!

(SIGHING) She's fine.
She's out of surgery and she's resting.

Well, how did she break it? Did she fall?

(MUMBLING)

Yes, she fell.

You know, Brian, a woman her age
comes in here, they don't always leave.

Peter, she's gonna be okay.

Listen, Brian, you say the word
and I'll go in there with a pillow

and you won't have any more problems.

How many times do I have to tell you
I'm sticking by this woman?

-I love her!
-Careful, Brian.

Sometimes the things you love
can disappoint you.

Like that <i>Playboy</i> issue.

(SIGHS) Here we go.
<i>"Playboy's</i> Women of the Olympics."

Wow, those are some broad shoulders.

Okay, I guess small boobs
are good for swimming.

(STAMMERING)

Those are balls.

Brian? Brian!

Oh. Is the soup ready?

-Yeah. Got it right here.
-Oh, good. I need to take my pills.

It's been three hours.

You know, they warned me these blue
ones were gonna make me constipated.

-Right they were.
-Okay.

-I am plugged up.
-No, I got it.

Do it, Brian. Do it.

(SNICKERING)

It's me as a pillow.

You know what, Brian?
I could really use some milk of magnesia.

Okay. Well, I'll go pick some up.

Thanks, Brian. I love you.

And if you're going out,
get some milk of magnesia.

Yeah. You just said that.

(GIGGLING)

RITA: <i>I am plugged up.</i>

(GIGGLING)

(SIGHING)

-Wow, you are really pretty!
-Thanks.

-You know, I wrote a book.
-What's that?

-It's like a long magazine.
-Huh?

It's like the Internet made out of a tree.

Oh. Weird. You want to have sex
in the bathroom?

Oh, gosh! What a treat! Yes. Yes.
I would like that.

Boy, that took you a long time!
Did you have to wait for the streetcar?

Look, Rita. I have a confession to make.

I met a girl, I had a couple of drinks

-and I slept with her.
-You what?

I know. I feel awful.
It was a terrible thing to do.

I'm so sorry. It'll never happen again.

But there's an upside.
You see, these past few weeks

I've been doubting
whether we're compatible.

You know, because of the age difference.

But I realized that
that doesn't matter.

What I get from you
is what I always wanted,

a smart, sexy, real person

who I can talk with
and share every piece of me with.

I had a moment of weakness today,
but, in a way, it's all right

because it's taken me to a place
where I now realize

that you're not too old for me.

Isn't that great?
You're not too old for me!

You know what, Brian?
You're not old enough for me.

-What?
-You cheated on me.

That's what happened today.

You can rationalize it any way you want,

but to me, all that shows
is that you're an immature guy

who doesn't realize what a catch I am.

I'm sorry, Brian, but you screwed up.
Now please go.

-But, Rita...
-Go!

You can leave my apartment key
on the davenport.

-Here?
-No, the davenport, the chesterfield.

-On this?
-No. Does that look like a divan to you?

-Here?
-Leave them on the chifforobe.

You know what?
Just take your (BLEEP) keys.

I don't know what the (BLEEP)
you're talking about.

Hi, Chris.
How'd you do on your science test?

I got a D.

A D? That's fantastic!

Just kiddin'. I know it means you suck.

Come here, you delightful idiot.

Another D, Chris?

I'm sorry, Mom, but science is so hard.

Well, maybe you just need
a little extra help.

Dad, would you help me
with my homework?

Uh, Chris, I've got to
tell you, that sounds worse

than a trip to a failing mall.

All right, kids, your mom is

going to go to the Cinnabon
that has the cage

pulled halfway down, and I'm going to go

to the stereo store next
to the dead fountain with garbage in it.

Let's say we meet back here
under the glue outline

of the old Limited sign.

Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

Every time I try to study, the evil monkey

comes out of my closet and scares me.

Oh, for God's sake, Chris,
you're in high school now.

Stop talking about that evil monkey.

-He's not real.
-He is to real!

I can prove it!

Well, you'll have to do a better job
than you did on your science test.

Or than God did when he left the iron
on Ellen Barkin's face too long.

(SIZZLING)

Oh, damn.

-How is it?
-You know what?

We'll put you in the '80s.
You'll pass for hot.

<i>Call to get your tickets now!</i>

Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

<i>But not now, 'cause it just sold out.</i>

What? Oh, no! No! No, no! No!

I'm calling anyway!

I need <i>Hannah Montana </i>tickets
and I need them now!

Never mind who this is!
Can you get them or not?

I guess I should dial something first.

What are you watching?

<i>Sorry, but you know the rules.</i>

<i>Hannah can't do the photo shoot</i>

-(CANNED LAUGHTER)
<i>-Shut up! This is real.</i>

Ha! You're watching <i>Hannah Montana?</i>

Well, yeah. To make fun of it.

I mean, look how stupid
she is with her clothes

and her makeup and, and-and, and,

and that fabulous hair and, oh, my God!

Brian, it's my favorite show!
It's my favorite show ever!

-Gay.
-And she's coming to town

and I have to get tickets, Brian.

-You have to help me get tickets!
-No.

It's a stupid show
and a huge waste of time.

(VOICE BREAKING)
But... she's my favorite.

Oh, my God, are you... Are you crying?

(CRYING) Yes!
Hannah Montana is my hero!

I love her so, so much.

And this is the only time
she's gonna be in town

and now I'll never get to see her!

Will you help me?

(SIGHS) All right, fine.

Hey, Chris.

-You want to practice kissing again?
-I'm busy.

I set up a video camera
last night so I can prove

to Mom and Dad that
the evil monkey is real,

and I want to see what I got.

(INAUDIBLE)

(TAPE SQUEALS WHILE FAST-FORWARDING)

(FAST-FORWARDING)

Huh. Nothin'.

All right, it's time to play rough.

I got you, you bastard!

Well, here he is.

The evil monkey!

Do you believe me now?

Holy crap!

It is real!

Oh, my God! I thought I was the only one.

Meg, we're... We're doin'...

We're doin' Chris' monkey.

Oh, my God, Chris was right!

Holy crap, Chris, is that thing dangerous?

Yes, he's evil!

I'm not really evil.

(GASPS) It talks!

If-If someone will please untie me,

I'll explain everything.

No, Dad, don't do it!

He's evil!

Look, just trust me.

This is all a huge misunderstanding.

Chris, I think we should give him a chance
to explain himself.

No!

(SIGHS) Thank you very much.

Now, I know this looks bad,

me living in your son's closet and all,

but it's a very complex situation.

You see, basically, I got home
from work one day,

and found my wife cheating on me
with another monkey.

Oh, that's terrible.

I fell into a deep depression
after the divorce,

which ended up costing me my job.

All my money was gone,
which means I lost the house.

So, I moved into Chris' closet,

just until I got back on my feet again.

Wound up living in there for nine years.

Oh, my God, you've missed so much!

Like when America was attacked

by mentally challenged suicide bombers.

<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

(BICYCLE BELL DINGS)

You know something?

You're not evil at all, are you?

No, he's not.

He's just a poor fellow
who's down on his luck.

Easy for you to say!

He doesn't hide in your closet
making a scary face!

That's just the face
I make when I'm thinking.

And you're always pointing at me!

I was trying to start a conversation.

And you do that weird trembling thing!

I have a copper deficiency.

Look, Chris, I'm sorry
if I scared you before,

but this is a great chance
for us to start over.

No, it isn't!

You can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me!

You go to hell!

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

Okay, now remember to play it cool.

Act like you belong here.

Oh, my God, Miley! I love you! I love you!

I love you! I'm your biggest fan!

Can I touch your hair? (SHRIEKS)

Who are you guys?
How did you get back here?

Look, I'm really sorry about this.

This is my friend Stewie.

H-He's just a baby and
he's your biggest fan and...

he has cancer.

Oh, my God! Really?

Yeah, he's got a tumor in his head
the size of a football.

I think I can see it.

Well, in that case,

I wouldn't feel right
about throwing you out.

Especially if you're my biggest fan.

(SHUDDERS HAPPILY)

I mean, Sarah Silverman
is just one of the most

wonderful people you'll ever meet.

Oh, that's so good to hear.

I want to like her. She's so funny.

I want her to also be nice.

Well, I'm glad you guys are
having such a great time

with that evil thing
that tortured me for years!

Dad, I thought you were going to help me
with my book report.

Chris, there is a monkey here.

And I just fed him a whole
bag of Subway sandwiches.

In a couple hours,
we are going to sit around

and throw his soft bread stool
at each other.

Now, you are welcome
to be a part of that.

Or not.

I'm just telling you what's gonna happen.

Well, thanks for nothing, Dad!

Don't mind him, monkey.

He's just a big disappointment.

Like things that look
like DVDs from far away.

(GASPS) DVDs!

Aw, books.

(SCRATCHING)

Ah, that feels so good.

You are an artist.

Thank you.

Lois doesn't like my toenails

'cause they stab her in the night.

Good for this family.

Good for all of us.

Mom! Dad!

I got an A on my book report!

That's wonderful, honey!

Congratulations, Chris.
What'd you write about?

I, um...

"The Slave Trade Allegory
of <i>Curious George."</i>

W-Wait a minute, I didn't...
I didn't write this.

Oh, really?

Did... Did you write this?

Well, I can't take all the credit.

I've been listening to you talk
in your sleep for years,

so I just put your
thoughts on paper, that's all.

Wow, that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

Thanks, evil monk... Thanks, monkey.

Ah, I'd get up to hug you,
but sittin' down's

the only thing keepin' the poop in.

Nah, that's okay.

I can't believe I'm sitting here

with you, Miley Cyrus.

It's like I'm in a dream.

Well, that makes me happy, Stewie.

What are you doing?

Oh, I'm just writing some new lyrics.

Oh, you write your own lyrics?

-Yeah.
-So do I...

Oh, you wrote a song?

Look at you.

You're a regular little Tim McGraw.

(CHUCKLING) Oh, oh, I'm...

I'm-I'm a little better than Tim McGraw.

Hey, these are pretty good, Stewie.

Really?

Do you think you could sing them?

Only if you sing with me.

Hey, where you guys been?

We went to the father/son barbecue.

You drove all the way up
to Fatherson for a barbecue?

No, Dad, it was a barbecue
for fathers and sons.

Wait a minute... You went with the monkey
to a father/son thing?

Well, it's not like you ever
take me anywhere.

-What?
-Oh, listen, Peter, I didn't...

-Meg, please!
-It's true.

You never want to do anything with me!

But the monkey's been taking me
to all the fun places I like,

and he's been helping me
with all my homework!

He helped me get an A in algebra!

How did the monkey know you
needed help with algebra?

Because he asked!

That's right, Dad.

You never ask, and even if you did,

you never listen!

And now you're getting
mad at the monkey

because he actually cares?

Screw you!

You are the worst dad
in the world and I hate you!

Well... Well, I hate you, too!

Ah, damn.

I left my cell phone up
at that monkey/kid barbecue.

I thought you said it was
a father/son barbecue.

Yeah, but it was up in Monkeykid.

What?

Boy, you guys have been
awful quiet this morning.

Lois, could you ask Chris
to pass the maple syrup?

Meg, could you tell Dad

that he's too fat
to need extra syrup?

Lois, could you tell Chris that I'm sorry

I ever planted the seed version
of him in your vagina?

I want you two to stop this.

This is no way for
a father and son to act.

Well, according to him,
that stupid monkey's

more of a father to him than I am.

He makes time for me
and you never do.

You're supposed to love me
and all you do is hurt me.

This morning I had a hard poo that hurt,

but then it felt great.

Meg, I'm trying to be mad right now,

but that's making me want to smile.

(LAUGHING)

This'll get Chris.

Hey, classmates.

Griffin. Did you gain weight?

Eh, that's not important.

But you know what is important?

I'm gay now.

Let's all of us go be
gay somewhere together.

And then you go tell all your friends

that I welcome them
to be gay with me, too.

Because I am gay.

I'll be gay with you.

Oh, this is too perfect.

Chris is going to be
so gay by the end of this.

What's this?

"Put your head between
these two restrained logs

"and win a free hat"?

Well, that's a no-brainer.

Come on, you fat (BLEEP).

Do it.

(LAUGHING)

Who's laughing now?

I got my hat.

Hey, guys. I stopped at Pinkberry

and I got some for everybody.

-Wow, thanks.
-You're welcome.

I've got to go put on my face
for press interviews.

-Stewie, can you hand me my cell phone?
-Oh, sure.

(STATIC CRACKLES)

Thanks!

That was weird... Did you hear that

when I was giving her the phone?

-No.
-It was like, interference or something.

Wait a second.

(BOTH GASP)

Oh, my God!

Miley Cyrus is an android!

Of course.

She's a product of Disney Imagineering.

Yes, assuring that she could never fail.

Like famous duelist Sir Henry
"Giant-Hole-In-The-Torso" Wickenshire.

Aha! Right through me!

Prepare for returned fire,
Sir Joseph Broadfront.

I give you one last chance to rescind

your insult of calling
me a "common dandy."

Never!

My God, I can't believe she's an android.

Do you think we should
tell someone or do something?

Well, we could do something.

-Like what?
-Well, look at her.

She dances like a real girl.
She moves like a real girl.

Yeah?

Do you think she does other stuff
like a real girl?

You know, if you reprogrammed her?

Brian, that's sick! She's 16!

I'm eight.

All right, I'll see what I can do.

Hey, Miley.

Oh, hi, Stewie.

Hey, um, your shirt tag is showing.

There we go, all done.

Monkey, do you think you could help me?

I just can't stand Peter and Chris

Of course, Lois. I'm sure if we can just
get them in the same room together,

I can convince them to talk it out.

Why don't you invite Peter to lunch,

and I'll invite Chris,
and we'll see what we can do.

Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it.

What the hell are you doing here?

I thought I was meeting Lois.

She wanted me to talk to you guys

about the way you've been behaving.

Look, monkey,
Chris is being a jerk, all right?

And there is nothing you can say

that will make me
change my mind about that.

Peter, you're acting bananas.

(LAUGHS) All right, I'll listen.

You're both good guys
and that's why it's important

for you to reconcile your differences.

Chris, I know you're angry,

but do you really hate your father?

No, I just think he's a douche.

Sometimes he is.

And Peter, do you really hate your son?

No, but sometimes he's
such a little fat jerk.

Well, it's only because you
never have any time for me!

Peter, do you think you could make
a little more time for your son?

Yeah, I guess so.

You know, Brian, here's your shot.
Go for it.

Oop, too late.

No, it's not.

Thanks for everything, monkey.

You made me realize how much
Chris really means to me

and how I should always remember
not to take him for granted.

Well, sometimes all anybody needs

is a little bit of a wake-up call.

And now that you two
are getting along again,

my work here is done.

Guess I'll be moving on now.

You have to leave?

But I thought you were gonna go

back to living in my closet again.

I think that time of
my life is over, Chris.

But I'll always remember you.

But... where will you go?

I'll go where I'm needed.

Dad, there's an evil
monkey in my closet!

Oh, my God!

Hey, Quagmire, guess who
I'm talking to right now?

Yup.

Brian, will you take me down to babyGap?
I want to dress like a small douche.

-No. Maybe tomorrow or Tuesday.
-But you said you'd do it today.

I'm kind of tired.

For God's sake.
Cancel my Tuesday appointments.

Sure thing, Stewie.
You want me to move it to another day?

-No, no. Just cancel it.
-Okay, will do.

-Who the hell was that?
-Hmm?

There was another Stewie right there.

Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
I've been so damn busy lately,

my schedule's been so packed, I felt like
I needed some kind of an errand boy

to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass
stuff, so I cloned myself.

You... You cloned yourself?

-What, are you deaf?
-What...

-So he's an exact copy of you?
-Well, not exact.

I have to remain superior,
so I bred out some of the intelligence,

made him sort of a simpleton, you know?

I call him Bitch Stewie.
Would you like to meet him?

-Would you like to meet Bitch Stewie?
-Yeah. I guess.

Bitch Stewie, come here
and meet my friend, Brian.

Hey there, Stewie. Oh! What's that?
You got a friend?

I'm always happy to meet
one of your friends.

-Dear God.
-How do you do? Pleased to meet you.

-I'm Bitch Stewie.
-He's got quite a grip.

Hey, Bitch Stewie.
Why are there no midget accountants?

Because they always come up short.

(LAUGHING)

Another good one, Stewie.

I don't know where
you come up with them.

Isn't he wonderful?

And all I have to feed him is
a crude peanut paste.

Watch this.

-Oh, hello, Brian.
-Oh, there's your friend, Brian.

Hey, Brian. I sure did enjoy
talking to you the other day.

I'm just making sure
Stewie is nice and clean

for his trip to the playground
this afternoon.

We had a little bit of a problem earlier

because Bitch Stewie was
stooling in the tub, wasn't he?

I did some poos. I did some poos.
I didn't mean to.

But we've rectified that now
and everything's fine.

This is really weird.

I mean, it's one thing to have him
help you out with a busy schedule.

It's another thing to let him
wash your back.

Well, he does more than that, Brian.
Bitch Stewie, give me a bubble beard.

Look at me. I'm George Bernard Shaw.

(LAUGHING)

That's awful funny, Stewie.

I don't know who George Bernard Shaw is,
but you look like an old Stewie, Stewie.

Enjoy your weird bath.

I told him I did the poos
even though you did the poos, Stewie.

Did I do good, Stewie?

That was very correct of you,
Bitch Stewie.

You're a good helper.

REAGAN:<i> And what a lot of people don't</i>
<i>know is that I was Jane Wyman's first.</i>

<i>You might say I broke her Jane Wyman.</i>

-He sure is. And you know what else?

The ghost of Reagan is gonna be
the new fourth guy in our group.

I'm all for that!
What other stories you got, Reagan?

REAGAN:<i> Well, I remember the time</i>
<i>I invited Ed Sullivan to the White House.</i>

<i>He sounded a little something like this.</i>

(MIMICKING ED SULLIVAN)<i> Hey, Ron.</i>
<i>Tonight, we got a really big show.</i>

<i>In fact, you ought to go see his show</i>
<i>at the Mohegan Sun casino</i>

<i>next Saturday at 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.</i>

-Yeah, no (BLEEP).
-What?

Peter, that's not Ronald Reagan.
That's Rich Little. You're Rich Little!

He must be on his own ham radio.

LITTLE:<i> Well, you know, Ed,</i>

<i>the kids say you got to go viral</i>
<i>to promote yourself these days.</i>

So, this is not Reagan?

No, it's Rich Little.
He's an impressionist.

He's been screwing with your head.

Well, this thing is worthless.

Like my Palestinian alarm clock.

CLOCK: <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

-Hey, Peter. What's up?
-Hey, Quagmire.

Listen, I'm here to get my money back
for that ham radio.

Whoa, whoa, slow down there, partner.
All sales are final.

Yeah, but you were Agamemnon with me
during the sale.

-What?
-I just saw that word somewhere.

I wanted to use it.

Look, Peter, why don't you just go home
before you get hurt?

Well, I'm clearly not the only one
who was dissatisfied with his purchase.

Whoever bought that baby from you
obviously didn't want it.

A baby? I didn't sell a baby.

Look, there's a note.

"Glenn, this is your child.
Next time wear a condom, jerk."

-Oh, my God!
-Wait. Now, hang on, Quagmire.

-There's no guarantee it's your baby.
-Giggity.

Oh, I say that.

Well, the DNA test results are back.

This little girl is definitely
your baby, Quagmire.

What am I supposed to do?
I don't want a baby.

Look, somebody's got to take this kid
off my hands.

I can't be a father.

Well, Glenn, you don't have a choice.
This baby is your responsibility.

Now, I brought you a basket of things
to get you started.

There's baby clothes, some toys,
and some books.

Now, if you have any questions,
we're right across the street.

Hey, what's going on?

I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do with you.

There's some frozen steaks in the freezer.

Bathroom's down the hall to the right.

If you ever come home
and there's a tie on the door,

it means I'm frogging someone,
so give me at least a couple hours.

You smoke?

Stewie, what are you doing here?

I thought you were going
to Bobby Stalling's birthday party.

I hate that kid.
And I hate children's birthday parties.

I sent Bitch Stewie in my place.

What a great little party, Janet.

You know, I've never seen Stewie
come out of his shell so much.

Oh, no. It's not on his tail.
It's on his face. I've ruined it.

Oh, no. Well, that's okay, though.

Somebody else will come along
and get it right.

Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, Stewie.

I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
I've never been to a party before.

Want to watch me blow out the candles?

I would love to see that.

And gosh, Bobby,

I'd love to play
with some of your birthday toys,

but only after you've played with them
and only if you say it's okay.

You know, Stewie, I've got to say

that clone of yours
has come in pretty handy.

I don't suppose you'd consider
making one of those for me, would you?

(LAUGHING) Maybe. What would you
be willing to do for me?

What do you want?

Take your index finger and your thumb

-and lightly grip the base of your tail.
-What?

Lightly grip the base of your tail
with your index finger and your thumb,

and then slide your fingers
up the length of your tail to the tip.

-Why?
-Because that's what I asked you to do.

That's kind of weird.
Is this some kind of sexual thing?

Nobody said anything about sexual.
There's nothing sexual about it.

I'm just asking you to
perform a simple task.

Take your index finger and your thumb
and lightly grip the base of your tail,

and run your fingers along
the length of your tail.

-You mean stroke it?
-Nobody used that word.

This is not a stroking motion.

This is a completely nonsexual thing
I am asking you to do

in a completely nonsexual way.

Squeeze the base of the tail lightly
with your thumb and index finger.

And then, while continuing to squeeze,

run them up the length of your tail
to the tip,

and I'll make you a clone.

-I only have to do it once?
-I'll tell you when to stop.

(CHUCKLES) I don't know why you're
stopping. Nobody told you to stop.

Give me a little smile.

Your lips look a little dry.
Why don't you wet them a little bit?

(LAUGHING)

My God, you're so weird!
All right, I'll make you a clone, buddy.

She's a beautiful little girl, Glenn.
Have you given her a name yet?

Yeah, I named her Anna Lee,

but I'm probably just gonna
call her Annal for short.

-That's funny.
-Thank you.

Anyway, thanks for all the baby stuff.
What's that big tarp over there?

That was Chris's blankie
from when he was a baby.

Yeah. He was a big kid.

Almost split Lois in half
coming out of her.

It's true. I never mention this
because I don't want him to feel bad,

but after he was born,
they had to rearrange most of my organs.

Oh, yeah, he dragged half of Lois
right out with him.

Yeah, the doctor said I'll be lucky
if I live past 50,

but Chris is healthy
and I thank God for that.

Oh, there you are, Brian.
All right, you ready to meet your clone?

Am I ever. I've got a to-do list
three pages long for him.

Okay. Now, I want to qualify this
by reminding you that as with my clone,

the intelligence level is reduced a bit.

That's good.
We don't want him thinking too much.

Yeah, well, I might have dialed yours back
a little more than I ought to have.

-What do you mean?
-Brian, meet Bitch Brian.

Hi, Brian. You got some stuff
you want me to do for you?

Oh, my God.

Yeah, that's kind of what I said, too.

You know, I'll be honest with you, Brian.
Here's what happened.

I didn't really want to do the work,
so Bitch Stewie sort of did it.

Hey, Stewie. How'd the clone turn out?

Brian, I can't go to the bathroom
by myself.

Will you please help me?
But I'm good at other stuff.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

-Hello, Candy.
-Hi, Glenn.

Come on in.

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

-So, how long you been in beauty school?
-Two months.

Well, tonight we're doing facials.

(ANNA LEE CRYING)

Oh, God. Hang on a second.

Okay, okay, stop. Just stop crying.
Stop crying, Anna Lee.

No wonder. You dropped your pacifier.

-You have a baby?
-Yeah, it's a long story.

Damn kid's kept me up
every night for two weeks.

Now, where were we? Giggity Giggity...

(SNORING)

CANDY:<i> Glenn, you fell asleep,</i>
<i>so I took off.</i><i>It's probably for the best.</i>

<i>I've never had sex before, and I probably</i>
<i>wouldn't have been much good at it.</i>

(SCREAMING)

(ANNA LEE CRYING)

That's it. That kid is out of here.

Hey, there's another note.

"Glenn, this is your child.
Next time wear a condom..."

Oh, that's the note from earlier.

I need a file cabinet.

So it's just not working out,
me being a father.

And that's why I'm wondering
if you and Lois

would be willing to adopt the baby.

Oh, boy, Quagmire.
I don't know that we can do that.

We can barely take care
of the two we have.

Now, now, this is just a suggestion.
Just throwing it out there.

Have you considered abortion?

Peter, I think it's too late for that.

Don't let the press
put the scare into you.

<i>Wade v. Boggs</i> has not been overturned.

Yeah, but you can't really abort
a live baby.

Oh, boy, they have got you.
Glenn, Glenn...

(WHISPERING) Give her back to God.

Peter, I'm gonna go ahead
and move the conversation forward.

Is there any way
you guys could take Anna Lee?

No, Quagmire.
We got enough kids of our own.

Plus old Brian over there. Right, buddy?

I sharpened a pencil in my bum
and now I need a Band-Aid.

You're doing the right thing, Quagmire.

All right, Quagmire,
just so you're clear on the law.

Once you give this child up
to the adoption agency,

you can no longer abort it.

Hello, sir. Do you wish
to put this child up for adoption?

Yeah, it's not working out.
I need to get her out of my hair.

Well, we can help you there.
Is it a boy or a girl?

It's a girl. Her name's Anna Lee.

Oh, beautiful name.
Let me take her from you.

Well, go on, Quagmire. Give her the baby.

I will. I just...

Oh. Here.

-She... She'll go to a good home, right?
-Oh, yes.

She'll be somewhere safe, right?

Like, you're not gonna put her
with Sand People, right?

-You mean, like from <i>Star Wars?</i>
-(LAUGHING) No, no, no, no, no.

Brian, I didn't know if you wanted
a God's Eye, but I made you one.

Okay, thank you.
Did you wash my car like I asked?

-No, but I hit it with a rock.
-Okay, thanks.

Brian, I think my jaw is falling off.

(EXCLAIMING)

Stewie, what is happening to this thing?

Oh, yeah. Turns out the clones
aren't too stable, Brian.

I've been having some trouble
with mine, too.

Hey, Stewie.
Everything sounds like rushing water,

and I can't stand up so very good.

Yeah, I figure they've got less than
a minute before they dissolve completely.

-Hey, Brian, knock-knock.
-Who's there?

(FARTING)

(LAUGHING)

Whoa! I hope that doesn't happen to me.

He took my dry cleaning and I have no idea
what he did with the ticket.

Yeah, this was not a fruitful endeavor.

I'm not proud of this,
but I need to lick that up.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

This'll be great, Quagmire.

A nudie bar is the perfect way to
celebrate your first night without a baby.

Yeah, Peter. This is great.
I feel like myself again.

I'll tell you, my life was so dominated
by that baby. I'm glad she's gone.

Yeah. You know, sometimes you just
got to make a decision and go with it.

Like when I decided to try
that radical penis enlargement.

-Peter, I don't think...
-Brian, your objections are duly noted.

Now, hit the gas.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

You know that would never work again
in a million years.

Don't need it to, Brian.

That stripper has a rash on her ass
just like Anna Lee used to get.

Yeah.

And that other stripper's
sitting on that guy's lap

-just like Anna Lee used to do.
-I guess.

And that stripper only has one tooth,
just like Anna Lee.

-Quagmire, you feeling okay?
-I don't know.

I think I might have made
a terrible mistake.

I abandoned my daughter.

Why did I give away my only daughter?

(SOBBING)

Oh, God!

He'll be fine.
We shouldn't let this ruin our night.

-Let's just enjoy the strippers.
-I guess.

I just hate the way that one
gets so into her work.

You boys have been very naughty.

I'm gonna have to assign you
extra homework.

Darn it. Fractions are so hard.

-What did you get for number four?
-She said don't share answers!

All right, here it is. 625 Maple.
That's the family that adopted Anna Lee.

Hey, wait. Wait, guys!

Well, it's just me and my old nemesis,

First Step.

(LAUGHING) Hey, Joe, what you doing?
You out for a walk?

I hate this block.

(GASPING) There she is. There's Anna Lee.

Hang on, Anna Lee. I'm coming.

It's them.

Look at her. She looks so happy.

Almost like she belongs there.
They look like a real family.

I can't take her away from this.

JOE: What's happening?

He's not gonna go through with it.

It's a nice family,
and the kid'll be better off here.

JOE: Oh, that's sweet!
What's the inside of the house look like?

Colonial. Furniture's pretty good.
Possibly imported area rug.

JOE: Oh, that's nice!

A bit pricey, but for the money
you're spending, you know,

it's not a bad way to go!

Yeah, for the money.
You ready to go, Quagmire?

Yeah.

You know, I got to tell you.
I think you did a good thing.

Well, I guess I just realized
it's not about me.

This family is what's best for Anna Lee.

This is her home now. I got to let her go.

I'm proud of you, Quagmire.

Thanks, man. Hey, who knows?
Maybe I'll bump into her in 18 years.

What?

Did you really think I was gonna
change that much?

Good night, everybody!

-You know, I'm sick of looking at that.
-What?

That empty space! It just reminds me
that Cleveland's not here anymore.

Yeah, it's just not the same without him.
I sure wish he...

Hey, guys, look!

It's him! Hey, Cleveland!

Why didn't you tell us
you were back, buddy?

Oh, it's a lamp.

You know, guys, I've been thinking.

We need a new fourth guy for our group.

We're a man short,
like Statler without Waldorf.

(LAUGHS)

You know, without the other guy yapping
in my ear, these guys aren't half bad.

Now, I know you're interested in being

the fourth guy in our entourage,
Kevin Connolly,

but don't you think you're a little small?

Listen, I tell you what.

You can be in our group
if I can have some of your cereal.

Oh, no!
They're after me Kevin Connolly charms!

How's your friend search going?

-(SIGHING) Not great, Lois.
-What friend search?

We're just trying to find a friend
to replace Cleveland.

We've been meeting people
for the past three days.

Well, you don't need to look for somebody
new. I'll hang out with you guys.

Yeah. You know, I don't think
that's gonna work out, Brian,

'cause of the whole Quagmire thing.

-What Quagmire thing?
-You know, just that he hates you.

-Quagmire hates me?
-Hates you.

I don't get it. Why...
Why wouldn't Quagmire like me?

Because he thinks you're annoying,

like people who never shut up
about their kids.

He would have been four today.

I still don't understand.

How do you drown in an inch of water?

(SOBBING)

Well, I guess I don't have
a new sweater and a haircut.

(SIGHS) Who would have thought it would
be this hard to replace Cleveland?

You know, guys, we've kind of been
ignoring the obvious here.

I mean, if you really break it down,
what we need is a black guy.

Yeah, that was the best thing
about Cleveland.

Oh, by far. I sure do miss him.

Peter's right!
We got to find another black guy!

Yeah, because otherwise,
we're just a bunch of boring white guys,

like a London gentlemen's club.

Hey, you guys want to enter
the darts tournament?

First prize is free drinks all night.

Well, we'd love to, Horace,
but there's only three of us.

JEROME: Did I hear some sorry-ass fools
in need of a mother-loving fourth?

I'll join your darts game.

How do we know you're any good?

Gentlemen, we got us a black man.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, boy! What a fantastic evening!

Jerome, you are a wonderful addition
to our group.

Hey, thanks, Peter. I like you guys, too.

What do you say we hit another bar?
Keep it going?

I can't. There's a girl tied up in
my basement who needs some food.

That's funny. You funny, pointy man.

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Yeah.
I joke around a lot.

Thanks for the lift home, Jerome.

Hey, if you got time to come in,
I'd love for you to meet my wife.

I got time for whatever I want, fool.
My watch don't tell time. I tell it.

Wow! You're cooler
than a York Peppermint Pattie.

When I bite into a York Peppermint
Pattie, I get the sensation

of being on a frozen mountaintop!

<i>It has been two months</i>
<i>since I made the tragic choice</i>

<i>and still I have made no progress</i>

<i>The only food I have is the rest of this</i>

<i>back to the top of the mountain.</i>

...of being on a frozen mountaintop!

Hey, Lois, I'd like you
to meet our new friend...

-Jerome?
-Loose Lois?

What? You guys know each other?

Know each other?

Peter, Jerome is an old boyfriend of mine.

-What?
-(YAWNS)

Sorry, I was out of it.
Wait, are we being robbed?

Peter, I know I told you about Jerome.

Lois, I would have remembered
if you had told me that.

I told you, Peter.
I remember exactly what we were doing.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

I slept with a black guy.

I hope this doesn't
make you feel awkward, my man.

It was a long time ago.

Hey, that's a beautiful baby.
Mind if I hold him?

Go right ahead.

Hey there, little fellow.

What's that around your neck?

Well, I say! It's a little black Jesus.

WOMAN: (SINGING)<i> Black Jesus</i>

I rode into town on an ass, yo mama's ass.

WOMAN: (SINGING)<i> Black Jesus</i>

It was really good to see you, Lois.

We should grab a coffee or something
and catch up.

Oh, that would be great.
It was really nice to see you, too.

Well, it's getting late, Jerome.
I'm sure you've got stuff to do.

Yeah. I got to go down to the gas station
and buy a framed painting of a tiger.

Catch you all later.

You're not really gonna
hang out with him, Lois, are you?

We're just friends, Peter.
Don't tell me you're jealous.

Well, you dating that guy,
it's just a lot to take in.

(LAUGHING) Oh, you... You're telling me.

Come on!
Those kinds of jokes aren't helping!

Well, what do you want me to say?

You're being silly. I mean,
Jerome and I dated over 12 inches ago.

(LAUGHING) I said "inches."

-What did I just say?
-I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Okay, look, just relax.
You're my husband and I love you,

so just put Jerome out of your head.

Get him out of my life is more like it.

Brian, I just found out Chris Farley died.

Yeah, that happened, like, 12 years ago.

But I just watched <i>Tommy Boy</i> yesterday.
He was right there.

Yeah, that's a movie. It's shot
beforehand. It's not happening right now.

Really? But I thought my knocking
on the TV glass distracted him,

and that's what made him
fall down that hill.

(CHUCKLING) Seeing him fall down that hill
put me in a good humor.

Stewie, get lost.

What are you doing just standing out here?

I'm waiting for Quagmire to get his mail.

I'm gonna conveniently stroll by
and strike up a conversation with him,

and maybe find out why he hates me.

I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
You'll smooth it over.

Hey, Quagmire. What a coincidence!

You and me just running into each other.
How're you doing?

Fine.

Taking a break, huh?
She's a hot piece of ass.

And from the looks of it,
she likes it rough.

That's my sister, Brian. Her boyfriend
has been beating her mercilessly.

The last thing she'd want right now
is to be objectified.

Oh, God, I'm really sorry.

I got a deaf brother!
You want to make fun of him, too?

(TIRES SQUEALING)

JEFF: Where is she?
QUAGMIRE: She's not here!

QUAGMIRE'S SISTER: Get out, Jeff!
Just get out of here!

JEFF: I'll get out when I'm finished!

(THUDDING)

You feel good
about your sex joke earlier, Brian?

He's savagely beating her again!
You hear that?

Yeah. I'm not deaf.

What? Like my brother?
Boy, you have no class!

JEFF: Yeah, that's the guy's brother, man.
QUAGMIRE'S SISTER: Yeah!

JEFF: Shut up, bitch!

Hey, you know what they say.

See a broad, to get that booty, yak them.

BOTH: Leg her down
and smack them, yak them.

Cold got to be.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

-Golly.
-If you'll excuse me,

I'm gonna order me some cheap cognac
and put it in a fancy glass.

Boy, Jerome is the greatest!
We really lucked out.

I don't know, you guys.
I'm not so sure about Jerome.

I mean, how do we know
we can really trust him?

What are you talking about, Peter?
Jerome's awesome.

Yeah. Why the hell
wouldn't we be able to trust him?

All right, you guys want the truth?

Before me and Lois were married,

our new friend used to slip her
the old Pringles can.

Well, so what, Peter?
That was 20 years ago.

That doesn't matter!

Look, Peter. Jerome's the coolest guy
we've met since Cleveland left.

Yeah, don't do anything
to ruin this, Peter.

You know, the way you ruined my parrot.

I just bought it yesterday.
Isn't it beautiful?

Cripple, cripple, cripple,
cripple, cripple,

cripple, cripple, cripple,
cripple, cripple!

-Cripple.
-Damn it!

That son of a bitch!
Thinks he can sleep with my wife.

Not on my watch!

ALEX KEATON: (ON TV) <i>Listen, I don't care</i>
<i>that you're dating Mallory.</i>

<i>Nobody in this family likes you, Nick.</i>

You just stand your ground,
garbage-sculpture man.

They'll come to respect you.

You bastard!

Nick was no good for her
and it broke Skippy Handelman's heart!

Dear God and Black Jesus!

Jerome? What the...
What the hell are you doing here?

Oh, Peter, something terrible's happened.

Somebody burned down
Jerome's house last night.

This whacked-out world!

It just makes you
want to grab your nephew

and get in a van
and shoot people in the DC area.

Yeah, well, when I find the guy who
did it, I'm gonna rip his arms off

and do his wife in front of him!

And no one would blame you.

But meanwhile, Jerome, you are
more than welcome to stay with us.

-What?
-Oh! Well, thank you, Lois.

Man, I'm so lucky to have real friends
like you and Peter!

Well, I guess you can stay here.

But I'll tell you one thing...

Hang on a sec.

What is that?

I don't know. It's trying to do something.

Oh. Well... Well, I guess
we're just gonna have to wait.

So, how long is Jerome
gonna be staying with us, Dad?

I don't know, Chris, but the sooner
he's out of here, the better.

I don't trust him
around Lois for a second!

LOIS: Oh, God, Jerome, that is so good!

Oh, yeah, it's so hot and moist!

Mmm! These scones are delicious.
You are quite the little baker, Jerome.

-Oh, thank God!
-What's going on in here?

Relax, Mr. Furley.
I thought what you thought, but it's okay.

Well, it sounded like...

I know. I know, but it's fine.
Go back to being dead.

Peter, is everything all right?

Yeah. Yeah, Lois. Everything's fine.

You guys having a little breakfast?

Yes, and Jerome made scones.
Would you like one?

Oh, they're delicious!

I thought maybe later today,
we could all...

(COUGHING)

(CHOKING)

Oh, my God! Mom's choking!

Out of the way! I'm an EMT.

(GRUNTING)

Her airway's jammed.

Come on now. Just like that.

I need some gravitational help.

Oh, no! Her clothes are constricting.

As are mine!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(PANTING) Oh, my God!

Thank you, Jerome. You saved my life!

Um, "I'll have what she's having,"
says the funniest person in the room.

Hey, what are you getting
all dressed up for?

I'm treating Quagmire to a night out.

Really? I thought he hated you.
How did you convince him to go?

I tricked him, sent him a phony card.

He thinks he's going on a date
with an old girlfriend.

-But instead, you're going to show up.
-You got it.

Yikes! That's a recipe for disappointment,

like walking a floral arrangement
through an office full of fat women.

Is there a Miss...es?

(ALL SIGH IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

-Oh. Brian? Where's Cheryl Tiegs?
-Well, she's not coming.

I wrote you that because I knew
you'd never come if it was me.

But I planned a big night,
and we're gonna have a great time.

Brian, Cheryl was the one that got away.

She was the great love of my life.

I thought this was my chance
to finally achieve some real happiness.

Ever since she left,
I've been chasing girls

to fill the hole she made
when she walked out.

Now I'm forever lost!

Well, I bet a thick, juicy steak
could help fill that hole, huh?

(CRYING)

Oh, come on! It'll be great.

Listen, Glenn, I want us to be friends.

I think we could be an even better team
than Lewis and Clark

and the guy who likes to rip up maps.

-All right, the Northwest Passage.
-Hey, could I see that?

Damn it! You ass!

-Easy, Clark.
-I hate that guy!

-It's been a long trip. You're tired.
-No! I hate him!

Look, you're angry. You're dehydrated.

Just have some water from the canteen
and you'll feel better.

(SIGHS) Okay.

I just totally drowned this ant hill.

Hey, when are we gonna get there?

Ah! And this is Peter
and I at our wedding.

Oh, you look beautiful,
and he's a handsome fellow, ain't he?

PETER: Well, I am ready for my evening.

Oh, my God! Peter, what the hell?

Peter, what are you doing?

PETER: Surely, Jerome,
you don't want to stay in the same house

as a ghost who carries a torch around?

(IMITATING A GHOST)

Fire ghost! You scared yet?

Didn't know this place was haunted,
did you?

Peter, take that thing off!

Hey, what the hell's going on?

I'll tell you what's going on!

I have had about enough of you, Jerome!

I know you want my wife,
but you can't have her!

You are no longer welcome in my house!

What you talking about, Peter?

(LAUGHS) But you can't have sex with Lois!
Now, I want you out of here right now!

(SIGHS) I can't believe this.

I thought I found a true friend in you.

I'd never do anything
to hurt you or your family.

Now you're breaking my heart.

Jerome, wait.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

I'm sorry, Lois.
I think it would be better if I left.

Peter, I'm sorry
if I caused you any trouble.

I won't be bothering you again.

Wow! What just happened was kind of sad.

(HUMMING SAD TUNE)

So, whose leg do you have to hump
to get a dry martini around here?

(CHUCKLING)

Hmm.

God!
Look at the size of these steak knives.

What are they serving us,
<i>Tyrannosaurus rex?</i>

Not likely.

Hey, what if I just drank
this whole bottle of ketchup?

(GLUGGING)

(CHUCKLES) Can you imagine?
You dare me?

Kind of ruins it for the next person
who might want some ketchup.

-So, how's the flying business?
-Not so great.

The economy's sort of taking its toll.
Lot of salary cuts. A lot of layoffs.

-Yeah?
-That's pretty much it.

I mean, you want to learn more,
read the papers,

go on the Internet. I don't know.

Boy, that's got to be an interesting job!

I bet you got... How do those things work?

-What? Planes? How does a plane work?
-Yeah.

You want me to sit here
and explain to you how a plane works?

-I don't know. Yeah.
-You want to maybe just go?

Quagmire, come on!
I'm really trying hard here.

Who asked you to try hard?

Nobody, but all... I'm trying
to establish a friendship with you.

All I've done is try to be nice to you
and you still don't like me.

How can you not like me?

Okay, I'll tell you.

You are the worst person I know.

You constantly
hit on your best friend's wife.

The man pays for your food
and rescued you from certain death,

and this is how you repay him?

And to add insult to injury,
you defecate all over his yard.

And you're such a sponge.
You pay for nothing.

You always say, "I'll get you later,"
but later never comes.

And what really bothers me
is you pretend you're this deep guy

who loves women for their souls
when all you do is date bimbos.

Yeah. I date women for their bodies,
but at least I'm honest about it.

I don't buy them
a copy of <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>

and then lecture them
with some seventh-grade interpretation

of how Holden Caulfield
was some profound intellectual.

He wasn't! He was a spoiled brat.
And that's why you like him so much.

He's you. God, you're pretentious!

And you delude yourself
by thinking you're some great writer,

even though you're terrible.

You know, I should have known
Cheryl Tiegs didn't write me that note.

She would have known
there's no "A" in the word "definite."

And I think what I hate most about you
is your textbook liberal agenda.

How we should "legalize pot, man."

How big business
is crushing the underclass.

How homelessness
is the biggest tragedy in America.

Well, what have you done to help?

I work down at the soup kitchen, Brian.
Never seen you down there.

You want to help? Grab a ladle!

And by the way, driving a Prius
doesn't make you Jesus Christ.

Wait! You don't believe in Jesus Christ

or any religion, for that matter,
because religion is for idiots!

Well, who the hell are you
to talk down to anyone?

You failed college twice,

which isn't nearly as bad
as your failure as a father.

How's that son of yours you never see?

But you know what?
I could forgive all of that, all of it,

if you weren't such a bore.
That's the worst of it, Brian.

You're just a big, sad, alcoholic bore!

(SIGHS)

I'll see you, Brian.
Thanks for the (BLEEP) steak.

Boy, it sure is nice having our house
to ourselves again, huh?

Lois?

Peter, sometimes you just make me
sick to my stomach.

Look, I know you think Jerome
was a good guy, but...

No. He was a good guy, Peter,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

And you're gonna feel like a real jackass.

-What's that?
-It's a gift for you.

You don't deserve it, but if anything,
it's gonna wake you up a little bit.

Jerome got you this as a thank you
for letting him stay here.

It's an actual prop from <i>Family Ties.</i>

This is one of Nick's garbage sculptures.

Yeah. Pretty thoughtful, isn't it?

Oh, boy, do I feel like a jackass!

Lois, I'm sorry. I just...
I let my jealousy get the best of me.

Jerome's such a cool guy.

And I guess I was worried he was
cool enough to steal you away from me.

You should know better than that, Peter.

Now, I think you have an apology to make.

Hey.

You look like you could use a pal.

Oh. Hi, Peter.

Look, I'm sorry about how I acted.
It's just Lois means everything to me.

And when I saw you together,
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

I just thought you might try to mount her
or whatever it is you guys do.

Peter, how could you even think that?

I would never
do anything like that to you.

You were my boy. We were like family.

Yeah, I know. I messed up bad.
I'm really sorry, Jerome.

We're cool, Peter. We're cool.

But, listen, there is something
I got to fess up to.

While I was living with y'all,

I had myself
lots of nasty-ass sex with Meg.

I don't care about that.

-Hey, Brian. How'd it go?
-Fine.

Have you been crying? What happened?

It didn't work. He still hates me.

Do you want to know something?
That's okay.

You don't need Quagmire to like you.

You only need one person to like you,
and that person is you.

And I'll tell you something else.
I like you.

Thanks.

-You want to sleep in my room?
-Yeah. That'd be nice.

-Good night, Brian.
-Good night, Stewie.

Going through your stuff.

Why were you getting MapQuest directions
to Abigail Breslin's house?

I just think she's a one-of-a-kind spirit,

and I don't want to see
her go down the wrong...

What the hell are you doing
going through my personal stuff?

You should really
clear your history.

I noticed you Googled yourself,
you egomaniac.

Whoa, whoa,
th-that wasn't me.

-Maybe Lois got on there.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

She's fascinated by things
that are going in my life and...

Oh. Oh, yeah.

Fine, I Googled myself, okay?

You got me.
But check this out.

I found a website for a group called

the Rhode Island Society
for Special Literary Excellence,

and they happen to have chosen
to read and discuss my book,

<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love.</i>

See? I knew it was
just a matter of time

before somebody would
recognize my genius.

Whoa, take it easy.

You're getting a bigger
head than Chris Matthews.

The economy's in the news today,
and Congress is considering

a minimum wage increase.

Live by satellite to talk about it,
Senator Harry Reid in Washington.

How about it, Senator Reid,
is this the right move

during the worst recession
since the 1930s?

Look, if we're gonna get
this economy back on track,

we have to get more money
in the pockets of hard-working...

Republicans are saying
this increase is gonna, in fact...

...Americans who are the backbone
of the American economy,

...put more people <i>out </i>of work
and make it harder

-...for American employers to compete...
-...instead of lining the pockets

-in the global marketplace.
-...of the ultra-rich

...who are the people who caused
this collapse.

-Wouldn't it? Senator, wouldn't it...
-Chris, if I could just...

Chris? If I could j... Chris, if I...

Senator, let me finish.

My forehead, my rules.

Let's go to Los Angeles.

Big actor, played the father
in <i>That 70's Show,</i>

Kurtwood Smith.

How's it going, Kurtwood?

Good. Thanks for having me.

Quagmire, it's so awesome that
you could come over after work today.

I know. I'm so psyched.
Hey, let's make some Kool Aid!

No, we got to wait
for Lois to do it.

No, we don't.
I know how to make Kool Aid.

No, Quagmire!
We're not a'sposed to...

(GASPS)

LOIS:
I'm home, Peter!

Oh, hi, Glenn...

Peter, can you
help me with the...

Oh, Peter Griffin!

Peter, you come out here right
now and clean up this mess!

No! You said I could
have two friends over,

and I didn't. Joe couldn't come!

So I only had one friend over,
and it was just me and Quagmire,

and I said we could make Kool Aid
instead of the other friend!

You come out here right now!

Bonnie's way cooler than you!

Joe has computer games!

Peter, it took me a half hour
to clean up all that Kool Aid.

I am sick as hell of you
constantly making a mess

of this house and having
to clean up after you.

So I hired a maid.

What, are you nuts?
We don't have the money for that.

Oh, really? And what about
the Peter Copter?

Did we not have money
for the Peter Copter?

Hey, did I say anything
when you bought that iron?

Whatever. I want you to meet Consuela.

Consuela, this is my husband, Peter,
and these are our children.

Oh. Hello, Mr. Peter.

Hello, Mr. Children.

Consuela's gonna be
our new housekeeper.

Why is she wearing makeup
like she's going out?

Is this "going out" for them?

Hey, where you going
all dressed up?

Oh, nowhere important.
Just this special dinner in my honor.

It's being thrown
by the Rhode Island Society

for Special Literary Excellence.

What's that?

Nobody said anything, Brian.

Oh, I thought someone just
asked why they're honoring me.

-No. Nobody asked that.
-Oh, okay.

I-It's no big deal. It's actually,

it's just you remember
the book I wrote,

<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love?</i>

They loved the book so much,

they want to give me their
most prestigious award.

Mmm.

Look, this is a really big deal.

It'd be nice to get some
support around here!

Oh, I'm sorry, Brian.
That's great news!

(LAUGHS) Yeah, what channel
will the awards ceremony be on?

Oh, are they having
an awards ceremony

for how well you did
the dishes last night?

Ha! You got nothing
going on.

Hi, Brian.

I'm Kathy from the book society.

So glad you could come.

Hi, there. Uh, you know,
I wasn't sure I had the right address.

Pizza parlor, huh?

Yeah. The group loves this place.
(CHUCKLES)

Oh, hey, this is fine.
I-I like this place.

It's... I'm a...

I'm a pizza dawg.

So, how long have
you been a member

of the Rhode Island Society
for Special Literary Excellence?

Oh, no, I'm not a member;
I'm their chaperone.

-Chaperone?
-Yeah, uh-huh.

We're in that section
right over there.

Hey! There he is!

It's Brian Griffin!

Damn it, Randy!
You just spilled my juice box!

Oh.

They absolutely love your book.

The simplistic writing style
is very graspable to them.

Here's your award.
I made it all by myself.

Thanks.

Hey, Brian!
Smell my finger!

I-I... I... I already can.

Lois was right.
I'm not a writer, I'm a joke.

I'm one big, fat,
ridiculous joke.

Well, maybe you just didn't
try hard enough, Brian.

You know what,
father from <i>Family Circus?</i>

All you do is judge other people.

Every day in the funnies,
all you do is judge.

Why don't you shut your
(BLEEP) mouth for once

and go home and (BLEEP)
your wife in the face!

You know what?

That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(SIGHS)
Almost home. Oh, my God!

(TIRES SCREECH)

Oh, please be okay,
please be okay, please be okay.

Oh, thank God!

Okay, you're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be o...

Oh, my God!

(TIRES SQUEAL)

Oh, my God, yes!

Brian killed a dog!

This is fantastic!

Oh, Mr. Swanson
is sleep-dragging again.

I'm flying.

I'm flying!

I clean in here?

Uh, yeah, that's fine.

I'm just reading the funnies,
so keep it down.

This is a very shocking

I swear to God, it sounded like

somebody had an accident
and maybe somebody got hurt.

What? Wh-What are you talking about?

Yeah, something must've gone down.
The cops were poking around.

What do you mean, like-like Joe?

No. Staties, man, Staties.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's

Hey, Brian, you want to see

what I drew in arts and crafts
at day care?

This is called "Happy Sun."

This one's called "Silly Space Man."

See? 'Cause he's in the forest.

And this one I call
"Alive Dog Burying Dead Dog."

This is a photograph!

-Oh, is it?
-Wait a minute.

-You saw the whole thing?
-Yes, indeed.

(LAUGHING) Oh, boy.

Have I been having some fun
at your expense, old man!

How could you do that to me?

Do you have any idea
how upset I am about all this?

I killed one of my own kind, Stewie.

How would you feel if
you killed a baby?

Well, I've killed seven, but the point is,
you might feel better

if you just confess
to what you've done.

(SIGHS)
Maybe you're right.

Everyone, I have something
very important to tell you.

-Is this about Meg's cervical cancer?
-What?!

(LAUGHING)
You always fall for that!

You can't always fall for that!
You-you just can't!

Go ahead, Brian.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Hi, Joe. Thanks for coming.

Okay, now that Joe's here,
I can say this in front of all of you.

Everyone...

I am a criminal.

A few nights ago,
I committed a murder.

Then I buried the body
and even went out of my way

to cover up the evidence.

Oh, my God!

These are very serious charges, Brian.

I know, and that's why I'm prepared
for you to arrest me

and take me to jail
where I belong.

I just couldn't take the stress anymore.
I had to come clean.

I mean, the truth is,
I didn't even stop

to find out if he had an owner.

-I just completely...
-Wait, wait, owner?

-What are you talking about?
-I just told you.

I hit and killed a dog with my car!

(LAUGHING)

What?

(LAUGHING)
Brian... it's a dog!

-That's not a crime!
-What do you mean?

Well... I mean,
it's not like you killed a person.

Or-or even ran over
somebody's mailbox.

Killing a dog is not a crime?

(LAUGHING)
Of course not!

Yeah, especially for you.

An animal killing another animal?
That happens all the time.

Hey, sweet ass,
last night was fantastic.

Hello? Where'd you go?

(GASPS)

(SCREECHES)

Oh. Well, then I guess
I worried for nothing.

Yeah, nobody cares
if a dog gets killed.

I could do it, Brian!
I could do it right now!

Nobody would say a thing!

I could blow your brains out
and they'd throw me a parade!

-What?
-I'm just screwing around, Brian.

Nobody cares.

Peter, what are you doing?

She's still here, Lois.

Wasn't she supposed to leave
like two hours ago?

I thought so.
Go ask her what she's doing.

I'm not asking her.
You go ask her.

Uh, Consuela?

I thought you finished cleaning hours ago.

Yeah, what are you still doing here?

I wait for rain to stop.

It's time for you to go home.

Is too much rain. I stay.

But it's gonna rain all night.

I sleep here.

Uh, I don't know about that.

I sleep here.

Can I get some covers over here?

No. No. You fat keep you warm.

No, no...

You know, Brian, I love it
here at the ice cream shop.

In fact, this is gonna
be my happy place.

If I ever get molested
or raped, this is the place

I'm gonna think of to make
everything all right.

That's great, Stewie.

-Hey, what's up your fanny?
-Nothing. I'm just...

I'm a little bummed out
from the other day.

I just can't believe
our society actually values

the life of a dog less than that
of a human. It's infuriating.

That is infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark

at a tree and chew on
your balls for an hour.

You know, that's the problem.
That's usually the way

I'd handle this kind of thing,
but not this time.

I mean, look at that dog over there.

You think he wants to be tied
to that chair,

waiting in the hot sun
while his owner gets ice cream?

Hell, no! I am gonna
make people see

that an animal's life is just
as important as a human's!

Go, fellow canine,
be free and enjoy life!

(SCREAMING) Oh, my God!
Help! Help!

It's killing my dog!

(SCREAMING)
He's got my neck!

(GROANING)

(GUNSHOTS)

(SOBBING) Oh, my God!
My dog is dead!

Maybe that's why
he was tied up.

Meg, will you take one of these
and pass it down, please?

-What's this?
-I'm starting a new advocacy group.

The Quahog Animal
Equal Rights League.

Our first meeting is tomorrow night,
and I'd really appreciate it if you guys

would come and show your support.

Well, of course we will, Brian.
We'd be happy to come.

Terrific. See, I thought
I'd start locally,

and then maybe try to merge
with one of the larger groups.

Oh, that's a great idea, Brian.
Maybe you could join PETA.

Join me for what?

No, PETA. The organization.

What organization?

-PETA.
-What?

PETA is an acronym, Peter.

No, I'm not! I'm Catholic!

Are we really doing this?

No, Peter, I'm just saying,
maybe if this meeting goes well,

Brian could be part of a PETA rally.

Somebody's having a rally for me now?

-No, for PETA.
-That's me! I'm Peter!

I'm not talking about you, Peter!
I'm talking about PETA!

Somebody better have something
to say to me pretty damn soon,

or I'm gonna have something
to say to them!

I am very busy!

I think Betty White is in PETA.

That doesn't even make any sense!

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Oh. Hi, Consuela.

Hello, Mr. Peter.

No school today,
so I bring my nephew, Mikey.

You want to buy light-up yo-yo?

Well... kinda.

Ugh, that's it. Peter, we have
got to get rid of her.

I couldn't agree more.
Just let me see if Mikey sells

those things with batteries
or what the situation is there.

Consuela, I'm sorry,
but this is not working out.

We're asking you to go.

No, I stay. I clean.

You don't understand.
You're fired.

No, I keep job.

Here. Here's $40
if you leave right now.

No. I stay.

God, she's more stubborn
than you are.

Daddy, I want a turn
on the swing set.

-No.
-But you've gone for two turns.

Get lost.

It looks like fun,
and I want to do it.

No, I'm doing it.
I'm gonna do a big jump-off.

Aah! Get Mom!

Mom! Mom! Mom!

Good evening, everyone.
I want to thank you all

for joining me at this
very important event.

Animals are treated
as second-class citizens

everywhere throughout
this nation.

We kill them for food,
we humiliate them as pets,

and we use them for
medical and cosmetic research.

Take a look.

Well, no. Steak is made
by killing cattle.

No medical research?

But how are we supposed
to find cures for disease?

Well, there are many more
promising research methods

for curing disease
than animal testing.

-Name one.
-I want a hamburger.

I have a sudden craving for quail.

No, no, you're missing the point.

We've got to change our way
of thinking.

Animals are miracles
of nature, just like humans,

but our society
hasn't figured that out.

Do you know that
in some Asian countries

they actually cook and eat dogs?

What?! Oh, no.

Are they... are they good?

Yeah, I wonder
what they taste like.

I would try it...
I mean, if everybody else was.

I'm adventurous.

You know what, you know what?
This is driving me crazy.

I want to eat a dog now.

I say we eat that one!

-What?!
-Get him!

he was also my best friend.

He was the smartest person I knew.

Nothing will ever be the same again.

Wow. I guess my life
does have meaning.

I never realized how important
I was to this family.

Wait a second.
Just to prove a point to me,

you burned down a liquor store
and murdered a dog?!

Well, a stray.

Thank you.

Well, I guess we should tell
them the truth now.

Well, hold... hold on a sec.

We could... probably let 'em go

in step with the rest of us

and this is sort of my way
of taking care of him.

Well, that's nice of you,
but it was so much simpler

when it was just you
and me doing our thing.

I know, but just let
him have this one.

Odds are he won't even come
back with the actual food.

Okay, Cheeseburger Helper,
you're on.

Yay!

Cheese, cheese,
cheese!

Yay!

I'm so sorry for your burden.

You're a good brother.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

So what do you think, Carter?
You having a good time?

I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to do with myself.

I'm very uncomfortable.

Why don't you get a lap dance,
Mr. Pewterschmidt?

No, Peter's Crippled Friend,
I think I'm just gonna leave.

This was a stupid idea.

Aw, come on, you just gotta
relax and cut loose.

Like those foreign
guys over there.

I can't believe
I'm back at the horse.

I had many drinks last night
and I was so hung out this morning.

Aw, me, too, friend.

I was blowing chinks like crazy.

Boy, this is fun, huh?

Except for the fact we gotta
sit next to that woman

who came with her
co-workers.

Huh, aren't we all pals?

I work at the office.

This is empowering.

Maybe I'll get a dance, huh?

You guys are probably gonna be
talking about this forever.

A woman who's so cool
with all of this?

Jackpot!

All right, there's
a cute-looking one.

Excuse me, miss?

This older gentleman
would like a lap dance.

What am I supposed to do?

Nothing. You just sit there
and enjoy yourself.

Do I... do I stick the money
directly inside of her?

No, you do not.

-Why, have you done that before?
-(LAUGHS)

Doesn't go over.
When do I hit her?

Oh, for crying out loud,
just drink this.

And you, give this old bastard
the ride of his life.

(LAUGHING) Yeah!

-All right, go, Carter! All right!
-Get some! Get some!

Hey, Joe, that's like
right in my (BLEEP) ear.

Stop it! Peter, I-I...

Whoa!

Boy, she's bendy!

(CHUCKLES) Wow! Y-Yes!

Oh! Awesome!

All right! Oh!

(GROANING)

Oh, my God!
What's happening to him?

I'm having a heart
attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack!

You ought to know by now!

Oh, my God!

Is my father gonna be okay, Dr. House?

He's in a coma, Mrs. Griffin.

And listening to the
sound of your voice,

I'd say he's the lucky one.

Oh, dear, I do hope
there's something to be done.

Dr. House, if you're gonna
save this patient,

you'll need this.

Get this thing outta my sight!

But wait a second!

How are you gonna play by the rules
if you don't have the rule boo... Oh!

My methods are a little
unorthodox, Mr. Griffin.

I think I can help.

-What are you doing?
-My job.

Sometimes people fake being in a coma.
This man's not.

Unless of course, the first
punch knocked him out.

In which case, we won't know
for some time.

<i>-House.</i>
<i>-Road House.</i>

That, too.

Any word on Carter's
condition yet?

No, it's been three days
and I'm really starting to get worried.

What if he's in a coma
for, like, 20 years

and he comes out of the coma
and you guys are all dead,

but I'm still alive
and I'm a famous race car driver,

and he's like "Aw, man,
Stewie turned out awesome."

And he comes to one
of my races

and I'm so surprised
to see him there, I crash,

and then I'm in a coma
for 20 years,

and I wake up
and he's a race car driver.

Stewie, do you want to be
a race car driver when you grow up?

Well, gosh, if you think
I'd be good at it.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hello, Mrs. Griffin,

I'm Kenneth Gould,
Mr. Pewterschmidt's attorney.

I'd like to talk to you
about a few things.

As part of Mr. Pewterschmidt's
estate planning,

he has left video wills

applicable to a wide
variety of situations.

<i>Hello, if you're watching this,</i>

<i>it means they didn't cut</i>
<i>the rope when I climaxed.</i>

<i>As a result, I'm now dead.</i>

KENNETH: That's not it.

<i>If you're watching this one,</i>

<i>it means the train wasn't</i>
<i>able to push the DeLorean</i>

<i>up to 88 miles per hour</i>
<i>and I'm still stuck in 1885.</i>

KENNETH: This could take a while.

<i>Eaten by sharks</i>
<i>while snorkeling...</i>

<i>...stabbed to death</i>
<i>in a Toys R Us bathroom.</i>

<i>...1940s roller skate</i>
<i>left in the hall.</i>

<i>Death by chocolate.</i> (LAUGHS)
<i>No, no, leave it in.</i>

<i>Had a heart attack</i>
<i>and have slipped into a coma.</i>

KENNETH: Here we go.

<i>In that case,</i>
<i>I leave control of my company,</i>

<i>Pewterschmidt Industries,</i>
<i>to my daughter Lois.</i>

What?!

I don't know the first thing
about running a billion-dollar company.

The board of directors is fully prepared
to run the company in Carter's absence,

if that's what you'd prefer, Mrs. Griffin.

Well, yes, I think that'd be best.

Well, now wait a second, Lois.

-I could run the company.
-You?

You can't run a business that size.

You have no experience.

You know what
that is, Lois?

That's you playing by the rule book.
And I don't play by the rule book.

-Right, Dr. House?
-Well, don't ask me.

My superiors think I'm crazy.

(GIBBERING)

Scared ya, didn't I?

<i>-House.</i>
<i>-House.</i>

And I'm gonna run
the company.

Well, Lois, I'm off to my first day
as a corporate bigwig.

I'm not so sure about this, Peter.
I mean, that's Daddy's company.

He spent his whole life
building it from the ground up.

And you don't know anything
about running a big business.

Whoa, whoa, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

Geez, you're a bigger downer
than a German bedtime story.

(MALE NARRATOR READING IN GERMAN ACCENT)

And in addition,

Pewterschmidt Industries'
pharmaceutical division is up over 30%.

Profits in new media
have doubled each quarter

over the past year,
and our stock is at an all-time high.

All right, stand aside.
I'll take it from here.

Good afternoon, gentlemen.
My name is Peter Griffin.

I will be running the company
from hence here forth.

Now, I want you all to lay
some business talk on me.

I need ideas.

What can we do to make
this quarter more quarterly?

Well, come on, come on.

-(MURMURING)
-(COUGHS)

Okay, I can see I'm gonna have
to get things rollin'.

All right, we're gonna do an
exercise called the Idea Ball.

I'm gonna toss a ball
to one of you,

and whoever catches it,
throw out the first idea you got,

then pass the ball
to the next guy,

and he throws out an idea
and so on. Everybody clear?

-Yeah.
-(MURMURING)

All right, here we go.

All right, Abrams, whaddaya got?

ABRAMS:
My lung's collapsing.

You know what I'm hearin', gentlemen?

(SIGHS)
What's the best way to put this?

What I'm hearing...

What I'm hearing
is a lot of yesterday talk.

This isn't the way we're gonna
do things under my leadership.

We are gonna turn
this company around.

But, sir, the company's doing fine.
Better than ever, in fact.

Mr. Pewterschmidt would...

I don't care what
Mr. Pewterschmidt would have done.

We need to take risks.

We need a complete overhaul.

Gentlemen, you're all fired.

-(ALL GASP)
-What?!

There, now that I've got
your attention...

you're all fired.

Peter, what the hell
is going on?

You fired everybody
at Daddy's company?!

-You bet.
-Are you outta your mind?!

Keep it up, Lois.
I might fire you.

You wouldn't.

Does the name Lacey Chabert
mean anything to you?

Okay, I'll behave.

Yes, you will.

Look, Peter, all I'm saying is,

those guys have been
with Daddy for years.

How are you supposed to run
that company without them?

That's it, Lois.
You're fired.

Chris, you are now Meg's mother.

Ooh, Peter, your muscles
are so muscley.

I am gonna plow you
so gross later.

You are a team of executives
I can trust.

Brian, Quagmire, Mort,
you are gonna be my creative team.

You are gonna help me lead
this company into the future.

Peter, we don't know
anything more than you do

about running a company.

Hey, where's Joe?

I think he's still outside.

Hey, Joe!
What're you doing down there?!

There's no ramp!
I can't get inside!

Well, we don't need him anyway.

This company's gonna
make it on my ideas.

Here are the products we'll be unveiling
in the new fiscal year.

The African American heart monitor.

HEART MONITOR:
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

<i>Aw, he dead.</i>

Jeremy Irons cereal.

If you're looking for
marshmallows, there are none.

It's quite bland, I assure you.

And Scream in a Box.

(MAN SCREAMING)

I needed that today.

And now,
new Lady Scream in a Box.

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

Finally, a scream that's right for me.

Well, it's good to see everyone's adapting
to their new business roles.

Brian, I like your Successories.

I will.

I will go get it.

(KNOCKING)

Mr. Quagmire, the Davidson
account is waiting for you

in the conference room.

All right, thanks, Marlene.
Tell 'em I'll be right in.

All right, Glenn,
time to go make millions.

What happened
to you, man?

I grew up!
That's what happened!

What happened to the free-loving Quagmire
who was banging ten chicks at a time?

I still do that.

-Oh. Good.
-Yup.

Can I have some money?

-Oh, get out of here, you bum.
-Ah, all right.

HEART MONITOR:
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

<i>He's a'ight.</i>

<i>Daddy, you're awake!</i>

Oh, Carter, I'm so relieved.

(GROANS) What happened?
Where am I?

Oh, you had a heart attack, Daddy,
but you're all right now.

HEART MONITOR: <i>Yeah, he cool.</i>

What the hell is that?!

Oh, it's an African American heart monitor
made by your company.

-What?!
-Yes,

it has two settings:
Barry White and Bill Cosby.

BILL COSBY HEART MONITOR:
<i>Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep.</i>

My company makes no such thing.

Well, you see, Daddy,
when you were in a coma,

Peter stepped in and took charge
of Pewterschmidt Industries.

BILL COSBY HEART MONITOR: <i>Zibida,</i>
<i>zoobida, gebada, bopada, zipity, ziggita,</i>

<i>zagata, boopada, bopada,</i>
<i>Ghost Dad!</i>

(SIGHS HAPPILY)
Well, you made it, Peter.

You're a big shot.
In charge of a whole bunch of people.

Peggy, hold my calls
for a few minutes, please.

PEGGY: <i>Yes, Mr. Griffin.</i>

Well, buddy, you're in love with Peggy.

What a mess.

Griffin! Get the hell
out of my building!

Holy crap, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're okay!

You're damn right I'm okay,

and I'm here to reassume
charge of my company.

Maybe I don't want to leave.

Maybe I like being a fat cat.

What are you saying?

I'm saying it's my company now,

and it's better than it ever was
when you were running it.

Security, we have a situation
in the conference room.

I'll give you a situation, you fat turd.

Gentlemen, please remove
this man from the building.

What th...? I'm Carter Pewterschmidt!
This is my company!

Throw that guy out!

Sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
but we work for Mr. Griffin now.

You can't do this to me!
Do you know who I am?!

I'm Carter Pewterschmidt!

-(ELEVATOR DINGS)
-I'm not getting in that elevator!

Don't you dare throw me
out of this lobby!

Don't you... Damn it!

Hey, what are you doing out here?

JOE: I can't get in the building!

Uh, Peggy?

PEGGY: <i>Yes, Mr. Griffin.</i>

That fart I have at 03:00...
can you push that up to now?

Very good, sir.

(PETER FARTS)

Lois, how could you let your idiot husband
take over my company?

He fired all my staff.

His stupid ideas are bankrupting
Pewterschmidt Industries,

and now he won't step down!

I know, Daddy.
He's become so full of himself.

He's more annoying than when
he's making his Christmas list.

Now, Peter, are you sure this is
all you want for Christmas?

I'm only going to the mall once.

Yeah, yeah, that's it.

MAN (ON TV): <i>All new this Christmas,</i>
<i>remote control cars...</i>

<i>that glow in the dark?!</i>

PETER:
Get that!

I've run that company for 40 years.

He even froze my corporate bank accounts.

-I'm broke.
-Oh, that's ridiculous.

I'll talk to him
as soon as he gets home.

(JET PLANE APPROACHING)

What the hell is that?!

Damn it, Peter!
Your plane set my lawn on fire!

Here, that ought to cover it.

Peter, I don't want your money!

Well, fine, then, have a box
of Jeremy Irons cereal.

If you're looking for a prize
at the bottom, there is none.

Only more cardboard.

Peter, this has gone on
long enough.

I want you to make things right
with Daddy.

-It's his company.
-It's my company.

It's your company.
<i>Three's Company.</i>

Where the kisses are hers
and hers and his.

-What?
-I'm sorry, Lois.

We all had some pot brownies
on the plane.

Hey, Peter,
are you seeing this rabbit?

-No.
-Well, I sure am.

You know something?

You're not qualified
to sit in that chair.

Oh, aren't I?

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMS)

Maybe there's a rabbit
head under here.

(YELLING)

Peter, all of my father's assets
are tied up in that corporation.

If you freeze up his money,
he's not gonna have anything to live on.

Now you are gonna make amends
with Daddy, and that's final.

All right, Lois, if that's what you want.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, be in
my office tomorrow morning at 09:00.

I'm sure we can figure something out.

(EVIL LAUGHTER)

Hmm... I don't know if I like
the sound of that laugh.

I knew I didn't like
the sound of that laugh.

Peter, this is unacceptable.

What gives you the right
to treat me like this?

You've been treating me like crap

for 20 years, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
and now I'm the one in charge.

Hang on a second.

Clean that up.

Carter, as your boss,
I command you to have a viewing party

for tonight's episode
of <i>The Big Bang Theory,</i>

and you have to go cubicle
to cubicle inviting people.

Aw, come on, Peter. I'm not...
I'm not good with rejection.

I'm your boss.
Now do it!

Hi. I was gonna catch
<i>The Big Bang Theory </i>tonight,

and wondered if you wanted
to come over and watch.

Wha... What? What is that?

It's a comedy. It's on CBS.
I'm really into it.

I don't want to watch that.
I don't want to watch it with you.

All right, if you change
your mind, here's a flyer.

If you do decide to come, I'm just asking
that you bring an appetizer.

Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

See, Peter, I told you,
no one wants to come.

-This is awful.
-You're not off the hook.

You still got to have that party.

-Babs, you want to sit and watch...?
-No.

<i>I'll have you know that I can bench press</i>
<i>over 690 billion nanograms.</i>

<i>Sheldon, that's less than two pounds.</i>

<i>It sounded better the way I said it.</i>

(LAUGHS)

Oh, when I tell that joke
at work tomorrow, people...

people-people are gonna
be sorry they didn't come.

They're-They're gonna...
This-This was...

This-This was a good night.

Carter, as your boss,
I'm ordering you

to pay a compliment to this
sharply-dressed Asian man.

You look very nice.

What else?

-Uh...
-What about my shoe?

They're nice, too.

How you think my house smell?

Not oniony?

You good man.

I pat you on the head
and feed you from the hand.

(CRYING) And then he made me
clean out the fridge

in the employee lounge,
and the employees were mad at me

because I-I threw out food
that they still wanted.

I don't know what's in there!

Oh, that's it.

Peter is completely out of control.

We've got to do something to take him down
and get your company back.

Right, right. But how?

In order to oust an idiot,
we've got to think like an idiot.

Let's see.
What's Peter's weakness?

He's got to have a weakness.

Swamp monsters.

Swamp monsters, of course!

Lois, what are you doing here?

Oh, I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

Of course it's okay.
Why wouldn't it be?

Oh, you know, that whole
swamp monster story.

Swamp monster?

-You haven't heard?
-Heard what?

Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's just, apparently,

somebody flushed
a baby swamp monster

down the toilet somewhere,
not far from here.

What?! Who would flush
a baby swamp monster?

Don't they know
what would happen?

Well, apparently, it has happened.

And now it's grown up
and is attacking important businessmen.

I'm an important
businessman!

(FAINT DEEP GROWLING)

What the hell was that?!

It sounds like maybe a swamp monster
who needs to project a little more.

(GROWLING LOUDER)

(ROARING)

Ah, crap!

(ROARING)

Aah! A swamp monster!

-(ROARING)
-(SCREAMING)

Quick, Peter, sign this legal document

giving the company back to Daddy
so you won't get eaten!

Oh, I don't understand,
but nothing makes sense

in these swamp monster times.

(SCREAMING)

We did it, Daddy.

I have my husband back,
and you have your company.

Sorry I'm late, Lois.

Okay, are we doing
the swamp monster thing?

Wait, if you're Daddy,
then who...?

BOTH: S-S-S-S-S-S-S...
Swamp monster!

(CHASE MUSIC PLAYING)

Now let's find out who you really are.

(BOTH GASP)

Dr. House?!

Indeed, Lois.

And if you don't mind, I'll address you
in my natural speaking voice,

as I've grown so weary
of doing an American accent.

Do you want to come to my <i>Big Bang</i>
viewing party next week?

Daddy, you don't have
to do that anymore.

I know, I know.
I-I... I like it now.

Well, I'm sorry
you lost the company, Peter,

but I think it's for the best.

You were turning into a real jerk.

Well, maybe so.

But I sure am gonna miss
being a corporate big shot.

Well, you'll always be
a big shot in this family, sweetheart.

Thanks, honey.

And I got a little surprise for you.

In that contract you signed,
you got to keep the corporate plane.

(GASPS) Yeah!

Peter, how are you doing that?

I-I don't... I don't know, Lois.
I'm scared.

Well, come down.

I can't. I-I... Get help.
Call somebody.

Wh-Wh-Who do I call?

I-I don't know. A police...
a fireman... a scientist!

Call a scientist!

Okay, you kids stay here with your father.
I'm gonna go find a scientist.

Am I gonna die?

Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, you're lovely.

I haven't heard that much applause

since Bob Crane premiered
his home movies in my closet.

-(PETER LAUGHS)
-All right, let's play the <i>Feud.</i>

One hundred people surveyed,
top four answers on the board.

Here's the question.

Name something you find
in your bathroom.

(BUZZER SOUNDING)

-A sink.
-Show us "sink!"

Peter, three answers on the board
that can beat that.

Name something you find
in your bathroom.

Find in your bathroom,
find in your bathroom...

Richard, I'm gonna go with
"fetus in the toilet bowl."

Show us "fetus in the toilet bowl!"

-Play or pass?
-We're gonna play.

Oh, this must be your lovely wife.

(CHUCKLES) Uh-uh.
I've been waiting for this for years.

(MOANING)

I want you to wear me like a pinky ring.

Okay, Lois, name something
you find in your bathroom.

Okay, how about "bathtub"?

(ALL CHEERING)

Okay, name something you find
in your bathroom.

A razor blade and a note?

(ALL CHEERING)

All right,
you've got two strikes, Callaghans.

Name something
you'd like to receive as a gift.

-Candy?
-Show me "candy!"

(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS
IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

Wait. We're out?
You said if I slept with you...

All right, Griffins,
here's your chance to win the game.

Name something
you'd like to receive as a gift.

-Groceries!
-Assorted lotions!

-An Uzi!
-A dead squirrel!

-Money!
-All right, good answer, good answer!

-Very good! Good answer!
-Bingo!

Well, Richard, my family seems to
think money's the way to go,

so I'm gonna go with
the flute that Captain Picard played,

first in his imagination
and then in real life,

in the episode "The Inner Light"
from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation.</i>

-What? No, you idiot! We said "money!"
-Show me "Picard's flute!"

-Peter, how did you...
-I was in the survey.

Can you believe it?
We're going to the bonus round!

Okay, Lois, 15 seconds on the clock.
Name something you sit in.

-A chair.
-My own feces.

Name a popular fruit.

-Orange.
-Clay Aiken.

Something in your closet.

-Shoes.
-Scary monsters.

Your favorite holiday.

-Christmas.
-9/11.

Something you do on the weekends.

-Go to church.
-Black guys.

All right, "Something you sit in."
You said, "Chair."

Survey said...

Wait a sec. I said "feces."
Where's my answer?

You're just going
to pretend I'm not here, huh?

Just like Robin Williams' agent
pretends he's still funny.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-Hey, Phil, it's Robin Williams.

(LAUGHING) That's hilarious!

I just wanted to make sure
the meeting is still on for 2:30 tomorrow.

Otherwise, I gotta go to
that Chinese dentist.

-Get it? Tooth hurty?
-(LAUGHING) You son of a bitch!

I had a mouthful of coffee!
God, you are funny, and that is real!

Okay, Peter, Lois did great.
You only need one point to win the $5,000.

Twenty seconds.
Name something you sit in.

-Chair.
-Try again.

-Big chair.
-No, that's the same thing. Try again.

-High chair.
-That's still a chair.

-Chair.
-Say something other than "chair."

-What if I can't think of anything?
-You can pass.

-How do I pass?
-Just say it.

-Say what?
-Say "pass."

-Chair.
-(BUZZER SOUNDING)

I'm sorry, your time is up,
and you didn't score enough points.

-But thank you for playing.
-What, that's it? We lose?

I'm afraid so,
but we enjoyed having you here.

You son of a bitch!
What about my cave in the yard?

-What about my cave in the yard?
-Get your hands off me.

I served in the fictitious military.

Peter! Oh, my God, are you all right?

What happened? Where am I?
Who are you?

I'm Lois.

Lois who? Who the hell am I?

Uh-oh.

Mrs. Griffin,
I'm afraid your husband has amnesia.

-Oh, my God! Is it permanent?
-Well, there's no telling for sure.

His memory could return in days,
weeks, years, or never.

Or weeks.

Peter, I want you to meet your family.

-You're my family?
-That's right. These are your children.

Dad, I'm Chris. I'm your son.

-Never seen you before in my life.
-Wow, then I must be invisible!

Hey, everybody, I'm invisible!

HERBERT: Oh, no, you're not! Hot diggity!

-This is Meg, your daughter.
-D'oh!

No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase.

Oh.

Sorry, I just don't remember anything.

-Dad, this is your baby and your dog.
-He doesn't remember us.

It's an opportunity
to come up with our own names.

I'm Tomax and this is Xamot. We're twins
who can feel each other's pain.

Ow!

No, Brian, I'm supposed to say, "Ow!"
You ruin everything!

Ow.

All right, Peter,
we're gonna try to jog your memory

-with some old videotapes of the family.
-Boy, you got a lot of tapes here.

I kind of want to watch
some of these instead.

<i>-Pretty Woman?</i> What's that?
-It's just a movie from the '80s.

Oh, my God, we gotta watch this.
Look what they're saying about it.

"As funny as it is touching. Gene Shalit."

"I stood up and cheered,
'Go, Julia, go!' Joel Siegel."

"This movie made me laugh so hard
I had mild headaches,

"so I went to the doctor
and got myself checked out.

"I'm currently awaiting results.
Gene Siskel."

Everyone seems to love this.
We gotta watch it!

We'll watch it later, Peter.

I want to show you
one of the most special times

of your life and mine, our honeymoon.

LOIS ON TV: <i>I think you've</i>
<i>had enough, Peter.</i>

PETER ON TV: <i>You don't know. Get away!</i>
<i>I know my body better than you!</i>

Is that us?

Yes, Peter. You were so handsome,
and it was such a wonderful week.

-Hey, buddy, I think that girl likes me.
-Of course she does. She's your wife.

Do you like her?

I don't know!

(GIGGLES NERVOUSLY)

(SIGHS)

You know,
this isn't gonna be easy, you guys.

We're gonna have to re-teach your father
everything he's forgotten.

Hey, have you heard
this awesome new song?

No!

(SINGING) <i>A-well-a bird, bird, bird</i>
<i>B-bird's the word</i>

<i>A-well-a bird, bird, bird</i>
<i>B-bird's the word, a-well-a...</i>

This is called a telephone, Peter.

You use it to talk to people
who aren't in the house.

There are others?

Yes, there are over six billion people
in the world.

Here, I'll show you.
We'll call my parents.

-CARTER: <i>Hello?</i>
-Hello.

<i>-Who's this?</i>
-Who's this?

<i>-Carter. Who's this?</i>
-I don't know.

<i>-Do you have my OxyContin?</i>
-What?

<i>-Are you the guy?</i>
-I'm a guy.

<i>-I want my drugs.</i>
-What are drugs?

<i>I don't think this is the call</i>
<i>I was expecting.</i>

(DIAL TONE)

Now, Peter, this is your silverware.

You see, this is your fork,
and this is a knife.

That's not a knife. That's a knife.

-This is also a knife.
-Oh. Well, I'll be on my way.

I want to see more of him,
and then suddenly none of him.

Forever.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

All right, you know what?
This is not working.

If you're gonna learn to drive,
you're gonna have to practice first.

Here, play <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>
for eight hours,

and then we'll give it another try.

So, you guys are my best friends,
and this is where we hang out?

That's right.
I'm Quagmire, and this is Joe.

So, what do we do here?

Well, we usually come here,
you buy us drinks

and tell us what Lois' nipples look like,
like you always do. Giggity Giggity.

Yeah, but first you usually go over there
and pull down that blonde waitress' top.

-(WOMAN SCREAMS)
-(SLAP)

She screamed, so I had to slap her.

Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Get nude. Get nude. Please get nude.

-Please get nude.
-Peter, you don't have to spy on me.

You're my husband. Come on in.

Oh, boy, no fooling? Oh, boy!

Wait a minute.
Something's happening in my pants.

-In the front this time.
-That's all right, Peter.

It just means you're excited.

That's the way it's supposed to be
between a husband and wife.

-It means you want to make love.
-But I forget how to make love.

(SHUSHING)

That's okay. I'll show you.
Just follow my lead.

<i>(FEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME</i> PLAYING)

(SINGING) <i>It feels like the first time</i>

<i>Feels like the very first time</i>

(BOTH MOANING)

-Wow! That was what they call sex?
-Yes, it was, Peter.

Can we do it again? Can we?

Wow! You're as excited
as a porcupine meeting a pineapple.

Hey, good-looking.
Where have you been all my life?

(CHUCKLING)

Morning, nice people
who I still don't know your names

and who mean nothing to me.

I certainly hope that doesn't apply to me,
especially after last night.

You got a point there, hot stuff.

And if sex with the rest of you
is half as good as it was with her,

then I think we're all
gonna get along just fine.

Yay!

What? No, no, Peter,
you can't have sex with the kids.

I wish you'd told him that
before he lost his memory.

(ALL GASPING)

It was a joke! I was just making a joke.

-That's your sense of humor?
-I was just kidding. God!

Meg, that's awful.

Jeez, you open your mouth for a joke once,
and that's what you come up with?

-That's messed up, Meg.
-I was just trying to be funny.

-That wasn't funny. That was just dark.
-Yeah, that's your father.

Get out, Meg! Get out of the kitchen!
Go on! Get out! Out! Out! Out!

Out of the kitchen!
Go on! Get out of here!

(CHUCKLES)

Peter, there you are. I've been waiting.
You ready to have sex?

You bet. Move over,
so Tiffani and I have room.

What? Who the hell is she?

She's the woman
I'm gonna have sex with tonight.

And don't worry about
getting me pregnant. I'm already pregnant.

Peter, what's the matter with you?

You can't just have sex
with some random woman!

-Why the hell not?
-Because we're married!

Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't remember marrying anybody.

Why the hell would I commit
to having sex with one person

-for the rest of my life?
-Because we love each other.

That's part of being a family.
It means being responsible and faithful.

Well, that doesn't sound very fun.

Well, if that's how you feel,
then we no longer have a family.

Boy, I'm glad you said it.

But this is my house,
and I'm not going anywhere.

You don't have to. I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the kids with me.

That's a beautiful necklace
you're wearing, Tiffani.

Thank you.

Is that what you do
with your <i>Saved by the Bell</i> money?

Mom, I don't want to live
in a tiny, gross apartment.

Well, I'm sorry, honey,
but we don't have a choice.

Your father doesn't remember his life,
and he doesn't want us to be a part of it,

-so we've just got to move on.
-This is disgusting. I shouldn't be here.

A baby doesn't belong in the inner city
any more than a baby belongs on a plane.

(CRYING)

(SHUSHING) It's gonna be okay.
Gonna be okay.

Peter, what the hell is all this?

Well, I'm a bachelor,
so I invited a bunch of people over,

and now I'm waiting for them to leave.
That's what bachelors do.

Peter, I'm interested in the redhead
with the wooden arms and legs over there.

-You think you could introduce me?
-That's a table, Seamus.

Don't point at her. Don't point.
She's looking.

Oh, great. Now I gotta go in.
Hey, I'm Seamus.

Peter, you left your family for this?

Look, I don't know
what I was doing before,

but this is the way man was meant to live.

I just know it. Check it out.

(BOTH MOANING)

-Don't you miss your family?
-What, that lady and those kids?

I don't even remember them.
How could I miss them?

I almost don't want to ask you out
because I know you're gonna say no.

You want to go out? No? Okay.

Giggity.

Giggity.

gi-gi, gi-gi, giggity!

Lois! Oh, my gosh! Hi!

-Oh, hi, Quagmire. What a surprise.
-I know, right?

Gosh, you know,
I was just picking up a couple of hams

to take down to the shelter,
and here I run into you,

buying food
to make dinner for your husband.

No, actually, Glenn,
maybe you haven't heard,

-but Peter and I aren't together anymore.
-What? Why?

It's a long story.
You don't want to hear about it.

Shut your face.
I want to hear all about it.

But listen, I got all this shopping to do,
so you want to stop by tomorrow night?

-I'll just whip something up.
-Well, sure.

You know, that sounds nice, Glenn.

Holy smokes, this is a sure thing.
Like the end of a Mexican wedding.

(ALL CHEERING)

Crap, we're out of milk.

I'm gonna run next door to the airport
and get some.

Hey, when you're over there,
can you get some rodent traps?

We got a giant mutant rat
living under the sink.

I'm just gonna hide under the sink
till y'all go to sleep,

then I'm gonna come out
and make my poops in your Kix.

Hey, Stewie, is Lois back yet?
I've been trying to get a hold of her.

-She went to Quagmire's for dinner.
-What?

That was a delicious dinner, Glenn.
I didn't know you could cook.

Well, when a fella's been alone
as long as I have,

he learns to take care of himself.

Well, you're a very sweet friend, and
you're so good to listen to my troubles.

I could listen for hours, Lois.

Whoo! Boy, I don't know how a half a glass
of wine got me so lightheaded.

-I better lie down.
-You want me to help you upstairs?

Oh, my God, you are a saint!

Oh, I think I can make it from here. I...
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Whoops!

Professor Klutz, the doctor is in!
(LAUGHS) Where's this heading?

Hiya, Brian.

All right, Peter, now I know your head
is still a blank slate,

but you gotta listen to me when I say...
Wait. Did you just call me "Brian"?

-Yeah.
-You've got your memory back?

Uh-huh. Happened yesterday on my way
back from the grocery store.

Hi, Peter.

Hey, you just snubbed me
in front of my own house.

I thought we'd come to an understanding.

Look, fella, I don't know who you are
and I don't want to,

so why don't you just go back
to your crabgrass?

This happens to be fresh Marathon Sod!

Man, I just got my memory back. And as
I recall, I don't really care for you!

Wait a minute. Who are you?
Hey, I know you!

What's your beef, stranger?
Well, if it isn't my old nemesis!

I was just lucky
he had an odd number of objects.

Why the hell didn't you tell anybody?

Well, I figured I could enjoy
the bachelor life

for a few more days
before getting Lois back.

Well, you may have waited
too long already.

Lois is on a date with Quagmire,

and you've gotta stop her
before something happens.

-What? Oh, my God! Where is she?
-She's next door at his house.

And you better get there quick,
because with Quagmire, sex is inevitable.

Like a fat guy ordering dessert
when everyone else wants to leave.

-So, does anyone want dessert?
-Oh, I couldn't eat another bite.

-No. I gotta get home for the sitter.
-I'll have the souffle.

-That takes 45 minutes.
-That's okay.

I can't believe we're doing this,
but I gotta say, it feels kind of right.

I know, it's so weird, right?
I mean, it's, like, fast.

I mean, it's fast,
but it feels, like, okay, you know?

I mean, like, isn't that crazy?

It's like this adventure
that we're having together.

I know. That's exactly how I feel.

I mean, it's a little strange,
but if Peter's never coming back to me,

it's at least nice to know
I'm in the arms of a trusted friend.

You... You trust me?

Uh-oh.

-Is something wrong?
-I don't know. I'll be right back.

(PUMPING)

QUAGMIRE: Damn it!

-Lois!
-Peter? What are you doing here?

I got my memory back,
and I love you, Lois!

I want you and the kids back.
I want our old life back!

I don't believe it! Sweetheart, it's you!
You're back!

-QUAGMIRE: (SCREAMS) Damn it!
-I'm back, Lois, and I'm sorry.

I treated you so badly, but I hope you
know it was only because I wasn't myself.

I didn't just lose my memory.
I lost my mind.

-Clear!
-(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

-Damn it!
-Oh, my God, Peter, I don't care!

I don't care!
I'm just overjoyed to have you back!

Let's go home!

Good evening.
I'm Diane Simmons.

In traffic news, heavy gridlock
on the 195 interchange.

We now go live to Drunk Billy
in the Channel 5 news copter.

This just in.

Channel 5 news copter pilot
Drunk Billy passed away today.

In anticipation of this event,

we put together a clip package

featuring some of Billy's work
for Channel 5 News.

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

"I'm still hungry," said
the very hungry caterpillar.

"But you've already..."

Drunk Billy will be missed.

But what you shouldn't miss
is the Quahog Rodeo,

coming to the Civic Center this Friday.

Tickets are on sale now.

And for those of you who
are handy with a horse,

entry spots are still open.

Oh, God, this seems like
the kind of thing Peter...

Too late, Brian.

Peter, you're gonna
enter the rodeo?

That's stupid. You don't know
anything about horses,

and you're in terrible shape.

You know, that's the difference
between you and me, Lois.

When life comes knocking at the door,

you go and hide in the kitchen.

I fling the door wide open and I say,

"Peter Griffin here. What do you got?"

And if that don't convince you,
look at this.

In this week's <i>TV Guide,</i> it says,

"Peter gets more than he bargained for

"when he joins the rodeo."

Well, it's in the <i>Guide.</i>

Hey, can we make that a thing?

Can we start calling <i>TV Guide,</i>
"the Guide"?

You know what?
I'm not even asking anymore.

That's what we're doing.

Who says I couldn't be a rodeo star?

I got more cowboy blood in me
than Billy the Kid.

<i>Well, he robbed his way</i>
<i>from Utah to Oklahoma</i>

<i>And the law just could not</i>
<i>seem to track him down</i>

<i>And it served</i><i>his legend well</i>

<i>For the folks, they loved to tell</i>

<i>About when Billy the Kid came to town.</i>

Dad, what are you doing?

All right, Meg, this is only gonna hurt

for about three weeks.

What the hell?

That there's my steer, Griffin.

All right, Lois.
Go ahead. Say it.

Ho der.

All right. I am ready for the rodeo.

Mom, when's it Dad's turn?

I don't know, Chris.

But I think we should
all pray for your father

that he comes
out of this uninjured.

Those horses stink.

And it's too hot in here.

I fell asleep in the car,
so now I'm cranky.

This is a disgusting display.

Boy, you can say that again.

Nothing like a bunch of adult
men teasing animals for fun.

It's amazing that this is still legal.

The only reason I'm here

is 'cause my idiot friend
is in the rodeo.

I only came 'cause I'm
writing a magazine article.

One of the competitors

is a 13-year-old female riding prodigy.

Apparently she got on
the bull to miscarry,

and found out she had a talent for it.

So, what magazine
do you write for?

I'm the editor for <i>Teen People.</i>

Editor?

Well, gosh, you know, I'm
something of a writer myself.

I-I wrote for <i>The New Yorker</i>
for a little while.

Wow, that's impressive.

Are you looking for work?

Oh, no. No, no, no.

I-I never have to look
too far for that.

I... W-W-What are you...

What do you...
What-What do you got?

Well, we're looking for
someone to write a piece

on the everyday activities

of the average
American teenage girl.

Oh, I love teenage girls.

It's all ahead of them, you know?

They haven't turned into bitches yet.

Oh, it's true.

What happened to all of us?

I got a house on the Cape.
Maybe you come visit.

(FEEBLY) Maybe.

Maybe you call a few days in advance

to give me time to get the house clean.

Okay.

Maybe you bring a blazer,

so we can go to a wider
range of restaurants.

I'll-I'll bring a blazer.

You see this, Rupert?

Most children build a sand castle.

But I'm building a sand retreat
for singles in their 30s.

(DEEP VOICE) Hi, I'm Jeremy.

I work in corporate finance.

(HIGH VOICE)
Hi, I'm a French-Canadian girl

down here on my vacation.

It's a big deal for me
to be down here on my own.

I like the swimming pool
with a bar in it

'cause you can sit on a barstool
and you're in the water.

(DEEP VOICE) I like how all the food
and drink is included

in the price of the ticket.

(HIGH VOICE)
Yeah, that way you don't have

to bring your cash down from the room.

(DEEP VOICE) Okay, I was just looking
for a friend of mine,

so maybe I'll see you later.

(HIGH VOICE) Good for you, Janine.

You promised yourself you'd talk
to somebody and you did it.

(NORMAL VOICE)
Brian, what are you doing up there?

Shh. I'm writing an article

on teenage girls for a magazine.

I'm studying Meg to see
what goes on during her day.

Well, be careful
you don't fall off that ladder.

Not all dogs go to heaven.

So, says here you were involved

in the plotting of September 11?

Well, that's what they
get for supporting Israel.

Hyuck, yuck, yuck. Gawsh.

Okay, into the eternal
pit of fire you go.

Wa-hoo-hoo-hoo-ee!

You know, Brian, just because
you're writing a profile

on teenage girls,
it doesn't mean you have

to be a creepy stalker
and follow Meg around all day.

It's called research, Stewie.

I'm just being thorough.

Where the hell is she going?

There's nothing out in this part of town.

What is that, Brian?

What is an adult correctional institute?

-It's a prison, Stewie.
-Ah.

One would think they could just say that.

Hi, Meg.

Hi, Luke.

(BOTH GASP)

Oh, my God.

Meg's dating a convict!

Oh, looks like Consuela's son
is in prison.

I see you soon, Rodrigo.

<i>S√≠, mama.</i>

It's really good to see you, Meg.

-It's been a while.
-I know. I'm sorry, Luke.

It's just so hard
to get over here

without anybody finding out.

Have you gotten all the letters
and hair that I've sent?

It's the only thing

that's getting me by,
Meg. Thank you.

How'd your parole hearing go?

Not good.
Looks like I'm gonna be in here

-another three years.
-Oh, Luke.

Oh, I don't expect you
to wait for me, Meg.

No, I will, Luke. If it takes
ten years or 20 years,

I will be here when you get out.

Oh, my God!

Meg's involved
with a convict!

Wow, Meg's like one of those crazy chicks

who hooks up with an even crazier guy.

Brian, you bastard!

How could you do this to me?

I'm sorry, Meg. I had to tell them!

Don't give him crap for this, Meg.

He did exactly the right thing
by coming to us.

Don't you know what kind of fire

you're playing with, dating a prisoner?

Hold on, Lois. This is
some serious parenting.

I'm gonna go put on my Cosby sweater.

Mom, you don't understand!

Luke and I really connect, very deeply!

He's all alone in there,
and I'm all alone out here.

In a way, we're both in prison.

Well, Meg, there's a big difference there.

He's in prison for a reason.

He broke the law!

He robbed a convenience store

to pay for medication for his mom.

Oh, I'm sure he gave you a
very convincing sob story.

It's not a sob story! It's true!

Frankly, I don't care, Meg.

I do not want you seeing him again!

I can't find the sweater.

How the hell did you even meet him?

We had a pen pal project at school,

and when it was over, Luke and I

just kind of kept writing to each other.

Well, it stops now!

But, Mom, I love him!

It stops now, Meg!

Your mother's right, Meg.
You got to be careful

who you get involved with romantically.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

I'm in the mood for some coitus.

Get over here.

I can't. I'm with my family.

Pick up wine on the way.

Well, Angela, if I'm really
the only guy at work

who can solve it, I'll be right there.

(SOBBING)

(RAPPING AT WINDOW)

(GASPS)

Luke!

What are you doing here?

I escaped, Meg.

I escaped 'cause I just couldn't bear

another second away from you.

My God, how did you get out?

I filed down a toothbrush to a fine point

and stabbed the guard with the most kids.

-What?
-I'm just kidding.

Oh. I'm still getting used
to your sense of humor.

Actually, there was a riot
in the prison yard,

and I slipped over the fence.

Well, well, quick, get in here
before somebody sees you!

Oh, Meg, I've wanted
to do that for so long.

And it's nice to be in front
of someone for a change.

(LAUGHING)

Now, I know that was a joke!

(LAUGHS) Whatever.

Hey, Meg?

Can I talk to you for a second?

(RUSTLING, DOOR CLOSING)

MEG: Uh, yeah, come on in.

Listen, uh, I feel like
I should explain myself

a little bit here.

I'm sorry I had to tell Lois
what was going on.

You just,
you gotta realize

I was only thinking
about your safety and...

(MAN SNEEZES)

(GROWLS)

Luke, you might as well
come out now.

Luke! What the...?
They let you out of jail?

Not exactly.

He broke out
to see me, Brian.

We're in love.

Meg, are you crazy?

You can't harbor a fugitive.
That's a felony.

Only if someone
finds out.

Are you gonna do it?

-Are you gonna tell on me again?
-Well, I-I...

Brian, will you call me
on my Mickey Mouse phone?

Wait a second.

Why is that guy wearing a prison jumpsuit?

Think, Peter, think.

Wait. Hang on.

Sunday, Sunday...
Here it is.

"Peter gets more than he bargains for

"when he joins the rodeo." Boy, did I.

"And Meg dates a prison escapee"!

Oh, no!
Luke, run!

Joe, it's Peter! Two things:

First of all, when I was over
at your house the other day,

I forgot to tell you how much
I like the rearrangement

you and Bonnie did
with your living room furniture.

Second of all, come outside!

There's an escaped convict
running across the street!

No, Luke, don't run downhill!

You're going to jail, punk!

No, Mr. Swanson, you can't take him!

Yes, I can, Meg.

He's going back to jail.

Well, if you're taking him to jail,

you have to take me, too!

I know. That's the plan.

You're under arrest for
harboring an escaped convict.

Oh, well, that's only fair
because after all,

I did hide him from the...

What?

Uh, hi.

Did you also get caught
trying to vote in Ohio?

Well, this is it.
Meg gets out of jail today.

Already? It seems like just
yesterday we rented her room

to that fly that wants to leave,
but can't figure it out.

(BUZZING)

FLY: Okay, now where now?
PETER: Right there.

I'm having some trouble here.

It's right there!
It's right in front of you!

Okay, I can hear you.
Volume's not a problem.

I'm just not quite seeing
what you're referring to.

Okay, then fly, fly out the window.

-Up here maybe?
-No, to your left!

No, that's not it. That's just more wall.

How many eyes do you have, huh?

Just two, same number as you,
but I can't, I'm not...

Just go! Oh, my God!
Whatever it is

you're driving at, I'm just
apparently not getting it,

-so I'm just gonna go back upstairs.
-You're right there!

I think we should all go
together to pick Meg up.

She's probably a little fragile
after being in there so long,

and I'm sure she'll be heartened
to see our faces.

I'm home.
You're all my bitches now.

Okay.

Meg! You look
so different.

How was prison?

First question:

who's the biggest, toughest guy
in this house?

Well, I don't like
to toot my own horn,

but I believe I hold
the distinction... (GRUNTS)

(GRUNTING)

My house now, bitch!

Now, who's the funniest?

I know my way around a joke.

(GASPING, GRUNTING)

For God's sake, Dad,

have some humility!
It'll save your life!

There better be beer
in the fridge.

Boy, I liked her better when
she was more predictable...

like the stock photos
on a corporate Web site.

<i>I'm a woman in a lab coat</i>
<i>wearing goggles,</i>

<i>staring intently at a beaker</i>
<i>that I'm holding near my face.</i>

<i>I'm a Latino in a hardhat,</i>

<i>but I'm also wearing a tie</i>
<i>so you know I'm a supervisor.</i>

<i>We're college students</i>
<i>listening to our professor,</i>

<i>but the class is taking place outside?</i>

(WATER RUNNING)

Hey.

Meg! What the hell are you
doing in here?

-Shower time.
-Yeah, for me.

Not-not for... What are you
doing with that loofah?

Don't worry about it.

(PETER SCREAMS)

You told me not to worry about it!

I should have been worried
the whole time!

Meg, honey?
I did all your laundry.

Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

It's my poop bucket.

What the hell?

I'm used to going to the
bathroom in my room.

That's disgusting!

No, you use the toilet here
like everyone else!

-No.
-Ugh!

God, it smells horrible!

Well, can you at least empty it
each time you use it?

I like to fill it up.

I'm not making a million trips.

Oh, my God, are you using
my shirts as toilet paper?

Yeah. And I think

I might need some right now.

Get out now or stay and get weird.

Your call, warden.

Hey, who's the new dude?

Oh, my God, that's Meg Griffin!

She just got out of prison!

Hey, Meg,
what'd they put you in jail for,

being ugly?

(ALL LAUGH)

Hey, Meg, what happened?

Did you get out early for fat behavior?

(ALL LAUGH)

Nice tattoo.

Did you get your butt hair braided, too,

-while you were in there?
-(ALL LAUGH)

What'd you do,
carve a gun out of soap

and then not wash with it?
Ha-ha! P.U.

(ALL LAUGH)

Hey, Meg, are you gonna take
those soda cans

to the Shawskank
Redemption Center?

(ALL LAUGH)

Peter, Meg's been suspended from school.

That's okay. Whatever she wants to do.

She cracked three kids' skulls open!

Ever since she's gotten out of prison,

she is completely out of control.

Don't you see?

That's what the penal system
does in this country.

It turns small-time offenders
into hardened criminals.

Look at Meg. They took
an innocent little girl

and turned her into a psychotic,
sociopathic freak.

-(ALL GASP)
-What'd you say, Brian?

Oh, I-I was just picking up
on something Lois said.

What-what was it? What'd you say, Lois?

Something about Meg being a freak?

Oh, no, I didn't say anything.

Uh, Peter said something about Meg,

which I completely disagree
with.

That-that-that wasn't me.

Stewie was really laying
into Meg about something.

Yeah, it was Stewie. Definitely Stewie.

Oh, so now everyone understands me.

Look, Meg, we're just worried about you.

Well, don't. I can take care of myself.

I'll be out of here
by the end of the week.

Punch yourself in the face.

(WHIMPERS)

Punch yourself in the face!

(WHIMPERING)

All right, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

You, fatso, punch your baby
in the fa...

I did good, Meg?

Shut up.

I did good. I did good.

(ENGINE STARTS)

Drive.

Uh, any particular
direction?

That way.

You're gonna help me get some money

so I can get out of this town.

Really?
Where are you gonna go?

I don't know. Somewhere far away.

Maybe China.

I hear they got NASCAR there now.

(YELLING IN MANDARIN)

What kind of birdhouse can you build

with Popsicles, roofies and a mallet?

It's for a rare African bird
called "Nunya Business."

Hi, Meg.
Can I help you?

Hands in the air, Goldman!

Oh, my God, what are you doing?

Gimme your money!

Here, here, just take this jar

for the leukemia kids.

I don't give it to 'em anyhow.

Meg, put down the gun.

Brian, get back in the car!

Look, don't do this. This isn't you, Meg.

What happened to the girl we used to know?

The one that Luke fell in love with?

The one he's expecting to see

when he steps out of that prison
in 40 years?

I don't care about Luke.

I don't need him. I don't need anyone!

Look, if you don't put the gun down,

I'm gonna be forced
to call the police.

Good! Call the police!

I want you to!

What do I care
if I go back to prison?

Nobody cares about me anyway!

You're wrong, Meg.

I want to show you something.

<i>Teen People?</i>

It's the article
I wrote about you.

You wrote an article about me?

They wanted a story

about a typical teenage girl.

Is it "A Fistful of Backne:
Tale of a Teenage Loser"?

Yeah, they make the title.
Read paragraph three.

MORT: This isn't a library, you know.

"And in the face
of every adolescent challenge,

"she looks at the world
through hopeful eyes

"and maintains
an uncommon resilience

"that can only be admired.

"In this sense, Meg Griffin is
not the typical American girl.

"She is far sweeter and kinder than that."

Oh, God, that is so nice, Brian.

Did you mean all that?

Of course I did.

Oh, my God.
I-I can't believe I did this.

I was just so tired of being
everyone's whipping girl

that it felt kind of good
to do some of the whipping.

Give me the gun, Meg.

Thanks for reminding me who I really am.

Well, at least
I didn't get robbed.

(BELL OVER DOOR CHIMING)

And what can I do for you
four fine black gentlemen today?

I got to say, Meg, I like you
so much better like this.

Me, too, Meg.

God, it must have been
horrible in there.

It wasn't so bad.

-I met Wesley Snipes.
-Is that right?

Yeah. Oh,
and you know what's funny?

He was <i>inmate </i>57, too.

-Huh?
-He was inmate 57?

See, he did a movie called <i>Passenger 57.</i>

Ah.

Well, terrific.

Always end on a strong joke.

Stewie, look.

A butterfly.

Let's get it!

(LAUGHING)

Uh, Chris, I don't think we
should be leaving the trail.

(WITH ENGLISH ACCENT)
I shall put you in a glass box

to display on
Saint Trimmings Day.

Awww.

British guys always
capture my butterflies.

Yes, and to add
insult to injury,

I shall present to you my fanny:

Sir Chadwell Heath.

(LAUGHING)

Aw, darn it.

Hey, wait a second.
Where are we?

Oh, no.

Hey, Chris, did you know

your bacne spells "Citibank" in Braille?

Great. You had to chase the butterfly.

Yes, I had to chase the butterfly.

I came out here to observe nature.

What did you come out here for?

I came to the woods because
I wished to live deliberately,

and see if I could not learn
what it had to teach,

and not, when I came to die,

discover that I had not lived.

Wow, Stewie.
That was beautiful.

-Did you write that?
-No.

But can you tell me who did?

Log on now.

All right,
let's tally up those responses.

Wow.

You know who that is?
You know who Thornton Mellon...

First of all,
it was Henry David Thoreau.

But do you know
who Thornton Mellon is?

That was Rodney Dangerfield's
character in <i>Back to School.</i>

You feel good about yourselves?
Huh?

This is why the other countries
are beating us, you know!

So you know,
you got only yourself to blame

next time you go to the vet and complain

that that Indian doctor
is too rough with your cat.

(SOBBING)

Stewie, are we gonna die?

Hey, hey.

Probably.

I-I don't want to die!

You know, Chris, if by some miracle,

we do manage to get out of here alive,

I'm gonna finally run
for public office again.

I think people have forgotten
my last embarrassment.

Harry Truman. Stupid jerk.

Freakin' FDR's ass bitch.

If we get back home alive,

I'm gonna finally open up
to Ellen from my math class

and tell her how much I like her.

I'd like those things for us, Chris.

What are you doing?

I'm digging a hole.

Why?

'Cause I like to
sleep on my side.

<i>Our top story: The search</i>
<i>for two local boys</i>

<i>lost in the woods drags</i>
<i>on into its third day.</i>

<i>That's right, Diane.</i>

<i>Still no sign of Chris</i>
<i>and Stewie Griffin.</i>

<i>Here's the update</i>
<i>from the local authorities</i>

<i>who are overseeing</i>
<i>the search party's efforts.</i>

We're still very optimistic that
we're gonna find these kids,

and we just want to urge
everyone not to give up hope.

All right, everyone,

we are officially looking for corpses.

Repeat: this is now a recovery effort.

We are officially looking for corpses,

so let's get back out there,

bring back those dead bodies.

Oh, God, this is horrible!

I can't watch anymore!

Mom, Daddy, thank you
so much for coming over.

Oh, of course, dear.

I don't know what to do.

They scoured the area,

and there's
no sign of them.

I feel like I can't just
sit here doing nothing,

but I don't know what I can do.

I'll tell you who could help. Medium.

Daddy, that's not
a real person.

That's a character on a TV show.

Don't you disparage Medium.

Medium works very hard.

You know, Mom, I saw this thing
on the Discovery Channel

about psychics who help
find people who are lost.

Really?

I saw this thing on
the Discovery Channel

about this fat woman
who sat on her dog

and it went up inside her guts.

It's been three days,

and I just don't know where else to turn.

Please, can you help me?

Don't worry, Lois.

The spirit world wants
very much to assist you.

Your missing sons will be found.

Oh, oh! Thank you! Thank you so much!

I can't tell you how reassuring that is.

Ah. My babies are okay.

Will you answer one question for me?

Yes.

Thank you so much.

Well, Stewie, I think we're finished.

It sure looks that way.

It's been a pleasure
serving with you, Chris.

And with you, Stewie.

Jeffrey! Jeffrey, come back!

It's gonna get dark soon!

All this drama over a turkey burger?

(GASPS)

Oh, thank God!

Oh, you're not Jeffrey.

You're that missing baby and boy.

(GASPS) Jeffrey!

I found that missing baby and boy!

JEFFREY: I don't care.

(GASPS)

CHRIS AND STEWIE:
Mommy!

Chris! Stewie!

My babies!

Oh, I'm so happy you're safe!

Oh, I knew they'd find you.

I knew you were okay.

It's just like the psychic said.

Thank you all for your help, everybody.

Oh, for definite.

It's just like a childhood
game of Hide and Find!

You said it, friend!

What do you say for celebration,

we go dunk our whistles in the trough?

Ah! We should totally phone Gaspard!

Ah! He would love to hear this tale!

Oh, but I only have 15 pfenigs
on my phone card.

Happy Gerbitz Day.

-Ah!
-Ah! Ah!

-Ah!
-Ah!

Oh, it is so good to have my
boys back home safe and sound.

Thank God for that psychic.

What are you talking about?
The psychic didn't do anything.

Well, she said we were gonna
find them and we did.

I always wondered about psychics,

but I gotta tell ya, I'm a believer now.

Yeah, I'm gonna go back and see
what else she has to say.

Hey, check it out. Chris and Stewie,

you're on the front page of the paper.

You know, Chris, that girl from school

sees that picture and you're in.

Look, Stewie, I'm not
really gonna ask her out.

I think that just might have
been cocky forest talk.

No, but you got to take advantage of this.

Seize your moment.

Like the Duck Founding Father.

Gentlemen, these are all
important fundamental rights,

but I move we strike the right
to bob for small fish

with your butt in the air. All in favor?

-ALL: Aye.
-Opposed?

(DUCK QUACKS)

The motion carries.

I don't know about this, Stewie.

Nonsense. You're a hero now.

Your picture's in the paper.

She'll be fawning all over you.
Now, which one is she?

There.

Hi, Chris!

Wait a minute. That's the girl?

Yeah. Isn't she special?

That's the way the state
of Rhode Island would put it.

Uh, there's something...
up with her, isn't there?

Yeah. She's got
Down syndrome.

Oh, okay, well, there we go.

She's so sweet.

And doesn't she have
the most beautiful eyes?

Well, the spacing seems a tad off,

but, yeah, individually,
they're not awful.

All right, I'm on board.
Go talk to her.

Um, hi, Ellen.

Hi, Chris.

Um, this is my little brother Stewie.

(CHUCKLES) Your head makes me laugh.

I'm guessing this one owned
a bunny, but not anymore.

(THUDS)

Um, listen there's something
I've wanted to tell you

for a really long time.

Oh, yeah? What?

Well, um... I really like you.

(LAUGHS)

And I was wondering
if maybe, um...

You want to go out
on a date with me.

Okay. Pick me up
Saturday at 8:00.

Great.
See you then.

There you go.
Being confident.

Like an Italian guy in
any given theoretical situation.

If that was me...

I'm, I'm just saying, if that <i>was </i>me...

They are lucky that was not me.

Because, if the
circumstances were such,

as you have described them,

but with me in them,

that's a very different
and scary outcome

for those involved.

If.

Oh, my God, Brian.

Oh... my... God.

Whoa. What is it?
What happened?

I just went to see
my psychic Estelle,

and she told me
that Stewie is gonna grow up

to be very successful.

Ah! Isn't that great news?

You went to see that psychic again?

That's the third time this week.

She's a lifesaver, Brian.

She gives me the confidence
to live my life,

knowing I'm making the right choices.

Wow, and she does all this for free?

No, she charges me.

She charges you? Well, that's weird.

Why would you pay her to
hear things you want to hear?

I'm not crazy about your tone, Brian.

Well, I just think you're
being taken for a ride, Lois.

Like a snail on the back of a turtle.

Slow down!

I want to get there,
but I want to get there alive!

Mom, why do I have
to take a bath with Stewie?

Because, Meg, Estelle told me
that someone in the family

was in danger of drowning,

and that I should take
some steps to prevent it.

So, from now on,
everybody has a bath buddy.

Hey, Meg, watch.

(FARTS, BUBBLING)

(BOTH LAUGH)

-(FARTS, BUBBLING)
-(BOTH LAUGH)

(SCREAMING)

What am I gonna do?

I'm really nervous about
my date with Ellen tonight.

I mean, I want to impress her,
but what if I mess things up?

Oh, come on, Chris, it's just a matter

of getting off on the right foot.

First things first.
Let's get you looking sharp.

Okay, Brian, I'm here.

Now, what is it you want?

All right, look, Lois,
this psychic nonsense

has gone too far, so I'm
going to prove to you

that there is no such thing
as someone who is psychic,

and that with the most minimal training

and the right set of buzzwords,

anyone can appear to be psychic.

Even a complete boob
like Peter. Watch this.

Excuse me, ma'am. I'm psychic,

and I'm getting a strong feeling from you.

Do you have a watch or clock
that no longer works?

Wow. I used to have a watch that broke.

You see, just by asking
very general questions

that would apply
to most people,

a person can appear to have
inside knowledge about you.

I'm also sensing
that you have a dead relative.

My husband died of
cancer last year.

Oh, my God. Awesome.

Okay, uh, I'm sensing
some other bad stuff.

My daughter was just
in an accident.

-Sweet! High five!
-(GASPS) You're awful.

Hey, you don't want to hear the truth,
don't come to the park.

(SIGHS) Okay.

Okay, you made your point.

I get it.

Maybe I went a little overboard

with the things Estelle told me.

All right, look,
can we just go home now?

Come on, Peter. Let's go.

Brian, I felt something.

Just now, talking to
that bitch cancer widow.

I think I may have a gift.

Peter, we were just doing
a demonstration.

No, Brian. This is real.

I believe I am psychic.

My first prediction:

I am either going to fly
or ruin that family's picnic.

Hey! You've ruined our picnic!

Psychic.

Peter, what are you doing?

Quiet, Brian.

I'm performing a psychic reading.

Peter, for the last time,
you're not psychic.

I most certainly am.

All right, Quagmire, clear your mi...

Ooh, soft hands.

Clear your mind,

remove all traces of unease and doubt,

and I will tell you your future.

What is it, Peter?

You will die in a plane crash

and be reincarnated as a prophylactic.

All right!

No, no, not all right!

Well, I'm glad we're
finally going out, Ellen.

I've really liked you for a long time.

Hey, what the hell you think you're doing?

Sitting down.

Get up and pull my chair out for me.

Oh, goodness, I'm sorry.

(CHUCKLING) I'm so sorry.

That's better.

You going to be this rude all evening?

You haven't asked me
anything about myself.

Oh. Um, sorry.

Um, uh, so... so, what do your parents do?

That's better.

My dad's an accountant,

and my mom is the former
governor of Alaska.

Oh, that's cool.

It's real cool.

Now, get up, come over here,

and give me a
shoulder massage.

Okay.

Boy, you're tougher
than a doggy dominatrix.

Do it, do it. Come on, do it.

Do it, do it.

Aah, yes!

Yes! Aah, you bitch!

Aah!

Oh, my God, this is awful.

There's got to be 200 people here.

Thank you.

Thank you so much for coming.

Thank... (GASPS) Hold on.

I'm sensing something psychic.

Ma'am, did you have a female relative

who's passed on to the other side

named, um, um...

-Polly?
-Polly! I said it first.

That was amazing.

I've never seen a bad show
at the Marriott.

Oh, my God, they're all
falling for this insanity.

I'm sensing a black guy
over here.

Is there a black guy?

Me! I'm a black guy.

(CROWD OOHING AND AAHING)

Yes, good, good.

I'm sensing your infant daughter
has earrings.

He's right. She does.

(APPLAUSE)

Peter, you got to
stop this right now.

Shut up, Lois.

Don't mess up my psychic-ness.

I'm sensing a doctor in the audience.

Where is the doctor?

I'm a doctor.

Okay. Your great grandmother

is contacting me right now,
and she wants to know

if this rash looks like

it's going to go away.

Well, I-I-I guess

I'd tell her to use Bactine.

No! She says Bactine hurts.

She wants something more soothing.

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

Peter, we need your help.

We just got word of a kidnap victim

buried alive with a bomb
strapped to his chest.

We need your psychic powers

to lead us to him
before the bomb goes off.

Well, well.

Finally, a true test of my abilities.

You came to the right place, Joe.

I'll psych that guy out for you.

Peter, you can't do this.

All right, I mean, it-it's one thing

to take money from a bunch of suckers,

but this is serious.

-You're a fraud.
-I am not.

I'll tell you who's a fraud: Mr. Spock.

-Mr. Sulu, set a course for...
-One moment, Captain.

They're about to announce
the winning numbers

for the Intergalactic Lottery.

FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Today's winning numbers are:</i>

Ah, yes!

You're damn right!

Hell, yeah!

You can suck it.

You can suck it.
You can suck it.

You can all suck it!

Live long and suck it!

Well, Ellen, I had

a really interesting time
with you tonight.

I guess I'll talk to you soon.

You're not leaving yet.

I need somebody to make
me an ice cream sundae,

so get in the house.

Okay, okay.

Uh, unless you're going
to pull a sundae

out of your belly button,

I'd get your ass
in the (BLEEP) kitchen.

Oh, boy.

My dogs are mooing today.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

What's the matter?

Did I say put chocolate sauce on there?

Did you hear me say
put chocolate sauce on there?

Well, I... I just thought that...

You thought what?

You know, if you want
access to this temple,

you'd better pay the proper tribute.

All right, that is it!

I don't care how hot you are.

I don't much like being treated this way.

You know, I used to hear
that people with Down syndrome

were different than the
rest of us, but you're not.

You're not different at all.

You're just a bunch of (BLEEP)
like everyone else!

I got bad news for you, buddy.

You just blew it.

Get out of my house now!

How'd it go?

Looks like I totally screwed that up.

No, you didn't. You made a vow

that you were going to ask
Ellen out, and you did.

That took courage, my friend.

Especially for a poor, timid sap like you.

I'm proud of you.

Thanks, Stewie.

I'm just sorry I never got
to make out with her.

Oh, she would have crushed
your scrote into a diamond

with her robot-strength hand.

Come on, let's get out of here.

All right, Peter, we know the victim

is somewhere in this area.

We don't have much time before the bomb...

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Okay, Joe, when I'm tracking someone,

it often helps to touch something

that belongs to the victim.

Does he have a wife?

Yea-Yeah.

Yeah, uh-huh.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

It's still very fuzzy.

Does he have a daughter?

Yeah, I see.

Does he have maybe, like,
a thinner, hotter daughter?

Well, yes, but she's only 12.

Okay. Like-like a... like a young 12

or, like, a
"she eats a lot of milk products

"so she got her boobs early" 12?

Which is a real thing, by the way.

Peter, we're running out of time!

All right, all right,
we'll try something else.

I will now use my psychic powers
to seek help from beyond.

I shall now channel the ghost
of Lou Costello,

who will guide us
to this soul in distress.

Hi, everybody. It's me, Lou Costello.

All right, what's the name
of the guy we're looking for?

Well, he's an Asian fella...
Melvin Hu.

-That's what I want to find out.
-What?

-The name of the guy.
-Melvin Hu.

-Are you a cop?
-Yeah.

-You handling this case?
-Yeah.

-Then what's the name of the guy?
-Hu.

-The guy we're looking for.
-Hu.

-The guy who's buried.
-Hu.

-The guy with the bomb.
-Hu.

-What street's he live on?
-First.

(BOMB EXPLODING)

Yeah, I'm not psychic.

You, too, Mrs. Griffin.

I think Anthony wants

Right, Meg?

Has anybody ever told you
you're pretty enough

to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin?

Oh, my goodness.
Well, I don't know about that.

Penelope Ann Miller, Nancy Travis,
now, <i>those </i>are movie stars.

she ain't what she used to be, all right?

it's like two sagging pressed hams

But I don't want to go home.
I want to be on <i>Jolly Farm!</i>

Well, you heard her.
They're only auditioning little girls.

Now, come on, let's get out of here.

(SIGHS) I suppose you're right.
Nothing I can do.

Okay, our next young actress
on the audition list is

Karina Smirnoff.

(IN GIRLISH ENGLISH ACCENT)
Hello, everyone!

Thank you all so much
for squeezing me in for an audition.

So, should we just jump in?

Sure. When you're ready.

(EXHALES) All right,
let me just get into character.

I'm a bit distracted.
I wasn't expecting we'd do this today

in light of the circumstances.

What circumstances?

Oh, dear God, didn't you hear? The bomb.

The bomb that went off in Times Square.

(CHOKING UP)
All those poor people... dead.

Oh, my God, my cousin
works in Times Square.

Well, your cousin is fine
because I was <i>acting!</i>

-That's impressive. Oh, wow.
-Risky, very risky.

All right, fun's over.
What do you want me to read?

We want you to read your new contract.

(GASPS)
You mean it?

Absolutely. You're hired.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh!

Well, I guess sometimes
you're just right for the part.

Like James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader.

So, James, we just
want you to do the voice.

Thanks for taking time
for me today, Bonnie.

I just didn't know who else to talk to.

Oh, that's okay, Lois.
What's on your mind?

Well, you're going to think
I'm an awful person,

but I'm attracted to another man.

-Giggity?
-It's Meg's boyfriend Anthony.

(SADLY) Giggity.

It's just that, lately,

Peter's been making me feel
so crappy about my age, and...

Well, then I'm around Anthony,

and he looks at me like
I'm young and attractive.

I'm going to tell you a secret, Lois.

I had an affair once.

(GASPS)
You had an affair?

Mm-hmm. It wasn't anything sordid.

Just some guys I met on the Internet.

The point is, it's healthy
to explore your sexuality.

Oh, I don't know.
It just feels like I'm lying to Peter...

like Jesus lied to the meek.

All right! Jesus and the jocks win again.

Hey, you said we were
gonna inherit the earth.

Yeah, when we're done with it.

-(BOY GRUNTS)
-(JOCKS CHUCKLE)

-Hello there.
-Hello.

Um, I'm new in town
and I'm awfully lonely.

I'm wondering if you wouldn't
mind buying me a drink?

Well, that'd be my pleasure.

And maybe later I can show you
some of the local points of interest.

There's one right below the table.

Oh, my, you're very bold.

Well, when your lifespan is 13 years,
you got to be direct.

Lucky for you, I like bold men.

Karina, Karina Smirnoff.

Brian, Brian Steel.

Ooh, good heavens.

Man, your accent is sexy.

Oh, this is all moving very quickly.

I'm afraid I'm a little light-headed.

You must think I'm a fool.

I'm-I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to come on too strong.

Oh, that's all right.

I've been missing a man's touch
lo these many months.

And I've been missing a woman's touch.

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Brian, Brian, it's me, Stewie.

Oh, my God, that was hilarious.
You really fell for it.

I-I was, like,
"Is he gonna fall for this?"

And then when you did, I was like,

"I guess I should see
how far I can take it

"'cause, you know, it'll be funnier."

I'm gonna kill you!

Why are you dressed like that?

Uh, because I'm the star of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

Remember how
they only needed little girls?

Oh, my God. I'm telling Lois.

You're not telling anybody, friend.

No, no, you're gonna
be my on-set guardian.

You're out of your mind.

Brian, we both know I touched it.

Now, if you'd like
to keep that just between us,

I suggest you sit back down
and order me some chicken fingers.

See? We're having a nice time.

All right, first scene up is on page 12.

Everybody, this is
our new <i>Jolly Farm </i>resident,

Karina Smirnoff.

She'll be playing the role of Mary.

-(IN GIRLISH VOICE) Hello.
-Hi, I'm Julie.

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, hello, I'm Stew...

(IN GIRLISH VOICE) Uh, I'm Karina.

Can we get some quiet on the set?
I'm trying to rehearse.

STAGEHAND: Quiet on the set!

Don't mind Randall.
He's getting into character.

Is he playing a dick?

All right, everybody, here we go.

Scene ten. Places, please.

And... action!

Oh, it's so great being here
on Jolly Farm.

Let's go to the barn and meet the animals.

Yeah! Hey, Mary,
bet I'll beat you to the barn.

That sounds like
a really chauvinistic presumption.

I mean, because I'm a woman,
you think you'll beat me?

A man is automatically better than a woman

at any physical challenge?

Well, here are a few women
who might beat you to the barn:

Joanie Benoit, Jackie Joyner-Kersee,

Babe Didrikson Zaharias,
Mary Decker, Zola Budd...

DIRECTOR: Cut!

Karina, your line is, "That sounds fun."

Well, yes, Dan, but I felt
that just because we're on a farm,

it doesn't mean we have
to be stuck in the 19th century

with our value system.

Mary needs to stand up for herself.

Hmm... Interesting.
I suppose we don't really have

an outspoken female character on the show.

All right, Karina, we'll try it your way
and see what happens.

(GIGGLES) Good luck.

She'll be gone in three episodes.

<i>Go, Stewie, go!</i>

<i>Roll, Stewie, roll!</i>

<i>Sweet Stewie roll!</i>

(FLIRTATIOUSLY) Hi, Anthony.

Hi, Mrs. Griffin.

You know, we've enjoyed
having you around so much lately,

so we got a little
"welcome to the family" present for you.

Your husband's work
and poker game schedule?

(WHISPERING) My menstrual cycle's
on there, too,

but I don't mind if you don't.

Uh, thanks.

Oh, by the way, Meg, I forgot to tell you,

your grandfather needs you
to pick him up at the airport.

Ugh, Grandpa always makes me
so nervous when I'm driving.

(CLICKS EMPTY)

Okay, now me.

That's a stop sign.

-Anthony, you want to come with me?
-Sure.

Oh, don't be ridiculous,
I'll keep him company till you get back.

Good-bye, Meg.

Let's not play games.

The other day, you said I was attractive.

Now, what are we gonna do about it?

Oh, my God.

Wow, this is so cool.

I've never had a MILF
come on to me before.

Can I, can I kiss you?

Let me ask you this:

Do my gray hairs bother you?

-What gray hairs?
-Oh, kiss me.

(MOANING)

Mom, I forgot my keys.
Do you know where...

Um... rape?

<i>(SEINFELD </i>TRANSITIONAL CUE PLAYS)

Hey, another batch of fan mail, Karina.

Oh, careful, Sam,
you're emptying your sack all over me.

(LAUGHING) What?

Stewie, how the hell long
do you think you can keep up this charade?

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I will keep up this "cha-rahd",

as it's pronounced, Brian,
as long as I see fit.

Ooh, ooh, shh, shh, shh.

-Hi, Karina.
-(IN GIRLISH VOICE) Oh, hi, Julie.

God, I love your makeup.

You know, I'm thinking of asking them
to do my makeup like yours.

Oh, you don't need makeup.

I mean, I need all the help I can get,

but you have such a youthful look,
you could pass for 11 months.

Ugh, then why do I feel like 40 months?

You've got to stop doing that to yourself.
You're fantastic.

Oh, I think you're the nicest person
I've ever met.

Hey, baby, you ready to go take a nap?

Oh, okay, Randall.

I don't think that guy is right for her.
Do you see the way he treats her?

Why do you care?

Because... I think I'm in love with her.

Whenever I talk to her,
it makes my Band-Aid start to peel off.

-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about my thing.

Got to hide it for the cameras.

Instead of tucking, I just push it in
like a button and put a Band-Aid over it.

-What kind of Band-Aid?
-Big one, big giant one.

Nah, just one of those
little dots you put on a shot.

Okay, Brian, watch,
here comes my big part.

<i>Oh, here comes Large Bird</i>
<i>and Moody Green Garbage Creature.</i>

<i>Wow, you're a big bird.</i>

<i>And I'm grouchy,</i><i>so get out of my way!</i>

<i>You watch that tone,</i>
<i>Moody Green Garbage Creature,</i>

<i>or I'll get Bernie and Gert</i>
<i>over here to kick your butt.</i>

<i>Is there a problem here?</i>

<i>Yeah, you need us to use our fists?</i>

Look at Julie, Brian.
She's absolutely beautiful.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Julie, hi, w-we were
just talking about you.

Oh, hi, do I know you?

Oh, right, yeah.
No, you don't, you know Karina.

I'm her brother Stewie.

It's nice to meet you. Is she home?

Oh, yeah, yeah, she's upstairs. Come in.

Brian, you've met Julie, right?

Julie's my sister's costar on <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

Hi, Brian.

Why don't you keep her company
while I go fetch Karina?

Just make sure you get her fast.

-Karina?
-(AS KARINA) Yes?

-(AS STEWIE) You have a visitor.
-Who is it?

It's that nice girl, Julie,
from your show.

(AS KARINA) Oh, Julie.
Did she say what she wanted?

(AS STEWIE) Just go see for yourself.
I'm not your secretary, Karina.

(AS KARINA) Why are you so cruel to me?

Is it because I'm the pretty one?
The talented one?

(AS STEWIE) Oh, for God's sakes.
You know, we're all sick of you.

That's right, all of us.

(AS KARINA) Sick of me? Oh, that's rich.

You know, I wasn't going to say this,
but Mother hates you.

(AS STEWIE) That's not true.
You take that back!

(AS KARINA) It is true. She hates you!
She told me.

It was the Christmas
we all went to Edaville Railroad,

and you cried because you were afraid

because one of Santa's elves
was a real midget,

and father said,
"That's it, I can't take this anymore,"

and he left that very night

and all you cared about
was ice cream on the way home

and Mother said
you didn't appreciate anything!

-BRIAN: Karina!
-Coming!

Hello, Julie. So nice to see you.

Please.

Two lemonades, Brian.

Oh, yeah, I'll go make you a lemonade.

I'll make you a fresh one.

So, what brings you here?

Well, I wanted to see
if you could come over

to my house tonight and run lines with me.

Don't you usually do that with Randall?

We kind of had a fight.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I thought maybe you and I
could have a sleepover tonight.

You know, a little girl time.

Oh, that would be so fun. Yes, let's.

Terrific. I can't wait.

Hey, do you mind
if I say good-bye to your brother?

(SIGHS) Fine.

-Stewie!
-(AS STEWIE) What?

(AS KARINA)
Julie would like to say good-bye to you.

Well? Answer me.

(AS STEWIE) I'm not talking to you.

(AS KARINA) You're being a baby.
Go say good-bye.

(AS STEWIE) Why? She's your friend.

And why should I do you any favors

after the terrible things
you said to me earlier?

(AS KARINA) Well, at least I didn't
bring up that time at Brigham's

when you showed your fanny
to that girl in the wheelchair.

-Julie's gone.
-(AS STEWIE) That's fine, Brian.

We're having a conversation up here.

That girl in the wheelchair
called me a name.

(AS KARINA) Yes, well, that gives you
no right to be a blackguard!

Meg, honey, I think we need to talk.

I don't want to talk to you. Get out!

Look, I understand that you're upset.

You made out with my boyfriend.
How could you do that?

I don't know, sweetheart,
but I am so, so sorry.

It was an awful thing that I did.
I never meant to steal him from you.

Is that what you think?
You stole him from me?

Are you kidding?

You couldn't steal him from me.

Well, I do know a few things, Meg,

and clearly, if I wanted him,
I could have him.

You really think you stand a chance?

Look at you, you're old, you're nothing.

You couldn't even imagine
the things I do for him.

And this isn't about making out,
this is about power tools.

Yeah, I go to places
you couldn't get back from.

I'll do anything.

You don't know me.

Oh, my God!

He hangs me from the shower rod
with your old bras,

and then we laugh at you.

Now get out of my room!

Well, when you're ready to talk...

Are you okay in there, Karina?

Be right out. Just rinsing off my Noxzema.

I'm so glad you came over.

Oh, so am I, Jules. It's been so fun.

So, I guess I sleep
in the guest room or whatnot?

No, you can sleep in here with me.

Oh, well, my goodness,
I hope there's room for both of us.

I'll just have to squeeze in here.

Well, good night, Karina.

You know, I really like
spending time with you, Julie.

Me, too.

Why couldn't we just have girlfriends
instead of boyfriends?

I know.
It's all just one big, confusing mess.

-Can I snuggle with you?
-Uh-huh.

(SWEET MELODY PLAYS)

Good night, Julie.

Well, I hope you're happy, Peter.

Our daughter hates me
and it's all because of you.

Me? What the hell did I do?

You've made me feel so unattractive lately

that I went and did something

disgusting and abhorrent
and I'm ashamed of myself.

Peter, I made out with Meg's boyfriend.

You made out with Meg's boyfriend?
How the hell could you do that to me?

Because, Peter, you've been
making me feel old and fat

and unattractive and worthless.

How do you expect me to respond?

Lois, I think you're the most beautiful
woman I ever seen in my life.

Well, but then why have you
been saying all these horrible things?

Because I'm old and fat
and unattractive and worthless.

I guess I thought that
if I could bring you down,

you wouldn't start to notice
that you're too good for me

and run off looking for another fella.

Peter, that's ridiculous.

-I love you.
-Why?

-Maybe I like fat guys.
-You do?

-Maybe I like having sex with fat guys.
-Yeah?

Maybe I want to have sex
with a fat guy right now.

Well, maybe I want to have sex
with an ugly, old broad.

-Peter!
-Gotcha!

(LAUGHING) Wow!

(BOTH MOANING)

I'm going insane, Brian.

I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

I've got to tell Julie my true feelings.

So, tell her.

Have you heard, Karina?
We're gonna be doing the show live today.

I'm so nervous.
I've never been on live TV before.

Would you give me a hug for luck?

No, no, no, no, no, I'm not done yet.

-Karina, what are you...
-(MOANING)

Oh, oh, I'm not...

I'm not a lesbian.

No, no, I'm not either.

What are you exactly?

I'm sorry, Karina.

If only you were a boy.

But... I am a boy.

DIRECTOR: Okay, everybody,
we're live in five.

You'd better get out there.

Four, three, two...

Good morning and welcome to <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

Today we're going to learn
about the letter "T."

I've got something to say, Mother Maggie.

You do? Well, maybe
that can wait till later, Mary.

No, I think this needs to come out now.

You see, I didn't move to Jolly Farm
from the big city to be around animals.

I moved here because
my uncle was molesting my sister,

and my parents wanted her
to start a new life.

But my sister Mary
shot herself in the face,

and that's when I decided
that she would live on through me.

For I am not who you think I am.

I am not little Mary Sunflower,

daughter of Bradley and Theresa Sunflower.

No, I'm not.

(AS STEWIE) I'm Desmond Sunflower!

Desmond Sunflower, and I'm a boy!

(ALL GASPING)

A perfectly normal little boy.

Who also happens to be a transvestite.

Which begins with the letter "T."

I'm ready.

Did you talk to Julie?

Her mother won't let me see her.

It doesn't matter anyway.
She's back with Randall.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Hey, why were they
shooting that scene live?

-Convenience.
-Yeah, but why'd they--

Let's not start
pulling threads on this one.

-Can we go home?
-Sure.

-You want to get some ice cream?
-Well, why not?

I don't have to fit in that dress anymore.

-Hey, can I borrow the dress?
-STEWIE: What?

BRIAN: Nah, I'm just kidding.
I'm just doing some playful

walking-away banter during the music.

STEWIE: Can we not do that?
I have such a headache.

BRIAN: Sorry.

Hey, can I get your autograph?

(SIGHS) Fine.

Do you have a pen and paper?

What do I look like, a Staples?
I don't carry that stuff around.

to that corner drugstore

and possibly some other groceries I need

and come back
and sign several things for me?

You're a jerk.

That was my tape, everybody.

I sent that in and they put it on TV,

which makes me a famous journalist.

Journalist? You're badgering a celebrity
and passing it off as news.

Yeah, journalist.

And I got a hundred bucks for it,

which I used to buy
this $4,000 video camera.

From now on, I'm gonna be
right where the action is,

in the White Hat" Griffin.

Stewie, Stewie, how's that oatmeal?

Is it true you're having an affair
with that oatmeal?

What do you say about the rumors
that you have a full diaper?

I'm just trying to eat here.

-What did you do to your mother's vagina?
-Leave me alone!

How come your feet are so small?

Is it true you can't say "spaghetti"?

What about the rumors
that you have cooties?

Is it true you doubled your weight
in the last six months?

Daddy, help me, Daddy!

I can't get involved 'cause of journalism.

Tom, Tom Tucker, Tom!

It's not supposed to be funny.

Tom, who were you having
dinner with in there?

Was it a guy? Are you gay?
Someone said you were gay.

It was me.

Are the rumors I'm making up true?
Ignore me if you're gay.

Mayor West, over here.

What hot spot are you going to
this Friday night?

Oh, I've got some pretty nifty plans,

-Yeah?
-That's right.

I'm a clearance sale area rug.

Bernie Mac, how come you died?

Oprah, why are you so fat, Don Cheadle?

Stupid Ollie Williams broke my glasses.

I got to put in my contacts.

By the way, the repair shop called.

They said they can't fix your camera.

Well, that's just great, Lois.
That's great.

And here I was going to use the money
to take you to "Can-cun" this winter.

-Canc√∫n, Peter.
-Whoa, whoa!

I don't like Ollie any more than you do,
but we are a 21st-century family,

and I will not have
that kind of talk here.

about the...

What? What's the problem?

(STAMMERS) Okay, look, I know
I was watching TV,

but I'll... I'll stay late.

No, that's not it, Griffin.

There's... There's something
different about you.

You're not wearing glasses.

Yeah, they got busted.
I'm wearing contacts.

I can see your eyes, and...
And your eyelashes...

They're beautiful.

Who cares? What gives?

(WHOOSHING)

(BLOWING GENTLY)

Griffin, I never noticed you before.

I like what I see.

Uh, okay.

-Oh, no, I dropped my pencil.
-Oh, I'll get it for you.

Yeah, this is gonna work out just fine.

(BREAKS WIND)

(CHUCKLING) Excuse me.

Family, we need to talk.

Your father was sexually harassed
at work today.

-What?
-That's right.

Angela grabbed my ass.

So what? Peter, a woman can't
sexually harass a man.

Why not?

I don't know,
it just doesn't make any sense.

I mean, guys like being touched by women.

It's not harassment if you like it.

But I didn't like it.

I got sexually harassed at school.

My chemistry teacher,
Mr. Taylor, rubbed my shoulders

for 35 minutes in class
the one day I didn't wear a bra.

See, Peter, that's harassment.

An older man, a weak, younger woman.

He could have taken advantage of her,
forced her to do things to him.

He did... Awful things.

See? But you, it just can't happen.

Griffin, get in here,

and make sure you have on
your new uniform.

Why am I the only one
who has to wear denim shorts?

Because you're the only one
who looks this good in them.

Damn, Griffin, you fill those out nicely.

Why is there a dusty gas station
and a Diet Pepsi machine in your office?

'Cause your car broke down,

and you need to wipe a cold soda
on your neck to cool off.

Well, maybe I don't need to cool off.

Maybe you don't need to be employed.

-It's hot in here, isn't it?
-Yes.

You need to cool off, don't you?

I need to cool off.

You need to wipe your neck
with the soda can.

I need to wipe my neck with the soda can.

Do it!

Now, get out of here, you slut.

Okay. Can I keep the soda?

Oh, all right.

Yeah!

Oh...

Oh, God.

I really hope there's
a hungry horse back there.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

Oh, hi, Angela, hang on.

Peter, it's your boss.

I don't want to talk to her.
She's gonna harass me.

Oh, don't be such a baby.

I'm sorry, Angela, Peter can't talk.

He's upstairs in the shower
touching himself to your picture.

Give me that.

Why are you calling me at home?

ANGELA:<i> I want to hear you breathe.</i>

<i>-Breathe into the phone for me, Griffin.</i>
-What?

<i>Shh, shh, shh. Don't talk, just breathe.</i>

<i>It turns me on.</i>

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

<i>That's it, Griffin. Keep breathing.</i>

<i>God, I'm almost there.</i>

(MOANS)

<i>Your breath is filling me up.</i>

(MUMBLING)

I like kangaroos.

<i>Oh, sure you do.</i>

<i>Well, tomorrow,</i>
<i>I'm getting you</i><i>a kangaroo T-shirt.</i>

And she wants me to come over
to her house tonight

to work on a "special project."

I know she's gonna make me
have sex with her.

-What the hell am I gonna do?
-I don't know, Peter.

If you have sex with her,
you give her all the power.

If you don't have sex with her,
you're gay. You can't win.

I don't want to get fired
and have to look for another job.

What the hell do I do?

I might be able to help you, Peter.

All right, hurry up,
let's get this over with.

All right, unbutton your shirt
and your pants.

That oughta do it. Okay, close up.

All right, let me get lined up right,

so she'll think it's you
she's having sex with.

-Wow, that's really clever.
-Thanks.

And if you don't feel
like doing Lois later,

-I can stick around.
-(LAUGHS)

Let's... Let's just see how this goes.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

-Hello, Griffin.
-Hello, Angela.

You know, Angela,
I've been thinking about it,

and I want to have sex with you now.

-Really?
-QUAGMIRE: Giggity.

Yeah, but... But I want to just do it
through my zipper, all right?

(STAMMERS) I don't want to
have to take off all my clothes,

'cause I'm self-conscious
about my Congressman Barney Frank body.

Well, I suppose I can work with that.

QUAGMIRE: Oh, yuck.

What do you say we go into the bedroom?

Uh, yeah, sure.

Aw, she's so ugly.
I don't want to get in that.

Peter, I'm... I'm not gonna do it.
Deal's off. Deal's off.

-No, it isn't!
-Yes, it is.

I'm gonna spread my legs,
and it'll be you doing it, not me.

-You better not.
-I am.

I'm re-jiggering my position right now.

Oh, no, you don't!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

What the hell is going on here?

Oh.

Hi, Angela, I'm Peter's friend,
Glenn Quagmire.

Uh, thank you so much
for having me in your home.

And, um, I would have had sex with you,

but Peter neglected to tell me
that you are a complete dumpster fire.

(CHUCKLES) Some friend, huh?

Okay, all right, take it easy.

I am tired of playing games, Griffin.

I mean, let's go.
I have waited long enough.

I'm having sex with you right now.

No! I don't wanna!

Griffin, you have sex with me,
or you're fired.

Fine! Fire me!
I'm through being harassed by you!

You know, this is awful timing,

but I... I remembered
part of the reason I came over

was 'cause my cousin is looking
for a job at the brewery.

I'll... I'll just put his r√©sum√©
under the door.

Give me another one, Horace.

All right, but slow down, Peter.

Or else I'm gonna have to get
that lady boss of yours

to come in here and give you
a good shoe to the gift bag.

You know, keep you in line.

(ALL LAUGH)

I'm just kiddin' ya, Peter.

You'll find yourself a new job.

MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to Robert Mitchum</i>

<i>in </i>A Backhand for Sally.

<i>You're getting on that train with me.</i>

<i>I can't go with you.</i>

<i>I just can't. </i>(GASPS)

<i>Okay, I'll go.</i>

<i>Ow! I said I'd go.</i>

<i>Why'd you give me the back of your hand?</i>

<i>Because I love you.</i>

Wow, I thought you had to be in the NBA
to hit a girl in the face.

But I guess anyone can.

<i>Of course you can hit a girl in the face.</i>

<i>They have faces, don't they?</i>

Are... Are you talkin' to me,
Robert Mitchum?

<i>You bet your ass I am.</i>

<i>Look at you, you're pathetic.</i>

<i>What kind of a man gets fired by a broad?</i>

A man with a female boss?

<i>Don't crack wise.</i>

<i>Listen, Peter, somewhere along the line,</i>
<i>you got turned around.</i>

<i>You're a man.</i>

<i>And what do you think</i>
<i>it means to be a man?</i>

Um, it means not gettin' pushed around.

<i>-Exactly.</i>
-It means drinkin'

not because I want to,
but because I need to.

<i>-Right!</i>
-It means standing up to fart,

not hidin' it in a pillow,

or holdin' it in till your stomach goes...

(GROWLING)

<i>-Now you've got it!</i>
-Give me my keys, Horace!

I'm going to see my boss!

But, Peter, you're drunk!

Horace.

You're right. This is more important.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Angela! Open up in there!

(MOTOR RUNNING)

Oh, my God!

Angela! Angela, wake up!

What the... Griffin?

Angela, what the hell are you doin'
tryin' to kill yourself?

Oh, why the hell did you
pull me out of there?

You should've just left me alone!

That's how I'm gonna end up, anyway.

What are you talkin' about?

I'm talking about the fact
that I have nothing to live for.

Sure, you do.

Someday, a white man's gonna
be elected president again.

Griffin, I haven't been
with anyone in 10 years.

And when you spurned my advances,
it was a wakeup call.

No one's ever gonna love me again.

Wait a minute.

So that's why you been actin'
like such a wacky ass around me?

It's been so long since
I've been with a man,

I don't even remember what it feels like.

I always imagined it felt very painful.

You just sorta grit your teeth
and let us do what we want.

I just wish one person
was able to find me attractive.

That's not too much to ask, is it?

No...

Look, Angela,
I came over here to punch you

and maybe kick you in the boob.

But now I'm all turned around.

Angela? Angela?

-Right here.
-Oh.

But now all I want to do is help you out.

I'll tell you what, you know that ritzy,
upscale place over on Third?

-The Stuffy Fella?
-That's it.

You be at the Stuffy Fella
tonight around 9:00.

I think I know someone
who might be perfect for you.

Mm, well, hello.

Good evening, sir.

I am Reginald New York Knickerbocker,
millionaire.

(SNIFFING)
Are you serving fish this evening?

No, sir.

Then I believe my guest has arrived.

There she is!

You must be Angela.

Hi, are you Peter's friend, Reginald?

Mm, indeed I am.

Mm, what a beautiful shade
of lipstick on those teeth.

Oh, thank you,
but that's just my gums bleeding

from aggressive gingivitis.

Mm, well, your mouth is too sweet
for your teeth to want to stay in.

-(GIGGLING) Oh.
-Yes.

Well, I... I'm just gonna
go to the powder room and freshen up.

She's eatin' it up.

This is easier than an American
finding his brother in China.

Ron? Ron, where are you?

Over here, Paul!

Oh, good, there you are.

-It's pretty here.
-Yes, it is.

Mm, what a wonderful dinner.

Would you like some dessert?

Did you bake a pie?

Well, there is a pie.

It's been baking since I met you.

Mm, gross.

-What?
-Nothing.

You know, Angela,
there's something I need to tell you.

My doctor has given me 24 hours to live.

Oh, my God!

No, no, it's quite all right.

Because I vowed to myself

that I would spend
the last night of my life

in the company of the most
beautiful woman in the world.

And that's just what I have done.

Oh, Reginald.

No, no, no. This is already
a perfect end to a perfect evening.

Good night, my dear.

Reginald...

I want you to make love to me.

Oh, if only I could,

but I must to a Jew
to put my affairs in order.

(SIGHS) I know what's going on here.

You don't want to be with me.
You're just like everybody else.

So... So go, then.

I'm just gonna stay here and kill myself.

But you can't kill yourself
every time somebody won't sleep with you.

I won't.

Just sleep with me just this once,
and it'll give me everything I need.

Sleep with me tonight. Save my life.

Oh, that was fantastic!

It was exactly what I needed.

Mm, well, hopefully
there'll be no more talk of suicide.

Oh, no. I feel better
than I've felt in years.

I have my confidence again.

I'm ready to go back out there
and meet someone.

Well, I'm glad to be of service.

Oh, just one more thing before you go.

What's that, my dear?

See you at work on Monday, Griffin.

Huh? Oh, I'm gonna have to have a word
with Rite-Aid about this fake moustache.

Well, I got my job back,
Angela's happy again,

and she's not gonna harass me anymore.

Everything worked out perfect.

-Not really, Peter.
-Yeah, you cheated on your wife.

No, I didn't. I used Mort.

Oh, my God, I forgot about Mort!

I want my $2!

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
S08E15.en
Boy, eight months on patrol and nothing.

You know, Rupert, I miss
the Earth so much.

I miss my wife.
It's lonely out in spa...

(ALARM BLARING)

Uh-oh, Rupert, we've got company!

And I don't think it's the Avon lady.

Strap yourself in.

No matter what happens,

it's been a privilege to serve under you.

Don't relax yet, Rupert.

Those fighters had to have
been coming from somewhere.

Oh, my God.

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

(BEEPING)

Wait a minute, Rupert,

there's a weapons systems cooling duct

on the far side of the hull.

If we can get just one good shot at it,

we can blow that fat bastard
out of the cosmos.

Uh-oh, Rupert, our main blasters are gone.

Looks like this is a suicide mission.

(BEEPING CONTINUES)

(STEWIE YELLING)

Got you! Got you! Got you!
Got you! Got you!

Stewie, get lost. Daddy's
trying to watch the ball game.

You can't talk. I've knocked
out your communication systems.

Hey, hey, look, Stewie,

Rupert wants to go play
down in the basement.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Hey, hey, Stewie,
I'm gonna go play down in the basement.

Here I go.
<i>‚ô™ Do-do-do-do-do ‚ô™</i>

What? Why, Rupert?

Why do you want to play in the basement?

I don't know, I just feel like
there might be some fun stuff down there.

I'm not following your logic.

And why are you talking
different than usual?

Here I go.

Rupert, get back here!

Rupert?

Oh, there you are.

Wow, look at all
the old stuff down here.

Hello, what's this?

<i>"What I Learned on Jefferson Street.</i>

"Written by H. Brian Griffin."

(LAUGHS) Oh, yes!

What's this?

What the hell...
Where the hell did this come from?

What is it, Brian?

It's the first thing I ever wrote.

It's a script for a television show,
a drama.

I had an idea for a script once.

It's basically <i>Jaws, </i>except
when the guys in the boat

are going after Jaws,

they look around and there's
an even bigger Jaws,

so the guys have to team up
with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.

I call it <i>Big Jaws.</i>

God, I haven't looked at this in years.

I don't even remember
if it's any good or not.

Oh, wait a minute.

Yeah, yeah, this is all coming back to me.

You know, this is actually
not too bad a piece of work.

This was... This was kind
of deep as I recall.

You know, Lois, you-you might actually
be interested in reading this.

You-you... You might actually...
You-you might like this.

You should look at it.

All right, damn it!

So, have you read the script yet?

Oh, I'm sorry, Brian,
I haven't gotten around to it.

Why not now, you know?

Just get it off your plate.

Oh, gosh, you know what?

I don't even know what I did
with the copy that you ga...

Oh, (BLEEP) there it is.

Hey, you know what else would be great?

Why-why don't you put check
marks next to scenes you like?

Well, I don't have a... Here's a pen.

You know, I'll-I'll just
leave it for you right here.

Okay. Thank you, Brian.

Hey, you know what I'll do
to make it even easier?

I'll just go ahead and
place this in your hand.

There we are.

And now when you go,
"Oh, where's that crazy pen?"

Well, there it is.

It's in your hand.

Brian, I'm not gonna read this
with you standing here.

Oh, it's okay, I don't mind.

Go for a ride in the car?

(GASPS)

Come on!

Why the hell's it taking her
so long to read that thing?

I don't know, I saw her giving Joe notes

on his pilot this morning.

-What?
-Brian, your script...

It was enchanting.

This Brian Griffin...

I've never met this Brian Griffin.

I would have told you last night,

but I was 100% sure you ripped it off.

But after spending the last 18 hours

on the Internet and in libraries

trying to find traces of it somewhere,

I couldn't find a thing.

Well, I-I'm... I'm so happy you liked it.

Look, I don't want to get your hopes up,

but Daddy's got some
connections over at CBS,

and I think he could
help you get this on TV.

That's amazing, Lois! Thank you!

Oh, I am very proud of you.

My God, a TV pilot.

Wow, Brian, you must feel like Hitler did

after he wrote <i>Mein Kampf.</i>

Well, we read it and we don't like it.

(DEJECTED SIGH)

We love it!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

You got me!

I could have killed you, Mr. Weinberg!

(CHUCKLES)

"Dear Diary, still no sign
of that tampon from last week,

"but the headaches are getting worse."

(GASPS)

Chris, what are you doing?
Give me that!

(LAUGHING)

(TAUNTING LAUGH)

Well, I'm off to buy imaginary groceries.

(GASPS) Do you think he's okay?

I don't know.

You idiot, this is your fault!

My fault?
You were the one chasing me!

You were the one reading my diary.

LOIS: Kids, breakfast.

What do we do?

Is he breathing?

It-it looks like it.

That's a good sign, right?

Brian, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to be blunt with you.

Yeah?

We love this pilot!

Oh, my God. (LAUGHS)

I felt like Hitler just then.

-What?
-It was a joke.

I just-I just said I felt like Hitler.

What? Nobody here's Jewish, right?

Uh, gee, I don't know,
are you Jewish, Gordon?

Gee, I don't know, Jeremy, are you?

I-I had no idea. I'm-I'm sorry.

Hey, Brian. We're both Italian.

(LAUGHS) You're in!

(RELIEVED SIGH)

(ALL LAUGHING)

That's a good one.
That's a good one.

(CHORUS SINGING)

Chris, I'm worried.

Stewie's still unconscious.

Maybe he's just sleeping.

-Is Stewie in here?
-Ye-Yes.

Well, can you give him to me?
It's time for his dinner.

Oh, don't worry, Mom,
we'll bring him down.

Anything I can do to make
your life a little easier.

Well, you could always
grab the vacuum

and clean up the living room floor.

Oh sure, I'll take care of that.

Are you, uh, running off to your job?

Oh.

Yeah.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

Kids, what is taking so long?

Dinner's ready.

(LAUGHS) Oh.

Look at my little cowboy.

Come on, Stewie, up in your high chair.

Boy, he must be starving.

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

Yeah, he's really chowing down.

Hey, how's the food, Stewie?

(COCKNEY ACCENT) Oy, blimey,
it's right delicious,

I do declare. Wacka wacka.

Brian, have you decided
who's gonna star in your show?

Well, it's a tough role.

I mean, Byron is a 25-year-old
single father

going back to finish college

so he can do right
by his four-year-old daughter.

So it's got to be somebody
who can project

a certain amount of
world-wizened sophistication,

while at the same time retaining

a certain youthfully passionate idealism.

You know who'd be good? Big Jaws.

Actually, in my mind,
there's only one actor

who could do this role... Elijah Wood.

(WITH COCKNEY ACCENT)
Oh, Elijah Wood.

I got a little bit of a crush on him,
I have.

Oh, oh, look, Lois, wishbone.

Okay, ready?

One, two, three.

Yes!

I got five seconds.

Hah! No gravity.

There he is!

Oh, go on.

No, really, go on.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hi, I'm Todd Goldstein,

senior executive of programming
here at the network.

We are so happy to be working with you.

I hope you brought the magic wand
you wrote this with.

Yep, it's right here.

Watch, I'll turn this beautiful
princess into a toad.

-Bing!
-Ribbit.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, all right, I can tell

this is gonna be a fun process.

You know, Brian, you've spun
gold into these pages,

and it's our job to bring
that gold to the screen.

So, what do you say we get this
casting session started, huh?

-Let's do it.
-(ALL AGREEING)

-All right! Yeah!
-(BARKING)

Okay, now obviously,
we love Elijah Wood

for the part of Byron as much as you do.

The audition is just a formality.

Let's bring him in.

Elijah?

Hi, everyone.

-Hey, Elijah, how are you?
-How you doing?

So should I just jump into this?

Whenever you're ready.

Okay, I'll read you in, Elijah.

Now, this is the scene where
Byron's professor fails him

for missing the chemistry midterm

to take his daughter to the doctor.

I'm sorry, Byron, missing the
midterm is an automatic failure.

Go ahead, Professor Watkins,
fail me if you want.

Give me an F on the exam.

I don't care because I got an A today...

as a dad.

Maybe this is news to you,

but love isn't some element
on your periodic table.

So, you know what?

Keep your chromium and magnesium,

because I discovered
a much more precious element.

I discovered Dadmium.

Wow.

Does that audition come
with a box of tissues?

That was a great read!

Thanks, everybody.

I mean, come on. How great is he?

Wow. He's amazing. That's our guy.

That's our Byron.

Great. Then we're good to go.

Look, since we're playing
with house money,

we do have one more guy.

-What?
-Oh, don't worry.

He's not Byron.

Somebody upstairs threw out a name,

got real excited about it,

so we're just playing the game.

Okay, so who?

Hey, what's up, douche bags?

I'm here to audition
for this stupid pilot!

(ALL LAUGHING)

James Woods?

Thanks for coming in, Jimmy.

Do you need a copy of the scene?

Nah, I got it memorized.

Just like your wife's phone number.

(ALL LAUGHING)

No, he didn't!

I do, though. I have it memorized.

Wait a second. I don't want this guy
anywhere near this show!

He's been harassing my family for years!

He stalked my best friend and
then he stole his identity!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, my God. That's an episode!

Brian, will you read him in?

(SIGHS)

I'm sorry, Byron.

Missing the midterm
is an automatic failure.

Hey, science face, I got an F for you.

It stands for (BLEEP).

(ALL LAUGHING)

There he is!

Hey, and guess what?

I discovered a new element.

(FARTS)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Okay, thanks a lot, everybody.
I got to go.

I got some school bus seats to sniff.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Seriously, stop it!

Okay, did everyone else feel that?

-I felt it.
-Oh, I felt it, too.

I felt whatever the most senior executive
in this room felt.

Okay, good. So we all felt it.

Wait, you're not seriously
considering him, are you?

James Woods is insane!

And on top of that, he's, like, 60.

The character of Byron is 25 years old.

I know, I know.

But what if he wasn't?

What? But he is.

...n't.

My God, this is a nightmare.

I thought you said you weren't
gonna mess with my show.

It's a small change, Brian.

You won't even notice it.

You guys aren't gonna
(BLEEP) believe this.

Call a tow truck.

I just banged into some homo's Prius.

This is Rob, our director.

Hey, Brian. Really looking
forward to making your show.

What's, uh, wha-what's
with all those empty seats?

Well, that's where the audience
is gonna sit.

Audience?

This isn't a sitcom. It's a drama.

Well, we thought it would be

a lot funnier if it was a sitcom.

It's-It's-It's not supposed to be funny.

It's a serious drama about a single father

raising his four-year-old daughter.

Oh, right. That's the other thing.

Now, this is just a thought,
but we're doing it.

-She's 18.
-What?

It was James Woods' idea

and we thought it was just the right hook.

I mean, how great is that?

A father and a daughter,
both in college together?

Hey, do you guys think
this outfit is too revealing?

What-what do you think, Brian?

I mean, what-what do you think

of the ta-tas, you know what I mean?

Can we do better?
I think we can do better, right?

Who is this? Where'd you get this girl?

Oh, by the way, I need a chimp sidekick.

Maybe we should take him
to the hospital.

I think the maggots have evolved

to the point that they've
developed space travel.

-(TINY ROCKET BOOMING)
-(HIGH-PITCHED CHEERING)

We just gotta clean the wound, Meg.

Hand me that scrub brush.

Hey, Chris.

H-Hey, Dad.

So, question. How long has
Stewie been unconscious?

Oh my God, Chris, he knows!

Dad, I am so sorry.

We should have told somebody,
but we were too scared,

and-and-and I wanted
to take him to the hospital,

but Chris wouldn't let me.

Good, Chris.
I've taught you well.

You got the right instincts.

When you were babies,

I used to knock you kids out
every month or so,

sometimes by accident,
sometimes when the Patriots lost.

You just gotta cover it up,
and eventually it all works out.

Meg, this is a list of hats.

I need these by 4:00.

Good idea.

One of those hats would have
helped him at the park today.

Chris, did you put a
coonskin cap on Stewie?

CHRIS: No, why?

(LAUGHING)

They look like little robbers.

Hey, good evening, everyone,

and welcome to the first taping
of CBS's new hit comedy,

<i>Class Holes!</i>

(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

Wait a minute. That's not the title.

It's called <i>What I Learned</i>
<i>on Jefferson Street.</i>

Yeah, it didn't make a lot of sense

now that he lives on Boner Street.

And... action!

Okay, Hillary, you know the bet.

You have to sleep with the next guy

that walks through that door.

Got it.

Dad?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

Hillary?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

You're in college?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

You're my new college roommate?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

We're gonna be living together?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

In the same dorm?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

For the whole year?

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

With my chimp sidekick?

(CHEERING)

Brian, they love it.

W-What is this? This isn't my script.

What the hell'd you do to it?

And I've got great news for you.

We just got an e-mail
from the network heads.

They want to pick up
<i>Class Holes! </i>for 22 episodes!

-Really?
-Yeah, aren't you thrilled?

I, uh... I'm not sure.

Hey, guys, the chimp just ripped
the other girl's boob off.

Please tell me you got that on camera.

Lois, I-I wish you hadn't
gone through all this trouble.

Are you kidding?

I'm so excited.

From the first time I read that script,

I just knew it was gonna make it on TV.

I could see it.

Well, yeah, I mean,

but the real victory is just
having a show make it to TV.

I mean, we almost don't
even need to watch.

Hey, what's the cast of
<i>Two and a Half Men </i>doing here?

Well, you're always saying our show sucks.

Let's see yours.

Come on, Peter! Come on, kids!

The show's about to start!

I'm coming. I was just gettin' Stewie.

All right, got the little guy
up from his nap.

Say hello to everyone, Stewie.

ALL: Aww.

Oh, oh, look, everybody.

It's starting.

<i>‚ô™ There was a man ‚ô™</i>

<i>‚ô™ He dropped out ‚ô™</i>

<i>‚ô™ Now he's back ‚ô™</i>

<i>‚ô™ He had a daughter ‚ô™</i>

<i>‚ô™ Now she's in college with him ‚ô™</i>

What a pain in my class!

(CANNED LAUGHTER ON TV)

<i>Well, Dad, I owe you an apology.</i>

<i>You said you'd win that talent show</i>
<i>and you did.</i>

<i>Now everyone's doing the Charleston.</i>

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

<i>Not everyone.</i>

<i>Someone's doing The Monkey.</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

BOTH: <i>Mr. Nubbins.</i>

<i>Well, if you can't beat 'em...</i>

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(TURNS OFF TV)

So, uh... what'd you guys think?

Not the worst thing in the world, right?

Oh, ha-ha.

Time for bed, Stewie.

So, really, everybody,
what-what'd you think?

You want to know what I think?

Well, yeah.

-You son of a bitch!
-Oh! Oh, my God!

It's a travesty! Joe, stop it!

And I will kill you!

Okay, okay. Come on, Joe.

You bastard, we hired a sitter for this!

Come on, come on, Joe!
Okay, come on.

Guys, keep his anus above his head!

Okay, okay. All right, all right.
Okay, careful. Careful, Peter.

(TWO GUNSHOTS)

PETER: Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Look, I'm sure you're disappointed, Lois,

but it wasn't my fault.

There-there were so
many people interfering.

Of course it's gonna be bad.

I'm not disappointed because it was bad.

I'm disappointed because you sold out.

You had something really
special there, Brian.

You had a vision and
you let them change it

because you didn't believe in yourself.

Lois, what was I gonna do?

It was either do it their way
or get cancelled.

Well, at least then you would
have had your integrity.

You guys wanted to see me?

Look, Brian, we're really
excited about the ratings.

We're just really disappointed
with how low they are.

We did some testing this morning,

and we think we've
discovered the problem.

People want something
more real, more grounded.

That's exactly what I think, too.

We need to get back
to the original script.

Byron wants to do right
by his daughter,

and I think that everyone
can relate to that.

That's what America wants to see.

The simple love within a family

that conquers all
and makes life worth living.

What if I'm a cop and the chimp
is my reincarnated partner?

-Yes!
-That's perfect!

See? That's relatable!

How the hell is that relatable?

And every month, he's got a story

for why he doesn't have
his half of the rent.

I'm not doing this!

What do you mean, you're not doing it?

I'm drawing the line.

I wrote a script that really
meant a lot to me,

and you guys took it and turned it
into something cheap and ridiculous.

I've had enough!

I'm not selling out anymore. I quit.

Do you guys have a
studio lawyer or something,

'cause I banged that chick,

and I think she is
well under 18 years old.

All right, he's not waking up.

I think we gotta take these bandages off

and see what we're dealin' with here.

(FLIES BUZZING)

Oh, crap, you smell that?

That's brain smell.

Okay, I don't care what you say.

He's really hurt, and I'm gonna do

what I should have done
in the first place.

I'm taking him to the hospital.

No, no. I got one last plan, Meg.

Oh, my God! Stewie!

Oh, God. What have I done?

Looks like you ran over him, Lois.

Oh, no! He's unconscious!

Peter, Peter, we have to cover this up!

Yeah, but... What?

Let's put a hat on him
to cover the wound,

and-and then let's get some makeup
and draw eyeballs on his eyelids

and find a way to pin
this on someone else.

I love you so much right now.

Let's go to the hospital.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, Brian, I'm proud of you.

You went in there and you stood up
for what you believed in.

Yeah, and now I don't have
a TV show anymore.

Oh, who cares about that?

You made the right choice
for your own integrity

and that's what matters.

Well, I suppose you're right.

And, hey, at least I got
something on the air.

I mean, not everyone can say that.

<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Our top story tonight, scientists at NASA</i>
<i>have made a fascinating new discovery:</i>

<i>the first directly observable</i>
<i>instance of a black hole,</i>

<i>which appears to be located</i>
<i>just outside our solar system.</i>

<i>Tricia Takanawa has the story.</i>

Tom, I'm standing here
with Stephen Hawking,

the first white man I've ever met
who knows math better than me.

Mr. Hawking, what does
the discovery of this black hole

mean to you and your research?

(COMPUTERIZED VOICE) I am overjoyed.

This is the crowning achievement
of my career.

It validates the work of a lifetime.

It certainly does.

Back to you, Tom.

MAN: All right, we're clear.

(NORMAL VOICE) I'm telling you, man,
this shtick is getting so old.

That chair smells, dude.

-MAN: Hey, Steve, surf's up!
-All right!

See you, bitch!

-Everyone, guess what.
-What?

-I have been selected.
-For what?

Oh, nothing too important, just jury duty!

They have summoned me.

I am part of an elite group of individuals
deemed intelligent enough

to decide the fate of a fellow citizen.

(LAUGHS)

Ah, the amused laughter of the envious.

You know, they don't just
pick anybody for this job.

Yeah, they do.

Brian, perhaps
I have not made myself clear.

I have been entrusted
to pass judgment upon others.

Everybody gets called for jury duty,
you stupid idiot! I've been called!

The only reason you've never been called

is that they use
the voter registration list,

and this past election
is the first time you ever voted.

I voted before.
I stuffed the ballot box at the Oscars.

<i>And the nominees</i>
<i>for Best Actor in a Leading Role are:</i>

<i>Grover, Bluto from </i>Popeye,

<i>a red guy, a boob,</i>

<i>and Daniel Day-Lewis.</i>

<i>And the Oscar goes to</i>

<i>a red guy!</i>

(CHEERING, ORCHESTRA PLAYING)

Wait a second. You're saying that
everyone is asked to do jury duty?

Yes, Peter.

So then, I'm not special?

TOMMY LEE: Everyone's special, Peter.

Rock Drummer Tommy Lee?

And if your wife ever tells you
that you're not special,

punch her really hard
right in her hepatitis.

Thanks, Rock Drummer Tommy Lee!

Hey, and you know what else is cool?
Having sex with sunglasses on.

I've got a lot of things to try now!

I don't want to go to jury duty.

Turns out it's not a special honor
at all. It's lame.

And the worst part is,
they try and trick you

into getting excited
by putting "duty" in the title.

So, you were excited when you thought
there was fecal matter involved?

What the hell is fecal matter?

-Waste.
-Huh?

-Doody.
-Ha-ha!

Peter, jury duty
is an important cornerstone

in our democratic society.

Yeah, that's what separates us
from the monkeys.

That and the armed guards at the zoo.

Man, they got some
sexy monkeys down there.

I don't care, jury duty sounds boring.
I'm gonna get myself kicked out.

Just like I got kicked out of Coldplay.

Guys, guys, I got an idea!

How 'bout we do a song
that's not whiny bull crap?

All right, ladies and gentlemen.

We're gonna ask you a series
of questions to determine

whether or not
you can be impartial jurors.

First off, do any of you
have any prejudices

you feel the court should know of?

Yes, you sir.

Ants. I hate ants.

-What?
-That's right, you heard me.

I'm an ant hater. Just like my daddy
and his daddy before him.

So, if this is an ant trial, forget it.
No way I'm gonna be fair.

Always making those cocky little hills.

Moving around all single file and stupid.

All ganging up
and walking my pie off the picnic blanket.

(GASPS) 'Twas my pie gone missing!

-Sir, this is not an ant trial.
-Oh.

Is there anything else
we should know about?

-Oh, have you not heard?
-Heard what?

<i>A well-a-bird-bird-bird</i>

<i>B-Bird's the word, a well-a-bird-bird-bird</i>
<i>B-Bird's the word, a well-a...</i>

All right, now the prosecution
is about to show you

items pertinent to this case
that have been entered into evidence.

It is vitally important
that you look but don't touch,

as any fingerprints
could contaminate them.

-Exhibit A, one bloody Slinky.
-(SIGHS) Oh.

Exhibit B, one semen-covered View-Master.

(SIGHS LOUDER) Oh!

With the reel of the Grand Canyon.

(SIGHS LOUDER) Oh!

And a blood-splattered Mr. Potato Head.

(SIGHS LOUDER) Oh!

And these socks you really need.

(GROANS) Oh!

All right, everyone, we're going
to take a ten-minute recess.

I would like to remind members
of the jury that you are

forbidden to discuss details
of the case outside the courtroom.

(GAVEL BANGS)

PETER: Hey, how about this trial, huh?
And all its details. Let's discuss them.

MAN: He said not to!

PETER: Hey, you know how the judge told us
not to make up our minds beforehand?

-Let's make up our minds.
-MAN: Griffin, shut up!

PETER: Hey, I know the judge said

not to run in the hall,
but check this out!

(RAPID FOOTSTEPS, PETER GIGGLING)

JUDGE: Griffin! Knock it off!

PETER: Hey, come on, Judge,
tell us the answer.

The Mexican guy did it, right?

Oh, I don't think so, He-Man. Ow!

Oh, I'm sorry, did I punch you too hard?

Yes, I suppose you don't know
your own strength. Look at your muscles.

Oh, stop it,
you're the one with the sick abs.

God, my mouth is watering
just looking at you.

Yeah, that's right. You buy your kids
ridiculously homoerotic dolls

and then ask what happened?

Yep. Your gay son is on you, buddy.

Explain that to your god.

Off to another day of jury duty, sweetie?

Yeah, and it sucks. Even
the vending machines are out of order.

(SNICKERING)

I don't want to go back
to stupid jury duty.

There's got to be some way
I can get out of it.

<i>This is Tom Tucker</i>

<i>Neptune and Pluto have</i>

Well, it's become clear,
the only way to avert this disaster

is by writing a strongly-worded
letter to the black hole.

"Dear space,

"well, you're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

"You think you're so good
'cause you went to Choate.

"Well, you're not gonna be so tough

You've had sex a million times.

called Tom's Crank Calls.

Let's dial that number, shall we?

Hello, is this Megan Fox?

I will kill you, do you understand?

If I can't have you, no one can.
I will kill you.

This is Tom Tucker.

Well, I know who you are.

(CHUCKLES) It's fun to see how
people react when they're on the spot.

Look, since these are our final hours,

I want you kids to know how much
your father and I love you,

and how important this family is to us.

Oh, I'm scared.
I wonder what it's like to die.

I don't know,
but from the look in a stray cat's eyes

when you're pushing on its windpipe,
I think it's pretty terrifying.

Like, panicky.

Hey, Brian,
what do you think is gonna happ...

What was that... You were praying.

Come on, no, I wasn't.

Yes, you were. You were praying, I saw!

-No, man, it was a joke!
-You were praying!

It was a goof! I was goofing on you!

You're, you're, you're disingenuous.

Hello, everybody.
This is Montecore. He's my lion.

I have a lion now.

(ROARS)

Peter, what the hell!

You know, I went to the zoo last week

and asked if I could do it,
and they told me to scram.

Went to the zoo this morning
with a shotgun and now I have a lion.

-Does it bite?
-Of course it bites, it's a lion.

Peter, get off the lion. We should
spend some time together as a family.

I don't think so, Lois.

But the world is ending.

We should be spending these final hours
with the people we love most.

Lois, a day ago, I was stuck on jury duty.

Today, I have a golden ticket
to do whatever the hell I want.

I feel like an old guy
who's reliving his youthful shenanigans.

Tell me about
when you were young, Grandpa.

Oh, sonny, those were crazy times.

My friends and I were out of control.

We used to give each other
wet-willies and funny arms.

We'd play dandy-balls,
and legs-a-spread, and penis-butt.

Sounds kind of gay, Grandpa.

It was gay. Everyone was.

But, back then,
we were called pole-fancies.

It was real, good old-fashioned

"grab the nearest tree
and hold on for dear life" gay,

not today's fancy, featherbed,
thread-count gay.

People got hurt back then!

-That's gay.
-Yeah, it was pretty gay.

You don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

TOM: <i>Stay with us as the countdown</i>
<i>to Doomsday continues</i>

<i>with just six more hours to go.</i>

The only thing that's nice about this is,
even though it's a Tuesday,

it feels kind of like it's a Friday.

Peter, where are you going?

Last day on Earth, last chance to do this.

I'm gonna find a black neighborhood
and see what happens

if I yell the you-know-what word.

They respected me for saying it.

<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is it,</i>
<i>our final minutes.</i>

<i>Any moment now, the Earth will be sucked</i>
<i>into the gaping maw of the black hole.</i>

<i>We here at Channel 5</i>
<i>would like to leave you</i>

<i>with some highlights</i>
<i>of mankind's brief existence,</i>

<i>like the Battle of Hastings.</i>

Guys, if we win this, we get Hastings!

-Yeah, let's do it!
-Let's go!

All right, Hastings!

The Ottoman Empire.

Ah, I could get used to this.

You know what? This is what
I want our empire to be about.

The first television broadcast.

(PLAYING LIGHT MELODY)

And with only 30 seconds to go,
we thank you for choosing Channel 5

as your Armageddon network.

-Mom, where's Dad!
-I don't know, Chris.

Sorry I'm late, guys.

Peter, where have you been!

Look, you try scheduling a haircut today.

You'd think you'd want to spend
your last day on Earth with your family!

-Hey, I'm here, aren't I?
-With only seconds left!

Don't you love me?

Of course I love you, Lois.

You're the most important person
in the world to me.

-You promise?
-I promise.

Ten, nine, eight...

I just hate being around the kids.

-What!
-...six, five...

Sorry, I just thought I'd be honest
since we're gonna die.

...three, two, one.

BOTH: April Fools!

-What!
-You gotta be kiddin' me!

We're not gonna die?

No, we're not gonna die!

(ALL CHEERING)

Wait, what did Dad just say?

<i>Yes, April Fools!</i>

<i>We at Channel 5 News concocted</i>

<i>the whole black hole story</i>
<i>as part of our commitment</i>

<i>to being festive around the holidays.</i>

<i>And with only 87 suicides</i>
<i>and widespread looting,</i>

<i>we think this was a pretty</i>
<i>successful practical joke.</i>

You dicks!

Hey, how do you like that, Lois?
We're gonna live!

Peter, what did you mean by what you said,

you hate being around the kids?

-Yeah, Dad, what did you mean?
-Don't you like us?

-Yeah, what gives?
-Well... Oh, come on.

I, I didn't mean that.
I was just joking around.

Hey, give me a big hug.
How about a big hug for old Dad?

Kids, why don't you go upstairs
so your father and I can talk.

Yeah, come on, Meg and Chris.
Let's get out of here.

Well, I'm off to serve food
at the soup kitchen.

Now that I lived through this,

I kind of have to keep
a promise I made to someone.

STEWIE: It's God!

Peter, what did you mean?

(SIGHS) All right, you want the truth?
They bore the hell out of me, Lois.

Bore the hell out of you?
They're your kids!

I know, and I love them,
but don't you just sometimes wish

they'd run away, or get kidnapped
and be made to work

in a Temple of Doom?

(HUMS <i>TEMPLE OF DOOM </i>THEME)

How can you even say that?

Because, Lois, Meg tells a story

that makes you want to blow
your brains out,

Stewie just sits there, and Chris is
always leaving his Russian mice around.

Get out of here!

(RUSSIAN ACCENT)
Okay, okay, you don't have to yell.

Let us go find <i>das vaginya.</i>

Listen to you! You don't
know your own kids.

That's the problem.
It's not them, it's you!

-Me?
-Yes, you.

And you know what? You've hurt your kids
worse than any black hole could.

Lois, you're overreacting.
This will all blow over by tomorrow.

Morning, (BLEEP).

Ha-ha, I'm just kidding!

So what do we got, pancakes? Cool!

Hey, what's on tap for school today, kids?

-Shut up, Dad.
-Whatever.

So, Chris, how, uh,
how are all your friends at school?

What do you care?
You don't even know who my friends are.

Sure, I do. Um, Chandler...

Fonzie...

and Remington Steele?

You got lucky, Dad.

So, Stewie, how's everything
going in Lego Land?

Oh, pretty good. I made a spaceship...
Wait a minute. I'm not talking to you.

Come on, guys.
Let's go eat in the living room.

It stinks in here.

Oh, no, does it stink 'cause I farted?
'Cause sometimes I can suck 'em back up.

I think we can make up some of
these losses in the third quarter.

(PETER FARTS)

-(PNEUMATIC SUCKING SOUND)
-What was that?

What was what?

Oh, nothing.

I thought I smelled a fart,
but now I don't.

They, uh, they're really pissed
at me, aren't they?

Oh, look who's starting to get it.

Peter, they heard you say
you hate being around them.

They know you have no interest
in getting to know them.

I mean, how would you feel?

Well, right now I feel like a jerk.

Peter, if you really
do care about your kids,

you're gonna have to earn back
their respect and affection.

How do I do that?

You gotta spend time with them
and make their interests your interests.

(SIGHS) I guess you're right, Lois.

I'm always screwing up.

Like that time with Jason Mraz.

Oh, my God! You're Jason Mraz!

No, I'm not. I'm just some guy with a hat.

Yeah, that's who Jason Mraz is!

(SWEETLY) Hey, buddy.

What's going on?

-You having your period?
-What!

I'm just trying
to take an interest in your interests.

My period's not an interest.

It's something that happens to me
that I cannot control.

Gross.

All right, I'm gonna go talk to Chris.

-Hi, Chris.
-Hello... Peter.

You know, I was just thinking,

when I was your age,
my Uncle Roy shared a beer with me.

I drank it,
and I was so excited, I fell asleep.

I must have tossed
and turned something fierce,

'cause when I woke up, my pants were off.

Never saw much of Uncle Roy after that.

Turns out we weren't even related.

Anyway, I thought him sharing
that beer with me

was the coolest thing ever.

And I know nowadays things are different,
so I got some crystal meth.

I figured we could do it
together as father and son.

-I don't know about that.
-Tell you what, I'll get us started.

(SNIFFING)

Ah... That feels...

That feels better.

You sure that stuff is okay?

All I know is the guys
who made it are dead.

Why is there no hole in this wall?

You know, this thing is bugging me.

All right, I'm gonna take a hike.

So, you gonna introduce me to your pals?

That's Trap Jaw. That's Optimus Prime.

That's Destro.

And that's a Care Bear.

You having a tea party?

No, we're working out a land deal.

Trap Jaw is trying to get a variance

to build an unpermitted
structure within 10 feet

of Optimus Prime's property line.

Destro is the City Councilman
who's telling Trap Jaw

that he has to file it
as an accessory structure,

and even then it can only be
built at the rear of the lot.

And the Care Bear is just a Care Bear.

I am so (BLEEP) ready!

I don't know, Lois, I tried my best.

I don't know what else
I possibly could have done.

Peter, you're just gonna
have to do better.

Somehow you gotta let those kids know
that they matter to you.

(SIGHS) I'll try, Lois.

Kids, come in here.
Your father's got something to say.

Look, I know you kids ain't too happy
with your dad right now,

but I hope at least
you could see that I'm trying.

I mean, I know sometimes
we don't get along with each other.

Hell, if we weren't all related,

this would be like
the worst table at the wedding.

But we're, we're part of a family.

And I'm still your father.

And I promise I love you.

Well, then how come you said
you hated spending time with us?

Look, I may not have said
exactly what I meant.

But I, I can still be your dad,

even if we don't have
any of the same interests.

So what do you say, are we a family again?

-I don't buy it.
-Me neither.

When you jumped through
my ceiling, you let an owl in.

I know they're supposed to be wise,

but all it did was shriek
and poop out half-digested mice.

Well, then I guess there's only one thing
I can do to regain your love.

Who wants a brand new Xbox?

-Yay!
-Oh, Daddy!

Oh, my God, you're the best father ever!

(ALL CLAMORING)

Well, I guess if you can't earn
your kids' respect,

you can always buy it.

(ALL LAUGHING)

There's some awesome stuff in the garbage.

Dad, can we please
have a turn at the Xbox?

Just a second, Meg.
I'm still trying to get the hang of this.

Okay, guys, tell me again, uh, now,
which one do I press to shoot now?

Damn it! Ah, crap.

GAMER 1: <i>Who's the douchebag</i>
<i>who keeps dying?</i>

PETER: I'm not a douchebag. I'm new.

<i>Look, if you're no good,</i>
<i>why don't you just go hide till the end?</i>

PETER: All right,
I'll go crouch behind the, uh...

Is this a crouch button?

GAMER 2: Ah! Who dropped a grenade?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
S08E17.en
Hurry up.

We still have to swing by
Wyndham's before they close.

Relax. I'm almost done.

And why do you have
a safety deposit box anyway?

What's in there
that you can't bury in the yard?

I have things.

You have a dead bird in there?
What are you gonna do with that?

I was gonna take it home,

show it to Lois, make her proud of me.

Hey, I'm starving.
You want to grab a late lunch?

Can't. I'm Jenny Craig-ing.
Already paid for the meals.

And if I want to return this sweater,
we've got to get

-to Wyndham's by half 6:00.
-Half 6:00?

Yes. You have to return it
within a fortnight for a refund.

I love it,
but I feel like it was too much.

Cute, right? It's Thom Browne.
It was over $3,000.

You spent $3,000 on a sweater?

What's it to you?

That's the most idiotic thing
I've ever heard. You're a moron.

A pretentious moron.

Drop dead. I was returning it anyway.

Where'd you even get that kind of money?

None of your damn business, that's where.

You know, today started
as a really nice outing,

but as usual, you had to ruin it.

-I had to ruin it?
-Yeah, you.

You know, I was actually hoping

that you'd talk me
out of returning this sweater.

So, you're right. I guess I am a moron.

You know, it's the one time
I ever splurged on myself,

and you have to go
and make me feel foolish.

-Look, I didn't...
-Save it, okay?

I'll be waiting outside
under the porte cochere.

It's my own fault for thinking
I could have pretty things.

I'm not having fun anymore.

I feel you should know that.

(DOOR CLANKS)

What was that?

(GRUNTING)

I don't believe this.

Hello? Hello?

We're locked in!

(SNIFFS)

Did you... Did you just crap your diaper?

I got scared when the door closed.

(KNOCKING)

Hey!

Hello! Hello! Somebody!

We're trapped in here!

You're wasting your breath.

These bank vault doors close automatically
at the end of the workday.

This thing won't be open
again till tomorrow.

Well, there's got to be
some way out of here. Think!

I don't know. You think of something.

Well, I have no idea!

So, you invented a time machine,
but you can't get us out of a safe?

I'm uncomfortable. You have to change me.

I'm not changing you.
We don't even have any diapers.

Oh, my God, that smell
is making me sick. (GROANS)

Oh, thank you for making me
more self-conscious.

I'm not gonna be able to stay like this
until tomorrow, you know.

Well, I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

You don't?

No, I don't.

Stop looking at me like that.

Look, I'm going to propose something,

and I need you to hear me out.

Will you promise me you'll do that?

I guess.

Okay, well, I can't be in a soiled diaper

until tomorrow, Brian, we both know that.

I'll get a rash, which could lead
to an infection if left like this.

All right, fine, I'll take the diaper off.

That doesn't really solve our problem,
now, does it?

Yes, it does.

No, it doesn't though, really.

See, you're... You're not... (CHUCKLES)

You're not really thinking this through.

We... We would still be faced
with the problem of the odor, you see.

(STAMMERS) And, of course, you know,
then what am I gonna do with no diaper?

I'm not gonna walk around here
with my Tic Tac hanging out.

I need a clean diaper.

I told you,
we don't have any clean diapers.

Well, well, no, I mean,
not right now we don't, no.

But if the poo were to be removed...

I'm not following you.

If the poo were to be removed...

(STAMMERS) What does that...
What are you driving at?

Eat it.

-What?
-Eat it, Brian.

You're out of your (BLEEP) mind.

Now, you promised you'd hear me out.

Besides, is it really that big a deal?

And, you know,
I've seen you eat poop before, Brian.

Yeah, mine!

-Is that really a huge distinction?
-It is to me!

I can't even... How would... You...

That's sick! That is sick!

How messed up in the head are
you that you would even ask?

-Look, okay, okay, just calm down, okay?
-(GROANS)

We're not... We're just talking.
We're not doing anything yet.

All right, we're just talking.

Nobody's doing anything at this point.

Dogs sometimes eat feces.

It's not a judgment, it's just a fact.

So what I would need you to do
is eat what's in my diaper,

lick the diaper clean,

and then put the diaper back on me.

There is no way any of that is happening.

Well, I don't see a way around it, do you?

I would shoot myself first.

Well, how you gonna shoot yourself?
There's no gun in here.

There's a gun
in your safety deposit box, isn't there?

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GUN COCKS)

Stewie, come on.
You don't know how to use that thing.

Oh, really? What if I hold it
sideways like a Black guy?

Whoa, whoa, come on, man.
Take it easy, all right?

I don't want any trouble.

There's not gonna be any trouble
as long as you eat my poo.

That's not happening.

Well, then I'll be forced to shoot you.

Go ahead. There aren't
any bullets in that gun.

-I don't believe you.
-Then shoot me.

-I will. I will!
-Do it. Then do it!

What are you waiting for? Go on!

I will! I'll blow your (BLEEP) head off!

Wait a minute. Don't you have
your cell phone with you?

(GASPS) You're right!

-(CELL PHONE BEEPING)
-Oh, no, low battery.

I have to make this call count.

Hurry up.

-It's ringing.
-Oh, thank God.

Come on, come on.

Yes, hi. Can you connect me
to men's designer wear, please?

-Thank you.
-What are you doing?

This will just take a second.

-Give me that!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hi, uh, this is Stewie Griffin.

Uh, who am I talking to?

Hi, Matthew.

I think you're the salesman who helped me

pick out a Thom Browne sweater
two weeks ago.

Yes, I was going to see
<i>The Bounty Hunter </i>that night.

Well, I enjoyed it very much. Thank you.

Good memory, my word.
Anyway, it doesn't fit properly and...

-Give me the damn phone!
-Hey!

Sorry, he's gonna have to call you...

It's dead.

You wasted the one phone call
we had to return a sweater?

A $3,000 sweater,
which I am now stuck with.

Oh, this day. (GRUNTS)

Ow.

You stink! And now I'm trapped in here

with you and your stink
because you were too stupid

to call somebody who could help us!

That really hurt.

Just get away from me!
I can't even look at you!

Well, I'm... I'm sorry. Don't be mad.

Don't!

(SNIFFLES)

(SNIFFLES)

(SIGHS)

All right, I'll do it.

What are you talking about?

(SIGHS)

I can't leave you like this.

But you have to swear
never to tell anybody.

(GASPS) You mean, you're gonna eat my...

Yeah, no, no,
I won't tell anybody. I swear!

Okay, how should we do it?

I... I guess it's dealer's choice, really.

I suppose the easiest way would be
to use the diaper as a bowl of sorts.

All right, well, we should
get your overalls off first.

I know how to do the snaps.

There. I did it.

Okay, good. Now let's get your feet out.

(GIGGLES)

I can't believe we're doing this.

Oh, really smells bad, doesn't it?

Yeah. You sure you can't stay like this?

I'm getting a rash, Brian. I can feel it.

Okay, okay, I can do this.

All right, lay down.

It's so amazing to me
that you know how to do that.

It's... It's like watching someone
do algebra.

I just have no conception
of how it's done.

Oh, God!

(GAGGING, COUGHING)

Okay, you ready?

Okay.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

Ah, don't do it right here!

-I don't want to watch!
-What?

Take it over there. Do it in the corner.

-It's gross!
-It's your poop!

Yeah, but it's your activity, you know?

(STAMMERS) It's your... It's your thing...

(SIGHS)

(GAGGING)

(GROANS)

(GASPS)

It's done.

Got some dessert for you.

You've gotta be kidding me.

Come on. It's throw-up.

You like throw-up.

I do. I do like throw-up.

All right, now let's get
this diaper back on you.

Oh, wait. I can do this part.

So, yeah. Thanks.

I feel a lot better now.

(SNIFFS) Smell's gone.

You know, I think I missed my nap today.
I'm sleepy.

Well, why don't you lie down?

I think I will.

(SIGHS)

-Brian?
-What?

I just realized something.

What?

Tomorrow's Sunday.

(BLEEP)

(STEWIE SNORING SOFTLY)

Guess this is as good a time as any.

Ah...

Mm, whatcha doin'?

Oh. Hey.

Just needed a little drink.

Was kind of saving it, but, uh,
what the hell, right?

-Saving it for what?
-It's not important.

Want a sip?

You're offering me some?

-It's liquor, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's liquor.

Babies aren't supposed to have liquor.

This would be the most naughty thing ever.

-Do you want a sip or not?
-(GIGGLES)

Yeah, yeah!

Mm, smooth.

I like what comes out
of Lois' breasts better,

but I, I like this, too.

Ah...

Oh, startin' to... Startin' to feel that.

Oh. You know,

I like...
I like hanging out with you, Brian.

I feel like...
I feel like a big boy right now.

Yeah, this isn't so bad, right?

It's like a very private party.

Mm, I feel like dancing.

Yeah, you know how to move.

That is real...
You... Wow, that is awesome.

I'm really impressed.

Oh, wait, I can hurdle my own leg
like they used to do in the '90s.

(SLURRING) Okay, all right, you know,
this is gonna sound really weird.

This is gonna sound really weird,

-but I really want you to do it, okay?
-Wha... What?

I want you to pierce my ear.

-Let's do it.
-You mean it?

(STAMMERS) Because I... Look at my face.

I'm totally serious.
Are you totally serious?

I'm with ya. I'm on the train!

You have... Do you have a needle?

Uh, uh, ooh, there's a pin in the sweater.

Here.

Oh, my God! This is happening!
This is really happening!

Oh, you know, I think this is going
to look so good on me.

This... You know what else?

Oh, maybe I'll buy a glove
with no knuckles.

(STAMMERS) I...

I voted for McCain.

Okay, left ear. Left, left ear. Right now.

Stick it in. Come on, dude.

Can I just... Can I just say before...

Can we just, like, take two...

I love... You're so brave.

I just love how brave
you're being right now.

This is like the closest
I've ever felt to you.

Okay. Oh, my God,
I was thinking the same thing.

We are so "us" right now.

Do you... Do you know that?

Okay, okay.

Okay, here we go.

(SCREAMS) Oh, my God!

-Oh! Are you okay?
-Is it over?

I think. I don't know where the pin went.

Mov... Wait, move your hand.

Oh, wow! Oh... (BLEEP)

What? What? What is it?

It's stuck in there.

I think the pin's too thick
to go all the way through.

-Ew! Get it out!
-(SCREAMS)

Got it.

How's it look?

Cool.

Really? Oh, that's good.

Oh, I knew it was...
I knew it would look...

It would look cool. We don't... Wait.

Don't we have to put an earring in it
so the hole won't close?

I don't think it's gonna close.

I can't believe...

I can't believe I have pierced ears.

I'm one of those people who I talk about.

Finally, no more clip-ons, you know?

No... Hey, give me some of that.

Don't hog that there.
Give me some of that.

It looks... It looks really good, Stewie.

(STAMMERS) I wish we had a mirror
'cause I actually did a really good job.

Oh, yeah, it's awesome. I'm not worried.

Mm, cozy.

-So, um, question.
-Yeah?

This is gonna seem stupid,
but I've been dying to know.

<i>The Dog Whisperer.</i>

Wha... What is that?

Is any, is any of that true?

Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I've offended you.

No, no, no, not at all, Stewie, no.

It's... Some of that stuff,
some of that stuff is right on.

Really? Wow.
Well, give me a "for instance."

Well, the guy talks about...

-Cesar Millan.
-Right, Cesar Millan

talks about living in the moment

because that's how dogs live, you know?

We live in the moment.

I hope he's not Mexican.

There's something off about him,
but I hope it's not that.

You know, people can learn
a lot from dogs, you know?

A lot. Like, we're like, like here's us...

We're, like, "Yeah! Yeah!"

Like that. "Yeah! Yeah!"

Okay, sure, sure, relax, relax.

It's just, well, you don't...

I mean, you don't really do
any of those things, do you?

Yeah, I do. Wait.
What are you talking about?

It's just, I don't know...

I mean, do you...
You really live with purpose?

How could you say that to me?

Just callin' it like I see it.

Listen, why don't... Why don't you...

You know what? You can just go to hell!

Hey, whoa, whoa.
Look, I didn't mean to start anything.

Let's just forget it, okay?
We're... We're having a good time.

I don't want to forget it.

How dare you tell me
that my life doesn't have purpose.

No, that's not what I said.
That's what you're saying.

No, no, no. Don't do that.
Don't try to turn my words on me.

And you know what, take that sweater off.
It makes you look queer.

Are you trying to hurt me?

Because you've succeeded.

Oh, just calling it like I see it.

Oh, I see. Is that what we're doing?

All right, well,
I'll play that game with you.

Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

You think I care about you? I don't.

Yes, you do. I know you do.

I don't really care.

No, you're just smart enough
and you're just clever enough

to occasionally amuse me.

If I had anybody else,
anybody else to choose from, I would.

You are the best of a bad situation.

Nothing more.

I use you, man.

Yeah, I would know if you were using me.

Oh, oh, you would?
I got you to eat my poop.

And you know why I did it?

Yeah, you were afraid
you were going to get sick.

Because I wanted to see if I could.

You're a monster.

Hey, you started this whole thing.

You son of a bitch,
I could kill you for that!

Oh, really? Well, how convenient.
You got a gun right there.

Here you go, Brian. You want to kill me?
Kill me with this.

Oh, but there are no bullets in it,
are there?

Yeah, there are. I lied.

Oh, you're so full of crap.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

I'm sorry, Stewie.

Me, too.

How long is this gonna last?

No idea.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

-Hope I'm not bothering you.
-Nope.

Just doing some stretching.

Maybe a few poses.

You'll tell me
if I'm bothering you, right?

Uh-huh.

Oh, yuck. What happened to my ear?

We pierced it.

Oh, yeah.

Lot of crazy (BLEEP) went on last night.

Well, we were both drunk.

Oh, of course, of course.
Oh, yes, that's right.

We were four pillows
to the breeze, my friend.

I don't know what the phrase is.

(STAMMERS) What are you reading?

<i>David Copperfield.</i>

It looks old.

It's a first edition.

That's why I keep it
in my safety deposit box.

-It's by Charles Dickens.
-Ha. Giggity.

What are you doing?

I was hungry. You want one?

You've had energy bars this whole time?
You idiot!

Not energy bars.

Jenny Craig Anytime Bars.

And you just bitched
yourself out of a bite.

All right, I'm sorry.

All right, can I have one, please?

All right.

-Can you give me a caramel one?
-No.

You can have, um...

You can have, um...

You can have strawberry yogurt.

Hey, Bri?

Yeah?

How come you have a gun?

I don't know.

What do you mean you don't know?

You... What about all that liberal crap

you're always spewing
about stricter gun regulations?

You even cried after Columbine.

Because that was a national tragedy.

Oh, it was kind of a regional tragedy.

Whatever.

It's just weird, you know?

I mean, you're the last person
anybody would expect to have a gun.

Well, that's why I keep it here
where it's safe.

That doesn't make any sense.
Why have it if you're not gonna use it?

You know, I really don't want
to talk about this with you, Stewie.

But I want to know. Just tell me. Come on.

-No.
-Come on, please.

(SIGHS)

I keep it in case
I ever want to commit suicide, okay?

Wow.

Oh.

Oh, my God. You're... You're serious.

But why, Brian?

You wouldn't understand.
You're just a kid.

Well, I could try.

I don't know. Sometimes it's all too much.

-What is?
-Life. Everything.

Just having the gun here,

knowing there's a way out, it... It helps.

Yes, but a gun... it's so messy.

It just seemed the quickest way, I guess.

I suppose.

But I don't quite understand
why you're so unhappy.

Yesterday, when you said
I don't live with purpose,

you were right.

I don't.

What purpose does my life have?

I don't like when you talk like this.

Oh, it's true, Stewie.

Dogs are supposed to be able to
instinctively live with purpose,

not even to have think about it,
just born like that.

But I wasn't.

You know, I've tried to find
meaning in my life,

and I just... I just can't.

And that bottle of Scotch?

I was saving it for my last drink.

Wow, heavy.

So is that why we came here?

Were you gonna end it?

No, I was just putting money
in my Christmas club.

God, I have to get one of those.

You know, last year I only had $30 saved
when the holidays came around.

I was so embarrassed.

I think I gave Meg tape.

Well, you're the only person
I've ever told this to.

Aren't you gonna say anything?

Well, I don't know what to say.

Wanting to kill yourself, I...

Well, I think that's
pretty selfish of you.

How is that selfish?

What would I do if you weren't here? Hmm?

You're the only one
who makes my life bearable.

I thought you said
I was the best of a bad situation.

I was just trying to hurt you
'cause you hurt me.

But the truth is,
you're my only friend, Brian.

If I didn't have you, I'd be lost.

You'd be okay.

No, I wouldn't.

I don't really care for anybody else.
Just you.

You're the only one I like.

Well, thanks.

I like you a lot.

I guess you could say I really like you.

I would even dare to go
a little further, perhaps.

I care a great deal about you.

A very great deal.

Maybe even

deeper than that.

I... I...

I love you.

I mean, you know,
not in like a "Hey, let's, you know,

"let's have an underpants party,"

or whatever grown-ups do
when they're in love, but I mean...

I mean, I love you
as one loves another person

whom one simply cannot do without.

Well, I...

I love you, too, Stewie.

You give my life purpose.

And maybe... Maybe that's enough.

Because that's just about
the greatest gift

one friend can give another.

Thank you.

Hey.

-What?
-Will you read to me?

Sure.

Wait, wait, wait. I want
to get all snuggled in.

Okay, go.

"Chapter 1, I am born.

"Whether I shall turn out
to be the hero of my own life,

"or whether that station
shall be held by anybody else,

Good luck wherever you wind up.

Take care, buddy. Call if you want.

If not, take care of yourself.

I'm just going away for a few days.

-Oh.
-Oh, okay.

Yeah, there's a seminar on creating...

Really? It would be that easy for you?

-What?
-You thought I was leaving forever

and you just said, "Good luck"?

What the hell was that?

Brian, take it easy.
You're not leaving forever.

You're just leaving for a few days.

-What do you want, a parade?
-You know what? Never mind.

Look, Brian, face it, you're a dog.

The fact that your last name
is Griffin is a pleasantry

extended from our family,
not by any legality.

Yeah, and someday, when you're ready,

you're gonna walk off
into the woods and die.

And we're prepared for that.

Yeah, so there's this seminar in New Haven

on creating your
own Web-based Internet series.

Sounds like it could be right up my alley.

Is this another one of those classes

where you make the checks out
directly to the teacher's name?

Feel good about that?
Feel good about what you just said?

You gonna go, Brian,
or should I get the can of pennies?

-(PENNIES RATTLE)
-(BRIAN GASPING)

Guys, I got some great news!

My dad's coming to visit.

-Oh-ho!
-Hide the women!

So, we're finally gonna get to meet
the man of a thousand chicks.

That's right. You think
I've been with a lot of broads.

My dad's had more pie than Kirstie Alley.

(LAUGHING) What?

Anyway, the Navy is honoring him
at this year's Naval Ball

for all his bravery in Vietnam.

Wow, you must be proud.

Sure am. He was like a hero to me
when I was growing up.

You know who was my hero? Aquaman.

And his secret alter ego, Arthur Curry.

Wow, you saved our lives, Aquaman!

Just doing my job.

Arthur Curry! Did you see Aquaman?

He was just here!

Oh, darn, I must've missed him.

We forgot to tell him thanks.

Oh, I have a feeling he already knows.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, guys. Come on in.

Dad, they're here!

At ease, ladies.

Hey, Glenn, you're not gonna
give your dad an entrance?

Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot.
Guys, watch this.

<i>(THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKIN'</i> PLAYS)

<i>Are you ready, boots?</i>

<i>Start walking!</i>

Ha! That's my dad!

No one dances like
Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire.

Dad, this is Joe and Peter.

Joe and Peter!

-Which one are you?
-Peter, sir.

Look at you.
You're a chowhound, aren't ya, Pete?

Don't want to get behind you
in the mess hall, huh?

No, sir. No, you don't, sir.

I'd stand and salute you, sir,
but this is the best I can do.

I'll take it.

And a salutey-rooty-toot-tooty
back to you, my friend.

Sir, you gotta tell them about the time

you had to eject from your plane
behind enemy lines.

And I will,
but first, it's been a long trip.

This sailor needs a cosmo.

A cosmo?

Hey, it's got to be 5:00
somewhere, right? (LAUGHS)

(CHUCKLES)

Okay, fine.
I'll make you one, you tell a story.

He can be such a nudge.

So, anyhoo,
I remember that day like it was yesterday.

I'd gotten a haircut earlier that day,

the first one I ever got over there
that looked like anything.

So all of a sudden, we get these orders.

And, of course, it's the day of all days
I have to put on a helmet.

-I remember the sky was a majestic orange.
-(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

The breeze was just warm enough
that you could wear short sleeves,

but you know, not so warm

-that you break any kind of a sweat.
-(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

Because let me tell you,
I do hate to perspire.

So anyway I just bit the bullet
and put on my helmet...

Oh, sorry, that's my auto spell correct.

But, uh, yeah, he's super gay.

Brian, it's so boring here.
When are you coming back?

<i>I'll be back soon, Stewie.</i>

<i>And I gotta tell you, though,</i>
<i>this seminar is great.</i>

<i>I'm really learning a lot.</i>

<i>I'll tell you all about it</i>
<i>when I get home, okay?</i>

<i>-I'll talk to you later.</i>
-Wait, wait, hang on, Brian!

There was, um, something else
I wanted to tell you.

<i>What?</i>

Um, the mail came a little later
than usual today.

<i>Yeah, Stewie, I gotta go.</i>

Ooh, wait, hang on, hang on!

Did I tell you about that over there?

<i>Stewie, I can't physically see</i>
<i>what you're pointing at.</i>

<i>-I'm getting off now. Bye.</i>
-(LINE DISCONNECTS)

Well, your loss, Brian.

That thing over there
is pretty interesting.

Huh? An alien in a grass skirt
juggling torches.

Yeah.

All right, you're all done. Go.

Come on, Stewie. Time for bed.

Oh, get a job!

Peter, what are you doing home?

I thought you'd be out on the town
with Quagmire and hid dad.

Lois, you're not gonna believe this.

Quagmire's dad's gay.

What? Quagmire never said
anything about that.

I don't think he knows.
It's like he doesn't even notice it.

Really? Well, then how
do you know he's gay?

And a lot of little things.

The way he talks, his mannerisms,

and he had the complete DVD set
of <i>Sex and the City</i>

between his butt cheeks.

Peter, no, he didn't!

No. He had the DVD set.

I was just being colorful
with the rest of it.

Well, maybe you should go
talk to Glenn about it.

I mean, especially if he has no idea.

I guess I could, but I don't know
if it'll do any good, Lois.

He's in complete denial,
like people in massive debt.

Well, honey,
I've extended our line of credit

and exhausted all our savings.

We should be good for another month.

Oh, that's great, honey.

What are we gonna do next month?

Well, I'll tell you
what we're not gonna do,

shoot all of our children
and then kill ourselves.

-(BOTH LAUGH)
-I'm gonna hold you to that.

I don't think you'll have
any control over it.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, Peter, how you doing?

Hey, Quagmire. Um, is your dad around?

Oh, he's off at his stitch n' bitch club.

I'm glad you stopped by, though.

My dad wanted me to tell you
he would be thrilled

if you and Lois would join us
as his guests at the Naval Ball.

Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

Um... Hey, remember when
we met him the other day,

and he danced for a while?

Oh, yeah, that was so funny, man!

-No, it, it wasn't funny.
-Oh, my God.

He's hilarious, that guy.

It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny. It was gay.

(LAUGHS) What?

Yeah, I think that your father is gay.

Gay? (LAUGHS)

We... We should all be so gay!

Quagmire, don't you see it?

See what? I'll tell you what I'm seeing.

-You're jealous!
-Huh?

Yeah, your father's a drunk,
and mine's a hero.

Look, you'll see.

At the Navy Ball,
you'll see how much of a man he is

and how everyone in the military
respects him.

-(LIVELY CHATTER)
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

Look at this, Dad.

All of these people came out
just to honor you.

Oh, it feels good, son.
I won't lie to you.

Dan Quagmire!

Wally! Good to see you. This my son Glenn.

Nice to meet you, Glenn.

You should be very proud of your dad.

Oh, I am, sir.

It was an honor to serve with him.

Come on, Dan, let's get a drink.

Huh. It's great to see you
back in your element tonight,

surrounded by seamen.

(CHUCKLES) "Seamen."

See, Quagmire? I told you he's gay.

Shut up, Peter!

-Hey, you Dan's boy?
-That's right.

Your dad was very brave
back in Southeast Asia.

He flew supplies in
where others wouldn't dare to go.

I can't tell you how many loads
your dad took when I served with him.

Huh?

Glenn, I wouldn't miss
this night for the world.

Everyone here admires your dad.

He'd walk into an army barracks

and make every private there
feel important.

Yeah, he just knew how
to stroke those privates.

Oh, God!

Your dad was cock of the walk, Glenn.

Every day at rifle training,
he'd help me clean my butt.

Your dad once drank me under the table.

If there was one man
you wanted in your hole, it was your dad.

Your dad had the best penis
in the military.

Okay, just stop, stop! Everybody stop!

Dad, are you gay?

What?

Are you gay, Dad?

No, Glenn, I'm not gay.

Just... Just tell me the truth!

I am telling you the truth.
Now calm down. You're ruining this ball.

You know how much I love balls.

All right, come on now!
That's not helping!

Son, you have my word, I am not gay.

You promise?

I promise.

All right, I believe you.

But I am a woman trapped in a man's body.

And while I'm in Quahog,
I plan to have a sex-change operation.

Oh, come on. Just be gay.

(KNOCKING)

Hey, guys, you got a minute?

Hey, what's up, buddy?

It's, um... It's about my dad.

He... He wants to have
a sex-change operation.

Whoa! I knew he was gay.
I didn't think he was that gay.

No, no, Peter, he's not gay.

He's a woman stuck in a man's body.

-Yeah, gay.
-It's totally different!

-Sounds the same.
-Well, it's not!

Okay, so he wants to be a woman
so he can be a lesbian?

No, he'd date men.

-BOTH: Gay.
-Yeah, gay.

Okay, this is not the help
I came over here for.

Well, look, let's just all agree
that he's odd, huh?

(LAUGHS)

He has an appointment Friday
with Dr. Hartman

to have the procedure,
and he wants me to go with him.

I just...
I don't know if I can handle that.

Well, I'm sure your friend
Peter would be happy

to come along for moral support.

All right, but look, here's the deal.

Anything he lops off,
we get to bring home for Brian.

That's very green of you, Peter.

-What?
-I don't know.

Lois, that doesn't make any sense at all.

Yeah, it's something I heard on TV.
I don't know. Have fun at the circus.

(SIGHS) I wonder how long it's gonna take.

I don't know.

Hey, hey, you know what we should do?

We should put on some '80s music,

and then, like, every few minutes,
have him come out of there

as a different sex, and we'll go...

And then like the fifth or sixth sex,
we'll go like this...

This is not a joke, Peter, okay?

They're cutting off his penis in there!

All right, all right.

I mean, this is my dad
we're talking about!

Okay, okay.

What are you gonna name it, huh?

What are you gonna name
your he/she father/mother?

Knock it off!

Wow! That thing was on there.

How is he, Doc? Is he all right?

-No, I'm afraid not.
-(GASPS)

But she's gonna be just fine!

Oh, my God!

(IN FEMININE VOICE)
What do you think, boys?

<i>I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!</i>

Okay, kids, Mr. Quagmire
and his da... His mo...

His friend are coming over soon
for dinner.

So, remember, Chris, no staring.

And, Meg, you know how it is
to be different, so be very nice.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Well, hi, you guys.

I'm so glad you could come over.

Everyone, I'd like you to meet Ida.

Hello, everyone.

-Hello, Ida.
-What's up?

I made a crumble.

Oh, how thoughtful.

Throw it away in the outside garbage.

Okay, you know what? Elephant in the room.

I'll say it. So, Ida, you miss your penis?

-Peter!
-Thank you for asking it.

-Geez.
-No, it's okay.

It's a perfectly normal question.

We can't sit here and just
pretend everything's the same.

It is a big transition for me, yes.

But the answer is, I still have it.

They just turn it inside out
to simulate a vagina.

Come on, Dad...

Not a bad option
to have in the back pocket.

So, Lois, what is this meal?

Wow, so good.

Oh, thank you, Glenn. It's nothing fancy.

Just chicken with rosemary.

But I did put a lot of planning
into the meal.

Yeah, we went down the list.
Nothing with wieners, nuts or grapes.

Out of respect.

Lois, I have to say,
you look so put together.

Where do you buy your clothes?

Oh, how sweet.

Well, I love Anne Klein.

Oh, I'll have to try them.

I like the outfit you have on.

Thank you, Meg. Who did your procedure?

Wow, you just burned
your last friend in this room, lady.

This corn is special.

So tell me about those knockers.
Are we... Are tho...

Is that just, like, implants

or did they reassign
some ass fat up there?

All right, I'm out of here.

(DOOR SLAMS)

I wonder if I could push mine inside.

Oh, my God, it worked. It's gone.

I can't believe... Oh, no, it's back.

Well, that was quite a performance.

My performance? What about you?

"Golly, Lois, where do you shop?

"Gee, your house looks beautiful.

"Hey, I have an inside-out penis."

I never said their house looks beautiful.
Because, frankly, it didn't.

My dad, my dad, talking about decorating
and women's clothing?

All I've talked about for years
with these people

is what a war hero you were.

And I was.

I'm changing my future, not my past.

Oh, yeah? What about my future, huh?

I don't even know what to call you.

My dad? My other mother?

My friend who pees sitting down
but can also palm a basketball?

-What about Ida?
-Oh, no.

Man, you know, this is too hard.

You know, you're asking me
to accept an awful lot.

(STAMMERS) I don't know if I can do this.

I understand.

I had the advantage of thinking
about this for years.

For me it was easy, do I want to be happy
the rest of my life or miserable?

So now you're happy and I'm miserable.

I see.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

Oh, boy, nice to be back home.

Those seminars can wear you out.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Wow, did you say
"Web-based Internet series"?

-No.
-Oh, my bad.

Great idea for one.

Where am I taking you again?

You know what?
Drop me off at the Marriott.

I could use a drink.

Jack on the rocks, please.

Hey, here's to exciting new
opportunities on the Internet.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.

Oh, no, it's not you.

I'm just dealing with a lot right now.

You know, kids.

Ah. Does not come with a manual.

(CHUCKLES)

So, wha...
You're doing something with the Internet?

I am, I am.

Being a writer, I'm always
exploring new possibilities.

Wow, I could never be a writer.
How do you do it?

Well, you see,
when I watch the world go by,

I think of it kind of like a huge screen.

You know, every little interaction,
every little moment

is another scene captured by this camera.

That's fascinating.

Oh, yeah.

-Brian.
-Ida.

Two more, please.

So I finally tell them,

"Hey, I came here to be
at the seminar, not run it."

(BOTH LAUGHING)

-That's... Oh.
-(CHUCKLES)

Hmm.

You know, we are in a hotel.

And I'm in room 406.

Go on ahead, I'll settle up.

Put it on 406.

-Well, look who's home.
-Hey, buddy.

How was the seminar?

Oh, it was terrific.
The first day we were there...

Brian, Brian, Brian.
I was after good or bad.

You know what? Fine.

You guys are not gonna
get to me this morning.

I am in too good a mood.

I met an amazing woman.
Finally, the whole package.

Oh, you met her at the seminar?

No, that's just it.
It was right here in town last night.

She's a classy, smart, beautiful lady.

Look, I took a picture of her.

See.

Uh...

Wha... Is...

Um...

Uh...

Here, Lois, take a look.

(BOTH LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

Oh, my God!

This is the best day of my life!

(LAUGHING)

You know what? You're just jealous
'cause I found a real woman.

(LAUGHING HARDER)

-Oh, hey, Brian.
-Hey.

Not to worry, I called in,

and a new cell phone should be here
for you in three business days.

-What? Why?
-Well, clearly, yours is broken.

Because I haven't heard from you.

I wanted to tell you about my week.

God... Doesn't anyone in this house
care about anyone but themselves?

Hey, Brian, how was the seminar?

Meg, please.

I'm serious, Stewie.

I have had an amazing few days
and nobody cares.

Oh, come on in. Come on in. Tell old Stew.

Okay, well, first,
the seminar was terrific.

I absorbed so much.

And then I get back here last night,
and I meet an incredible woman.

You know, I've heard the phrase
"soul mate" for years,

and I never got it till last night.

Well, I've got a woman story for you
that you're not gonna believe.

Quagmire's father, decorated war hero,

Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire,
is now a woman.

You're kidding.

No. Total sex change.

-(LAUGHS) That is hysterical.
-I know, huh?

Suck on that, Quagmire.

Yeah, it's... It's not settling
with the Q-man all too well.

Oh, my God, what does it look like?

You know, not half bad.

Nothing you'd look twice at, but not bad.

Oh, my God, that...
You know, that is a tough road ahead.

I mean, like, what do those people do
as far as relationships and sex and stuff?

I don't know. I mean, it's got to be
a train wreck down there, right?

I mean, just an absolute
casserole of nonsense.

Is she over there right now?
We should go take a look.

No. They had a fight,
she's staying at the Marriott.

-Aw, damn, I was just there.
-Really?

Yeah, maybe I saw him in the lobby
and didn't even know.

Oh, no, you'd know.

Aw, man, what do we call him now?

We... Do we still call him Dan?

No, and I'm not crazy
about the name change.

-What is it, like Danielle or Dana?
-No, Ida.

(RETCHING)

(GASPING)

(SCREAMING)

Oh, what? What the hell?
What's wrong with you?

-I had sex with her!
-What?

I had sex with her at the Marriott!

Aah, why?

I didn't know! I didn't know it was her!

-Oh, my God!
-(BOTH SCREAMING)

How does this happen?
When they move to a new place,

they're supposed to notify
the neighborhood! That's how it works!

He didn't actually move,
he's just visiting!

Oh, Dad, I've been worried sick.
Where have you been?

Listen, I... I feel awful about
the things I said last night.

I was selfish.

Aw, you weren't selfish.

I realize I put a lot on you.

I was wrong to just assume

that you would understand
and be able to accept this.

But, trust me, I had been unhappy
for a long, long time.

Wow.

Well, all I want is for you to be happy.

You're my dad.

And if you're happy, I'm happy for you.

I'm sorry, Dad.

I love you.

I love you, too, Glenn.

-Glenn?
-Sorry, sorry.

Damn thing can't tell the difference.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, dear...

Okay, well, so now that we got
all the mush out of the way,

I have some news.

Tell me. Tell me.

-I met someone.
-What? You did?

Oh, my God, Glenn, he's amazing.

I couldn't be happier.

Really? What's his name?

QUAGMIRE: (SCREAMING) No!

(SHUDDERING)

-(DOOR SLAMS)
-QUAGMIRE: Where is he?

Where is that self-centered,
arrogant son of a bitch?

Get out of there,
you dirty little bastard!

You're dead!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GROANS)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GROANING)

If I ever see you anywhere near my house,
I'll blow your head off!

Now lay there and die, you piece of crap!

(PANTING) Hey.

I (BLEEP) your dad.

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>This is the story</i>

<i>that happened to me</i>
<i>and some of my pals.</i>

<i>It all began innocently enough,</i>

<i>with my stupid wife showing me</i>
<i>some dumb-ass brochure.</i>

So, here's where we'll all
be staying this weekend.

You and I will have one cabin,

and Bonnie and Joe and Quagmire
will have the other two.

Ah, this is going to be so much fun!

-Hi, Chris. How was school?
-Not good.

I got suspended for saying bad words.

Oh, for God's sake!

My principal wants to
meet with you guys.

-Should we go? It sounds like a trap.
-Yes, Peter, we should go.

All right, but if it's a trap
and we don't come back,

I get to make smart-alecky remarks

when we're tied up
back-to-back, like last time.

Any more bright ideas, Professor?

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
the reason Chris was suspended

is that he told a very
inappropriate joke in class.

Well, Principal Shepherd,

we promise you it won't happen again.

I don't know where Chris
heard the joke,

but I can assure you
it wasn't at home.

Was it, Chris?

No. Mr. Quagmire told it to me.

I should have figured.

Was it the one where the blind man

walks by the fish market and
says, "Good morning, ladies"?

-(LAUGHING)
-I told you that one!

You told me that one.

I sure did.

We enjoy each other's company.

Hey, Quagmire.

You know, you got Chris
suspended from school

for telling one of your dirty jokes.

Oh, gosh, Peter, I'm sorry.

You want me to talk to him?

Well, no, actually, I...
I want you to tell me the joke.

Yeah, tell us the joke.

You want to hear it? All right.

So, this chick meets a guy
at a bar, and...

(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

P.S. Your vagina's in the sink.

(GUFFAWING)

Oh, God, I pooped my pants.

(CHUCKLES) It's funny
when it happens to other people.

Yuck. That's the end
of those underwears.

I didn't know what to do,
so I took them off

and hummed them at the wall,
and they started sliding down

-like one of them sticky octopuses.
-Well, it's a pretty funny joke,

you know, when you think about it.

"Your vagina's in the sink."

(LAUGHS) Damn it!

Wow. He poops every time
he hears that joke.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

He does, doesn't he?

(BOTH GIGGLING)

Get out of here, Quagmire!

I just put on clean pants!

-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
-Who's texting me?

(LAUGHS) Damn it!

(QUAGMIRE AND JOE LAUGHING)

Stop it, you guys!

You're ruining all my clothes!

Okay, Quagmire, he's asleep.

-(LAUGHING)
-Peter!

You just pooped all over the bed!

When you poop in your dreams,
you poop for real.

Hello, fellas.

Hey, Pete... Hey, those are my pants.

That's right. Thought I'd come by

and see if you have
any jokes to tell.

I enjoy a joke.

I don't know.

I want to tell the joke,
but I like those pants.

I'll tell the joke.

Go ahead, Joe. I'm all anus.

Joe, don't you dare.

I'll push you straight into traffic.

Peter, you win.

All right, I won't tell the joke anymore.

You know, I-I got to admit, Quagmire,
despite all the problems,

that joke is freaking hilarious.

Where'd you hear it?
Bruce told it to me.

No way Bruce came up with that.

Where'd he hear it?

I don't know...probably just around.

I mean, where does any
dirty joke come from?

Hey, you know, Joe is right.
There's a million of them.

They got to be coming
from somewhere.

I mean, somebody's got to
be making these things up.

-Well, who?
-I don't know.

But haven't you ever
wanted to find out?

Well, yeah, but how
would anyone do that?

A quest, Joe.

We go on a quest
to find the source

of the world's dirty jokes.

-Who's with me?
-Well, I'm with you.

Oh, what the hell? So am I.

PETER: <i>And so began our journey</i>
<i>to find the splendid source</i>

<i>of off-color humor as we know it.</i>

<i>Our first stop was to see Bruce.</i>

Oh, hey.
What size shoes is y'alls?

Actually, we're not here to bowl.

We were wondering where you heard

that dirty joke you told Quagmire.

Oh, that one? Oh, no.

I'm not going to tell y'all
that one here at the workplace.

Too dirty.

Maybe after quitting time,
I'll have a mimosa and tell y'all then.

Look, you blade, just tell us
who you heard it from.

PETER: <i>It turned out the joke</i>
<i>already had quite a history.</i>

<i>Bruce had heard it from Consuela.</i>

<i>Consuela heard it from Mayor West.</i>

<i>West heard it from Dr. Hartman.</i>

<i>Hartman heard it from Angela,</i>

<i>Angela from Opie, Opie from Herbert.</i>

<i>Herbert heard it from Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Tucker heard it from Bender</i>
<i>on </i>Futurama,

<i>oddly enough, for some reason.</i>

<i>Bender heard it from Al Harrington,</i>

<i>Harrington from REO Speedwagon.</i>

<i>Heard it from a friend who</i>

<i>Heard it from a friend who</i>

<i>Heard it from another...</i>

<i>REO Speedwagon</i>
<i>saved us several stops,</i>

<i>as they, too, had backtracked</i>
<i>the joke to some extent.</i>

<i>But when their trail had led</i>

<i>to a bartender in Virginia,</i>
<i>they had given up,</i>

<i>much the way the world</i>
<i>had given up on them.</i>

<i>In fact, just to kick them</i>
<i>a couple extra bucks,</i>

<i>here's five seconds</i>
<i>of </i>Time for Me to Fly.

No, don't!

All the money goes
to my bitch ex-wife!

Can you play our song?

PETER: <i>Okay, lead singer from Asia.</i>

<i>Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky</i>

<i>This lie is over...</i>

We can't go to Virginia, Peter.

Bonnie and Lois planned
that couples weekend to Maine.

We're supposed to leave
in the morning.

Yeah, Peter, we've looked long enough.

Maybe the joke doesn't have a source.

Don't be stupid.
Somebody had to have made it up.

And we're going to find out who.

Besides, this will be way more fun

than hanging out
in Maine with the wives,

sitting around a campfire,

listening to Lois tell grocery stories.

(IMITATING LOIS) Oh, Peter,
you should have been there.

Uncle Ben's converted
brown rice was on sale.

They marked it down
from $12 to... to three...

Whatever... I don't know how much rice is,
but you know what I'm saying.

Okay, Peter, I've got the directions.

Head north on the turnpike.

That's going to be
the quickest route to Maine.

Sure, Lois.

Say, ladies, I was wondering
if you could tell me...

what was childbirth like?

Oh, Glenn, you have no idea.

It's something no man
could understand.

Think of the most intense
pain you've ever felt,

and imagine feeling
that for hours.

LOIS: <i>Well, and then,</i>
<i>by the eighth month,</i>

<i>I had hemorrhoids that hung</i>
<i>like bunches of grapes.</i>

BONNIE: <i>And then, they said</i>
<i>I was four centimeters dilated.</i>

<i>They didn't think I was far</i>
<i>enough, but I was like,</i>

<i>"I can tell you I'm far enough."</i>

LOIS:
And that's when Chris was born.

Gosh, that's all so fascinating.

Let me ask you something else.

Have you girls ever worked
in an office with other women

who you have negative things
to say about?

-Oh, God, yes.
-Oh, my God.

Quagmire, shut up. We're here.

You drove us to Virginia?

All right, look, we're sorry
we deceived you girls,

but this is important.

The trail leads to a bartender
who works here.

He could be the source
of the dirty joke.

Hi, there. What can I do
for you gentlemen?

We've traveled a very long way
to find out where you heard this joke.

Oh... (RASPY LAUGH)

I remember that.

I heard it from that guy.

-Cleveland?
-Hey, fellas.

Holy crap!

Who knew we'd run into you here?

Except everyone,
if Fox ruined it in the promos.

What a surprise this is.

Donna, it's so nice of you
to invite us to stay here.

Oh, Lois, it's my pleasure.

I don't think we've seen
you folks since the wedding.

Still waiting on that gift.

The gift was the show.

Uh, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

It's great to have
you-all down here.

Hey, you know, Cleveland, you better hide
the markers from your kids.

Somebody colored in your Jesus.

Somebody colored in your ass
with too much ass, fat-ass.

All right, Cleveland,
let's get down to business.

Who told you the joke?

A bellhop at the Royale Hotel
in Washington, DC.

I met him when I took Cleveland Jr. there

to see the Lincoln Memorial.

But then Daddy got frustrated
'cause he couldn't find it,

so we just ate fast food
in the parking lot.

I'm just saying, maybe
put up a damn sign.

Anyway, the bellhop's name is Sal Russo.

He knows every dirty joke ever written.

Then that's the guy we got to talk to.

Everyone, don't get too used
to being around black people,

'cause we are going
to Washington, DC.

Now, wait a minute, Peter.

Donna's been nice enough to
invite us to stay the weekend,

and frankly, that sounds better

than continuing this wild-goose chase.

Well, Lois,
if you and Bonnie want to stay here,

maybe Cleveland could join us.

Yeah, it'd be just like old times.

What do you say, Cleveland?

Oh, I don't know.

I've kind of got my own life now.

All right, well, if you
have a sudden change of heart

and you want to chase us
down the street

as we're pulling away,
you know where to find us.

<i>(WHAT'S HAPPENING</i>
THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, guys, I got one.

Would you rather get
a massage from a man

or surgery from a female doctor?

-Wow.
-Like, minor surgery?

No, serious surgery.

Like a blown kidney or something.

-Geez.
-Good question, Peter.

-Is the man gay?
-No.

Is the female doctor
at least Jewish or Asian?

No, but, actually, you know what?

I'm going to take it up a notch.

Hispanic female doctor
or gay male masseuse?

Hispanic from Spain?

No.

-Ah. Ah.
-Ah.

So, it's basically... would you rather

get a massage from a gay man or die?

All right, I got another one.

Let Amy Winehouse
spit in your mouth

or eat a raw slice of
Anderson Cooper's ass?

-(GUNSHOT BLAST, ALL SCREAM)
-What the hell?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

What the hell was that about?

Who were those guys?

I don't know, but I'll tell you this...

I saw one of them
back in the bar in Stoolbend.

You think they were following us?

Either that or they got a grudge
against our back windshield.

Ah, Joe, that's so dumb.

Why would anybody be trying to kill us?

It might be safe to assume
that someone does not want us

to learn the origin of that joke.

PETER: <i>We had no idea how right</i>
<i>Cleveland was.</i>

<i>And if we had known</i>
<i>what lay ahead,</i>

<i>we would've stopped right there</i>

<i>and gone straight back to Quahog.</i>

<i>But we didn't know.</i>

(WHISPERS) <i>We didn't know.</i>

There it is... Washington, DC,

the seat of government

for the world's former
most powerful nation.

Wow, those are all the monuments
I read about in school.

There's the Washington Monument.

There's the Obama Monument.

And there's the Vietnam War Memorial.

Yeah, check out that Vietnamese
guy giving the business

to those Vietnam Vets.

Scoreboard! Scoreboard!

Aw, what happened to your friend?

Hey, I know that guy!

I kill him!

He cry like a bitch!

Vietnam, undefeated!

All right, this is the hotel
where the bellhop works.

Hey, there he is. Sal!

Well, hey, Cleveland!
What are you doing here?

I was wondering

if my friends and I could
ask you a few questions.

Yeah, where'd you hear that
dirty joke you told Cleveland?

That's none of your business!

Leave me alone!

Don't let him get away!

(SCREAMING)

(HORN BLARES, TIRES SQUEAL)

Hop on!

Where did he go?

I think he went that way,
past the Reflecting Pool!

Damn! He's nowhere in sight.

I'll ask these fellas.
Maybe they've seen him.

Excuse me, have you seen...

H-H-Hold on a second. I'm trying...

Hold on a sec. Hey, pal, stop talking

while I'm talking, all right?

You want a sandwich
full'a knuckles? Do ya?

All right, that's it.

Cleveland, you take Cleveland.
Joe, you take Joe.

Quagmire, you take Quagmire

and I'll get Fatty McLoudmouth.

It's no use, Peter.

We've lost him.

PETER:
<i>Our journey had abruptly ended,</i>

<i>and the trail had gone cold.</i>

Well, I guess

we're never gonna find
the source of that joke.

I guess there's nothing to do now

but head back home.

-Stop right where you are!
-(ALL GASP)

-Down on the ground!

PETER: <i>We were all terrified</i>

we walked through Crate & Barrel.

I don't know, but I got a bad feeling.

Every plane there's gotta be a crying baby

Yes, he's crying. Babies cry.

Is there some joke area
of a beaver eating a woodpecker?

Is that something... Would that work?

Wow. These are some
of the world's smartest people.

Not a lot of women.

Yeah, not a lot of women.

What are they all doing here?

Well, many of the world's
greatest geniuses

secretly devote themselves

to coming up with
the world's dirtiest jokes.

Oh, it's been that way for centuries.

Great men such as Ben Franklin,

Charles Dickens, Albert Einstein.

Shakespeare, of course.

I got a spear you can shake.

Ha! There you go, put that
in one of your jokes.

Let me show you around.

From this room,

we can see the entire world's joke supply.

This way, we can tailor jokes
to where the need is greatest.

Sir, we have a Best Man giving
a toast at a wedding,

and he is just bombing.

Put it up on the screen.

<i>Jim's... Jim's so clumsy,</i>

<i>it's like he's got two</i> (COUGHS)
<i>left feet and left hands.</i>

Permission to go to
the "bride is a whore" file, sir.

Permission granted.

<i>Anyway, if Sheila was a road sign,</i>
<i>it would read "Open Trench."</i>

(ALL LAUGH)

(ALL CHEERING)

Well, gentlemen, I hope you've enjoyed
the tour of our facility.

This was amazing!

Guys, we did it!

We found the source of the
world's dirty jokes!

I can't wait to tell
all the guys back at the Clam!

Oh, I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

What do you mean?

Well, you've seen our secret island.

You know about our network
of joke distribution agents,

like the bellhop.

We can't allow the secret to be revealed.

I'm afraid you must stay here
for the rest of your lives.

What are we gonna do now?

We gotta come up with an escape plan.

Hey, guys, I can see the plane
that brought us here!

If we can figure out a way to get to it,
I can fly us home!

I got an idea.

One of us should pretend we're hurt,

and when the guards come in
to give him medical attention,

we'll jump 'em!

That's perfect, Joe.

Hey, Cleveland, you got a pencil on you?

Oh, gosh, I don't know.
Oh, wait, here you go.

-Thanks.
-Aah! What the hell?

Hey, help, help!

-We have an emergency!
-You dick!

What's going on in here?

This man has been injured!

He needs medical attention!

-(GRUNTS)
-Come on. Let's get out of here!

All right, let's hurry up
and find a way out!

My God, I've done it!

After 80 years of work and research,

I have written the greatest dirty joke
in the history of mankind!

(LAUGHS)

(GASPS)

(GROANS)

-Give me that!
-Not on your life!

Take one step closer
and the paper gets it.

(GASPS)

Drop your guns! Do as he says!

Put it out! Put it out!

Oh, my God!

It's heading for the first
dead baby joke ever written!

(EXPLOSIONS)

Look what we did.

We destroyed a place that brought joy
and laughter to the entire world.

Is that the end of all dirty jokes?

Well, maybe it is.

But Peter's got the best one
ever written right there.

Read it, Peter.

"Guess what?

"Chicken butt."

That's it? That's the joke?

No, this is the joke!

(SCREAMS)

Now take me back to Virginia,
so I can put some Bacitracin on this

and pork my wife!

PETER: <i>It was a great adventure.</i>

<i>And it was great having</i>
<i>Cleveland along with us again.</i>

<i>He hasn't changed a bit.</i>

<i>Didn't grab one check.</i>

<i>Anyway, that's our story</i>

<i>about the splendid source</i>
<i>of all dirty jokes.</i>

<i>For those of you who stuck</i>
<i>around till the end,</i>

<i>you deserve a reward.</i>

<i>So here's some footage</i>

and we'll float away with their garbage.

Release.

All right, concentrate.

What do you see?

I see my friends.

They're in trouble.

I got to save 'em.

(GRUNTS)

W-W-Wait, Luke, that's a stupid idea.

Y-You're not done
with all your Force stuff,

and besides, you can't fight Vader.

Only an experienced Jedi
could fight Vader.

Well, why don't you go?

Yeah, you're probably ready
to fight Vader.

That boy was our last hope.

No, there is another.

I know.
I have the Force, too, you know.

I don't have a landing permit.

-I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
-(BOMB EXPLODING)

What the hell's he firing at me for?

-I told you not to shoot.
-Well, you're not in charge, I am.

-Well, I'm steering.
-No, I'm steering.

-No, I am.
-I have a steering wheel.

-So do I. There's two.
-Well, that's stupid.

-I know.
-I know, too, that's why I said it.

-Oh, we lost 'em.
-This is going in my report.

No, it's going in my report.

(LAUGHING) Hey, Lando.

(MORT'S VOICE) Hey, Han,
you crazy old bastard.

Hey, let me introduce everybody.

You remember Chewbacca,

and this is my special friend Leia

and that's, uh, that's Sarge over there.

You don't know my name, do you?

You never bothered to learn it.

What... What are you talking about?

We've been through all kinds
of space adventures together.

Of course I know you, slugger.

Yeah, sure.
Nice to meet you, I'm C-3PO.

C-3PO, yeah, I was just going
to introduce you, C-3PO.

Why didn't you let me, C-3PO?

Uh, maybe we should go inside.

Yeah, let's get inside, C-3PO.

You ever been to Cloud City,
C-3PO?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

J. Crew outlet store?

Oh, my God, awesome.

Space summer is right around the corner.

Oh, my God, what happened?

I got in a slap fight with a prep droid

over a pair of cargo shorts.

Are you guys all ready for dinner?

I don't know,
the time change is really hitting me.

I might just stay in the room
and watch bad TV.

Geez, it's only like
two hours earlier on Hoth.

What's the big deal?

I'm having my period, okay?

Please come in.

I have nothing to say to Lando.

Okay, so the door is going to open

and you guys say "freeze"
and point your guns at 'em.

Or, you know,
or should it just be me?

Yeah, you know what?
I-I think that'll be better.

Get, get, get out, go, go, go.
Just, just me.

-Oh, I wasn't ready. Hi.
-(CHEWBACCA GROWLS)

Wonder Woman!

Yeah! Look, the giant chicken's Boba Fett.

Chewie, you have to take care
of the princess while I'm gone.

Take care of her?
You mean like, uh...

No, just make sure she stays safe.

Oh, okay, that'll be fun for me.

I love you.

(BLEEP) off.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your lightsaber battle.

VADER: The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

But you are not a Jedi yet.

You're gettin' there.
You're gettin' there, though.

I can defeat you, Vader.
You'll see.

Okay, so no cutting off body parts.
Let's make that a rule.

No below the belt,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

And you know what?

Uh, how about no name calling,
you know?

Let's-let's not have one of those
kinds of lightsaber battles.

(LIGHTSABERS HUMMING)

Car! Car coming!

We're clear.

(BEEPING)

Nice work, fellas.

And, David, you sold the most
magazine subscriptions

so you get to invite four of your friends

-to a pizza party.
-Hooray!

-Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
-Pfft. Duh.

(WEAPONS FIRING)

Oh, no, we've lost Han!

They're takin' him to Jabba's palace!

Well, even though we know
exactly where he's going,

we should rescue him in three years.

(METAL SCREECHING)

(ZANY CARTOON SOUND EFFECTS PLAY)

(PANTING) Oh, God. Oh, my God.

I would give my right hand
for this day to just end.

(WEAPONS FIRING)

Have we ever hit anybody with these guns?

I hit a bird once.

(LIGHTSABERS HUMMING)

(GRUNTING)

(GROANS)

Come on, Luke, join the Dark Side.

It's really cool.

Well, who's in it?

Um, me, the Emperor, this guy Scott...

You'll meet him, he's awesome.

Uh, and James Caan.

I'll be your friend,
if you let me kick your ass.

I'll never join the Dark Side!

Never!

(GRUNTING)

(GROANING)

MAN: (IN DISTANCE) Hey, a hand!

There is no escape.

Don't make me destroy you.
Join me, Luke.

I'll never join you!

Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

He told me you killed him!

No, I... Hang on.

Spoiler alert! Okay.

No, I am your father.

Well, that's fine,
but I don't see how that affects...

What?

Join me and we can
rule the galaxy as father and son!

You know? I mean, it doesn't
have to be as father and son,

it can just be as, you know...
As two really close guys

who just happen to be men, you know?

Just two good-lookin' guys
sharin' a cramped office,

runnin' the galaxy together, you know?

Just... Gettin' the job done,
you know, maybe we...

Maybe we do it occasionally,
but it's not weird, you know,

'cause we're just two guys
with ragin' goals, you know?

I mean, it's not even
about the doin' it part,

but that's a part of it,
but it's not the whole thing.

What about those fighters?

I said turn us around!

<i>Turn the ship around</i>

<i>Leia knows where Luke is</i>

<i>Turn it upside down</i>

<i>Take it back to Bespin</i>

Is that him?

I don't know.

No, your right hand!

Don't worry, we'll find Jabba the Hutt

and that bounty hunter,
and we'll get Han back.

Why are you wearing Han's clothes?

Seriously, watch the actual movie.

Lando is wearing Han's clothes
in this scene.

It's really weird.

Take care, you two.

And may the Force be with you.

CHEWBACCA:

Wait a minute, this is how it ends?

There's so many questions

A letter.

"Dear Luke,

Actually, I think they did
a pretty good job

of that already, Dad.

Well, I'll have to take your word for it.

I don't watch Comedy Central.

It's on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, Dad.

-I'm pretty sure you know that.
-I don't know that.

I haven't seen that show in a while,
and I don't know that anyone else has.

Oh, I think plenty of people have.

Their fans are pretty loyal to them.

Oh, yeah? All 42 of 'em?

(SIGHS) I'm not gonna let you get to me
this time, Dad.

I'm not gonna let you get to me.

Well, maybe I got time

-Open that one up, buddy.
-All right, at ease, at ease.

"Dear Willy, it's been awful lonesome
since you've been away."

Hey, you hear that, fellas? She misses me!

(LAUGHING)

You're all wet.

Hey, check this out.
We got invited to a party.

"Peter Griffin, you and your family
are cordially invited

"to a gala dinner in your honor
at Rocky Point Manor."

-Well, who's the invitation from?
-I don't know, it doesn't say.

Wait, you're not gonna go, are you?
It's clearly some kind of scam.

Oh, well, then maybe we just go,
and you go to the kennel.

Oh, not the kennel.
Last time you left me there for an hour.

Or 10 years, I don't know.
There's no clock there!

You stink when you come out of there.

Dad, are we almost there?

Yeah. No,
according to the map, we're pretty close.

(GASPS) Peter, look!

My God, this is absolutely beautiful.

I bet Jeff Probst has a house like this.

-Joe?
-Peter?

What the hell are you guys doing here?

Well, we got an invitation
to a dinner in my honor.

I assumed it was for all those arrests
I made last month.

That's weird.
My invitation said it was in my honor.

I assumed it was
for being able to fart the alphabet,

which I almost did,
till I pooped on the "S."

Oh, well. Everybody on the bus was upset
long before that anyway.

What the...

Derek and Jillian?

What, what are you guys doing here?

I got a card that says
they're throwing a dinner in my honor.

Wait a minute,
what the hell's going on here?

Everybody got the same invitation?

Oh! Hey.

Uh...

Didn't think I'd see anyone I knew here.

This... This is Stephanie.

Hi, everybody! Oh, my gosh!
I never thought I'd meet Glenn's friends!

Yeah. I figured, why not?

You know, you, we, you and I
see each other from time to time.

Oh, my God!
We, like, never see each other! This guy!

You, like, disappear for a month
and then you call me?

So silly!

You're lucky I like you so much.

Okay, why don't you go ahead
and take the bags in?

Wow, it looks like
the whole town got invited.

If you will all please follow me
to third floor, I show you to your rooms.

You are all expected for dinner at 8:00.

-STEPHANIE: Oh, good! I'm starved!
-QUAGMIRE: Settle down, will ya?

None of this makes any sense.

Everyone got invitations,
from an anonymous source,

for a dinner in their honor,
when that's clearly not the case.

Now we're here, where the hell's our host?

Well, at least you all had eveningwear
provided for you.

I thought this was going to be
a lawn party.

I don't have one pair of long pants.

Boy, it's kinda awkward
seeing Jillian here with Derek.

I wonder if she's thinking about me.

I don't know.
Are you a pony or the color blue?

(LAUGHING)

-Derek, look!
-Ha, how do you like that?

Good heavens, Meg,
you're sprouting up like a weed!

I know, she's growing every day.

Meg, you remember Dr. Hartman.

Of course she does!
I performed her very first pelvic exam!

Unless I'm confusing you
with someone else.

Nope. That was... That was you.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Good evening, everyone.

(GASPS) James Woods!

(SNARLS)

Thank you for joining me
at my humble manor.

I'd like to introduce you
to my lovely companion, Priscilla.

Nice to meet you all.

-Who's he?
-James Woods.

-Oh, I thought he was a shark.
-No, he was on a show called <i>Shark.</i>

But he's made of wood?

No, his last name is Woods,
but he's not made of wood.

Nobody is.

This truly is a night to celebrate,
especially for me.

Hey, what's going on here, Woods?

The invitation said
this was a dinner in my honor.

-That's what mine said, too.
-Yeah, me, too!

-Mine, too.
-Same here!

-SEAMUS: Aye.
-STEPHANIE: Where's the food?

Well, actually,
this dinner honors all of you.

Where should I begin?

You see, recently
I've become a born-again Christian,

thanks to this beautiful little angel.

She came into my life
as if out of nowhere,

enchanted me beyond my wildest dreams,

and opened my eyes to the cleansing truth
of Jesus Christ's love.

No, honey, it was always within you.
I just helped you find it.

Um... What does all this gay stuff
have to do with us?

Well, the fact of the matter is,

I have wronged each and every one of you
in some way.

And, since I am a man of God now,
I am truly repentant.

So, I invited you all here to make amends.

And why the hell should we trust you?

Yeah, you've been terrorizing our family
for years.

I understand that there is some healing
to do here tonight,

and I am prepared to be patient.

Please, won't you just give me a chance?

And I promise you won't be disappointed.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll just go check on dinner.

Oh, I'll help you, sweetheart.

-This is all very strange.
-I agree. Something's not right.

I don't know,
maybe we should give him a chance.

Maybe he really is born again.

Well, he could be. It all depends
on what his astrological sign is.

Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

I'm very intuitive with these things.

Maybe if I sit in his chair
I can get a reading on his energy.

I mean, if he's an Aquarius,
a rebirth would not be unexpected.

That's enough, Stephanie.

STEPHANIE: You know,
it's like when I did Glenn's star chart...

(ALL GASPING)

Did the... Did the cork hit me?

(ALL SCREAMING)

My God! She's dead.

She's been shot!

(ALL GASPING)

I can't help feeling this would be sadder
if she wasn't heavy.

Oh, my God. It was him!

It was James Woods! He killed her!

Jesus, I knew he was crazy,
but I didn't think he was a murderer!

Oh, he must've brought us here
to kill us all! Run! Run for your lives!

Quick! We gotta get out of here!

Come on, get in the car!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(SCREAMS)

Oh, my God, Peter, back it up!

Oh, really, Lois?
I thought I might drive forward.

I thought that might be a fun thing to do.

Stop fighting!

Oh, my God! Quick, Peter, get in the back!

Oh, thank God. We made it.

(GROANS)

My neck! You backed into me, and now...

(GROANS)

All right, it looks like we're stuck here.

Storm has flooded the causeway,
and the bridge is destroyed.

For the moment, there's no way out.

What are we gonna do?

We can't just stay here with James Woods
lurking somewhere in the house!

All right, does anyone have a cell phone?

I'm not getting any reception!

-Me neither!
-No bars!

Look, he's got a landline we can use!

Oh, no. You know,
I wouldn't feel right about that.

We're guests, and it's long distance.

Doesn't matter. The line's dead.

Oh, my God!

(ALL CLAMORING)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right. Look.

Everybody but Chris,
just keep your pants on

and let's figure a way out of this.

He's right. We just gotta stay calm.

-With a killer in the house?
-Killer in the house.

Hey, guys, has anybody seen James?

Sweetheart, you may want
to sit down for this.

Who want little tiny tacos?

Oh, little taco. I'll have one of those.

(ALL GASPING)

-It's him!
-Sorry I took so long.

I was going to the bathroom,

and I just couldn't stop
looking at my penis,

'cause it's, you know, so fantastic.

You're a monster...
Yeah, I heard it's fantastic.

You're a monster, James Woods!

You think you can just commit murder
and get away with it?

-Quagmire loved that girl!
-QUAGMIRE: Easy.

Jimmy, what does he mean?

Look, I honestly don't know
what's going on here.

Oh, really?

Well, maybe that dead pile of cookie dough
in the next room will refresh your memory.

What do you mean?
There's nothing in the next room.

(GASPS) It's gone!

Where is she, Woods?
What'd you do with the body?

What body?

You know, maybe she wasn't dead.

I'll admit it,
I'm not great with that stuff sometimes.

All right, I don't know
what's happening here,

but look, I'm a lot of things.

A member of Mensa,
a huge hit with the ladies,

someone who, you know,
would have broken out bigger

if he weren't so impossible to work with.
Right. But a murderer?

I only just found God.

Why would I jeopardize
my entrance into heaven?

If I were you, I'd keep your mouth shut
till you talk to a lawyer.

I didn't kill anybody!

(THUNDER CRACKING)

(ALL GASPING)

PETER: Oh, my God!

Is this what black people see
all the time?

-(STABBING)
-(MAN GROANS)

-(THUD)
-(ALL SCREAM)

Look!

(SCREAMS)

-He's dead.
-Oh, my God!

Nice.

Nobody touch the knife!
There could be fingerprints on it.

So James Woods murdered Stephanie
and then he murdered himself.

Criss-cross.

No, Peter. Don't you see?

He didn't kill himself
and he didn't kill Stephanie.

What are you saying?

I'm saying
James Woods isn't the murderer.

The murderer

is one of us!

(ALL GASPING)

And someone
ate the last goat cheese tartlet.

(ALL CLAMORING)

Now I hope I die next.

Okay, everyone, it's important
that we all stay calm.

How are we supposed to stay calm?
There's a killer in the room!

We all gotta get out of here!
We're all gonna die!

Mr. Mayor, pull yourself together!

(SHATTERING)

Wait a minute. Joe, look!

-Oh, my God.
-Stephanie was an accident.

That's a way of putting it.

What do you mean, Joe?

This gun was timed to fire
directly at that chair,

where James Woods
would have been sitting.

But he left, and Stephanie was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

So whoever the murderer is,

they were after James Woods,
not Stephanie.

The question is,
who here wanted James Woods dead?

Let's look around
and see if we can find any more clues.

Oh, my God!

Brian, I feel like everyone's wondering
why I'm wearing shorts.

Nobody's even looking at you.

PETER: Brian, look what I found!

Check it out!
I'm a robot from outer space!

Hang on. I'm coming down.

Go, go, gadget skis!

(GROANS)

Uh-oh.

All right, since it's my fault
that Joe got knocked out,

it is now my responsibility
to take over the investigation.

-I don't know if that actually follows.
-Oh, it does follow, Brian,

because I'm the one
with the giant magnifying glass.

-Is my eye big?
-Yeah.

Good. Good.

That means progress.

All right, let's figure out
what we know here.

The gun was clearly meant
to kill Jimmy Woods,

but Stephanie got in the way.

So the murderer had to improvise and
finish the job by stabbing Jimmy Woods.

Now who here had a motive
for wanting James Woods dead?

Well, according to James Woods,
we all did.

He brought us here
to make amends with us.

But he wronged one of us
enough to want revenge.

The question is, who?

Well, I know one person who could have.

My partner, Tom.

All right, it's true.
James Woods ruined my career!

I originally wanted to be an actor.

And I booked the lead role
in <i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

But James Woods said, "No, don't bother.
Something else will come along."

So I turned it down.

And now this Robert Englund
is the talk of the town.

That should be me
everyone's talking about!

Was I angry? Yes, of course!
But I didn't kill him!

What about Seamus?
You hated James Woods. You told me so!

Aye. He's the one
who made me what I am today.

(SIGHS)

I wish you were a real,
live ornery sea captain.

But he didn't wish hard enough!
It only worked on me head!

But I'm not the killer!

What about the Mayor?

He could have killed him
and got himself off scot-free!

(SIGHS)

He took the Twitter name Mayor West,

so now I have to use
Mayor underscore West.

That rat-faced cracker!

And what about Quagmire?

Fine! So he stole Cheryl Tiegs from me.

He ruined your TV pilot!

Go to hell!
I backed out of that project willingly.

Oh, yeah, that's what every hack says.

-You know, Brian...
-I'm telling you...

(ALL SHOUTING)

(ALL GASPING)

STEWIE: My secret room's bigger.

HERBERT: Mine's smaller.

All right, stand back.
This could be dangerous.

Oh, laundry room.
Laundry room, everybody!

Oh, see, here we go.

Aha! James Woods made a list of
all his misdeeds so he could make amends.

Bonnie, he punched you in the throat,
and that's why you sound like that?

No, he punched me in the throat
because I sound like this.

What are all these?

God, there are tons of OxyContin bottles
in here. All prescribed to James Woods.

-And all from Goldman's pharmacy.
-What's that all about, Goldman?

I don't know what you're talking about.

James Woods never bought
anything in my pharmacy. Ever.

PETER: Yes, he did.

Says here he talked Muriel
into selling him OxyContin

for him and his 19-year-old girlfriend.
This went on for weeks.

But then she started to have misgivings
and threatened to cut him off.

But he wouldn't let her.

He threatened to blackmail her
by turning her in to the Feds.

Sounds like a pretty good motive to me.

No! No, it's not true!
I would never kill anybody, never!

And I am not saying another word
until I talk to my lawyer, because...

Why is he wearing shorts?

Oh, my God, I told you!

Muriel, just surrender quietly.
It'll be easier for us all if you...

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

She's gone!

We lost her.

Well, as long as there's a murderer
on the loose, none of us are safe.

All right, let's split up
and search the house. I'll go with Lois.

Chris, you check the basement
with Herbert.

Meg, you go with Brian and Stewie.

-No, she can't.
-Yeah, she can't.

We were gonna use this time

to figure out
what to get you for your birthday.

Ooh, okay. Oh, yeah, no, you guys go.
You... Ooh. Now I'm excited.

Okay, Meg, you go with Carl. Sorry, Carl.

Tom and Diane, you're a team.
Quagmire and Bonnie, you're a team.

Um... Seamus and Dr. Hartman?
That could be funny.

Don't usually see the two of you together.

Derek and Jillian,
you guys take the attic.

Joe and Priscilla are still passed out,
so they'll be the unconscious team.

And that leaves one three-person team
of Mort, Consuela and Mayor West.

All right. Let's do this.

So... You guys like to party?

-No!
-Oh, no.

Oh, my God, what a couple of squares.
Squaresville, I tell ya!

-What are we supposed to be doing again?
-We're looking for Muriel Goldman, honey.

Hello?

Is anybody up here?

(YOWLS)

Hey, maybe it was that cat
who was the murderer.

Let me ask him.

Meow, meow, meow,
meow-meow-meow-meow?

We don't all talk like that.
I happen to be a professor.

Our apologies, sir.

I should imagine so.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I have papers to correct.

Muriel?

Oh, yeah,
like she's going to answer you, Tom.

And here we go with the attitude.
This is why you're single.

Oh, so I'm not supposed to point out
when you do something stupid?

You hear that?
You hear that tone you're using?

That's penis repellent right there.

Careful. She could be hiding
behind any one of these statues.

Muriel, this is Tom Tucker
from the Channel Five News.

Perhaps you'd like an autograph.

Oh, for God's sakes. Do you hear yourself?

There it is.

(IMITATING CAN SPRAYING)

Knock it off!

Hey, wait a minute.
Doesn't feel like there's any wall here.

(CLICKS)

-What do you think's in there?
-I don't know. Looks scary.

What do you think, Ollie?

I miss Ollie.

(SIGHS) I better take a look.

No. I'll go first.

-Do you see anything?
-No, it's too dark.

(GRUNTS)

Tom? Tom!

Hey, check this out.
We got invited to a party.

BRIAN: <i>None of this makes any sense.</i>

<i>Everyone got invitations</i>
<i>for a dinner in their honor</i>

<i>when that's clearly not the case.</i>

Now we're here, where's our host?

Good evening, everyone.

James Woods?

I have wronged each and every one of you
in some way.

So I invited you all here
to make amends.

Look!

He's dead.

Muriel, just surrender quietly.

She's gone!

All right. Let's split up
and search the house.

Do you see anything?

Tom? Tom!

She's dead. She's been shot!

(ALL GASP)

I can't help feeling this would be sadder
if she wasn't heavy.

Let's see if we can find some cues.

(GASPS) What is it?

Phew! It's okay.

It's just the stuffed bear
from the great outdoors.

Did you see <i>The Great Outdoors?</i>

-No.
-You suck.

Hey, I found the pool cues.

(SCREAMS)

Meg?

Looks like I'm all alone.
Well, hey, that's all right.

I watch a lot of movies.
I can just use my imagination.

-Hi, Carl.
-Hey, Bear.

So, in the bear world are, like, pandas
your version of interracial children?

Yeah.
Pandas aren't something I agree with.

-Just when they're babies.

(MURIEL SCREAMING)

(BOTH SCREAM)

Oh, my God!

(ALL GASPING)

Oh, my God, Muriel!

My sweet Muriel!

She was so young. She was so beauti...

She was so gener...

We were married.

Look! This is the same knife
that killed James Woods.

Oh, my God!
Then Muriel wasn't the killer.

Well, then, who is?

I don't know, but one thing's for sure.

If we don't find out
before this storm lets up,

we're all gonna be dead by morning.

All right, if we're going
to make it out alive,

we gotta stick together from now on.

Is everyone here?

Wait a minute, wait. Where's Meg?

And where's Tom Tucker?

Right here!

Oh, my God! What happened?

I fell through a trapdoor
that led to an underground passageway.

So, I followed it, and it led me
to a hatch over there in the parlor.

The same thing happened to me.
But with a moustache.

Hey, Peter, look at this.

I'm getting a faint signal
on my cell phone.

Really?

Oh, my God, is that...

Are you holding up
the whole Hollywood sign?

(CHUCKLES) No, no, no, no.

The sign was way in the background.

I was standing in
the foreground going like this

when Jillian took the picture,
so by forced perspective,

it looks like I'm holding up
the whole sign.

I don't believe you.
I think you are a god.

And I will die for you or kill others.

Damn it. The signal's gone.

If I can get up to the roof or something,

maybe I can get a stronger
signal and call the police.

Okay. And I will skin this dog
in your honor.

-Please, don't.
-As you wish.

Do you really think it could work, Derek?

There's only one way to find out.

I'll be back.

All right, nobody leaves
this room until he gets back.

Wait a minute.
Something's not right here.

We're short one vagina in this room.

Oh, my God! Priscilla's gone!

-(ALL GASP)
-That's impossible.

She was still passed out
on the couch when we left.

(GROANS)

What the hell happened?

Joe! You're okay!

Yeah, I'm fine. What's going on?

What's going on is
Priscilla's the murderer!

Wait a second. We don't know that.

Well, she was by herself this whole time!

Yes, but she was unconscious!

She could've come to and killed Muriel!

This is all speculation!
We don't know she's the killer!

Yeah, besides, she's hot!

Hot chicks are never crazy!

Derek lifted up the Hollywood sign.

(ALL CLAMORING)

PETER: He did, too! I saw the picture!
STEWIE: Don't touch me.

(DOOR CREAKING)

Come on.

Yes!

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Hey.

What are you doing up here?

Wait a minute.

What the hell is this?

Oh, my God! It's you!

The man or woman
who's been killing everybody!

Stay back. Stay back.

(THUD)

It came from over there!

(ALL GASPING)

Dear God!

He's dead.

Do you think he slipped off the roof?

Maybe. But he was dead before the fall.

Look at this, he's been hit on the head
by a blunt object.

Oh, my God, no, Derek!

-(SOBBING)
-Oh, Jillian, I'm so sorry.

PETER: Hey, can you grab his phone?

I want to prove something to these guys.

I... It's Priscilla.

I... I mean, it's gotta be Priscilla.

She's the only one who's not here.

Look, maybe, maybe not.

We thought Muriel was the killer,

and look how that turned out.

We have no proof of anything.

Is this the latest you've ever stayed up?

It's the latest I've ever stayed up.

Oh, no!

Someone's taken
Mr. Woods' Golden Globe!

She's right! There was a Golden
Globe award here, and it's gone.

I think we may have identified
our blunt object.

So all we have to do
is find that Golden Globe

and we'll have our murder weapon,
and if we're lucky,

it may just mean we'll have our killer.

All right, from this moment forward,

nobody leaves the group.

Joe's right. Everyone huddle up.

Good. Now, we're gonna search the house,

and we're gonna move as one.

Anyone who separates from the group

we will assume to be the killer.

All clear?

ALL: Yeah. Yeah.

All right.

Let's do this!

All right, we gotta search
every one of these rooms.

We'll start with Quagmire's.

Oh, my God!

Are those Stephanie's underpants?

Oh, God.

They're huge!

Looks like the crotch got
chewed on by a walrus mouth.

(LAUGHS) Look, it's got flowers!

I mean, why bother?

Who's gonna see 'em?

Maybe someone in space.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Come on, guys, can't we all
just be glad she's dead?

Whose room is this?

It's, uh, my room.

You travel with a giant poster
of yourself?

Yes. It helps me get to sleep,
knowing that Big Tom Tucker

is keeping a watchful eye out
for nocturnal intruders.

What a ridiculous man you are.

Look, I didn't know my room
was gonna be scrutinized.

If you don't like it,
let's get out of here.

Not till we've searched the place.

(GASPS)

You guys?

(ALL GASP)

Oh, my God!

Well, well,
I think we've found our killer.

Oh, now, now, wait a minute,
that's not mine!

I suppose it crawled under
your bed all by itself.

Well, maybe it did.
I didn't murder anybody.

Tell it to Mike Judge.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is crazy.

What about Priscilla?

We have no idea where she is.
She could've planted that there.

Well...

I suppose it's possible.

What the hell?

Dang it, I got a nosebleed.

No, you don't.

Peter, give me a boost.

(PETER GRUNTS)

(ALL SCREAMING)

You're going to jail, Tucker.

Like hell I am!
You're not taking me anywhere,

you Podunk, Quahog, redneck cop!

Not you or anyone else in this damn town!

I'm not going to jail!

After him!

Give it up, Tucker!

Make me, Swanson!

(ALL PANTING)

Damn, he's slippery.

You guys give up?

-What do we do?
-Wait a minute, wait a minute, guys!

-I got an idea.
-Shoot.

What if half of us
go around one side of the table,

and the other half
go around the other side,

and then we won't have
to chase him around in circles.

Damn, that's awfully risky.

It sure is, but at this point
I'm willing to try anything.

All right. Let's do it!

PETER: It worked!

(GRUNTS) Let me go!

Let me go, you bastards!

You're all gonna pay for this!

Just for that, when the movie
of this story comes out,

I'm gonna make sure
Adrien Brody plays you.

I guess that means you
don't want anyone to see it.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Okay. All right.

Thanks a lot for your help, boys.

Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels
in the bath? Lois?

Lois? Lois?

Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels
in the bathroom?

No, I put 'em all in your bag.

Okay, well, I don't see the fire engine,

but I guess we'll just find out
when we get home, won't we?

I'll see you in the car.

Hi, Diane.

Oh, hi, Lois.

How you doing?

I just thought I'd make sure
you were okay.

Oh, I'm managing.

It's just so hard to believe

you can work with someone for 15 years

and yet have no idea who they really are
or what they're capable of.

Oh, I know. And I'm sorry.

So, what happens now?

Will you just anchor the news by yourself?

I suppose, for the time being.

Well, that's kind of exciting, right?

(CHUCKLES) You sound like my mother.

She actually bought me this blouse
for my first solo broadcast.

I guess that's sweet, huh?

She...

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

What do you mean?

I mean, how could she have known
you'd be anchoring alone?

I mean, none of this happened until...

Gosh, I... You know,
I think I'd better, uh,

go make sure Peter has his, uh,

fire engine.

Oh, really?
But I was enjoying our talk.

Oh, no, I... So was I, but, you know,

I've, really, I should... I should go.

No. I don't think so.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, it was you.

You're the killer!

Very clever, Lois.

You shouldn't have stopped
to say hi to me.

You would've lived longer.

God, why do I ever try to
be friends with other women?

But, Diane, why?

How could you do
all these horrible things?

Well, I suppose it all really began
a year ago when James Woods and I met

<i>at a press event</i>
<i>and began seeing each other.</i>

<i>We both valued our privacy, however,</i>

<i>so we agreed to keep it</i>
<i>a secret from the media.</i>

<i>Everything in my life was wonderful.</i>

<i>But then a few months ago, I turned 40.</i>

ALL: Surprise!

<i>It was hard for me to begin with,</i>

<i>but it got worse when,</i>
<i>not so coincidentally,</i>

<i>Tom began pushing</i>
<i>Channel Five News to replace me</i>

<i>with a fresh, young face,</i>

<i>and he succeeded.</i>

<i>Three weeks from now, I'll be off the air.</i>

<i>Well, apparently,</i>
<i>all men think the same way,</i>

<i>because around the same time,</i>
<i>James dumped me.</i>

<i>I watched my career</i>
<i>and my love life crumble,</i>

<i>and I wasn't gonna just</i>
<i>stand by and take it.</i>

<i>That's when I had the good fortune</i>

<i>to meet a young news intern</i>
<i>named Priscilla.</i>

<i>She was so anxious to get</i>
<i>into the reporting business</i>

<i>and would have done anything</i>
<i>to get on my good side.</i>

<i>So I seized the moment.</i>

<i>I paid her off to seduce</i>
<i>James Woods and reel him</i>

<i>into a relationship like a fish on a line.</i>

<i>I knew a hot, young woman like Priscilla</i>

<i>could manipulate him</i>
<i>into doing anything I wanted.</i>

<i>At my direction, she persuaded him</i>
<i>to become a born-again Christian,</i>

<i>and instilled him</i>
<i>with the drive to bring together</i>

<i>all the people he'd wronged.</i>

<i>That's how this weekend came to pass.</i>

<i>Of course, Priscilla knew</i>
<i>nothing of my real intentions,</i>

<i>but she played the part</i>
<i>beautifully, nonetheless.</i>

There's no way she could have known

I planned to kill James Woods
and frame Tom Tucker,

thereby destroying the two people

who cast me aside and ruined my life.

Oh, my God.

You're 40?

Yes. I'm 40.

But then why did you kill the others?

It was all supposed to go so smoothly.

<i>The hidden gun goes off,</i>

<i>kills James Woods,</i>
<i>and at the first opportunity,</i>

<i>I retrieve the gun</i>
<i>and plant it in Tom's bag.</i>

<i>James Woods is dead,</i>

<i>Tom goes to prison, nice and easy.</i>

<i>But Stephanie got in the way.</i>

<i>She was in James' chair at the wrong time.</i>

<i>And when I realized my mistake,</i>
<i>I had to improvise.</i>

<i>The power outage provided a perfect cover.</i>

<i>I grabbed the knife</i>
<i>off the dinner table and stabbed him.</i>

<i>But as Joe pointed out,</i>
<i>there were fingerprints.</i>

<i>I couldn't just leave it there.</i>

<i>So when Tom and I got separated</i>
<i>in the gallery,</i>

<i>I went back into the dining room</i>
<i>and got the knife.</i>

<i>But at that moment, Priscilla</i>
<i>regained consciousness after fainting.</i>

<i>She started to become hysterical.</i>

<i>I knew I couldn't risk her revealing</i>

<i>that I had engineered</i>
<i>this whole gathering,</i>

<i>so I killed her.</i>

<i>And I hid her in Tom's room.</i>

<i>I tried to plant the knife</i>
<i>in Tom's suitcase,</i>

<i>but at that moment, Muriel walked in</i>
<i>and caught me in the act.</i>

<i>It wasn't her fault, poor thing,</i>

<i>but she had to die.</i>

<i>I stabbed her, and she screamed.</i>

<i>I had to leave the knife in her</i>

<i>because I couldn't very well</i>
<i>hide it on my person</i>

<i>with everyone quickly closing in.</i>

<i>So I wiped off the fingerprints and ran.</i>

<i>I slipped in with the rest of the group,</i>

<i>when they all converged on the scene.</i>

<i>I needed more time</i>
<i>to finish my work framing Tom.</i>

<i>But that's when Derek</i>
<i>went out to the balcony.</i>

<i>I couldn't let him contact the police</i>

<i>before everything was in the place.</i>

<i>So I had to kill him, too.</i>

<i>When Peter was yelling at everyone</i>

<i>about that picture of Derek</i>
<i>holding up the Hollywood sign,</i>

<i>I grabbed the Golden Globe</i>
<i>and slipped out.</i>

<i>I followed Derek outside</i>
<i>and did what I had to do.</i>

<i>I barely had enough time</i>
<i>to plant the Golden Globe</i>

<i>in Tom's room and run back downstairs,</i>

<i>where I took advantage of the commotion</i>

<i>and joined the crowd</i>
<i>as they were all running outside.</i>

<i>And the rest, well...</i>

<i>You did all the rest for me.</i>

<i>You turned on Tom exactly as I planned.</i>

So there it is, Lois.

My God.

But wait, there's one
thing unaccounted for,

what happened to Stephanie's body?

Actually, that's the one thing
I don't know.

Damn it!

Well, now you know everything, Lois,

which, of course,
means I have to kill you.

Lois, are you coming?

I can't play my tapes without the key.

Well, actually, Lois and I
were just about to go

for a quick walk, weren't we, Lois?

We've been getting better acquainted.

All right, well,
just give me the key, please.

All right, Peter, I'll get it.

Don't put a gun in my back.

I'm not, I'm just asking for the key.
Give me the key.

LOIS: <i>Peter, we've been married 20 years.</i>

<i>Please recognize</i>
<i>when I'm</i><i>acting out of the ordinary</i>

<i>because I'm in danger.</i>

Here you go. Here's the key, Pete.

<i>Why is she calling me Pete?</i>

<i>We've been married 14 years.</i>
<i>She never called me Pete.</i>

<i>Why am I trying to figure this out</i>

<i>when I could be listening</i>
<i>to my tapes in the car?</i>

Bye.

Shall we?

Well, it's a shame
that you have to die, Lois,

but look on the bright side.

You'll be a story on the 6:00 news.

You know, unless a local cat
does something funny.

Diane, please, please, don't do this!

I won't tell anybody, I swear to God!

That's right. You won't.

Good bye, Lois.

Then it's a lie.
Everything Fox News says is a lie.

Don't they have bookstores
at the Nazi fascist...

Fascist fat camp where he...
Where he go...

Where he... Where he is a counselor?

I tell you what, Brian, if you want,
we'll give you another crack at that.

This guy single-handedly

set political discourse
back a hundred years.

You know what? I'm gonna go down there

and give that bastard Limbaugh
a piece of my mind.

But first, I'm gonna sit here
and stare at this brown paper bag

I'm pretty sure has food in it.

(SNIFFING)

-PETER: No!
-Oh, well.

Look at him. His side screwed up
our country for a generation.

I hate everything about that man.
I'm gonna go tear him a new one.

I'm gonna go find some hardcover
photography books of tasteful nudes.

STEWIE: Oh, my God, yes, that is tasteful.

Hey, my friend,
who should I make this out to?

Listen, Limbaugh,

my name is Brian Griffin
and I have got something to say to you.

Our republic has been bastardized

and royally screwed up
thanks to you jackasses.

You suck! And you're terrible!

And you've been divorced several times.

Yes, valid points you're raising,
my friend,

and I respect you for raising them.
But may I ask you a question?

-Okay.
-Have you ever read anything I've written?

Well, no, I haven't.

But I've read things
other people have written

about the things you've written,

and I do not approve
of the things I've read from others

about the things they've read from you.

Not one bit, sir.

For crying out loud, Brian, read my book.
Judge for yourself.

I'd sooner spend a night
watching European porn.

(MAN AND WOMAN MOANING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

(BOTH YELLING)

Stupid right wing dick.

Yeah, you...
Hey, you want to sign my book?

Yeah, you can sign my ass book.

Is what would've been awesome to say.

Oh, no. It's a multiracial TV gang,
including white guys.

Well, well, what do we got here?

Let's beat him up,
but not because of his color,

'cause that doesn't matter to us.

(GROANS)

-Wow. Thanks, Rush.
-It was nothing.

I mean, you'd have done
the same thing for me.

Uh, yeah, of course.

Hey, you dropped something.

You think you might give it a read now?

Uh, well...

What if I stick a piece of baloney
in the book

and I don't tell you which page?

Would you read it, then, Brian?

Would you read it to
find the page with the baloney?

Okay, look, I'll read four pages
of your book tonight.

All right? Four pages. That's it.

And maybe more if tonight's episode
of <i>The Office</i> ends up sucking.

(SIGHS) Four pages. Done. Moving on.

DWIGHT: <i>I know my staplers</i>
<i>by sound and by weight.</i>

<i>And that stapler, good sir, is a Schrute.</i>

(LAUGHS) Look at John Krasinski
look at the camera.

He can't believe this guy!

Aw, but there were gonna be
more high jinks in Scranton. (CHUCKLES)

Scranton. Dunder Mifflin. (CHUCKLES)

Funny words are funny.

<i>(AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL</i> PLAYING)

Oh, my God.
Rush Limbaugh was right all along.

Conservative Republicanism is the answer.

Good. Good for Brian.

Brian, look at this.
Now, this is a tasteful nude.

It's called "A Saucy Outing
In Tottenham Court Square."

Brian, are you reading
the new Rush Limbaugh book?

Yeah, I picked it up
at the mall yesterday.

I can't believe I'm saying this,

but this might be
the best book I've ever read.

-Brian, you got to be joking.
-No, I mean it, Lois.

You know, I've never actually
read any of Limbaugh's stuff,

but this book makes an excellent case
for personal accountability,

fiscal responsibility,
and steak eatership.

But you're a hardcore liberal.

Rush Limbaugh is a right wing extremist.

He stands for everything you despise.

My loyalty is to reason, Lois.

And as a reasonable person,
I reserve the right to change my mind

when presented with new information
that alters my perspective.

And I got to tell you,
I had this guy all wrong.

I mean, some of the stuff
in here is... Hey, baloney!

Thank you, friends. It's always a pleasure
to meet regular, real Americans.

Love the Hummer, Rush.
How do you like it?

It is the best.

I'm not saying you'd have to be gay
to drive something else.

But if you drive something else,

you're probably a guy who likes
to pleasure other men sexually.

-Hey, it's my new friend, Brian!
-Hi, Rush.

Listen, I have to tell you,

I read your book
and it was very persuasive.

I knew you'd like it,
and I'm glad you enjoyed it,

-Brian, I really am.
-Oh, I more than enjoyed it.

Every page just spoke to me.

And, you know,
talking to you now, I just...

I want to find the right words
to describe how much I agree with you.

I got the words, Brian.

"Thank you, Rush,
for doing my thinking for me,

"'cause I lack the ability to
think critically and independently."

Yes, that!

You should be proud of yourself, Brian.

I mean, you sound like
a thoughtful American.

Well, listen, I'd really love
to pick your brain some more

and hear some of your other thoughts
about what's going on in this country.

I can do even better than that, Brian.

Wow. Never thought I'd set foot
inside Republican National Headquarters.

This is amazing.

And it gets better, Brian.

Come on, I'm gonna introduce you
to some of my pals here.

Brian, meet George W. Bush.

Hey, Georgie!

Uncle Rush!

Hey! Ooh, you are getting heavy.

I know. I'm 64 and three-quarters.

You sure are, slugger.

Hey, you got one for me?

What? What are you talking about?

Oh, come on, Uncle Rush.

I don't know what
you're talking about, really.

Come on!

Oh! Wait a second.

Yay! Yippee! Thanks, Uncle Rush!
Don't tell my dad.

-Hey there, Rush. How you doing?
-Hey, John.

Hey, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Brian.

Brian, John McCain.

Gosh, it sure is a pleasure, Mr. McCain.
How do you two know each other?

Oh, Rush and I used to
solve mysteries together back in the day.

I don't understand, John.

The groundskeeper said he saw
the mummy burning the flag.

But mummies don't hate America.

They sure don't, Rush. But Democrats do.

Ruh-roh. Remocrats.

(TEETH CHATTERING)

Oh, it's okay, Hot Dog.

But I think it's time we unravel
the mummy and the mystery.

I don't get it, John.

How's a pig gonna help us
lure the mummy?

Rush, I've never known
a Democrat to pass up pork.

(SNICKERING)

(MOANING)

Gotcha!

Now let's find out who you really are.

BOTH: It's old man Barney Frank!

And I would have gotten away with it, too,

if it weren't for
you meddling Republicans.

Thanks for all your help, Globetrotters.

That was a cold swish. Put her there.

No, no, no, no.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Look, Brian, all I'm saying is,
it's not normal for people

to change their political views
so radically overnight.

Lois, no offense, but you don't exactly
know what you're talking about.

I mean, you're not exactly a fountain
of political knowledge yourself.

You want to know
what I think is happening here?

Oh, this should be rich and overtaxed.

I think you just got to be
in the "out" group.

Whoever's on top, whoever's
in power, whoever's successful,

you got to be on the other side

or you don't feel like
the smartest guy in the room.

All you are, my dear, is a contrarian.

Oh, please,
you could not be more off base.

Oh, yeah? Let me ask, what did
you think of the movie <i>Titanic?</i>

Horrible. One of the worst movies
ever made.

How about <i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

Overrated. Just a terrible movie.

<i>-Cocktail.</i>
-Actually, not a bad film.

You know,
as classically structured cinema,

<i>Cocktail</i> was one of the best films
of its era.

You make me sick, Brian.

Look, Lois, if I were you,
I'd stow that attitude,

because Rush Limbaugh is
coming over for dinner tonight.

Lois, this dinner looks delicious.

Oh, well, thank you.

Dig in, everyone.

Hang on, hang on.
I think you're forgetting the grace, Lois.

(SIGHS)

Dear God who definitely exists,

we, your people, who have been
on this planet for 6,000 years

and not a second more,
wish to thank you for this bounty,

and for keeping Congress
predominantly white

through Christ our Lord, amen.

So, Rush, I see you made it here okay

driving on roads built with public funds,
by the government.

Yeah, what about that, Rush?

I guess the government's pretty good,
like Lois says.

Actually, I took the toll roads.
Privately built.

Way smoother than
the crumbling public road system.

Yeah, Lois.
Government sucks at doing stuff.

Oh, no, toll roads sound great.

Too bad only the very rich
can afford to use them.

-I agree with Lois.
-Well, maybe more people could

if the government wasn't taxing
the bejesus out of them.

Now I agree with Rush.

I'm too stupid to make up my own mind.

Yeah, okay. Whatever you say, Rush.

So, nice weather today.

Yeah, unseasonably cool.

I guess we can forget
that whole global warming myth.

Global warming is not a myth,
you son of a bitch!

Look, what the hell
are you so hostile for?

Because you brainwashed our dog.

Hey, listen, sister, I just...

(FARTING)

I'm sorry.

Look, all I did was expose Brian
to a different way of thinking.

He embraced... Oh, God,
I'm gonna move over here.

He embraced it on his own, Lois.

Well, after Rush opened my eyes,

I am seeing the world
in a whole new way now.

To quote a famous troublemaker,
"I have a dream..."

(SINGING) <i>I dream of Republicantown</i>

<i>Where men to the right of the aisle</i>
<i>Don't back down</i>

<i>The streets are aglow</i>
<i>with the smell of apple pies</i>

<i>And babies come out of the womb</i>
<i>in coats and ties</i>

Nice place, huh, Rush?

It's a paradise, Brian.

<i>Trees grow from Republican sod</i>

<i>And everyone prays to</i>
<i>a proper right-wing god</i>

<i>Republican Catholics?</i>

<i>Yes, indeed, there are</i>

<i>Republican Muslims?</i>

<i>Well, let's not go too far</i>

Nah, too many tall buildings.

<i>you won't find a damn thing wrong</i>

<i>'Cause when you come down to it</i>

<i>Chuck Norris is one</i>

<i>And he's got a right-wing beard</i>

<i>Jon Voight is another</i>

<i>He's just right-wing weird</i>

His daughter's pretty hot, though.

At one time, Brian. At one time.

<i>But how about global warming?</i>

<i>It's a snow job</i>

<i>By Obama and his crew</i>

<i>But aren't all his findings</i>

<i>Backed by science?</i>

<i>Careful, Lois,</i>

<i>A place where America's</i>
<i>growing free and strong</i>

<i>'Cause when you come down to it,</i>
<i>this is where</i>

<i>We all belong</i>

Well, I got to tell you,
I'm not buying any of this crap.

Rush, we want our dog back.

Hang on, Lois.

What are you saying?
I don't have a mind of my own?

That's insulting. And you know what?

I don't like the way
you've been talking to Rush this evening.

You know, I thought you were my friends.

But if you can't accept me
now that we disagree about certain things,

then maybe you aren't
the friends I thought you were.

I'm moving out.

-What?
-No!

-Again?
-I'm gonna go stay with Rush Limbaugh.

-Right, Rush?
-Huh?

I'm gonna stay with you.

Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. That... That's fine.

Oh, this is a bad idea.

But I guess sometimes
Fox has bad ideas, huh?

Let's all just sit here for a moment
and remember that this was a thing.

Morning, Rush.

Hey, thanks again
for letting me stay here.

Oh, it's not really any trouble, Brian.

What do you figure, just a few days?

Man, who knows?
It's just so good to be out of there.

Hey, you know,
I've been reading all your books

and I so 100% agree with you.

I mean,
what is going on with this country?

I mean, wake up, America.

I mean, these taxes, right?
I mean, am I right?

About the taxes? You know?

Yeah, taxes are pretty high.

Is that a new coffee machine?

Oh, yeah, I took the liberty
of replacing your old one

with a new,
American-made coffee machine.

In fact, I got you a bunch of new,
top-notch, American-made stuff.

What else did you buy?

Oh, a couple things, that light fixture,

new heat regulator on your stove,
your man-bra,

your garbage disposal, your dishwasher,

and your new cat.

(MOOING)

And you're listening to
the <i>Rush Limbaugh Show.</i>

I want to take a moment
to give a shout-out

to my good friend Ken Lay,
faked his own death,

listening in on a ham radio
somewhere in international waters.

Smooth sailing, Kenny boy.

Hey, Rush? Is it okay to hang out in here?

All right, fine.
Just don't say anything, okay?

So, friends,
we were talking about Nancy Pelosi.

How do we stop her?
How do we stop the Pelosi agenda...

Hey, I'll tell you how.

You strap her to a board,
put a cloth in her mouth,

and pour water over it
to simulate drowning.

Yeah! Small government!

And why don't we take
a short break here, folks.

We'll be right back.

Brian, are you nuts?

What the hell kind of show
you think I'm doing here?

What? What are you...
Come on. Pelosi's a monster.

And she's addicted to crack.
Come on, you're with me on this.

Of course she's addicted to crack,
but you can't just say that.

You got to lead people there
with an intelligent argument,

so they arrive at it on their own.

Hey, come on, man.
We got to tell people how it is.

We got to get them on board with us.

Brian, look, there is no victory
unless people know

why they were wrong to disagree with you
in the first place.

Boy, do you sound soft.

What the hell's your problem, Brian?

My problem?

Right now, my problem seems to be
that I am talking to a Pelosi-lover.

-What?
-Yeah, that's right.

You love Pelosi.

You know what? It's time for you to go.

-Right now.
-Hey, fine.

I don't have to sit here and
waste my time with a softie.

You call yourself a Republican?
Republicans don't shy away from a fight.

And I'm gonna prove it to you.

Aha!

Who are you? How did you get in here?

Shut up, Pelosi.

Are you here to take my baby?

No, I'm here to strap you to a board,

put a cloth in your mouth,
and pour water over it

to simulate the sensation of drowning.

Yeah! Traditional values!

Griffin, you been bailed out.

Oh, Rush, thank God.

Boy, you got down here quick.

Yeah, I keep Strom Thurmond's corpse
in the front seat,

so I can use the carpool lane.

Oh.

Okay, well, come on, let's go home.

Great idea. Time for you to go home.

Home to the Griffins.

What do you mean?

That's where you belong, Brian.
You're not really a conservative.

What are you... That's not true.
I am conservative.

I support the death penalty
to show people that killing is wrong.

And that's great, Brian.

Look, I make a living persuading others
to join my side.

But I'd never, ever want somebody
to be something they're not.

You're a liberal, Brian.

I mean, what about that four-year-old
that was executed in Texas?

There was a four-year-old
executed in Texas?

Not really, but you see, Brian,
your concern betrays you.

I know your type.

It's not a coincidence
you turned your back

on your democratic principles

just when the Democrats
became the political establishment.

All you want
is something to fight against.

I mean...

I suppose we shouldn't
be executing children.

You see? You're not really one of us.

Oh, my God...

Lois was right.

Right there. See, the fact that you would
give a woman credit for anything,

it means you're a liberal, Brian.

It's time for you to
spread your two left wings and fly.

Does this... Does this mean
I'll never see you again?

Oh, I'll be around.

Wherever there's a rich white guy

in need of another tax break,
I'll be there.

Wherever there's a brain-dead woman
in need of expensive life support

her husband doesn't want, I'll be there.

Wherever there's a country
that needs to be invaded

for reasons that don't exactly pan out,
I'll be there, too.

Oh, yes, I will be around.

Hey, Limbaugh.

I think you're a boneheaded, fascist,
corporate-shilling blowhard.

Look, you little smartass,

I think you are a godless,
socialist, pot-smoking,

maggot-infested member
of the blame-America-first crowd,

and I think you want
the terrorists to win.

<i>And then a miracle happened.</i>

Babs!

Carter!

Oh, Carter, you're alive!

I've missed you so.

Babs, be my wife!

Oh, yes, Carter, yes!

Hey, that's my gal!

Dear sir, I respectfully urge you

to prepare yourself
for one devil of a skirmish!

I always love hearing that story, Mom.

I got a story about a fat guy
who's starving and bored.

Look, Peter, if you're that hungry,

go down to the dock and find Daddy,
and we'll get dinner started.

You're not gonna get dinner started.

She's gonna tell
that sloppy old Spanish maid to do it.

And she will,
but only because she needs money

to pay for medicine for
her prematurely overweight son Diabeto.

-Mama, may I have cookie?
-No, Diabeto, roll back to kitchen.

(EXCLAIMS IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

Mr. Pewterschmidt!

Mr. Pewterschmidt, dinner's ready!

Damn it, he can't hear me.

(CARTER AND WOMAN LAUGHING)

Ah! That was excellent.

When I clenched it,
you took your fingers away.

You were right to do that.

-Oh, my God!
-(BOTH GASP)

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're having an affair? Ew!

-No, no, this is my sister.
-Ew!

-No, no, no, I'm impotent.
-Ew!

I mean, she looked at me
while I did it to myself.

Ew!

-I mean, she's a man.
-Ew!

We need more "E's" and "W's"
down here now!

MAN: We're trying!
We're running out of letters!

Just turn the "M's" upside down
and send them down here!

MAN: You can't just do that! There's a lot
of paperwork before you can...

I don't care! I'll take the heat!

Just turn them over and send them down!

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're having an affair?

Now, look, Griffin,
you better not breathe a word

about what you saw here.

But how can you be having an affair?

What about Babs?

That's not your concern.

You didn't see anything.

Remember that, or I'll ruin you.

Okay, okay, I promise.
I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.

Hey, Billy, I was gonna have a party
at the rectory this evening.

Do you like sacramental wine
and mouse Russell Crowe movies?

Oh, boy, do I!

-Hey, can my sister come?
-No! She'd ruin it!

Now, remember, you keep your mouth shut
about what you saw.

Yes, sir, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Ah, there you are, boys.

Sorry, sweetheart, I lost track of time.

Right, Peter?

(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

I'm Peter.

Well, let's eat, huh?

You must be starving, Peter.

What am I, on trial here?

Maybe you should
just eat something, Peter.

Go on, put some food in your mouth.

Yes, sir, I sure will, Mr. Cooterschmidt.
Pewterschmidt! Oh, God!

Peter, are you feeling all right?

Oh, he's fine.

You know how hungry a man gets
after a day at sea.

He eats with porpoise.

(LAUGHS) Oh.

Peter, for God's sake, you're always
an embarrassment at the table.

You should've seen him when we
had dinner with Paul McCartney's ex-wife.

He kept playing footsie with her
under the table.

(GIGGLING)

-(WOOD CLATTERING)
-Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

Hey, guys? I got a problem.

-You know how Lois has that dad?
-Yeah.

Well, we were there
the other night for dinner,

and I caught him cheating with some bimbo.

-Oh, my God!
-You're kidding!

Anyway, he told me not to tell anybody,

but I'm having a real hard time
not telling Lois.

How could you not?

Peter, once entered into,
marriage is a sacred bond.

An alliance blessed by God
and hallowed by the community.

That's why I'll never opt for
the matrimonial condition.

It wouldn't be fair to
the historical framework

of the institution.

But for those who do,
and then turn their back

on its long-standing convictions? Shame!

This is unwelcome news, Peter.
Very unwelcome.

Yeah, I know, but I don't know what to do.

It's really hard keeping my mouth shut.

Actually, you know something, Peter,
this could be an opportunity for you.

-What do you mean?
-Well, Lois's dad is loaded.

You could probably get him
to pay through the nose

to keep your mouth shut.

Yeah, you could really
milk this thing, Peter.

Huh! I never thought of it like that.

Wait a minute. You're not serious.
That's totally unethical.

Yeah, Brian, no one cares what you think.

Peter, you could make him your slave!

Oh, man. He'd hate that even more

than he hates sitcom two-parters.

Tootie, it's 8:29!

Now either try that beer
or dump it down the sink! Wait!

Now I have to wait a whole week
to find out if she gave in

to peer pressure at that drinking party!

(DOOR CLOSES)

Carter! Carter, wake up!

It's okay, Lois.
Daddy's just taking your temperature.

What? What is it?

I heard a noise downstairs.

(SIGHS) I'll go have a look.

It's probably just the wined.

The wind, dear.

Is that how you say that?
I've only seen that word written.

(WATER SPLASHING)

Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Griffin! What the hell
are you doing in my house?

Well, I was getting ready
to watch a movie on your big TV,

but first I thought I'd use
your hot, bubbly toilet.

That's not a toilet!

Hey, when's it go down, by the way?
It's just doing a lot of loop-de-loops.

Get the hell out of there,
you son of a bitch!

Oh, no, no. No, you don't get
to talk to me like that anymore.

Not unless you want me to blab
about what happened on the yacht.

What are you getting at, Griffin?

That's right, you're gonna start
doing a lot of stuff for me.

-Like what?
-Well, for starters,

-you got more than one limo?
-Yeah.

You and me are gonna do a limo joust.

What the hell is that?

(ENGINES REVVING)

All right, you ready?

I don't want to do this.

Go!

PETER: That went
exactly as I wanted it to go.

All right, here's your Mike and Ikes
with all the Ikes taken out.

I hope you were careful,
'cause I swear to God,

if I find one Ike in there,
I'm going straight to Babs.

It's fine, I double-checked.

Here's your Mikes. What's next?

Next, I want you to fly to France
and tell French people

that a good-looking,
depressed guy smoking a cigarette

is not a movie.

(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>People of France,</i>

<i>a good-looking, depressed guy</i>

<i>smoking a cigarette</i>

<i>is not a movie,</i>

<i>and your sirens sound like</i>
<i>gay guys having a threesome.</i>

(SIREN WAILING)

All right, you got my catchphrases for me?

I just want you to know
this was a huge pain in the ass.

"Peter's new catchphrases,
by Carter Pewterschmidt."

Title's all business. I like that.

Also, I've been under the weather lately,
so it may not be my best work.

"Shape up or show me your balls."

-(CHUCKLES) That's good.
-Really?

How about this one?
"In your face, Nancy Grace."

I love it.

Oh, man, there are
a lot of good ones here.

"Fire alarm? I am the fire alarm.

"Find your own beach house, crabby.

"Put that in your office and frame it."

The last one's kind of lame.

Did you get down to
the one at the bottom there?

Which one?
"On your mark, get set, terrible."

No, this one here.

"If you've got a problem,
take it up with my butt.

"He's the only one that gives a crap."

-Oh, my God! That's it.
-Yeah.

-That's the one.
-I thought you'd like...

-You are...
-LOIS: Peter, dinner.

Take it up with my butt,

'cause he's the only one who gives a crap.

LOIS: Wow, what a great sentence.

You know, Lois,
I've noticed Peter and Carter

spending a lot of time together lately.

It's nice to see them finally getting on.

I know. Who would have thought, huh?

PETER: Boy, I can't wait to get this home.

You know, I keep not laughing
at <i>The Big Bang Theory,</i>

and I figure it's got to be
the television, you know?

TV this size, forget it.

It'll have me laughing
till I got snots falling out of my nose.

Carter, where are you taking
our television?

I'm giving it to Peter.

What? Why?

Yeah, why, Carter?

(SIGHS) Because Peter is the best

and he is awesome and he makes
better laser sounds than I do.

(MIMICKING LASER SOUNDS)

Damn right. You hear that, Lois?

And he's not just saying that
'cause I covered for him about his affair.

(ALL GASPING)

What?

Carter, is this true?

Yes, it's true.

Oh, dear!

(SOBBING)

Well, on your mark, get set, terrible.
(LAUGHS)

No, no, but I understand that this is bad.

You stupid fat bastard!

How could you tell her I had an affair?
We had a deal!

Look, I think you're blowing
this out of proportion, Carter.

She's divorcing me!

Well, I don't blame her.

Daddy, how could you do this to Mom?

You two were perfect together.

It was such a close marriage.

You know, maybe the two of you
splitting up is a blessing in disguise.

I mean, there are obviously
some problems in your relationship.

Who knows, maybe some time apart
could be just what you need.

Yeah, plus think of all the fun stuff
you can do as a single guy.

Like going to loud, awful bars
and not being able to hear

the mediocre-looking chick
next to you say something stupid.

It's going to be awesome.

I don't know how to do anything like that.

It's easy.

I'll help you meet some women,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Come on, it's been 50 years
since I've been on a date.

Well, how'd you get that chick
on the boat, then?

You know how in that movie

-Liam Neeson gets his daughter back?
-Yeah.

Well, that was one of the girls
their dad didn't get back.

(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)

What kind of joint is this?
Where's the cigarette girl?

Yeah, they don't have those anymore.

Peter, I don't know about this.

I have no idea
what women are like nowadays.

Last time I was on the dating scene,
Joe McCarthy was on a rampage,

looking for anything red.

Oh, Back then
I called my penis Joe McCarthy.

Look, relax, will you?

Here, I got these off a website

that tells you good things to say
when hot women walk by.

Here comes a hot one.
Say the first thing on the list.

I love getting trendy cupcakes
in the middle of the day for no reason.

No way. So do I.

-Hi. I'm Paula.
-Carter. How do you do?

Hey, why don't you and your friend
come join us over at our table?

Peter Griffin. How do you do?
(CHUCKLING PLAYFULLY)

We would love to.

Hey, girls, these are my two new friends.

Hello, ladies. My name is Carter,

and I require a tremendous
amount of calcium.

Carter, come here. Sit next to me.

This is fun. We're having fun.

Hey, what do you say we get some drinks?

Hey, boy. Boy,

fetch me a John Barrymore and soda,

and three Myrna Loys for the women.

-(WOMEN GASP)
-Excuse me?

What the hell is your problem, you jerk?

What? Does he belong to somebody else?

Come on, girls,
let's ditch this racist dick.

What happened? Did we get laid?

You jackass. Those women
were coming on to you and you blew it.

Now we got to go to another club
and start all over again.

Peter, I don't want to go to another club.

I don't want women like that.

I want Babs.

Babs?

You got a room full of chicks like that
and you're thinking about Babs?

She looks like someone farted in a shoe.

I had a moment of weakness,
but I know now that I was wrong.

I need her, Peter. I love her.

You got to help me get her back.

Well, it's probably the right move anyway.

Those girls seemed kind of annoying.

Look at them over there
taking a group picture together.

-I love you!
-I love you!

We're all such good friends!

You can tell by the way
we're pressing our faces together.

And that's where fat girls come from.

All right, if I've learned anything
from romantic comedies,

it's that the ex-wife always falls in love
with her husband again

after he befriends a little kid.

-Okay.
-And the kid needs to be really cute,

-so I ordered Jonathan Lipnicki.
-(DOORBELL CHIMES)

There's the cute little guy now.

Hang on.

PETER: Oh, my God! What happened to you!

Oh! Oh! We got to get you to the hospital!

You're hideous!

Who did this to you?

Where are my keys?
Where's my keys? Where are my keys?

Peter, what about Babs?

Forget about yourself
for a second, Carter.

Look what has happened
to Jonathan Lipnicki.

Oh! Yeah. No, you're right.

You should probably take care of that.

I'll be here.

All right, look, Carter,
I think this will definitely work.

Now as soon as she sees you,

you've got to do exactly what I...

Hey, whose Duesenberg is that
parked in the driveway?

There's only one man I know
who drives a Duesenberg.

(SINGING) <i>And I will buy you laudanum</i>
<i>and rhubarb cakes</i>

<i>To balance out your fragile body's humors</i>

Babs, I don't wish to overwhelm you
with my passions, but I must say this.

I'm ever so content.

Oh, I am too, Rodginald.

Do you think perhaps one day,

if we should marry,
that I could sit beside you?

Yes, I think that would be fine.

Get away from my wife, you rascal!

Such language in the presence of a lady.

If it's a row you want,
I will cleave you in twixt!

Hang on, Carter, I think I know
how to take this guy down.

-Penis.
-(GROANS)

Carter, get out of here this instant!

I don't ever want to see you again.

Pussycup, please.

Mrs. Pewterschmidt, Carter has
something important to say to you.

I'll set the mood.

-(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
-(SINGING) <i>Bird, bird, bird</i>

<i>Bird's the word</i>

<i>Bird, bird, bird</i>

<i>Bird's the word</i>

<i>Well, don't you know about the bird?</i>

<i>Well, everybody knows</i>
<i>that the bird is the word</i>

Peter, I kind of want to
do this on my own.

Babs, I need you.

Cheating on you
was the worst mistake of my life.

I kneel before you a frightened soul

and a broken man.

A man who has nothing without you.

Give me one more chance,

and I pledge to place above you nothing,
not even myself,

for all my time here,
and for time forever.

Please, I beg you.

Carter, what you did was unforgivable.

And as beautiful as your words are,

I just don't know
that they can fix what's done.

I know I can't do it overnight,

but we can still have
a lot of years together.

Please, just let me try.

Carter, you had sex with that woman.

So, no, I can't trust you.

But at my age,
I'm certainly not going to remarry either.

So, if you'd like to move back in

and take things slowly,
one step at a time,

I suppose I can give you the chance
to earn my trust again.

That sounds like a lot of work.
Go to hell!

Carter, what are we here for?
What are we here for?

All right, all right, fine, fine.

I'm gonna try.

Come here, you.

Hey, look, I found a genie's lamp.

<i>No? Okay, well, maybe next week.</i>

Trick or treat?

Chris, what in God's name are you doing?

You can't go out dressed like that.

Why not? I'm Bill Cosby.

Okay, but, I mean...
You can't go out like that.

Well, come on, Mom, don't I look like him?

(IMITATING BILL COSBY)

Well, yes, but, Chris, you can't
just walk around in blackface.

It's racist.

Now, go upstairs and put on that
Indian chief costume I bought you.

I don't want to! (GRUMBLING)

Peter, what's with all the eggs?

Well, every Halloween,
me, Joe and Quagmire

do this thing where one of us is it,

and then the other two of us nail the crap
out of him with awesome pranks.

Well, who's it this year?

Damn it.

(GASPS)

(YELLING)

Guys, guys, be careful! This isn't my box!

Oh, yeah, sure. Then whose is it?

MAN: It's mine.

I'm Dick Pump, and I'd appreciate it

if you hooligans didn't get
your eggs all over my parcel.

Sorry. I keep getting your mail, Dick.

Hey, what's in there, anyway?

Embarrassing stuff.

Wow, that was terrific, Jessica.

It was good for me, too.

(SCREAMS)

(LAUGHS) Got you again, Quagmire.

You said you were that waitress
from Friendly's!

-I lied.
-You jerk!

I didn't feel anything.

But you did!

Happy Halloween, (BLEEP).

Hey, hey, get away! (COCKS GUN)
Just get away from me, Peter!

Hey, take it easy, Quagmire.
Nobody wants to hurt you.

Right, Joe?

Gotcha!

Ha! Hepatitis C!

Joke's on you. I already got it.

-Meningitis!
-I'm a carrier.

-Gonorrhea!
-Patient Zero.

You're gonna have to do better than that.

I don't know, Joe. That's it.
We're out of known diseases.

Unless...

All right, what this is has no name,
so you can't have it.

(CHUCKLES) We got him.

Halloween is fun.

-(GROWLING)
-(GIRL SCREAMING)

What was that?

(GASPS) Oh, my God.
I knew this day would come.

Rupert, we're under attack by monsters!

Dear God!

But wait, there's Superman. He'll save us.

Superman! Superman!

Wait, wait. Where are you going?

To hell with him.

We'll have to deal with
these marauders ourselves.

Rupert, man your station.

All right, you undead bastards,
time to send you back to hell!

(YELLING)

(ALL SCREAMING)

Hey, Stewie,
you all set to go trick-or-treating?

Whoa, what the hell are you doing?

We're under attack, Brian!

By zombies and vampires
and a Mexican princess!

Stewie, those aren't monsters,
they're kids.

They're trick-or-treaters.

Trick-or-treaters?

Yeah. It's what kids do on Halloween.

They dress up in costumes,
and they go around asking for candy.

How do you not know
about trick-or-treating?

Well, how do you not know
that your reflection

in the patio door isn't another dog?

Hey! That guy is a dick.

Hey, get out of here! This is my house!

Oh, my God, Brian. What happened?

Who did this to you?

Did you do this? You son of a bitch!

Okay, see you later, Mom.

Where are you off to, sweetie?

You gonna go see three movies in a row

so it seems like
you're out doing something?

No, Mom. I'm going to my first
big high school Halloween party.

That's nice. What are you dressed as?

I'm a slutty cat.

I'll be back late. Don't wait up.

Quack, quack.

Oh! My little ducky. You look so adorable.

Oh, no, no. You see these holes?

I got bit by a vampire.
I'm a vampire duck.

But I'm a modern vampire duck
who hangs around with Anna Paquin

and drives around in a black Mercedes.

What is that?

It's <i>True Blood.</i>

Yeah, no one knows what that is.

Rich gay people do.

Brian, are you sure
none of these are real monsters?

Stewie, it's gonna be fine.

Look, here's our first house.

There you go.

A Cornish game hen for you,
a Cornish game hen for you.

Everybody gets a hen.

Would you like some gravy?

Sure you'd like some gravy.

Oh, my God, Brian, you were right.
Halloween is the best.

Look how much candy I have.
Where should we go next?

Look, there's Mort's house.

But I hope he doesn't have
some gross Jewish candy, like...

Like rugelach or hamentashen
or hachahachahacha.

Right, Brian? Brian?

Brian, where are you?

Hey, kid, nice costume.

Really? Oh, my God, thank you so much.

My mother bought it for me,

and I was worried it might be a tad banal,

but if you big kids like it,
then it must be pretty cool.

That's a nice bag of candy you've got.

Oh, thank you.
You know, it's actually a pillowcase.

They're sort of thrifty
around my house, you know.

Well, now it's ours.

Uh, well, no. But how about this?

You can have the apple and the raisins

and the cheese and crackers
with the little red stick.

I don't...
I don't know how that's candy, but...

Thanks, duck boy.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hey, get back here! Hey, that's my candy!

Damn you, that's my candy!

How could this day get any worse?

(EXCLAIMS)

Brian! Brian, help me! Brian!

-Hey, there you are.
-Brian, where were you?

Well, that jerk dog from our patio door
somehow got inside a hubcap.

I just wanted to alert the owner of
the car. I left a note on his windshield.

-What is wrong with you?
-You abandoned me!

And some larger children took my candy.

All right, look, just calm down. It's
still early. We'll get you more candy.

Brian, this isn't working.

What do you want me to do, Stewie?
It's late.

Everybody's stopped giving out candy.

Well, then let's get my candy back, Brian.

Let's track down the punks
who stole it and make them pay.

-Look, Stewie, I don't think that...
-Brian, please.

This is my first Halloween, and...
And it's ruined.

All right, all right, fine.
We'll look for them.

Good, because so far,

Halloween's a bigger letdown
than being a Mets fan.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Opening day,</i>
<i>and here's the first pitch.</i>

<i>And the season's over.</i>

You were a good sport this year, Quagmire.

Well, you know, Peter,
it's all in good fun, right?

You know, my grandfather
used to have a saying...

Holy crap, you speak Ebonics?

No, no, Peter, it's Japanese.

Wait, are they the angry eye ones
or the tired eye ones?

I'm not sure I... The first one, I guess.
I... I don't know.

My grandfather on my mom's side
was Japanese.

Wait a minute, you're...
You're part Japanese?

Sure am. My grandfather was a pilot

for the Imperial Air Force
during World War II.

Flew a kamikaze mission
in the Battle of Midway.

He's part of the reason I became a pilot.

Wow. How come I never met him?

He was a kamikaze pilot.

Yeah, no, I heard you,
he was a Karma Chameleon,

but how come I never met him?

Because he died, Peter.

Oh, my God, when? And how?

Hey, Joe, what are you doing?

I thought we were gonna go
to The Clam and get wasted.

Ugh. I can't. I'm on duty tonight.

And Halloween's got to be the worst night
of the year to be a cop.

All you do is drive around,
confiscate beer from teenagers

and occasionally handcuff
a drunk woman in a sexy costume.

Oh, cool! Hey, I got a great idea.

How about we ride around with you
and steal beer from teenagers?

I don't know, you guys.

This is my job, and I can't have you
fooling around, getting into trouble.

Hey, when the hell do I get into trouble?

Well, didn't you get lost
in the grocery store last week?

(CRYING LOUDLY)

-Are you okay?
-No!

I came in with my wife
and now I can't find her!

I'm sure she's here somewhere.
Come on, I'll help you find her.

Okay.

<i>Will Lois Griffin please</i>
<i>come to the courtesy booth?</i>

<i>We have a little gift for you.</i>

(SNICKERING)

I'm Lois... Oh, for God's sakes, Peter.

Yay, Lois!

This is so cool.
Our first high school Halloween party.

Do you think we'll get to make out?

These things always end up
in make-out sessions.

Hey, you know what, you guys?

My cousin went to a Halloween party
and made out with a guy,

and she's hideous.

I mean, really hideous.

How'd your cousin do it?

She wore a mask. Don't you get it?

If we wear our masks and we don't
take them off for the whole party,

the boys won't know who we are,

and we'll have a better chance
of hooking up.

-Good idea!
-We are so gonna hook up!

-I think we look hot.
-Totally hot.

Ugly bitches!

(QUAGMIRE MOOING)

JOE: So, what's the story, Quagmire?

Do you observe
any particular Japanese customs?

QUAGMIRE: Oh, yeah, I'm very in touch
with my Asian roots.

You notice I take my shoes off
whenever I enter my house.

PETER: Oh, yeah.

QUAGMIRE: I do five hours
of math homework every night

-even though I'm no longer in school.
-(JOE EXCLAIMS)

Sometimes I drink out of a wooden box.

PETER: Ah, very Asian.

QUAGMIRE: I was a very cute baby
and now I'm a joyless adult.

PETER: They are unhappy.

DISPATCH: <i>All units, we've got a domestic</i>
<i>disturbance at Fifth and Maple.</i>

This is Officer Swanson responding,
I'm on my way.

All right, you guys, these domestic
dispute situations can get pretty dicey,

so I need you to stay in the car, okay?
No joking around.

All right, sir, sir, ma'am.

I just need you to tell me
clearly and calmly what happened.

One at a time, please.

-The whore gets her stubby fingers...
-He puts cigars in his mouth...

-...in my wallet! Larceny!
-...and he becomes a different person!

PETER: No freakin' way.

Guys, I told you to wait in the car.
Domestic abuse is a very delicate matter.

Joe, this isn't domestic abuse,
this is hilarious.

And another thing...
I'm tired of massaging your foot knuckles!

You call that a massage,
with your baby carrot fingers?

-Go to hell!
-Come here! Get over here!

Stay away from me!
You keep him away from me!

Why, you little...

(BOTH YELLING)

Get over here!

-I'm gonna jump over you and I'm gonna...
-Come back here!

All right, that's enough, you two.
This is serious. Stop it.

(YELLING CONTINUES)

Quick, Quagmire, give me your iPod.

(CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING)

WOMAN: I swear to God!

You keep him away from me!

JOE: Got 'em.

Aw, they got tuckered out.

Of course they did,
they ran, like, two miles for them.

Okay, there they are, Brian.
And they've still got my candy.

You distract them,
and I'll run up from behind and grab it.

Stewie, don't be ridiculous.
They're kids, and I'm an adult.

I'll just go over there and calmly
ask them to give back the candy.

Hi, fellas.

Hey, look, it's Snoopy.
Hey, Snoopy, where's Woodstock?

Ah, that's... That's a good one.

Listen, my friend, Stewie, he's just a
baby, and you guys took his candy earlier.

What do you say you just give it back,
and we all forget this ever happened?

Sure, why not?

Your friend's candy
is right around the corner.

All right. Terrific.

-(THUMPING)
-BRIAN: Hey, hey, what are you doing?

-Stop it! Hey, let me go!
-(SPRAYING NOISE)

No! No! (SCREAMS)

Oh, my God, you look so cute.
What is that, spray paint?

Yeah. Those little punks want a war.
And now they've got one.

Hey, here's someone
who might understand how you feel.

-Hey, how you doing? First day being pink?
-Yeah.

Welcome to hell.

All right, Brian,
we're getting my candy back,

and here's how it's gonna go down.

First, we track down those
teenage hoodlums and kill them all.

Yeah, okay, fine, let's kill 'em.

Really? No way.

No, I was only half serious.
We can't do that.

Oh, my God... Pink Brian is crazy Brian.

Oh, man.

I know, I know we can't.
I just feel bad they stole your candy.

Well, now I know how Peter feels
when Mort steals his paper.

Come on, that's right, you bastard.

Stop right there!

Give me the paper!

No! No! Don't hurt me, you bastard.

Mort, give me the paper.

No, I'm reading it in here.

You can have the real estate section.
It's for schmucks, anyway.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, your turn to spin the bottle,
guy dressed like Bill Clinton.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Yeah, dressed like.

All right, let's go make some Whitewater.

Okay, slutty cat, you're up next.

Oh, my God, this is totally working.
Nobody knows who we are.

All right. Slutty cat and Optimus Prime.
Into the closet.

(ALL GIGGLING)

Oh, my God, you're gonna hook up.
With a boy.

I know. I can't believe it.

Oh, I feel as pretty
as Scarlett Johansson.

PHOTOGRAPHERS: Scarlett!
Scarlett Johansson!

MAN 1: Scarlett, over here!
WOMAN: Scarlett Johansson!

-Scarlett!
-Scarlett!

MAN 2: Laura Linney.

-(CAMERA CLICKS)
-Whoops.

Come on, you guys.
It's been well over seven minutes.

Let's go.
Other people want to use the closet.

-You guys...
-(ALL GASPING)

Oh, my God.

Chris?

Meg?

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

Trying to grab some boob!

From your sister?

I didn't know it was you!

Well, who did you think it was?

Some bitch! Who cares?

(GAGGING)

Oh, my God!

We did so much!

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

We're disgusting!
We're a disgrace to our family!

Oh! Maybe I can get in on this.

It's good to finally be off duty.

Wow, I never knew
about this place, Quagmire.

Yeah, this is the Air Force graveyard,
where old military planes come to die.

That one over there is my favorite.

It's an old Japanese Zero.

Wow, no calories
and all that Japanese taste?

That's the kind of plane
my grandfather used to fly

-in the war.
-Cool.

Man, this thing looks like
it still might be in working order.

You guys want to go for a ride?

-Sure.
-Hell, yeah.

Wow, I always thought
the Japanese flew flying saucers.

All right, there they are.

All right, boys, it's candy time.
Let's dig in.

Okay, Brian, let's do this.
Give me a boost.

STEWIE: Hello.

Hey, it's that stupid kid.

Yes, it's that stupid kid.

Now, listen very closely
'cause here's how it's gonna go down.

(ROARING)

(SOLDIERS CHEERING)

Guys, guys, guys,

I don't want to toot my own horn here,
but I think that was me.

(EXCLAIMS)

Well, there's only one thing to do now.
Go to plan B.

Mom!

I am so sorry, Mrs. Griffin.
I have no idea what got into my son.

Well, just have him return the candy
and everything's fine.

Justin, you give this young man
his candy back right now.

All right. Here.

Thanks.

Now we want Justin's candy.

-What?
-You heard me.

Take Justin's bag of candy
and pour it into Stewie's.

All of it.

And if I think you're holding back on me,
we're gonna have a serious problem.

Well, all right.
That's what I'm talking about.

Yeah, serious problem.

Good. Now, go in your purse,
take out $40 and put it in the bag.

All right, Lois,
you're kind of scaring me now.

I... I don't have $40.

All right, I understand.

I'll be back tomorrow for the $80.

And I'm taking your welcome mat.

Whoa, Quahog looks beautiful from up here.

Yeah, this thing handles pretty smooth,
doesn't it?

Feels right.

Feels kind of like something
I was meant to fly, you know.

Hey, there's Quahog Harbor.

Look at all those old naval vessels.

Yeah, look at 'em all.

Whoa, whoa, easy, Quagmire.
What are you doing?

I don't know, Peter.

It's like something
just awakened inside me.

I can feel my grandfather's
Japanese blood coursing through my veins.

Quagmire, what the hell's
the matter with you?

-What are you, nuts?
-Shut up, round-eye!

Oh, my God! Stop, Quagmire!
I don't want to die.

Please don't kill us!

(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

-Oh, God!
-No!

(BOTH SCREAMING)

You know what they call this
in my country?

-What?
-What?

Payback!

(BOTH PANTING)

What the hell was that?

Prank's on you, (BLEEP)! I'm not Japanese.

-You're not?
-No.

That was for making me have sex
with Joe, you sons of bitches.

You guys actually had sex?

Yeah, I kind of went rogue with that one.

Brian, you took me out
on my first Halloween tonight,

and you showed me an exciting time.

And for that, I'm going to let you

-pick out some candy from my bag.
-Thanks.

And keep in mind,
we can't use any actual brand names

due to advertising concerns.

Right, okay, I'll have a Mr. Whip-o Bar,

a Kooky Nut Pop, some Jim 'n M's,

a Zip Zap, a Choco Buddy,

a $64,000 Bar, a Notafinger
and a Dawkin's Peanut Butter Disc.

God, I hate television.

Brian, why are you pink?

(SNIFFS) Why do you and Meg
smell like sweat and shame?

Uh, well... You see... We...

You know what? I don't care.

I hooked up with a chick tonight,
and I am pretty darn proud of myself.

You're right, Chris.

I hooked up with a guy tonight,
a high school guy,

and I think maybe he'll call tomorrow.

You may be disappointed.

Yeah!

I'm gonna have
the best birthday party ever.

I gave out all my invitations yesterday.

Hey, Chris, I was wondering

if you'd like to come
to my party tomorrow.

Thanks, Dad. I'd love to.

Oh, no! M-E-G.

Hey.

What are you guys talking about?

-Nothing.
-Sports!

Birthday sports! No, just sports!

Meg, you're not invited to my party.

Happy birthday, sweetheart.

It's not a... Peter, its Earth.

It's a globe.

You gave me an educational toy?

Thank you.

Hey, Dad. This came in the mail for you.

Oh, my God!

I didn't know Lois had that in her.

Hey, is that your wife?

You bet that's my wife.

Well, I got to say, she's a natural.

You know, she could make some
serious money as a professional.

Wow, you really think so?

Oh, sure. Women's boxing
is a rapidly growing part of the field.

You should consider your
wife competing for a belt.

Well, she did look like she knew
what she was doing up there.

Think about it. Here's my card.

(CHUCKLES) What can I say?

I really like watching her box.

That means two things.

Hey, Lois, congrats
on winning that boxing match last night.

I saw your picture in <i>The Daily Growl.</i>

Brian,
<i>The Daily Growl</i> is not a real paper.

What? Yeah, it is.

-(SQUEAKING)
-(LAUGHS)

I like that sound.

(SQUEAKING)

Mom, since when are you a boxer?

I'm not, honey.

Honestly, I don't know what
came over me last night.

It was just one of those crazy things
that sort of happened after a few drinks.

Morning, everyone!

Morning, champ! You feeling loose, today?

Peter, what are you doing?

What is all this?

I'm a fight promoter now.

And I got you another fight.

You're boxing tonight
at the Quahog Civic Center.

Are you out of your mind?

No, Peter.
That was a one-time thing, all right?

I am not a boxer, and I'm
not fighting anyone else.

And that's final.

All right, well, how about this, then?

I'll take you somewhere real
fancy and romantic for dinner,

just the two of us.

And in return, I get to try
and convince you to fight.

Well, going out for dinner would be nice.

But I'm not changing my mind.

Oh, gosh, I can't wait to
see this fancy restaurant.

Oh, you're gonna love it, Lois.

Here, put on these special
eating gloves I bought you.

Why do I need to wear gloves
to eat in a fancy restaurant?

Because it's so fancy that...

You know what? I'm tired of this.

I booked you a boxing match.

Son of a bitch! Damn it, Peter.

I told you, I don't want to be a boxer!

Who the hell do you think you are?

There you go! Use that anger!

Hey, remember when I said I think it's hot

when you wear a sports bra
and gym shorts

underneath your dress?

-Yeah?
-Now, put these shoes on.

Stop it, you jackass!

I told you, I'm not fighting!

I'm sorry,
there's been a terrible mistake.

It's a different dialect!

One, two, three.

Hey! What you doing down there, Lois?

What's the matter?

Mad at little old me?

In your imagination,
I've got long eyelashes.

(GROWLING)

(CROWD CHEERING)

One! Two! Three!

Did you know where the Ukraine
was because of my globe?

No, I saw it in a book.

You knew 'cause of my globe, you dick.

Eight! Nine! Ten!

We have a winner!

(LOUD CHEERING)

Well, what do you think of that, Lois?

You still mad at me now?

Peter! I feel great!

I've never felt so in control.

I know the feeling.

It's how I feel when I burp really loud
in an underground parking structure

to assert my dominance.

(BURPING LOUDLY)

Says the king.

All right, kids,
I'm off to train at the gym.

Jeez, Lois,
you're really taking this seriously, huh?

Well, yeah, Brian, why wouldn't I?

I don't know, you've just never
really been the aggressive type.

I mean, you're usually
so measured and collected.

I know, Brian, but when
I stepped into that ring,

I don't know, something happened to me.

It's like I tapped into
this primal wellspring

of pent-up anger that
just needed to be released.

Really? What do you
have to be angry about?

-Where are my flapjacks?
-Huh?

You will recall, last night,
ere I drifted off into slumber

with a nudie magazine betwixt my legs,

I spake thusly,

"Lois, tomorrow morning,
I want flapjacks."

It was a simple message,
yet it has gone unheeded.

(SNARLING SOFTLY)

All right, Peter, give me a minute.

For every five seconds
I do not have flapjacks,

I shall break one window.

Uh-huh.

Look, Lois, it just seems to me

that this isn't necessarily
the healthiest thing

-for a woman your age to be doing.
-(GLASS SHATTERING)

Brian, I'm 42,
I'm in the prime of my life,

and this is what I want right now.

-You're sure about that?
-(GLASS SHATTERING)

Meg, go make your father some flapjacks.

(SIGHING) Okay, Mom.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

This is crazy! Is nobody really
making me flapjacks yet?

At this point, you guys are
being as irresponsible as I am!

I don't care about boxing!

The only reason I did
this in the first place

-was 'cause of you!
-What do you mean?

Peter, sometimes you're so insensitive,

and you make me so angry,
I just want to clock you in the jaw.

Obviously, I can't do that,
so boxing was an outlet.

Wait, you mean the reason
you fight so good is...

Yeah, 'cause I'm making believe
I'm fighting you!

Wow. Am I that much of a bastard?

Sometimes, yes.

Jeez, Lois, I'm sorry.

I mean, I don't mean to be, I just...

Look, if you don't want to fight anymore,
you don't have to.

Well, good.

And the truth is, I suppose I kind of got
most of it out of my system anyway.

I love you, Lois.

I love you, too, Peter.

Is it cool if I tell your insurance
that I gave you heart surgery?

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>in honor of her retirement</i>

<i>after 17 consecutive victories,</i>

<i>I hereby dedicate this statue</i>
<i>to Quahog's greatest fighter,</i>

<i>Lois Griffin!</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

<i>I'm also having a celebratory keg party</i>
<i>back at my house later.</i>

<i>You can tell your parents</i>
<i>that my parents will be there.</i>

<i>But they won't be.</i>

(LOUD CHEERING)

<i>And now a few words</i>
<i>from Lois Griffin herself.</i>

<i>Thank you so much for coming, everyone,</i>

<i>and thank you for always</i>
<i>cheering me on at all my fights.</i>

-WOMAN: Hey, Griffin!
-(CROWD GASPS)

-Oh, my God, that's Deirdre Jackson!
-Who's that?

Only the deadliest
fighter in all of women's boxing.

She's killed three people in the ring.

Her fists are so dangerous,

she's not allowed to be a lesbian.

I know why you're retiring, Griffin!

You're scared!

Scared? Of what?

Of me! Look at these people,

giving you a statue
for fighting a bunch of bums!

If you're so great,
why don't you prove it? Fight me!

Look, I don't need to prove anything.

I'm retired, and that's
the way it's gonna stay.

Oh, yeah?
Hey, man, you want a real woman?

Why don't you bring your pretty little
self over to my apartment tonight,

and I'll show you a real woman?

I'm ashamed!

Hey, that's my husband you're talking to!

Yeah?
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

You gonna fight me?

Look, I already said...

Get down on your hands and knees, fatty!

Yeah! Yes, sir!

Look at me, Griffin, I'm milking me a cow!

Moo for me!

-Moo.
-Louder!

-Moo!
-Louder!

-Moo!
-Louder!

(SOBBING) Moo!

All right, that's it!

You want a fight? You got one!

Now, you get your hands off my man
before I break them off!

Fuck, it's my parents!

The party's off, everybody!
Get the fuck out of here!

<i>Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Coming up next, a boxing match</i>

<i>where the fighters are bleeding</i>
<i>before the fight?</i>

<i>We've got exclusive coverage of</i>
<i>tonight's women's boxing bout,</i>

<i>Griffin versus Jackson.</i>

<i>We're here live with contender</i>
<i>Deirdre Jackson outside her dressing room.</i>

<i>Deirdre, is it true</i>
<i>you've killed three women in the ring?</i>

<i>Tonight it's gonna be four.</i>

<i>Are you saying you intend</i>
<i>to kill your opponent?</i>

<i>Let's just say you</i>
<i>don't want to miss round six.</i>

(GASPS) Lois, you can't go out there!

-What? Why not?
-Because if you step into that ring,

she's gonna kill you.

No, she's not, Peter.

What the hell kind of talk is that?

Now, I'm gonna win this thing.

Look, Lois, you don't
have to do this for me.

I know I make you mad sometimes,

but I thought we agreed
you'd hang up the gloves.

I'll hang up the gloves
after I knock her ass out.

Peter, she milked your boobs,

and there were a lot of
people I knew there.

Now, let's go.

VENDOR: Butt scratcher!

Get your butt scratcher here!

Now, since this is
a televised boxing match,

I'm gonna be joined
by a horribly disfigured former fighter

providing barely intelligible
commentary throughout.

Any thoughts on the fight, Floyd?

I think that they're gonna have,

they are gonna be fighting
Deirdre's last fight

in the contrast to the later one
is gonna be better than usually.

And how do you think
that helps her chances tonight?

Well, the match lasting the bout up
until the particular inaccuracy,

particular unusually that
should be the ultimate determining factor

in about the 12-round experience,
the heart of a champion margarine hat.

Well, we'll be watching for that.

We'll be checking in
with you throughout the night, Floyd.

And happy 23rd birthday.

You're welcome.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may</i>

<i>the top-ranked boxer in </i>
<i>all of Rhode Island,</i>

<i>Deirdre "Action" Jackson!</i>

(CROWD BOOING)

I think every Italian in Quahog is here.

Yeah! Go, white girl!

Hey, yo, you're getting
your grinder on my grinder!

<i>And in this corner,</i>
<i>weighing in at 130 pounds,</i>

<i>it's the Ovarian Barbarian</i>
<i>and the Breast of All Time,</i>

<i>let's put our hands together</i>
<i>for Quahog's own</i>

<i>Lois Griffin!</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

Okay, here's the rules.

No hitting below the belt,

no rabbit punches, no name calling,

no making trouble
for unconventional couples

who want to adopt babies,
'cause you know what?

They ain't getting
the good babies, anyways.

Okay, have a fun fight.

Ding, ding.

(BELL DINGS)

You think you're tough?
Well, let's see what you got!

Wow, she's really hitting Mom hard.

Good.

(BELL DINGS)

-(PANTING)
-How you feeling, Lois?

She... She's too... She's too strong, Joe.

I don't stand a chance out there.

All right, Lois, you listen
to me and you listen good.

I held your hand during childbirth,

I watched you raise three kids
on a shoestring budget,

you never gave up then,
and you're not giving up now!

Because you're the toughest woman
I've ever met.

And if there was a
hall of fame for hearts,

yours would be the biggest one
in the whole damn building!

QUAGMIRE: Peter,
you're in the wrong corner!

Ah.

All right, Lois, you listen
to me and you listen good.

-(BELL DINGS)
-Damn it!

(CROWD BOOING)

Shut up!

Everybody shut up!

This took a lot of courage!

Well, ladies and gentlemen,
here we are at round six,

the round that Deirdre Jackson
predicted she'd kill Lois Griffin.

What do you think, Floyd, is she gonna
make good on that promise?

A broken promise is a lot
like a child's pinwheel.

You have to be yourself,
or at least within the confines.

All right, well, let's see
what's going on in the ring.

(BELL DINGS)

(CROWD CHEERING)

Finish this.

(SNARLING)

One, two...

Lois, stay down. Don't get up.
You've got nothing to prove.

...five, six...

You get up, you die!

I've had enough of you!

Wow. Well, what do you think, Floyd?

How did Lois Griffin do
what no other challenger could do

and knock out Deirdre Jackson?

I have a strong headache
when I go to sleep and wake up.

And how do you think that's
going to affect Jackson's next fight?

My Puerto Rican wife got fat.

Well, I got to be honest,
Lois, I had my doubts,

but you really held your own in that ring.

Thanks, Brian.
It was nice to go out a champion.

Well, we're real proud of you, Lois.

And thanks to Deirdre,

Hi. Package for Brian Griffin.

Oh, I can sign for that. Package, Bri.

Wonder what this is.

It's my book.

And there's a note from my publisher.

"We are returning all of the unsold copies

"of <i>Faster Than the Speed of Love."</i>

You guys got a garage or something?

We got like 300 boxes of these things.

(LAUGHING)

Wow, that's a lot of boxes!

This is so weird.

Look what they used to pack your book in.

Shredded-up pieces of your book.

Okay, that's it, I'm finished.

What are you talking about?

I'm finished. I'm done. It's over.

Clearly, I am not meant to be a writer.

I have tried and I have tried,
and nothing has worked out.

I put my heart out there,
and it keeps getting stomped on.

Well, that's it, no more.

I'm done writing.

What? Writing's the only thing

that's giving your alcoholism
any credibility.

Hey, you know, I just thought
of something. Hold on a sec.

I bought a vase last week
and it's still in the box,

and I just want to check to see
what they used to pack it...

Ah! It's your book!

(LOUDLY) Oh, my God,
this gets me so angry!

-What? What is it?
-Look at this.

The number-one book
on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list

is <i>Dream Your Way to Spiritual Joy</i>
by Pauly Shore.

This is why nobody bought my damn book.

You know, this is what they want.
<i>The Secret.</i>

<i>Chicken Soup for the Soul.</i>
<i>The Purpose Driven Life.</i>

I tell you, I could crap one
of those things out in a night.

I'm gonna tell Mom you said "crap."

No, I mean it.
I could do it in three hours

and idiots everywhere would buy it.

Well, why don't you?

Believe me, I would love to,
just to make a point,

but I've given up writing.

Yes, but you cared about
what you wrote before.

You don't care about this,
so what does it matter?

Well, you do have a point.

All right. Maybe I will.

Oh, how fun. Can I watch you write it?

I don't know, Stewie.
I kind of like to write in solitude.

No, no, I promise
I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.

Three hours, 27 minutes,
and I've got myself

one big steaming pile of book.

-Definitely! What are you calling it?

<i>-Wish It. Want It. Do It.</i>
-Love it.

"to write down all of your

-Yeah, why not?

You know, if people want crap,
I'll give them crap.

And, you know, I have a friend

who might be able to help
get this published.

Wait, you have a friend
in publishing

and you never told me before?

-He's kind of a new friend.
-Who is he?

Yeah, I don't know if you
want to start digging around in this area.

Let's just leave it at,
"He's a friend in publishing

"and he calls on Thursdays."

Hey, Brian, when you're done,
can I make a pirate hat?

Here, just take it.

I look awesome.

All right, I got to go to a wedding.

I'll see you later.

Oh, my God, that is fantastic news!

I can't wait to tell him!

I know, I told you
the book was good.

Yeah, thank you so much, Don.

Um...

Red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath.

I don't really have
time to do this right now.

Brian, they're publishing your book.

You're kidding? I can't believe it.

That's the worst thing I've ever written.

Not according to Penguin Publishing.

In fact, you're supposed
to call the chief editor.

(PHONE RINGING)

Penguin Publishing.

One moment, please.

Sir, I have a Brian Griffin on the line...

Out. Get out! Get out now!

All right, everyone,
I made a very special breakfast

to celebrate Brian's book coming out.

And... And...

It's a special breakfast
for me, too, right?

Why?

Because... Because it is the anniversary
of when I started to eat vegetables.

Author! Author! (CHUCKLING)

And Peter for eating healthy.

Lois, you didn't have
to go through all this fuss.

What you got there?

This? It's just a copy of <i>Us</i> magazine.

Can you believe it?
<i>Wish It. Want It. Do It.</i> got three stars.

(LAUGHS) How hilarious is that?

It's not hilarious. It's great, Brian.
That's a huge accomplishment.

Well, I helped get the review in.

I called a friend over at <i>Us Weekly</i>

who usually just covers people
with gross amounts of children,

but now he's the book reviewer.

So hats off to both of us.

Well, nice going, Stewie.
You ought to be my publicist.

You know, I don't want you
to be offering me this

just because we're related.

I do have references you can call.

You know, I spent a month

as Melanie Griffith's loose skin holder.

-Melanie!
-Melanie! Over here.

You look beautiful.

Can't hold on much longer.

(ALL GASP)

I should have stayed in bed.

Yeah, we're walking in now.

Make sure Tom Tucker knows
he has 20 minutes

and he is to only talk about the book,
no personal questions, all right?

Are you okay? You good?
You need anything? All right.

All right, we're inside
and there is nobody here to greet us.

We have no idea where we are
or where we're supposed to go.

Wait, is that you on the phone over there?

Is this... This is us. Look over here.

There we go. He sees us. All right.

Hi, thanks for coming.

Yeah, hello, we've been here awhile.

Come on, I'll show you the green room.

And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say,
I loved your book.

Well, thanks. What's your name?

-Sharhooz.
-Oh, my God.

It'll just be a few minutes.

Excuse me, there's something on the wall.

Now you have exactly 20 seconds
to find us a room

with a white sofa, a white table,
white hydrangeas and Fiji water!

Stewie, there's no need to...

Ooh! I said no gray M&M's.
These are all gray.

Don't worry, Brian.
I've got it all under control.

You're a big canine star.

They should be treating
you like Spuds MacKenzie.

Man, I wonder what he's doing now.

(GASPING)

Now, ladies, approach him slowly.
He can't really see anymore.

I've injected him with the Viagra.

Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back,

but you're pretty much gonna
have to do 100% of the work.

We're here with Brian Griffin,

local author of the new bestseller
<i>Wish It. Want It. Do It.</i>

Am I pronouncing that correctly?

Uh... Yeah.

Now, what does that mean,
<i>Wish It. Want It. Do It?</i>

Well, it basically just refers
to the steps necessary

for identifying and achieving
your dreams and doing so

in as effective and expeditious
a manner as possible.

Wow. And it's nonfiction, right?

Yes, it is.

Now, which one is that? I always forget.

Is that the one
that really happened or not?

Uh... Yeah.

Okay. So now...
So this is... This is a true story.

Well, it's not really a narrative...

Doesn't matter. I'm hooked.

And we'll be right back with sports.

Okay, you're doing great so far.

Now I was just texting with New York.

We're doing a whole thing there.

I booked your plane ticket,
and I specifically asked

that you not sit next to an Asian.

Stewie, that's racist. That's terrible.

I'm sorry, do you want me
to call back and change it?

Well, it's done now.
Seems like a lot of extra work.

(INAUDIBLE)

Okay, there's a book signing

at the Barnes and Noble
on Union Square at 5:00.

And then at 7:00 you're
meeting with a reporter

from <i>In Style</i> magazine at Pastis.

I just want to warn you, she's very heavy.

So be prepared for that.

-Jeez, how heavy?
-I don't know, but apparently heavy enough

that they felt they needed to warn me.

Oh, look at this.
Your book is number three on Amazon.

Number three?

Well, who's number one?

It's that new biography
on Michael Jackson.

Come on, another one?

Unless it was written
by a 10-year-old's rectum, who cares?

It doesn't say who the author is, Brian,

but I would guess
that it's probably not that.

Well, Stewie, I can't tell you

how much I appreciate all you're doing.

I mean, I have been so
happy with most everything.

Oh... Most?

Yeah, don't even...
It's so tiny, those other things,

it's not even worth...
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

I've been so thrilled
with how you're doing.

-Great.
-Hi, can I help you?

Yeah, checking in. Brian Griffin.

You should usually do that.

You should check me in.

That's like one of the things
I was talking about.

I just have to tell you,
I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.

Thank you so much. You made my day.

So, you still in school?

Graduating this year.

Well, we'll have to celebrate
while I'm here.

(GIGGLING) Okay, well,
I'll be right back with your key.

She's so pretty, isn't she?

Yeah, you know.

-Do you think she liked me?
-I don't know.

How weird would it be
if she just showed up at my room later?

Pretty weird, I guess.

Oh, my God, were you...
Were you thinking of doing that?

Sending her to my room?

No, why?

Why? Were you thinking of me doing that?

I don't even know
what you're saying anymore, man.

Just do whatever you're thinking.

Man, crazy.

Hi, I just want to say
that I can't tell you

how much your book has helped me.

Uh-huh. What's your name?

It's Jan.

Okay, here you go, Dan.

Yeah, it's Jan.

Back of the line. Go on.

Come back around, he'll try it again.

Hi. Can you make it out to Kelly?

Well, hi there. I sure can.

You know, I have to tell you,

<i>Wish It. Want It. Do It.</i>
totally changed my life.

Well, you know, that's what
I set out to do with this book,

so, you know, I got to tell you,
that makes me feel pretty great.

This is just a phone number.

I know, I know, my phone number.

Oh.

Yeah.

-What do you think of that?
-Um... I'm not sure.

-Well, you know, I'm sure for you.
-Oh.

-Yeah.
-I see.

Yeah.

I'm a little creeped out.

Hey, congratulations,
somebody famous now hates you.

Okay, so, that's enough autographs,
I think.

Listen, I want to thank
you all for coming down.

And remember,
wish it, want it, buy it. All right.

Brian, settle down.

You're worse than that guy
from Penguin Publishing.

You want to get a book
published, don't you?

Well, yes.

Well, if you want to be
in black and white,

black and white's got to be in you.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

God, you know, Stewie,

I used to think that
John Lennon was kind of a jerk

for saying The Beatles
were bigger than Jesus,

but now, I mean, it's like,
I'm not saying I am, but I get it.

You know, now that we have two minutes
to kind of let the dust settle,

I just want to say
that I'm really proud of you.

Hey, I'm proud of myself, man.

I mean, I think it's like...

You know,
I think everybody has greatness in them,

but it's really about having the courage
to just kind of get inside your own head

and just kind of poke around
in there, you know, and be like,

"Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here?

"Hey, what do you call yourself?"

"Oh! Wisdom."

"Oh! Profundity."

"Oh! Truth."

"Hey, let's all just go hang out together
between the covers of a book."

I love hearing about your process.

Hey, enough about me.
This was a great meal.

Good, good, I'm glad you like it.

They told me everybody comes here.

Hey, there's Ren√©e Zellweger.

Hey, Ren√©e, how you doing?

Hey, Brian!

She seemed really nice.

Get over here!

Is everything okay?

No, everything is not okay.

Can you figure out what the problem is?

I don't... I honestly have no...
Oh, God!

How do you think I feel
walking out of the back room

of a restaurant and seeing
Ren√©e Zellweger eating

in the front room of that restaurant?

I am mortified.

Absolutely mortified!

You should know better than this!

I told them who you were
when I made the reservation!

Look, I have written
a best-selling phenomenon!

I should be sitting in
the front goddamn room!

Okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you.

And I just want you to know
that my only goal is

to be able to help you better.

And you being honest with me,

well, that's helping me do that.

So thank you.

Good.

Brian, are you going
straight back to the hotel?

'Cause I was gonna go back...

You know what, I'll just...
I'll take a cab.

Oh.

(SIGHS) Well, at least it's not raining.

Hey, Brian, welcome home!

How was your book signing?

Jeez, Lois, could I have, like,
five minutes to decompress, please?

It was a really horrible flight,

and I was sitting next
to a Japanese guy who had a cold.

Dear God, he's become a monster!

BRIAN: Stewie,
I got a flea thing going on in here!

Where the hell's my Frontline?

(SIGHS)

(BEEPING)

Oh, my God! Brian! Brian!

Brian, look at this!

I got you on <i>Real Time with Bill Maher!</i>

You're kidding? That's awesome, Stewie!

Great job!

"Great job," so you know that phrase.

-What's that?
-What?

What phrase do I know?

Bill Maher! Whoo!

Okay, so the topic is going to be,

"Should God play a role in politics?"

Oh, and here's your heartworm pill
wrapped in baloney.

Stewie, the point of the baloney is

that I don't know the pill is there.

Why am I standing under an air vent?

Um... Because...

-Because that's where...
-"Because that's where..."

-I...
-"I..."

-Because...
-"Because..."

-Well...
-"Well..."

-I can...
-"I can..."

-You...
-Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, Mr. Griffin,
we'll be ready in five minutes.

You'll be on the panel
with Arianna Huffington and Dana Gould.

Wait, wait.

My publicist told me Christopher Hitchens
would be on the panel.

No, we told him
Dana and Arianna two hours ago.

I did my prep research on
Christopher Hitchens.

-I am so sorry.
-I am done with you.

Do you hear me? Done!
Get out of here now!

-Brian, please.
-You're fired!

Yes, but I think the more
important question

that sometimes gets ignored

is what about the separation
of church and state?

Well, Bill, see, I think...

Actually, Dana, if I may, if I may,
I have some insight on this.

Bill, do you mind?

-Go, dog.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Well, it just so happens
that separation of church and state

is something I'm actually gonna cover
in my next book, <i>God. Period. Damn it.</i>

(LOUD LAUGHTER)

What does that mean?

Well, if I can expand on this.

For one thing,
"In God we trust" is on money.

Now, what does that tell you?

Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y
about any sort of stupid shit.

So what?

I think what's actually alarming
is the fact that

all this kind of pseudo-spirituality

is being peddled to the American people

in books that have, really, less substance
than an issue of <i>TV Guide.</i>

That's a good argument.
It's a very good argument.

I agree. I agree.

Really? Because I read
<i>Wish It. Want It. Do It.</i>

(CHUCKLING SHEEPISHLY)
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed!

Gosh, next thing you know,
both of you guys are gonna tell me

that it changed your lives.

Uh...

Yeah, I didn't read it.

Hey, so you're the guy. (LAUGHS)

It's actually...
It's actually very popular.

Well, it may be popular,
but I have to say I agree with Arianna.

I think it's actually quite harmful.

Did you... When did you say that?

I just did.

I'm sorry, maybe 'cause it sounds

like you're talking
with a mouthful of syrup,

-I just didn't get it.
-(LOUD LAUGHTER)

Hey, fuck you, man.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

(CHUCKLING)

Actually, I mean, it seems
that these sort of books

tend to pander
to the laziest kind of self-help

within the narrowest socioeconomic range.

I mean, yeah, you can wish it,
and you can do it,

but only if you have
the educational advantages,

the societal advantages that, like, what,

5% of the country has.

Well, yeah, you forgot "want it,"
which is such a big part of the book.

I mean, but you know, then again,

you just said you haven't read it,
so, you know...

Actually, since I said that,
I did read it.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And that's another thing, I have to say,

aren't "wish it" and "want it"
really the same thing?

I mean, your book

basically makes three points,

and two of them are the same point.

Well, you know, I mean,
it does seem to be helping

a lot of people, Bill.

Well, "help" is a strong word.

How does this help people, like,
with cancer or in Darfur?

Well, I mean, it's not really for them.

It's for, like, if you want a car.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

How does this help you get a car?

Well, I mean,
it doesn't with that attitude.

-I mean, you have...
-(CHUCKLING)

You have to do some of the work yourself.

That's why there are 50 blank pages.

That's why I keep it by the phone.

I think what this is,
is simple exploitation

of the American people
who could be using the money

that they spend to buy this book
to actually buy something useful,

like legitimate healthcare
that they actually need.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

(INDISTINCT)

(CLEARS THROAT)

You know, what the hell's
your problem, Zsa Zsa?

What is your problem, Snoopy?

Look, what it comes down to is that
these false promises of, like,

a quick fix to any and any problem
that you would ever have,

what books like these suggest
is actually damaging

to a large, gullible segment
of the population.

Yeah, aren't you a sitcom writer?

I'm an author.
I have contributed to the zeitgeist.

Do you even know what "zeitgeist" means?

If I didn't know what it meant,
I wouldn't use it, Dana,

which is a girl's name, and I'm...

And you know,

I'm not gonna give you...
I'm not gonna give you

the definition right now just
for your satisfaction.

You know, Brian, I don't think
you're in a position, really,

here to pull rank on anybody.

I mean, yes, Dana has made
a career in comedy.

I don't think he's ever done anything
as laughable as this book.

Look, all right, well...

What do you want? I wrote it in a day.

(AUDIENCE GASPING)

Listen, Bill,
I am such a big fan of yours.

I think you're totally getting
the wrong impression of me.

I was just trying to write
something that would sell.

I think it's crap, too.

Wow. If I had even one shred

of respect for you before this,
it's gone now.

I mean, if you're gonna
dump on people,

the kind of steaming, stinking,
smelly dump

that your kind traffics in,

at least stand by your dump.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY)

Okay, look, I'm happy to do that.

(STUTTERING) I'm just... I'm just...

Look, what I was saying...

Look, just tell me
what you want me to say!

Bill, he's urinating!

-Oh, shit!
-That's it!

-Look, Bill, can I just...
-Outside.

No, no, no, outside! Outside now!

-(BARKING)
-Outside! You get outside!

Knock-knock.

Hey, Stewie.

What do you want?

I just want to talk to you about
everything that happened.

Um...

You know, you were the only person
who believed in me when I was down.

This all happened so fast,
and I lost sight of who I was.

I mean, you know, sure,

you were in a little over your head,
but...

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I was in over my head?

Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about
all the things you did wrong.

It's about me apologizing.

Okay, then apologize.

-I just did.
-No, you didn't.

You just said it's about me apologizing.

That's not actually apologizing.

All right, Stewie, I'm sorry

that I made you uncomfortable
and put you in a situation

that you clearly couldn't handle.

Okay, okay, there it is again.

What the hell? Stop with that!

You're right. You're right.
This is about healing.

This is not about how many things
you messed up along the way.

It's about how badly I reacted to them.

So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted
to your many errors.

That's as good as it's gonna get,
isn't it?

-Pretty much.
-You can't write.

I'm so excited to see Santa Claus.

You know what I think is really wonderful?

Of all the malls
in this great country of ours,

he chooses to come here. Year after year.

You know? I mean, who are we?

You know? I'll tell you who we are.
The lucky ones!

Uh-oh.

Oh, my God! Look at the line.

Damn it! We're gonna be here forever.

Wait, look. There's Quagmire,
way up front. We can cut in line with him.

Wait. Stewie, he doesn't like me so...
(SIGHS)

Glenn? Glenn Quagmire! Wow!
What are you doing here?

Oh, hi, Brian.

Just waiting for Santa,
like everyone else.

Cool. Cool.

We'll just hang with you guys here.

Who's this little guy?
Is this your nephew?

Hey, buddy. You here to see Santa?

Yeah. I hope you've been
a good boy this year.

That little guy is my niece Abby,
you douche.

Her hair's short because of
the chemotherapy.

-Uh-oh.
-Do you know how much talking it took

to get her out of the house
because of her no-hair?

Oh, gosh, I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

Oh, you're sorry? For what?

That waiting in line is
such a catastrophe for you

that you'd rather destroy the confidence
of a five-year-old cancer patient?

Oh, come on. I didn't know she was dying.

Who said anything about dying?

Uncle Glenn, am I dying?

No, sweetheart, you're not dying.

'Cause we're gonna see Santa,
and he's gonna bring you a new brain.

Get out of here, Brian.
Just get out of here.

Should have gone into politics, Bri.

Now we got to go to the back of the line.

What the hell? Why isn't it moving?

I don't know. It's always the same thing.

Some fat kid sitting on Santa's lap
taking all day.

And I want a <i>Charles in Charge</i> lunch box,

and I want a Magna Doodle
and a new Uno game

'cause I lost a "Draw 2" card.

And I want a pet animal
that's half-chinchilla and half-mink,

'cause it'd be really soft, and I could
call it "Chink," and that's okay.

Geez, doesn't the mall close soon?
We've been here forever.

Would you relax?
We're right here. I'm next.

Hello, Santa.

Now, um, we've got a slight problem here,
because I have been rather naughty.

But you're a businessman,
I'm a businessman.

I'm sure we can work something out.

Wait, what are you doing? Santa?

You can't leave now!

Hey, wait, buddy, buddy,
we've been in line for, like, two hours.

Sorry. I'm done.
You want your kid to sit on my lap,

meet me at the bar at Applebee's.

That sucks. Sorry, Stewie.

That son of a bitch.
He just turned his back on me.

The way reality
turned its back on Gary Busey.

How am I doing today, Gary Busey?

You're doing great!

Good! Then I'll keep it up!

Hey, give me your keys. I need your car.

What? You're not taking my car.

Very well, then.
You're driving me. Let's go.

Driving you where?

To the North Pole, to see Santa Claus.

If that beslubbering,
onion-eyed maggot-pie

thinks he can just blow me off like that,
he's got another thing coming!

Look, Stewie, I know you're disappointed
that you didn't get to see Santa,

but I'm not driving you to the North Pole.

Everyone, Quagmire's niece is in the ICU.

Now, I think we should
go down there to support him.

-What?
-Yeah, apparently,

something happened at the mall,
and she took a turn for the worse.

They don't know
how much time she has left.

Quagmire just called. He's really upset.

It doesn't sound like
he wants us there for some reason,

but we should go anyway.

All right, let's go to the North Pole.

And so Brian and Stewie set off
on the road to the North Pole.

Hey, you want to hear
a real live-action fart

instead of one of those fake,
cartoony ones?

(FARTS QUIETLY)

We're gonna need another pair of pants
and another chair.

Hey, Stewie, wake up. We're here.
We're at the North Pole.

What? North Pole?

North Pole! North Pole! There it is!

My word, I really must have been asleep!

Ah. Look at this.
The tip of the Earth, Brian.

Okay, let's go see Santa Claus.

All right, let's go.

Well, this is rather festive, isn't it?

Small.

Well, it has to be small
because of all the tiny elves.

That's right. Good point. Elves.

Yo, yo, what's up, y'alls?

Y'alls ready to kick it
in some fine North Pole gear?

Brian, why does the North Pole
have black teenagers?

Uh...

From Katrina?

Of course. All right.
Well, I just have one more question, then.

Do you think I'm an idiot? Huh? Do you?

Look, Stewie, the North Pole
is a long and dangerous...

You can't jerk me around
when it comes to Santa Claus, Brian!

There is a Ferris wheel here,
and a guy hosing vomit!

Nobody vomits at the North Pole!

Except for Santa's wife,

-because she has an eating disorder!
-What?

Yeah, 'cause he can have anyone he wants,
and she knows that!

Stewie, just pull yourself together.

I won't, Brian!

Now you get your ass
back into that hippie car of yours

and take me to the North Pole, now!

Look, I know you're upset.

Why don't you just sit down,
write out your Christmas list,

and I promise I will mail
it to Santa Claus?

Screw that.

This was never about
Christmas presents, Brian.

Well, then why do you want to go
all the way to the North Pole?

Because I'm going to kill Santa Claus!

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

RON: <i>So it turned out Stewie was</i>
<i>determined to kill Santa Claus.</i>

<i>Would he succeed? Well, let's find out.</i>

Wait a minute, why the hell
do you want to kill Santa?

Because that fat bastard
blew me off at the mall,

and he shall not go unpunished.

Now, let's go.
I've got it all planned out.

I'm gonna see the workshop,
pet a few reindeer,

take a few pictures of me and Santa,

and then I'm gonna blow his brains out,

hopefully with his bitch wife watching.

This is ridiculous.
We are not going to the North Pole.

Trust me, it's a waste of time.
You're not gonna find Santa.

-Why not?
-Because there's no such...

Because when you get there,

you may find out
it isn't what you thought it was,

and I wouldn't want you
to be disappointed.

That's it? That's your reason?

Well, you know why
nothing works out for you, Brian?

Because you've got a negative attitude.
Like Eeyore.

Come on, Eeyore, let's go play.

I don't feel like it.

Why are you always in such a bad mood?

-I have a nail in my anus.
-Oh.

That's not fair. I don't think I have
a negative attitude, I just...

I don't think it's a good idea
for us to embark on

a potentially dangerous journey...

-Stewie?
-(TRUCK HORN HONKING)

Say "Yes" to life, Brian!

I'll be home for Christmas.

Son of a bitch!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

So, what are we hauling, good buddy?

I got a flock of birds
that were too tired to fly back north.

Boy, this is the way to do it, huh, Jerry?

Sure is. Think this makes us lazy?

Nah, we're still in the V-shape.

What is this? This is a weird gun.

Yeah. Don't touch that.

Oh, it's a flare gun.

Maybe you should put that back.

I'm just holding it. Is this the trigger?

(BOTH SCREAMING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(GEESE HONKING)

(DRIVERS SCREAMING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Oh, my God, Stewie, you all right?
What the hell happened?

Just some stupid stuff went down.

You could have been killed!
I could have been killed! Look at my car!

Well, you know, if you had just taken me
to the real North Pole to see Santa,

none of this would have happened!

What is this? What are you doing?

Hitching a ride.

I'm gonna keep heading north
until I find Santa.

Stewie, you're not gonna find him.

You do what you want, Brian,

but I am going to the North Pole
and I'm gonna kill that bastard!

Stewie, you're putting me
in a hell of a position here,

but I have no choice.

You're not gonna kill Santa Claus,
because he doesn't exist.

(LAUGHING)

Really, Brian? He doesn't exist?

That's right, he's not real.

Oh, interesting.
Interesting theory, Brian.

Um, who else isn't real, hmm?

You gonna tell me that
Elmo isn't real? Huh?

SpongeBob? Is he not real, Brian?

Is SpongeBob not there
at the bottom of the ocean

giving Squidward the business, hmm?

And what about Curious George? Huh?

Does he not really exist?

Is Curious George not really out there

making little boats out of newspapers
that he should be delivering? Huh?

Educate yourself, you fool.

Look, Stewie,
if you'd just listen for a sec...

No, you listen, Brian!

I'll tell you what,
you take me to the North Pole,

and if Santa isn't there,
I'll do something for you.

-What?
-When Lois does that

middle-of-the-night feeding

that she doesn't even open
her eyes or really wake up,

I'll let you take that one for me, Brian.

-Are you serious?
-Quite.

Okay, you got a deal.

Damn it, it won't turn over.

Great! Not even halfway through Canada,
and we're stuck.

Oh, hey there.
You having some car troubles, eh?

Yeah, we're trying to get
to the North Pole.

I don't suppose you're from AAA, are you?

-Who?
-AAA, you know? A-A-A.

Oh, AA, eh? Yeah, I just came from AA.

No, not AA. A-A-A.

Yeah, that's what I said. AA, eh?

So you are with AAA?

Oh, no, that's A-A-A.
I just came from AA, eh?

-Huh?
-Stewie, I think he's just a drunk.

Well, drunk or not, can you help us?

I can if you want to join AA, eh?

No, I'm already a member of A-A-A.
I need help with the car.

Oh, I see. Yeah, looks like
you got some water leakage.

You might need a hose, eh?

Jose, Roberto, whatever.

If you've got some Latinos up here
that can fix cars, that'd be great.

No, I mean,
it looks like you need a part, eh?

Well, yeah, when it's fixed,
we can celebrate,

but let's deal with first things first.

Well, I can probably take
you to a gas station, eh?

You have cash, eh?

I don't know,
my name carries a little weight,

but I don't see how that matters here.

Look, we don't have enough cash
to fix the car,

and we're kind of on our way
to the North Pole.

Oh, a car won't take you there, anyway.

But if you like,
you can take my snowmobile.

Really? You'd just give it to us?

Oh, sure, that's what
Canadian hospitality's all about.

If you like, you can have
all my money and my leg.

Okay.

(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)

Why'd we take his leg?

Well, we're in their country, Brian.
We have to observe their customs.

Oh, dear.

Well, at least we're done with
the first leg of our journey, Brian.

-Ha!
-Damn right, ha.

Brian, how long do you think
we've been driving?

I don't know, I've lost track.

Besides, dogs don't have
a good sense of time.

Could be three hours, could be
three years, I don't (BLEEP) know.

Well, we must be pretty far north by now.

Yeah, you're right.
Look there's the aurora borealis.

Yes, and there's the Aurora Boreanaz.

<i>Hi, there.</i>

<i>Things are kind of</i>
<i>beautiful up north, huh?</i>

(ENGINE SPUTTERS)

-Oh, no!
-What's the matter?

We're out of gas.

Out of gas?
But, Brian, it's freezing out here!

What are we gonna do?

I don't know.
We'd better think of something.

BOREANAZ: Maybe I can help.

There's an old, abandoned hunting cabin
about two miles north of here.

You could spend the night there and then
resume your journey in the morning.

Thanks, David.

Guess there are a few stars
in the sky tonight.

(LAUGHS)

Come on. Come on, now.

Okay, we'll leave you alone.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, this should do for the night.

Look, Stewie, now that we have a moment,

I think we should really try to call Lois
and tell her where we are.

Don't worry. I've got that covered.

(ROBOTIC VOICE) Hey, Lois, would you make
an appointment for me

to be neutered in two days?

Are you sure, Brian?

Yes, I'm sure.

And whatever I say in two days,

do not let me convince you
that I've changed my mind.

(ROBOTIC VOICE) Wow, you sound
pretty serious about this, Brian.

Oh, I am. In fact, I have this document
that legally binds me to same.

Have you had it notarized?

No. But a notary
should be here any minute.

(ROBOTIC VOICE) I received a call about
notarizing a document,

but I am spending the day with my family,
so they are here, too.

This is my wife, Janice,
my daughters, Lisa and Jane,

and this is Rosalyn,
a friend of our daughter Jane's.

Her family life is rough,
so we are kind of like a second home.

-(ROBOTIC VOICE) Robert!
-Well, it's true.

Well, thank you for taking the time
to notarize this important document.

I'm sure you are quite busy.

Yes. We only have a moment,

for we are taking a bus tour
of Providence and other places.

(MECHANICAL ARMS WHIRRING)

The next morning, Stewie and Brian
set out on foot for the North Pole.

They were cold and tired,

but Stewie was determined
to carry out his plan to kill Santa Claus.

As long as I've got
all you people watching,

does anyone want to buy some pot?

(WIND HOWLING)

My God! We made it, Brian! The North Pole!

See? Boom! Right there! I told you!

This is where Santa Claus lives!
In your face!

I don't believe it. It's here.

Damn right, it's here!
Now, while you think about the fact

that you're never going to enjoy
a nocturnal breast-feeding from Lois,

I shall open the gate.

(HINGES CREAKING)

This can't be it.
This can't be Santa's workshop.

This looks like Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Oh, boy, get ready for the letters.

Dear <i>Family Guy</i> bastards,

who the hell do you think you are?

I'll have you know that
Bridgeport is among

the world leaders in abandoned buildings,

shattered glass, boarded-up windows,
wild dogs, and gas stations without pumps.

So eat my (BLEEP), Jew writers.

Well, whatever sort of trick this is,
I will not be deterred.

I'm not leaving until
Santa Claus is dead by my hand!

Oh, my God! You're... You're Santa Claus!

Yeah. Who are you?

I'm Stewie Griffin,
and I'm going to kill you!
S09E09.en
We've got a slight problem here,
because I have been rather naughty.

Wait, what are you doing? Santa?
You can't leave now!

If that beslubbering,
onion-eyed maggot-pie

thinks he can just blow me off like that,
he's got another thing coming!

Why do you want to go
all the way to the North Pole?

Because I'm going to kill Santa Claus!

I've got it all planned out.

I'm gonna see the workshop,
pet a few reindeer,

take a few pictures of me and Santa,

and then I'm gonna blow his brains out,
hopefully with his bitch wife watching.

This can't be it.
This can't be Santa's workshop.

This looks like Bridgeport, Connecticut.

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

Oh, my God! You're... You're Santa Claus!

Yeah. Who are you?

-Ah. Thank God!
-What?

Do it! Please! Put me out of my misery!

You want me to kill you?

Come on! What are you waiting for!
Pull the trigger!

Well, there isn't
a great deal of sport in that.

(COUGHING)

Oh, my God, are you all right?

I'm okay. I'm okay.

I just need to catch my breath.

I-I don't understand.

I thought you were supposed to be
jolly and happy.

I used to be, a long time ago.

I made toys for little boys and girls.

I loved my work, and they loved me.

But it just got out of hand.

The world's population
kept growing and growing.

Kids wanted more toys, fancier toys!

We used to make
wooden choo-choos and rag dolls.

You ever try to make an iPod?
I've got orders for millions of 'em!

Oh, that reminds me.
I need a new version of Quicken.

Look at the toxic waste we're producing.

In fact, I think the toxins are taking
even more of a toll than the inbreeding.

-Inbreeding?
-Take a look!

I started with one family of magic elves,

and every year I needed
more and more to keep up.

Now they're just a sickly race
of mutated genetic disasters.

At least 60% of them are born blind.

(INHUMAN SHRIEKING)

The workload destroys them,
but they don't know anything else.

<i>It's gotten so their instincts take over,</i>
<i>and near the end,</i>

(GROWLING)

<i>Then the reindeer eat them,</i>

<i>I don't even pray for them anymore.</i>
<i>Seems pointless.</i>

<i>What god would allow this?</i>

This is in none of the songs or poetry.
It's a horror show up here!

How could you let this happen?

Me? I didn't do this.

Christmas did!

(SINGING) <i>Each bell would peal</i>

(COUGHING)

So, Brian and Stewie found Santa Claus,

but he sure wasn't what they expected.

It turned out
the increasing demands of Christmas

had all but destroyed the poor old man.

Okay, look at this.

Somebody gave me
a little remote control helicopter.

Pretty cool, huh?

-(CRASHES)
-Oh, it's broken.

I don't know, boys. He's in rough shape.

Doctor, you've got to do something
for him. It's Christmas Eve!

Christmas is the problem.
He can't keep this pace up anymore.

If he goes out tonight, he'll die.

Well, then who's gonna
deliver all the presents?

We will.

-What?
-What?

Stewie, look, you were right.
Santa is real, and he needs our help.

Don't worry, Santa. We'll make sure
there's a Christmas this year.

Thank you, Brian.
That brings me peace in this hour.

I'll be with Allah soon.

-What?
-Uh...

He doesn't know what he's saying,
he's delirious.

Look, you'd better get moving.

All right, Stewie,
let's go get the sleigh ready.

Is anyone else a little freaked out
by that Allah thing?

Never mind that, let's just get going.

All right, Brian. Let's do this.

Go on.

Giddyup.

Come on, you dumb deer.

It's not working.
I think they need to be coaxed.

Santa said they eat elf flesh.

Um... Oh. Excuse me? Sir?

Mr. Elf? Sir?

Hello? Young man?

I don't think he even knows where he is.

Do you want to just...

Yeah, I mean,
I'll just try and do it, I guess.

Hey.

Hey, fella?

Um...

Okay.

Bye.

(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

STEWIE: Hey, Brian, look.

That one reindeer just kind of
pooped in the other reindeer's face

and the other reindeer
just kind of ate it.

Isn't Christmas magical?

All right, according to this map,

we're approaching
the northeast coast of the U.S.

Get ready to land.

All right, Bri, this is it,
our first town.

I'm gonna head for that roof.

Why are we tilting?

Look, I've never landed
one of these things before, okay?

You're coming in too fast! Look out!

(BOTH SCREAMING)

All right, this is good.

In and out of this house
and onto the next one.

What about the reindeer?

(GROWLING)

Yeah, we'll cut 'em down afterwards.
Now let's get down the chimney.

Ow! Bitch!

Okay, let's get the presents
under the tree.

-All right, you have 'em?
-I thought you had them.

Oh, for the love of God,
they're still in the sleigh!

Oh, crap. On the roof?

(METAL CREAKING)

No, it's in the yard.

Oh, my God.

Didn't you unlock the door when we left?

No, you were the last one out!

How the hell are we gonna get back inside?

All right, find a rock.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

-I'm putting out the presents.
-Not like that you're not.

Tall in the back, short in the front.

And show some care, for God's sake.

You know, those aren't socks and underwear

donated by the fire department
to some battered women's shelter.

Those are Santa gifts, Brian.

You know, you have to...

What are you doing?

Did you just eat that whole cookie
off the mantel?

What? They left it out for Santa.
We're Santa.

Yeah, but you're not supposed
to eat all of it.

You take a bite and a sip of milk.
That's how the kids know Santa was here!

-Don't yell at me.
-I'm not yelling at you. I'm just...

I'm telling you how it's done.

They need some kind of indication
that Santa was here.

Oh, okay, how about this? Look.
Hey, now they know he was here, see?

-Stop it!
-Look, I'm here giving out free presents!

All right, I'll eat
the damn cookies if I want!

You know what?
I might even make a sandwich!

Wait. Where are you going?

I'm going into the kitchen.

I'm gonna make a sandwich,
get some chips or something.

Brian, knock it off!

Oh, man.

You jackass!

-Hey, who the hell are you?
-Uh...

-Hello?
-What are you doing in my house?

We're Santa Clauses.

Yeah, you're Santa Claus.

That's why you broke in
through the window.

I'm calling the cops.

No, no, no. I can explain. We-we...

We came down the chimney,
but we forgot the presents.

It's actually...
It's kind of a funny story.

What the hell did you do?

He was gonna call the cops, man!
You can't call the cops on Santa.

Now, help me move this guy's body!

(GROANS)

He's still alive!

All right, tie him up.
I'm gonna make it look like a burglary.

All right, look, let's just go.

Right, right. We'll go.
I'm gonna rewrap this bat for, um, Johnny.

Let me just clean
his father's blood and hair off it.

GIRL: Daddy, I want a drink of water.

(BLEEP)

Hey, there. How you doing?

-Who are you?
-I'm Santa.

You're Santa?

(GASPS) Who are you? Where's Dan?

-Oh, my God!
-Oh, crap!

(GRUNTING)

-Quick, Stewie! Get the bat!
-Help! Help!

Mommy!

It's okay. It's okay.
Brian, see if you can find some duct tape!

-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-GIRL: Mommy!

Mama!

All right, let's get this
place cleaned up.

All right, that's the last of the blood.
Go check on the other kid.

-What other kid?
-Johnny, the one who's getting the bat.

Stewie, there's only one bedroom up here.

What? Do you have a brother?

Well, then who the hell is...

Oh, my God, we're in the wrong house.

(SIREN WAILING)

Damn it, we tripped the alarm.
Brian, the cops are coming. Let's go!

What? We're just leaving like this?
What about not wanting to ruin Christmas?

It's already ruined! This was one house.

We've been here for an hour and a half!
An hour and...

First of all,
we're not even Santa anymore.

This has been a home invasion.

But an hour and a half, Brian!
It's gonna be light in six hours,

and we have to deliver
to the whole rest of the world!

There's two apartment buildings
on this block alone!

No wonder Santa lost his mind.
This is ridiculous! We can't do this!

Nobody can. It's inhuman!

All right, come on, let's get out of here!

-Oh, damn, what about the reindeer?
-The hell with the reindeer!

Look, they're all eating
each other, anyway!

(SNARLING)

Besides, we don't need 'em.
I made a few modifications. Hang on.

(SIRENS WAILING)

That was a disaster.

I can't believe it.

We were supposed to save Christmas,
and we completely blew it.

We failed Santa.

No. No, we didn't fail Santa.
The world failed Santa.

He gives and gives and gives,
and everyone just takes him for granted.

Hell, I didn't even think
he existed until last night.

Well, what are we supposed to do now?
Christmas is doomed.

Maybe, but there is one thing we can do.
Move over.

(GIDDY GIGGLING)

(GASPS)

Lois, there's no presents under the tree!

What?

Oh, my God.

Joe, did you get any Christmas presents?

-No!
-QUAGMIRE: Me, neither!

I got eight mediocre things.

That's right. It's Santa Claus.

-I can, too.

I can live with that.

you tell me what hope is.

Hope is what gets you out of bed
in the morning

when it's the day of prom
and you haven't been asked.

Hope pushes the caterpillar
through the cocoon

and drives the salmon upstream.

Your breasts may be small
and your glasses may be thick,

but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.

Hope is a horizon we head for,
leaving nothing behind us but fear.

And though we may never reach our goals,

it's hope that will save us
from who we once were.

Wow. Did you learn that at school?

No. You can't just learn
creative writing, Chris.

It's got to be inside you,
like musical talent

or athleticism or the ability
to choose to be gay.

-I don't think they choose that.
-Oh, please, they choose that.

(DOORKNOB RATTLING)

(TALKING RAPIDLY) Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's up, party people?

What the hell are these things,
curtains or something? Boring!

-Holy smoke, it's crowded in here.
-Hey!

There, that's terrific.
It opens up the whole room.

Peter, there you are.
Where the hell have you been?

I've been worried sick.

Oh, so I had a few Red Bulls,
drove to New York.

What's the big deal?
Hey, there's my little man!

(STEWIE EXCLAIMING)

-Done!
-Wow, Dad, that was pretty cool.

Can I try some Red Bull?

Oh, my God, can you try some Red Bull?

Chris, I'd take it as an insult
if you didn't.

Here you go, have some cans,
one, two, three, four, five.

Go on, take 'em, take 'em,
take 'em, take 'em.

(LAUGHING) That's what
Woody Woodpecker says.

All right, I'm gonna go outside
and milk the cow.

-Peter, where'd you get that cow?
-Oh, that's a silly question, Lois.

I bought it so we can have
fresh milk every day.

(MOOING)

Whoa, boy, that Red Bull's
some strong stuff.

(SCREAMING) Ahhh!

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Hey, everybody, welcome back
to <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

Time to spin the wheel.

Top winner for the day is Peter,

so you're gonna be the first to spin it.

Go ahead, Peter, close as you can
to a dollar without going over.

(BEEPING)

All right, while we're waiting
for the wheel to spin,

you want to say hi to anybody?

Oh, yeah, Drew,
I want to say hi to Lois, Brian,

Chris, Stewie, Meg, Joe, Bonnie,
Quagmire, Cleveland,

Mort, Seamus, Adam West,
Dr. Hartman, Bruce,

Carter, Babs, Tom Tucker,
Angela, Opie, Carl, Herbert,

Jillian, Consuela, Giant Chicken,
Greased-up Deaf Guy!

Okay. I'm sure they're happy to hear that.

(ALL SCREAMING)

(MOANING)

Whoa, paramedics, come on down!

(LAUGHING)

Mom, oh, my God, guess what!

Oh, God! You scared the (BLEEP) out of me.

You know that essay about hope
I had to write?

Well, the principal said
it was the best one in the class,

and he wants me to read it aloud
to introduce the President!

Chris, that's incredible!

Remember when I used to
come to school to wipe you,

and I'd say, "Someday I won't
have to wipe you anymore

"and you'll do great things"?

Well, this has been a big year for us.

Wait a second. Give me that.

"Hope pushes the caterpillar
through the cocoon

"and drives the salmon upstream."

I wrote that! You stole this from me.

Hey, you didn't say I couldn't use it.

But now you get to meet the
President of the United States

because of what I wrote. Ugh!

I bet you don't even know
what his first name is.

I... I don't know... Mike?

Hey, what are you doing?

Lois, where is my Red Bull?

Peter, I got rid of it.

Why the hell would you do that?

It was making you crazy,
and it's not good for you.

That's why I poured it all out
in the garden.

(GRUNTING)

Official flower business.

(MAN EXCLAIMS)

What are you doing, Peter?

I'm making my own Red Bull.

Lois can't stop me from experiencing

the manic highs and lows my body demands.

Whoa, whoa, hang on,
you're adding kerosene?

Peter, that's insane.
That'll destroy your body.

Kerosene is fuel, Brian. Red Bull is fuel.
Kerosene is Red Bull.

Now, why don't you leave me alone
while I'm doing my important work?

Peter, that drink will kill you.

Brian, whatever kills me
makes me stronger.

(SIGHS)

See, Brian? I feel great.

Peter? Peter, are you alive?

(GROANING)

You're alive. Okay, I won't...

I won't eat you then.

I was gonna eat you.

Dr. Hartman, please tell me,
is my husband gonna be all right?

Cancun, actually, thanks for asking.
Just got back.

Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
all the toxic chemicals

your husband ingested
from his homemade energy drink

-have caused total kidney failure.
-(GASPS)

(ALL GASPING)

How was Cancun?

Oh, my God. Kidney failure?
Is he gonna be okay?

Well, yes and no.

We'll put him on a kidney transplant list,
but that could take months.

Until a donor is found,
he's gonna have to undergo

dialysis treatments three times a week.

Dialysis? Is there any other way?

Yes, there is.

No, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait.
We'll do the dialysis.

Hey, Doc, I'm here for my dialysis.

Ah, have a seat, Peter.
Let's get you hooked up.

Doc, I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

-It's been three weeks.
-I know, I saw the caption.

Yeah, but I just go crazy
just sitting here for so long.

I know it's tough, but maybe there's
something I can do to make it easier.

Here, play with this bucket of afterbirth.

Heh!

The Lockhorns. Always locking horns.

(GASPS) Oh, my God,
that's why they call it that.

Oh, Peter, you got here just in time!
Chris is almost on.

Shh! Mom, here it is.

Oh, Chris, we are so proud of you.

I got to admit, Chris,
this is pretty exciting.

When did you become so coherent?

Mom, I wrote that!

He stole it,
and he's taking all the credit!

Chris, is that true?

You didn't write anything!
This is my essay!

Meg, is that true?

No, he's lying!

MAN ON TV: <i>Coming up next,</i>
Charles in Charge.

Oh, my God!

I want to watch this,
but I got stupid dialysis at 3:00.

I am so sick of this crap
mucking up my life.

Well, Peter, I mean, what,
you can get away with

skipping one treatment, right?

I mean, that's not gonna kill you.

Yeah, it's probably just
like missing an antibiotic.

You just take the next one.

Yeah, you're probably right.
Besides, it's <i>Charles in Charge.</i>

JOE: You know what I like?

The "Charles" part is formal, but the
"In Charge" part is kind of casual.

QUAGMIRE: Oh, wow. Remember this?

Remember when nobody had any muscle tone?

(<i>CHARLES IN CHARGE</i> THEME PLAYING)

QUAGMIRE: Geez, how many "A's"
does that guy need?

JOE: Two, apparently.

QUAGMIRE: You know, it's kind of
weird that '80s white clothes

could pass for '90s black clothes.

JOE: Yeah, is that
like a rummage sale thing?

QUAGMIRE: Ah! Nicole Eggert.

JOE: Didn't she bang somebody gross?
QUAGMIRE: I don't know.

JOE: Yeah, I feel like she
banged somebody gross.

QUAGMIRE: You know,
I heard the sweater budget

on this show was 200 grand.

Didn't you tell me that, Peter?

Oh, my God! Peter, you don't look so good.

What are you talking about? I feel great.
Like I could go another 20 years or more.

(SPLASHING)

Dr. Hartman,
this was just too close a call.

Next time, we could be too late.

Suppose he's stuck somewhere, or...
Or he's trapped in an elevator

or God knows what else? He could die!
He needs a new kidney now!

Well, as I said, Mrs. Griffin,
he's on a list,

but there are a lot of people
ahead of him.

Well, what are the chances
of getting him moved up the list?

Honestly, not great. It could be months
before he can get a transplant.

Unless you know someone
who's a compatible organ match

and would be willing
to donate one of theirs.

I'll do it.
He could have one of my kidneys.

Well, we always check spouse
records for compatibility.

I'm afraid you're not a match.

But it turns out
you are a match for a little girl

who's dying in that next room over there.

Oh, well, how 'bout we concentrate
on this family, Doctor?

Well, the only other option
is your children.

No, I won't put the kids through that.

Well, then I don't know what else to do.

You'll just have to roll the dice
and hope a kidney comes through soon.

Well, what about me?

Is that possible, Doctor?

Well, I suppose.

Stranger things have happened in medicine.

I once tried to clone a chicken.

The result wound up
being a man-sized chicken

that was incredibly hostile
and ended up escaping from the lab.

Okay, Doc, we got to have
a talk at some point,

but Brian, are... Are you...
Are you sure about this?

Well, there's no harm in seeing
if I'm compatible.

Well, according to these results,
Brian is a match.

(ALL CHEERING)

Hooray, yay, yeah, ice cream sounds great.

The only thing is...

Mrs. Griffin, could I speak with you
and Brian alone, please?

Well, of course.

-Kids, why don't you wait in the car?
-Okay, Mom.

Let's go find the big, black sassy nurse.
There's always one.

WOMAN: You can cry about it,
or you can decide to live.

-It's your choice.
-STEWIE: Found her.

Hey, what is it, Doc?

Well, as a dog,
Brian's kidneys are smaller

and don't have the capacity
of a human kidney.

For the procedure to work,
we would need to transplant two.

But... But I only have two.

That's right.
The procedure would kill you.

(LAUGHING) That car's getting towed!

My God, Dr. Hartman,
isn't there any other way?

I'm afraid not, Mrs. Griffin.

BRIAN: I'll do it.

What?

I'll... I'll do it.
I'll give you my kidneys.

But Brian, you'll die!

Peter, you're my best friend.

You... You gave me a home
when I didn't have one.

And you've treated me like
a family member ever since.

I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

I'd probably be dead anyway,
lying under some freeway overpass.

And I... I wanna...
I wanna return the favor.

After all, I'm... I'm a dog.
I have another eight years, at best.

I'm... I'm willing to give that up
so you can have another 40.

Brian, I... I... I don't know what to say.

You're saving my life.

Well, you saved mine.

And, hey, we... We had
a lot of good years together, right?

Yeah. We...

We sure did, buddy.

Hello, everyone.
Lois, did you put Stewie to bed?

Yeah, he's asleep.

Good. I'd rather he didn't know
about this till it's over.

He's just a baby.

Now, since the operation is
tomorrow, I thought it might be

a good idea to just kind of close
the book, you know?

So I just wanted to share
my final thoughts

with each one of you.

Meg, you're so beautiful on the inside,

but it's very important that
you know your limitations.

What do you mean?

Well, I know they say "Reach for
the stars," but if we all did that,

there'd be nobody left here
on Earth, right?

I guess.

(CHUCKLES) There you go.

Chris, I have watched
you grow from a little boy

into the young man you are today.

I know sometimes life seems tough,

but you just remember
to reach for the stars.

You really think I can?

I know you can, slugger!

And, Lois, I only ask this

because of the dire situation
I'm in, but can I...

Can I hump your leg
for 15 uninterrupted seconds?

I suppose so, Brian.

(RUSTLING)

I... I said you could do it
for 15 seconds.

BRIAN: Didn't need it.

No! It can't be!

Where... Where am I?

We're at the playground, Brian.
I kidnapped you.

You and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives

living right here under the slide.

Stewie, what the hell?
Are you out of your mind?

I most certainly am not!

I know what you're planning to do,
and I won't allow it!

You're not going to kill yourself
for that fat bastard!

Look, I've made up my mind, all right?
Now untie me.

No, I will not!
How dare you make plans to abandon me!

Come on, you, you can live
without a dog, Stewie,

but you can't live without a father.

And besides, how exactly
do you think we're supposed

to live here on the playground?

We'll do fine, Brian!
Everything is right here where we need it!

The jungle gym is the grocery store,
the swing set is the mall,

the seesaw is the post office,
and the sandbox is our summer home.

Can you believe it, Brian?
We... We have a summer home!

I mean, yes, we'll... We'll have to rent
it out some years to help pay for...

Oh, no, wait, no, we won't, because
I'm a famous race car driver. I forgot!

Stewie, you're not a race car driver.

And if you don't let me go right now,
you're gonna lose your dad.

(SNIFFLING)

But Brian, I...
I don't wanna lose anybody!

I don't... I don't wanna lose anybody!

(CRYING)

Oh, my God. Just stop, stop, just stop it.

But Brian, I love you!

(LOUDLY SOBBING)

Oh, God, just wipe your nose, man!

Can I have a hug, Brian?

Oh, no, no, God, no, no, not now, no!

-I want a hug! I love...
-No, no. Just wipe...

-Oh, God, there's no Kleenex.
-I love you, Brian!

-I love you so much!
-Go... Go roll around in the sandbox...

In the summer house! Go...
Go to the summer house and roll around!

Well, here we go.

You know, buddy,
I'm really gonna miss having a dog.

Hey, what do you say
you be my dog one last time, huh?

Sure, Peter. Whatever you want.

Hey, hey, whassat? Whassat, boy? Whassat?

Uh. Surgical equipment.

Whose is that? Whose is that?

Probably belongs to the hospital.

Whassat for? Huh? Whassat for?

Um. Cutting me open,
harvesting my organs and killing me.

You gonna go get it?
You gonna get it, boy?

No, I think, I think the doctors need it.
Can we... Can we just lay here?

Dr. Hartman, what're you...
You're not dressed for surgery.

I sure am.

But I... I don't understand.

Well, you see, Mrs. Griffin,
I found another donor for your husband.

You did? Who?

-Me.
-What?

It turns out I'm a perfect match.

And I'm willing to give up
one of my kidneys.

Oh, my God, Dr. Hartman,
you'd do that for us?

Well, the truth is you folks are
my only remaining patients.

I couldn't afford to lose two of you.

What do you mean, two of us?

Well, chances are Peter never
would have survived the surgery.

I mean, I mean, dog kidneys?

I'm not even sure dogs have kidneys.

-Do dogs have kidneys?
-Yes.

This... This is the guy.

Oh, my God, Brian...

-You're gonna live!
-(INDISTINCT, HAPPY TALKING)

-Oh, I love you!
-I love you!

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

I'm happy to welcome you all
here to our auditorium

for something that's not a terrible play.

In fact, tonight we're graced

with the presence
of our Commander in Chief.

But first, to introduce him
is a very talented young man,

James Woods' own Chris Griffin.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Thank you, Principal Shepherd.

My sister Meg will be helping me
introduce the President,

since we wrote this essay together.

"What is Hope?" by Chris and Meg Griffin.

Hope is what gets you
out of bed in the morning

when it's the day of prom
and you haven't been asked.

Hope pushes the caterpillar

through the cocoon
and drives the salmon upstream.

Your breasts may be small
and your glasses may be thick,

but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.

CHRIS: Hope is a horizon we head for,
leaving nothing behind us but fear.

And though we may never reach our goals,

it's hope that will save us
from who we once were.

Oh, my God, look!
It's Joyce Kinney from Channel Five.

Excuse me, Miss Kinney?

I don't mean to bother you,
but my name is Lois Griffin.

I am a huge fan, and I just think
you are doing a fantastic job.

And after what I went through
with Diane Simmons,

well, let me just say it's nice
to be standing here

with no one trying to murder me.

Yeah, no, you're fine.

Oh, well, that's very nice of you to say.

You know, it's my first anchoring job,
and I'm trying to make a good impression.

I love the "Child of the Month" segment.

We just watched that one
with the little goofball

who thought he was going to be a doctor.

I can't believe I'm actually meeting you.

You know, the news is so much
better with you on it.

Well, you know, Lois,

I'm on my way back to
the station after lunch.

I'd be happy to give you a tour.

Oh, my goodness. That'd be wonderful.

Great. Why don't you come down
to the station around 6:00?

You can watch the broadcast.

Okay. I'll see you then.

Oh, wait, wait. BILF. Total BILF.

Yeah, so, going pretty good.
I got six pacifiers now.

That was a big nothing.

And Julie Andrews pleaded not guilty,

saying that she brought the gun
to the nightclub for protection.

And that's all for today's
Channel Five News at 6:00.

Oh, I almost forgot.
That little girl is still missing.

Do we have a picture?

Do we... We... We don't?
We don't have a picture?

Okay, we don't have a picture. Okay.
But she's... She's Puerto Rican.

So look out for a Puerto Rican.

MAN: We're clear.

That was so much fun to watch.
What a pro you are.

Lois, you've met Tom Tucker.

Oh, yes, of course.

I loved that piece you did
on the invention of the guillotine.

Oh, thank you. You know, half the time
those things didn't really work.

-How was it, honey?
-They couldn't finish.

-Oh, really?
-Yeah, I got to go back tomorrow.

Oh, well, I made cabbage for dinner.

Yeah, that would be
the ending to this day.

In here is our editor, Mike.

They let him smoke inside
because all the smoke from his cigarette

just floats directly back up
into his face.

Hey, Joyce, when you get a chance,
come take a look at the Weekapaug thing.

Oh, this is all so fascinating.
You must have so many stories.

Well, look, if you want to grab
a drink with me later tonight,

I'd be happy to tell you some.

Oh, my God, I would love to.

Look at me, huh?

Stepping out on the town
with a big celebrity.

Well, I think you're exaggerating.

No, you're a lady big shot,
like Miss Piggy.

Hey, Kermit. What happened
to the "Bears in Space" sketch?

Sorry, it's "Pigs in Space" now.
There's been a change.

-What?
-There's been a change!

Hiya, lame asses.

(ALL EXCLAIMING DISAPPROVAL)

We were having a nice time.

Sorry. I'm just painfully aware
that I'm the only member of this family

who's going out for drinks
with a celebrity tonight.

What are you talking about?

Joyce Kinney invited me out for drinks.

So just order a pizza or something, okay?
See you guys later.

Man, I hate calling that pizza place.

They don't speak English,
and they always mess up the order.

It's like trying to give my cell phone
number to the housekeeper.

Okay, I'm expecting a very
important delivery at the house.

So, could you please call me
if it arrives?

I'll give you my cell number.

Okay. Yes. No problem. Give me number.

Okay. 401-555-1125.

Four...

Four, zero...

Four, four, zero...

No, no, I was just repeating the four.
One four.

One, four...

All right, let's start over.
Four, zero, one.

Four.

-Zero.
-Zero...

-One.
-One.

-Four, zero, one.
-Yes.

Five, five, five.

Five. Five. Five.

That was painless.
Okay. One, one, two, five.

One, one, two, five.

There you go, you got it.

-One, five, five.
-What?

You say, "One one, two fives."

One, five, five.

No, no. Not one one and two fives.
Two ones.

Two, one, one, one, two, five.

Oh, my God.

Okay. How many ones?

I'm not giving you
quantities of the numbers,

I'm giving you the numbers.

One, one, two, five.
Those are the last four numbers.

Okay, one...

One, one.

One, one.

-Two.
-Two.

-Five.
-Five. Oh, I see.

One, one, two, five.

Yes! One, one, two, five. All right,
now, read the number back to me.

Let me get my pen.

And that's why whenever
I have sex without protection,

I call it, "Taking a John Chancellor."

Oh, my God, Joyce,
you've got so many great stories.

Oh, come on, I'm sure you've done
some crazy stuff in your time.

-Well...
-Oh, what is it?

No, no, I can't.

Lois, I feel like we're
really bonding here tonight.

Come on, let's hear it.

Well, I have had an abortion.

(MOCK SNORING)

Oh, wake me up
when you got something good.

Oh, my goodness, sarcastic sleeping.
That puts a lot of pressure on me.

All right, well, when I was in college,
I was in an adult film.

Oh, my God, you did a porno?

(SHUSHING) Please, please, please
do not say a word to anybody.

I have never told anyone that,
not even my husband.

I promise, I'll take it to the grave.
But, oh, my God, Lois, that's hilarious!

Do you have a copy?

Oh, no, that movie's long gone.
Like the original ending to <i>Grease.</i>

<i>(WE GO TOGETHER</i> PLAYING)

We've been up here for four days.

Why did you drive the car into the air

if you didn't know
how to get it back down?

Look, Sandy, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

Obviously, I didn't think ahead.

It's so cold.
Let's cuddle together for warmth.

I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm warm enough.

Quick, we got to turn the channel.

I promised my friend Joyce
I'd watch the news tonight.

<i>Joyce, do your thing.</i>

<i>Thanks, Tom. Pornography.</i>
<i>The very word conjures up</i>

<i>the turn-of-the-century</i>
<i>pornograph machine.</i>

<i>Whoa, ho, ho!</i>

<i>But it seems pornography</i>
<i>has finally found its way</i>

<i>to our neighborhood.</i>

<i>Yes, local housewife and church organist</i>
<i>Lois Griffin has revealed to this reporter</i>

<i>that she appeared in a pornographic movie</i>
<i>back in the early 1980s.</i>

-What?
-Mom, that's you!

Boy, that black bar would be
a lot lower now, huh? Huh?

Huh? Would it not?

<i>Evidently, Lois Griffin,</i>
<i>star citizen of Quahog,</i>

<i>is also Lois Griffin,</i>
<i>star of</i> Quest for Fur.

<i>It just goes to show you never know what</i>
<i>sort of person is living next door. Tom?</i>

I can't believe this!

Lois, you were in a porno?

She totally betrayed me!

I thought girlfriends were
supposed to support each other.

Ha!

Slut!

How could you do that to me, Joyce?

Oh. Hello, Lois.

I told you that in confidence!
You totally humiliated me!

Well, then I guess now we're even.

What? What are you talking about?
I never did anything to you!

You really don't remember me, do you?

Remember you?

We went to high school together, Lois?

Chemistry class? Freshman year? Joycie?

You're Joyce Chevapravatdumrong?

Yes, but they'd never let that name on TV,
so I changed it to Kinney.

You ruined my adolescence, Lois.

<i>You told me I'd made the cheer squad,</i>
<i>blindfolded me, and told me</i>

<i>we were going for a special</i>
<i>celebration breakfast.</i>

<i>When you took the blindfold off,</i>

<i>I was standing</i>
<i>in front of the entire school</i>

<i>with my pants around my ankles</i>
<i>and a hot dog in my mouth.</i>

It was a horrible thing to do, Lois.

Look, Joyce, that was a long time ago.
And I'm very sorry for what I did.

But we're adults now,

and that doesn't give you any reason
to humiliate me like this.

Boo-hoo!

You don't like it,
you can go talk to a reporter.

Oh, my God.

I thought we were friends.

The kind of really good friends
that communicate with each other

poorly through Facebook.

Everyone, I think it's important
that we talk openly about this.

It was back in a disgusting period
known as the early '80s.

It was a time
when women would stand topless,

high on coke,
on the edge of hotel balconies

while the curtains
were billowing around them.

I think there was actually
more wind back then.

RAOUL: Hey, Lois, get back inside!
This coke isn't gonna snort itself!

(ELECTRONIC POP MUSIC PLAYING)

Great party, Raoul.
I feel like I'm horking all your cocaine.

Hey, that's okay, Lois.
You can just buy the next bag, eh?

Right, other guy?

Oh, I couldn't afford that.

My daddy's making me pay
for my own tuition this semester

because I maxed out all my credit cards
buying a copy of <i>E.T.</i> at the video store.

It was $399.

Yeah, but you own it.
You can just watch that now.

And besides, I got another way
you can make money.

So Raoul gave me a job at his pet store,
but I still needed money.

One day I was cleaning a bird cage,

and a porn producer came in,
and, well, the rest you know.

I kind of feel like the part
that we should have seen was...

You know what? Never mind. It works.

Good Lord. Am I a porn baby?

No, Stewie, come on.

I doubt it. I mean, maybe...
Yeah. probably. Yes.

Your mom's in a porno! I saw her boobs!

-Shut up!
-Hey, Griffin, your mom's a whore!

Come on, guys, knock it off!

Yeah, Griffin, your mom's gross and nasty!

-Hey!
-Not cool!

That's a dude's mom!

Well, she's also my mom.

-Your mom's a whore!
-Yeah! Suck it!

-You're a whore-daughter!
-Yeah, Griffin gets it!

Boy, I'm really looking forward to this.

I really need some church
after the week I've had.

-(COUGHS) Sinner.
-(COUGHS) Harlot.

-(COUGHS) Skank.
-(COUGHS) I'm actually sick.

You are no longer
welcome here, Lois Griffin.

But, Father, I've been an active
member of this church for...

Leave this house of God!

(ALL AGREEING)

But... But I love the church.
It's an important part of my life.

Maybe you should've thought
of that before you made a porn.

But, Father, I didn't mean...
Wait. Did you say "a porn"?

-Yes.
-Oh.

-Well, that's kind of weird.
-Why?

Well, I mean, you'd either say,
"You made porn," or "You made a porno."

You don't say, "Made a porn."
It just... It hits the ear wrong.

Oh, God, have I been saying
it wrong this whole time?

Come on, Lois. If it makes you
feel any better, I don't care.

And what does it matter
what those people in church think?

I mean, most of them are
just random background people

we've never seen before anyway.

Half of them don't even move,
the other half just blink.

Peter, that... That's very sweet,

but how am I supposed to live in this town
if I'm a social pariah?

What's that?
Is that them little fish that eat cows?

Just... Just leave me alone, please.

(SIGHS)

Hey, Lois, can I talk to you for a second?

For the last time, Brian,
there's no link to it anywhere online.

No, no, that... That's not...
That's not what I'm here for.

Look, Lois, you did what you did, and
there's nothing you can change about that.

But those people can only make
you feel ashamed if you let them.

If you own the choice that you made,

you take away all their power
to make you feel bad about yourself.

What do you mean?

Well, you remember a few years back,

people used to make all those jokes
about how Ryan Seacrest was gay?

And then he started making
those jokes himself,

and now nobody makes those jokes anymore.

I mean, he's still gay,
but now it's no fun to joke about it,

because he... He beat us to the punch.

My God!

That little pole-smoker's
a (BLEEP) genius!

...and so did the Corinthians finally
write back to Saint Paul, saying,

"Dude, enough with the letters.
We have received them all,

"and will get back to you
when we have the time.

"And by the way,
a lot of the information you're asking for

"is available online."

Oh, look, everybody,
it's the burning bush.

(ALL GASPING)

Hello, Father.

I thought I made it clear that
you are no longer welcome here.

You know, I've been coming
to this church for years.

I've heard all the stories.

Who did Jesus hang around with?

Mary Magdalene.

And who was she?

A prostitute.

Which means,
if they had cameras back then,

I bet she would have done a porno.

(ALL CLAMORING)

And if she did,
I know that Jesus would have forgiven her.

Am I any worse than Mary Magdalene?

And more importantly,
are you all better than Jesus?

I'm better than Jesus.

Okay, yes, Tina Fey,
you're better than Jesus.

But the rest of you...

The rest of you need to accept the fact
that I made a simple mistake.

And here it is.

(FUNKY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(ALL GASP)

I know I'm a man of God,
but that (BLEEP) is hot!

Hey, I've already seen this movie.

Let's talk about other movies we've seen.

That's an excellent idea.

I like <i>The Madness of King George.</i>

Hey, shut up!

Hey, I'm not the only one talking.

Hey, jerk. Hey, you keep it down!

Oh! What the hell, Peter?

Joe, thank God. There's a situation here.

<i>I've got a sore finger.</i>

I don't give a crap.
We got bigger problems!

Mr. Griffin and Mr. Griffin,

this court finds you guilty
of creating a public disturbance

and destruction of private property.

And all of this
while under the influence of alcohol.

Your Honor,
if you'll just let us explain...

I've heard all the testimony
I'm prepared to hear.

This court sentences you both
to 30 days of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Well, Your Honor, in that case,

I'll have to call my surprise witness,
Mr. Sockerby.

Mr. Sockerby, before we begin,
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

Yes, but that bitch had it coming.

Ah. Okay. Your Honor, I'm afraid
I have to withdraw this witness,

and I am going to those things
you said I have to go to.

This sucks. Can't believe that judge
is making us go to a month of AA.

You know, if you ask me, this is gonna be
a good thing for both of you.

There's a lesson you need to learn.

What are you talking about? What lesson?

I don't need to go to AA.
I'm a social drinker, not an alcoholic.

(SCOFFS) Yeah, that's like saying
rappers are really poets.

"I'm not saying she's a gold digger,

"but she's not messing with..."

Who isn't she messing with?

Hey, y'all.

Okay, we got us a few new friends here
joining us tonight.

So let's all say us
a big hello to Peter and Brian.

-ALL: Hello, Peter and Brian.
-Hi there.

All right, who'd like to kick us off?

I will. Um...

My name is Greg, and I'm an alcoholic.

ALL: Hi, Greg.

One fateful night, I got behind the wheel
of my brand-new sports car,

blind drunk.

I was responsible for the death
of an innocent 8-year-old girl.

-What kind?
-What?

What kind of car?

You said you had a sports car.
That's cool, but what kind?

-It was a Miata.
-Oh, come on. That's not a sports car.

How does that even kill a kid?

What, did you hit her
over the head with it?

-That's a legitimate sports car.
-No. Next!

Jenny, would you like to talk?

My name is Jenny, and I'm an alcoholic.

Jeez, anybody here
in any other line of work? Ha!

ALL: Hi, Jenny.

Before I found AA, my ex-boyfriend and I
used to get drunk and party all night.

I missed work half the time.

One morning, I woke up naked

with three Persians high-fiving each other
on the way out of my bedroom.

But now that I've joined the program,
I'm a whole different person.

And my two new cats, Clean and Sober,
just think I'm tops.

That's wonderful, Jenny.

All right, Peter, do you have
a story that you'd like to share?

Oh, yeah, I got one.

This one time, me and Joe and Quagmire
made a bet

to see who could drink the most beer
and still drive.

And you know that water slide
in South Attleboro?

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

-Yeah!
-Water slide!

Summer fun!

Peter, it sounds to me like alcohol

is a very destructive influence
in your life.

You need to relinquish your dependence
and give yourself over to a higher power.

(SCOFFS)

You have a different view, Brian?

Oh, I don't know.
Are we allowed to have a different view?

Brian, AA is the only way out
for these people.

Millions are saved every year
by the program.

Hey, people got along just fine
for thousands of years without AA.

Just like they got along
for thousands of years without religion.

I like you and have no reason not to.

I like you and have no reason not to.

Hey, did you hear about that magic baby
that was born in Bethlehem?

(ALL YELLING)

Oh, there you boys are.
How was your meeting?

Twenty-nine more and we're done,
that's how it was.

That doesn't sound
like the right attitude.

Lois, you weren't there. It was awful.

Just a bunch of losers
telling boring stories.

"My drinking ruined my marriage."

"My drinking ruined my family."

"My drinking ruined my TV show, <i>24."</i>

I see you got your own thing
going on this week,

but there's a new teacher at preschool

who deactivates the camera
and then hits us.

Brian, AA's been around for years.

It's helped a lot of people
get over their addiction.

No, it hasn't. They've just traded
one addiction for another.

Their life goes from being all about
drinking to being all about AA.

The only difference is,
when it's all about drinking,

they're more fun.

Well, like it or not,
you got to stick it out for 30 days.

You know what sucks, Brian?

We don't got a problem with our drinking.

It's everybody else
who's got a problem with our drinking.

Wait a minute. Peter, that's it.

The issue isn't that
these people are alcoholics.

They just have nowhere to drink
without being judged.

She slams us into the monkey bars,

but none of us have the language skills
to call her on it.

And then this one time, I was so drunk,
I gave someone a back adjustment.

I'm not a chiropractor.

You got to go to a weekend of school
for that.

Hey, hey!
Anyone in the house addicted to alcohol?

-Hi.
-Hello, Peter.

I enjoy alcohol.

I can't hear you!

-Hello.
-I have a very serious problem.

Mr. Griffin,
alcohol is forbidden at our meetings.

Look, just hear me out.

I sat here and listened to you bums
the other day,

and I got to tell you,

I have never seen a duller bunch
of pathetic bastards in my life.

I don't know who you were
when you were drinking,

but it sure as hell's got to be better
than who you are when you're sober.

Yeah, you all stopped drinking
because you were hurting your loved ones.

But you can't hurt them
if they don't know you're drunk.

Let's make this our sanctuary.

I wants me that beer.

DISPATCHER: <i>Attention, patrol cars,</i>

Wait a minute.
That's where Peter's AA meeting is.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

So I clicked on it, and the girl's
got a bigger wang than I got.

-No way!
-No way, right?

So I did... So I just put my thumb
over it, and then...

And that got me through the rest of the...

Of the session.

Oh, no. There's a policeman coming.

(ALL GASP)

All right, everybody, you know what to do.

Alcoholics, transform.

All right, what the hell's going on
in here? We got a noise complaint.

Joe, shh! Peter's about to start.

We are gathered here again tonight,
fellow AA members,

to talk about the greatest temptation
the devil ever created.

Alcohol!

Very well, my brother.

Let us lead him
on the path of righteousness.

This poor gentleman used to speak
in long, eloquent sentences,

but after years of drinking,

he can only speak
in short, choppy utterances.

Why, at one time, if you asked him
who his favorite musicians were,

he'd say Leonard Bernstein,
Johann Sebastian Bach

and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

But thanks to that old devil hooch,
it's all changed.

-Who's your favorite musician, Ollie?

I'm impressed that you're taking

No, Peter. I'm gonna go meet Jenny's cats.

You're dead, jackass.

You died in a drunk-driving accident.

Oh, God.

What the... What's wrong with you?

You know what?
I was so drunk, my ghost is drunk.

Look, I've been told
I can give you another chance,

but there's some things
we have to do first.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about you understanding
alcohol just a little bit better.

Peter, I'm gonna show you
where your life is headed

if you keep drinking as much as you do.

All right, Peter. Here we are.

Well, everything looks fine.

All right, family.
Line up for cigar burns.

(ALL SCREAM IN PAIN)

Wait a minute. Who are you?

I'm your other son, MacCawber.

Here for my cigar burn, good sir.

Stewie, go on, get out of here,
you stupid "laugh and cry, laugh and cry."

What's the difference?

What's this?
This is the bathroom at my work.

That's right. And there you are
in the stall with your boss, Angela.

What?

PETER: Oh, my God, Angela. That was...

That was... That felt so good.

ANGELA:
All I want to do is please you, Griffin.

Well, that was a good idea you had
dunking your hand in the toilet.

Oh, my God!
I wouldn't have sex with Angela!

-She's disgusting!
-DEATH: Not when you're drunk, she's not.

All right, Death, I get it.

I wish I'd never touched
a drop of alcohol in my life.

Never touched a drop, huh?

Well, guess what.
I'm gonna show you that, too.

Okay, get ready for this.

Hey, hey, hey, gang!

Everybody line up for a "Triple H,"

a hug, a handshake or a high five,
your call.

Lois, hug, you got it.

Stewie, hug, two in a row.

Try for three, Chris?

Oh! No, high five.

Well, that's okay. High five's great, too.

Meg, back to the hug. All right.

Hugs may win it today.

And we close with a handshake.

And all in time
for my big bike ride announcement.

Who the (BLEEP) is this jerk?

That's you, Peter, alcohol-free.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, look, there's Joe and Quagmire.

-Hey, let's have a drink with them.
-You've never touched a drop, Peter.

You don't even know those guys.

Those are your friends over there.

Hey, do you guys mind keeping it down?
We're trying to have a conversation here.

Some people, gee whiz.

Those are your friends
Phillip, Ernest and Jonathan.

-Do I at least call him Jon?
-DEATH: No, he prefers Jonathan.

Ugh! One of those guys?

You know, I've started taking
a Bufferin baby aspirin every day.

It's improved my heart one heck of a heap,
I'll tell you that. Pardon my French.

This is even worse than the other one.

I mean, it's cool I know French,
but, Death, this ain't me.

What am I supposed to do?

If I'm a drunk, I'm a jerk,
and if I'm sober, I'm a douche.

Exactly, Peter. It's called moderation.

You don't have to give up
the booze cold turkey.

You just have to be responsible with it.

You members of the human race
have the ability to send a man to the moon

and make Justin Long a movie star.

With that kind of willpower,

don't you think you can learn
to put the bottle down just sometimes?

We did it with Justin Long, didn't we?

America said no, but we kept at it.

All right, Death. I'll try.

Well, we're home.

Thirty days of sobriety
and we can finally drink again.

Oh, for God's sake, Peter,
didn't you learn anything from this?

Yes, I did, Lois.

These are going in the garbage.

But these I'm keeping for myself.

Moderation, Lois.

Wow, Peter.
I never thought I'd see the day.

Good for you.

From now on, half of every six-pack I buy
is going in the trash.

Hey, how come we're the only animals
with poo that's white?

I know. What the hell?

Right? We're not...
We're not eating white stuff.

Hey, you want something good?

Just look for the containers
that say "KFC" on them.

There's always something good in there.

Dude, that's birds in there.

You're eating another bird.

-What?
-That's bird meat, dude.

What? No.

-You're eating a bird.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

I mean, look at this.

What's that, some kind of board?

It's Chris' blanket.

We got to do something about this.

I'm pretty sure

I don't even know

Chris needs a hobby.

Hey, Chris, get in here.

-Yeah, Dad?
-We are gonna find you a hobby.

-What do you think of that?
-Okay.

There you go, that's the spirit.

Yuck.

Hey, Christopher. What you up to?

Hi, Mr. Herbert.

My dad's helping me find a hobby.

Well, you sure got
a pretty morning for it.

Chris, don't waste our time
with the elderly. They're dying.

Please, God, let me just sniff his hat.

Let me just sniff his hat,
that's all I want.

Now I want more.

Okay, Chris, this is the
gentle art of philately

otherwise known as stamp collecting.

Here's a pile of stamps

carefully culled from swap meets
and garage sales.

And look at this.
It's a Bolivian airplane.

Now, it says it's worth 8 cents,
but really

it's worth 12.

See that? Already ahead.

Came right out of the blocks
with a winner here, Chris.

Now, we'll just paste this
very carefully into the book.

And that's where it belongs.

Now, this is a loaded handgun.

And what we're gonna do now
is kill ourselves

because this is horrible.

-Couldn't we just stop philateling?
-Too late.

And I thought I'd seen everything.

My name is Chris.

Well, Chris, puppetry
is a wonderful art form.

You can create an entire world

and watch it come to life.

Wow.

What's that one over there?

Ah! That is a work in progress.

It is waiting to become
anything we wish it to be.

My name is Chris, and I like candy

Wow! What else do I like?

You like the pop singing of today.

-Oh, boy, would I?

I'm a vampire, and I'm in love

Boy, she sure can act, though, can't she?

Nope.

Bravo, Chris!

You have really tapped into

the wonder and enchantment
that is puppetry.

Plus, I move these dolls
and make like they're talking.

Yes. Right.

Thanks for showing me how to do it
and being so nice to me, Mr. Gutentag.

Call me Franz.

Okay. Franz.

You know, Chris, seeing
a young person like you enjoy puppetry

makes me so happy.

I feel like we could become good friends.

That sounds like fun.

Wow, I think you're just
about my most favorite guy

who's gonna die soon.

That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

Oh, no!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Mr. Griffin, I'm sorry to bother you,
but there's a...

Well, there's a situation,
and we need to talk.

Look, if this is about
those droppings in your yard,

it was, uh, Brian.

Yeah, Brian.

No, it's this man
Chris is hanging out with.

He's bad news.

Why? What's the problem?

-Chris is friends with a Nazi!
-What?

At first I wasn't sure it was him,

but I got a closer look, and now
there's no question in my mind.

Franz Gutentag is really
Lieutenant Franz Schlechtnacht,

the most sadistic SS guard
in all of Hitler's concentration camps.

That's a very serious accusation.

How do you know
this man was a Nazi prison guard?

'Cause I was there.

<i>It was 1944.</i>

<i>I was a young Air Force pilot</i>
<i>assigned as part of an escort</i>

<i>for a bombing raid over southern Germany,</i>

<i>when we encountered the Luftwaffe.</i>

<i>At first we thought we were in the clear</i>
<i>because the Germans were frightened</i>

<i>by the scary shark face</i>
<i>on the front of our plane.</i>

(SCREAMS) A shark!

How did it get all the way
up here in the sky?

Who cares, you fool?
Do you want to get eaten? Retreat!

<i>But there was one stubborn pilot</i>
<i>who saw through our disguise.</i>

<i>Most of the surviving American pilots</i>
<i>were taken to POW camps,</i>

<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>they thought I was gay,</i>

<i>so I was taken to a concentration camp.</i>

<i>Behind those walls,</i>

<i>there was one guard</i>
<i>who decided everyone's fate.</i>

<i>If he pointed to the left, </i>
<i>you did hard labor.</i>

<i>If he pointed to the right, you died.</i>

<i>That man was Franz Schlechtnacht.</i>

<i>I was spared death,</i>
<i>but I was given hard labor.</i>

<i>He made me sort the camp recyclables.</i>

<i>But some of those bottles</i>
<i>still had a little bit of soda in them.</i>

<i>It would spill out on my hands</i>
<i>and make them kind of sticky.</i>

<i>Dear God, how my hands</i>
<i>would get kind of sticky!</i>

(SCREAMING IN TERROR)

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

<i>No one should have to suffer</i>
<i>the way I suffered!</i>

So that's why Chris should
stay away from that puppet store guy.

It all sounds kind of sketchy.

Wait, are you Jamie Kennedy?

Am I being skunked
or puked or whatever, some (BLEEP)?

I'm telling you the truth.

I swear on my nephew's grave.

I don't know,
Franz seems like such a nice old man.

You know, maybe we should
just invite him for dinner

and clear this whole thing up.

Yeah, you know,
we got no right passing judgment

without getting to know him.

Isn't that right, Scottish chipmunk?

Yeah, he doesn't talk,
but he's a chipmunk,

and he's Scottish,
and he would back me up on this.

Chris, wait. Where you going?

I'm going to Mr. Gutentag's house.

-You can't.
-Why not?

Chris, his name isn't Gutentag,

it's Schlechtnacht, and he's a Nazi.

What?

It's true. You've got to stay away
from that terrible man.

Mr. Gutentag isn't a terrible man.

He's my friend.

Chris, you don't understand,
I'm trying to help you.

Help me what?
Clean your pool with my shirt off,

or wash your car in jean shorts,

bend over in front of you
to get little bits of lint out of the rug?

I know what you're about, Mr. Herbert,

free labor, and I'm not into it.

Chris, you have to choose.

It's either Franz or me.

Chris, what's the matter? You look upset.

Mr. Herbert was saying
terrible things about you.

He said you liked Hitler,
and your name isn't really Gutentag.

Oh, Chris, you can't always
believe what you hear.

For example, everybody thinks
that prostitution is illegal,

but there are ways around it.

All right, let's do it.

Both of you are
under arrest for prostitution.

It's not prostitution.

You paid her to have sex.

No, I paid her to have sex
and we're filming it.

So, technically it's not prostitution,
it's a porno.

Oh, well, as long as you're filming and
selling it, it's legal. Enjoy your day.

Remember, kids,
she's not a whore if she's an actress.

by giving you a hand-carved
German wall clock.

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

I could not find the clock.

(GROANS)

But you got three of them
on the wall over there.

Yes, those are mine.

Oh.

Yeah, I need those.

Uh-huh.

I just don't know why you said it, then.

Mr. Gutentag, can I use the bathroom?

Of course. Down the hall to the right.

It's the door marked...

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

What the...

FRANZ: So now you know the truth.

(COCKS GUN)

I promise I won't tell anyone!
Just let my dad go!

Oh, I am afraid that is quite impossible.

You're not gonna get away
with this, Mr. Googlesearch.

Oh, but I think that I will.

You two know my secret.

I must be sure no one
ever finds out the truth.

So, what? Are you gonna kill us?

Perhaps, Mr. Griffin.
I have not yet decided.

Well, you might want to do
something about that first.

What?

Quick, shoot him, Chris!
What are you waiting for?

-I... How do I know which one to shoot?
-What?

How do I know which one is the real dad?

I... We never switched.

We don't even look the same!

-All right, when's my birthday?
-Aw, crap.

February 8th.

(SCREAMS)

Dad!

There. That's more like it.

You idiot!

Well, learn my birthday, (BLEEP)!

Mrs. Griffin.
What a nice surprise. Come in.

Mr. Gutentag, I'm sorry to bother you,

but Chris and Peter
didn't come home last night.

Have you seen them?

Oh. Wait, is he a great big fat person?

He's a large man, yes, sir.

No, I have not seen them.

Well, if you do,
could you please contact me?

I'm just worried sick.

Of course, Mrs. Griffin.
I will let you know immediately.

Dad, I want to go home.

All right, let's try
and figure a way out of here.

Look around. See if you can find something
to break the door down with.

(GASPS) Dad, there's a window here!

Oh, my God, maybe we can get outside.

No, it's too small.

Wait, Dad, look.

There's Meg walking down the street.

Hey, Meg!
Hanging out with all your friends?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, whale, the ocean's that way!

That's a good one, too.

All right, let's figure
a way to get out of here.

Now, we can't fit through the window,

but maybe there's some way we can let
people know we're down here.

We gotta make as much noise as possible
to get people's attention.

And nothing makes more noise
than unwanted salsa music.

Hand me that radio.

(SALSA MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

What the hell?

Oh, for God's sake,
where's that white-noise machine?

(SIGHS)

(TURNS RADIO OFF)

Oh, man, the battery's dead.
Now what do we do?

(GASPS) Oh, my God.

Mr. Herbert! Mr. Herbert!

He can't hear me.

Jesse! Jesse!

(BARKS FEEBLY)

Jesse, what is it, boy?

(GASPS) Chris!

Chris, what happened?

You were right, Mr. Herbert.

Franz is a Nazi.

And he's keeping us prisoner down here.

-Get help.
-Oh, and if you see Meg, tell her

"Thunder thighs are on the move.
Thunder thighs are loose."

You know, I gotta say, Chris,

all my life I wanted
to see you locked in a basement,

but now that it's happened,
all I want to do is get you out.

Don't you worry. I'll be back with help.

You want me to write
that thunder thighs thing down for you?

He's not gonna do it.

I'm here for the boy.

-Who are you?
-Oh, you don't remember me?

Well, I remember you,
Lieutenant Schlechtnacht.

(GASPS)

But then why should you remember?

There were so many of us.

But frankly, I don't give a damn.

And I'll tell you this,

only one of us is gonna
walk out of here alive.

Bring it on!

(SNORING)

Wake up. Wake up. We're fighting.

Where... Where am I?

It's okay. We're fighting. Wake up.

(WATCH BEEPING)

-Hang on. Hang on. Pills.
-Yeah, me, too.

-Wednesday, right?
-Yeah, it's Wednesday.

-Oh! You know what? You know what?
-What?

I'm having some trouble getting up.

Would you mind calling my nurse?

Her name is Frieda.
Her phone number is in the kitchen.

Oh, gosh,
look who's stuck on the couch again.

-I'm not stuck on the couch.
-Okay, Mr. Cranky.

One, two, three! There we go!

You didn't need me. You did that yourself.

Good for you. You need anything else?

-No, I'm fine, thank you.
-Okay, you guys have fun.

Franz, grab my hand!

(BONES CRACKING)

Say good night, you Nazi bastard.

Thanks for everything, Mr. Herbert.

If only I had listened to you,
none of this would've happened.

You were my real friend all along.

-I'm sorry.
-It's okay, Chris.

Sometimes the only way to really
appreciate what you have

is to see what life is like without it.

And there's nothing I appreciate more
than your friendship.

(MOANING)

Dad, Mr. Herbert called me thunder thighs.

Oh, you did it. Thank you!

Oh, hi, Bonnie. What's up?

Hi, Lois, I hate to bother you,

but I'm going out of town for a few days
to visit my father in the hospital.

I was hoping that while I was gone,
you could look in on Susie and Joe.

And go have sex with Quagmire.

-Quagmire!
-Quagmire!

Oh, shucks,
you can't blame a guy for trying.

Giggity Giggity Giggity!

(SQUEAKING)

Well, of course, Bonnie. I'd love to help.

-Meg? Meg, sweetie?
-Yeah, Mom?

Bonnie wants you to look after Susie
and Joe while she's out of town.

(GROANS) What? Why me?
I don't want to have to do that.

And Bonnie said you are very pretty.

But I... How did that come up?

Oh! You know,
we were talking about pretty people.

And I said Rachel Maddow,

and she kind of took the baton
from there and said Meg Griffin.

Who's Rachel Maddow?

-A model.
-Oh.

Yeah.

Okay, I'll do it.

(LAUGHING MOCKINGLY) Whoops!

Oh, hey, excuse me, fella?

Yeah, what do you want, shrimp?

Oh, just a few moments of your time.
Hang on.

Let me just get this little guy assembled.

(HUMMING)

So where you from?

Newburyport. What's it to you?

Oh, I'm just always interested
in where people are from.

Everybody's got a story,
that's what I believe.

All right, I think we're all set here.

(LAUGHING)

Wow. Never seen that happen before.

What the devil happened here?
I've assembled that rifle a million times.

Well, I don't know if it's just the rifle.

What are you talking about?

I think you're going soft.

I mean, when was the last time
you tried to blow something up,

or take over the world,
or even used the phrase, "Damn you"?

Hey, I got a lot on my plate, man.

I'm learning to use the toilet,
I'm learning what shapes are.

I spent half an hour laughing
at my own feet yesterday.

Yeah, you're losing it, man.
You're losing your edge.

Well, I don't care for your tone

and I'd say you deserve
a good kick in the...

JOE: Come in.

Drop it, creep-o!

Don't move, Catherine Deneuve!

What are you doing, Mr. Swanson?

I'm trying out some cop entrances.

Oh. Well, I'm here
to help you out while Bonnie's gone.

Oh, great.

Do you have any experience
helping out people with special needs?

Well, I did work for that
old lady down the street.

Meg, could you come here, please?

What is it?

Could you see if I'm getting
a bed sore on my back?

Sure.

It looks fine to me, ma'am.

Thank you, dear.
I must have just slept on it wrong.

(CHUCKLING)

I stole Meg's cutaway.

(MACHINE POWERING ON)

What the hell is going on in here?

Well, Brian, I thought about
what you said at the park,

and I've decided you're right.

I have gone soft.
I've lost my sadistic streak.

So I've built a concentrated
neural enhancement device,

designed to boost my evil side.

All right,
shall we take this thing for a spin?

Now, when I say so, hit that button.

Okay, hit it.

(MACHINE ACTIVATING)

Well, how do you feel?

I don't know. I don't feel any different.

Well, why don't you try insulting me?

Yeah, okay.

Sometimes you chase helicopters.

-That's kind of lame.
-Yeah. Um...

Besides, I do that to protect the house.

Helicopters are going to hurt us,
and I make them stay away.

You know what? Didn't look at it that way.
Thank you for protecting us.

Look, your machine obviously didn't work.

It just needs a few adjustments,
that's all.

Come on, help me get some
of Peter's tools out of the gay-rage.

(MACHINE HISSING)

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

...97, 98, 99, 100.

Oh, thanks, Meg. I really appreciate you
helping me out these past couple of days.

Sorry I bit you yesterday.

That's okay. I guess now I know not
to get too close to your bowl, right?

(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

I know you're not trying to hurt me,
but part of me doesn't know.

Oh, my God, is it 7:50?

Oh, damn it, I missed the bus.

Well, that's all right, Meg.
I can drive you to school.

That'd be great. Thanks.

So, how are your academics going?

Good. Real good.

That Puerto Rican street gang
give you any trouble

on your way home from school?

-What Puerto Rican street gang?
-You're welcome.

Oh, hang on, there's a red light.
Got to hit the brakes.

(BLOWING)

(BREAKS SQUEAKING)

So, I hear you teenage girls
are pretty hot on that Nic Cage.

Er...

No, not really.

(CHUCKLES)

Okay.

Hey, can you tell me what Lady Gaga is?

Is that a band, or a soda, or a store,

or one of those terms like "donkey punch"?

No.

Is it a douche?

Is Lady Gaga a douche?

I don't think so.

Well, whatever it is, I like it.

Ah, green light.

(BLOWING)

Is it hard being a paraplegic?

Well, it's no picnic.

Unless your version of a picnic
is being the basket.

Well, you seem like you have
a good attitude about it.

Yeah, you know, it's like
we handicapped people say,

"When life ruins your legs,
you just got to make legonade."

I can sort of relate to that.

You know, sometimes
it's really hard being me,

and I guess I just make Megonade.

That sounds disgusting.
All right, we're here.

-(BLOWING)
-(BREAKS SQUEAKING)

This is my school.

Yeah, isn't that where you wanted to go?

Well, yeah, but most times
people just drop me off a block away,

so they don't have to be seen with me.

Oh, that's gay.
I don't mind being seen with you.

-You don't?
-Of course not.

Wow.

Well, I better go.
I don't want to be tardy.

Oh, that's not going to happen
from missing one class.

People are born that way.
Now run along, or you'll be late.

Hey, who's that, your boyfriend?

(LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)

Yeah.

Yeah, that's my boyfriend.

Meg, you're here early.

Oh, yeah, I just wanted to make sure

you got a nice hot breakfast
before you head off to work.

Oh, well, thanks. What's with the getup?

Oh, nothing. I just wanted
to look sexy for Susie.

How are your eggs, Joe?

<i>If he doesn't say anything</i>

(STRANGLED GROANING)

Brian, have you seen...

Whoa, what the hell happened to you?

-(MUFFLED TALKING)
-Easy, easy, man, easy.

(GASPING)

What the hell is your problem?

Me? What did I do? You're the one
going all Michael Hutchence over here.

You just stay away from me,
you psychopath.

Hey. Ow!

Look, I don't know what's going on here,

but don't be throwing things,
because that's just not safe.

-(GASPING)
-What?

Oh, my God.

Good Lord!

I am a genius.

What is it?

Don't you see, Brian?
My machine did work.

It created an evil clone of me.

That's why I didn't feel more evil.
All the evil energy went into him.

Well, kill it.
It almost choked me to death.

I shall do no such thing, Brian.
It must be studied.

If I can decode
the genetic puzzle of this being,

perhaps I can determine how to apply it
to my own neurological makeup.

Evil Stewie, come with me.
We're going to run a few tests on...

Ahhh!

(GASPS)

(YELLS)

(RETCHING)

(YELLS)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Oh, my God, a baby! Are you okay?

-Hi, honey.
-What? What'd you say?

I just said hi.

Is that... Is that Bonnie's dress?

Oh, yeah. Susie spit up on me,
and I didn't want to go all the way home,

so I just threw this on.
I hope that's okay.

Yeah, it's fine, I guess.

Oh. Here's that juice box you asked for.

Oh, tanks, Meg.

Oh, er...

-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

It's just that I like
to put the straw in myself.

Oh. I'm sorry. Here.

Yeah. It's not the same now.
I'll... I'll just get another one.

(PHONE RINGING)

I'll get it! Hello.

<i>Oh, hi, Meg. It's Bonnie.</i>
<i>How is everything going there?</i>

-Oh, great.
<i>-Has Joe died?</i>

-What? No.
<i>-That's good.</i>

<i>I was just calling to tell him</i>
<i>my father is recovering well</i>

<i>and the doctors say he'll be fine.</i>

That's great. I'll tell him.

<i>I'll be flying back</i>

That's great, too. Okay, bye, Bonnie.
See you tomorrow.

<i>Bye.</i>

JOE: Who was that?

Oh, uh, prank call.

Oh, yeah, I get a lot of those.
I can never figure out who it is.

-Who is this?
-PETER: <i>Wheely-wheely stupid head,</i>

<i>bet you wish that you were dead.</i>

Listen, I don't know who this is,

but you better cut it out!
I'm a cop, you know!

<i>Oh, what, are you gonna report me</i>
<i>on your can't-walkie-talkie?</i>

I'm gonna hang up now.

<i>No, no, no, wait, wait, wait! I got</i>
<i>three more of these I wrote on a napkin.</i>

(SIGHS) All right, three more.

(SNORING)

(ALARM BUZZING)

Ma'am, is this your bag?

I don't know
how that cocaine got in there.

Ma'am, this bag contains
a concealed weapon.

I'm gonna have to place you under arrest.

Oh, my goodness,
how did that get in there?

You're gonna have to come with us, ma'am.

What happened to the coke?

There's no coke in here.

Oh, (BLEEP), Ricardo's gonna kill me.

This is nice, Joe.

A night out, a good dinner.
Thank you so much.

Well, I wanted to do something special.

Show you how much I appreciate
all the hard work you've been doing.

Oh, it's been my pleasure.

So, listen, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

What's that?

Do you ever think
about having another baby?

I don't know. I guess I'm open to it.

Really? Oh, that's great!
So, I'll get off the pill...

What do you mean?

Nothing. Nothing. Forget it.

I... I think
I'm just a little scattered tonight.

I'm probably just PMS-ing.

Oh, grody.

Hey, this is supposed to be a fun night.
What's wrong with you?

You know, I could ask the same of you.
We haven't made love in two weeks.

-We haven't made love ever!
-(CRYING)

Oh, great! Now you've upset the baby!

(EXCLAIMING)

Oh, God!

(PATRICK STEWERT'S VOICE) <i>This feels</i>
<i>right, but it tastes like a dirty penny.</i>

This is ridiculous.
Evil Stewie could be anywhere.

You know, this really is all your fault.

If you hadn't told me I was going soft,

I wouldn't have created Evil Stewie,
he wouldn't have escaped

and we wouldn't be trying
to track down a murderer.

For all we know he could be
killing someone else right now.

Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

Oh, yeah!

Listen, guys, I got something to tell you.

And I don't really know
how to break it to you,

so I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

Meg has a crush on me.

(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

Oh, my God! Get over yourself!

Well, look, all I'm saying is,

I remember when Brian had
a similar difficulty with Meg.

Maybe she's prone to quick
and severe infatuation.

Yeah, with a dog, not a cripple.

Hey, easy there.

All right, look, maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I misread a few of Meg's signals.

Sorry I bothered you.

Excuse me, Lois,
I have to go make a phone call.

(DIALING)

Hey, wheely stupid head,
I heard you think Meg likes you.

JOE: <i>Who is this?</i>
<i>How are you getting this information?</i>

(SNIFFING)

Oh, my God, Joe was here.

Yeah, he just left.

I know. I can feel him. I can smell him.

Mmm! I can taste him.

Okay, I get the smell part.
But, Meg, I think we have to have a talk.

Sweetheart, you don't...
You don't have a crush on Joe, do you?

Um...

I don't know.

Oh, my God, you do have a crush on him.

What, Mom? Why shouldn't I like him?

When I'm with him, he makes me happy.

And he needs me.

Oh, Meg, you're fooling yourself.

It's classic
Florence Nightingale Syndrome.

You're taking care of him
and you're feeling a closeness

that you're misinterpreting
as a romantic connection.

But think about it, Meg.
You two have nothing in common.

You know, you're right, Mom.
I hear you loud and clear.

(CAR APPROACHING)

(YELLS)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Meg, what the hell did you do?

I made us the same, Joe.

We're exactly alike, you and I.
Now we can be together.

My God, we have to get you
to the hospital.

(SIREN BLARING)

No, but I mean after soccer practice.
You got anything planned for then?

Oh, I mean, nothing, nothing.
Keep walking. You don't know me.

The doctor says you're going to be fine.
And your family's on the way.

But that was a crazy thing you did, Meg.

I know. I'm... I'm so sorry.
I just wanted us to be closer.

Look, Meg, I do care for you,

but I care for you like I would a niece
or a good friend's daughter.

(SIGHING) I feel like such an idiot.

Don't. I'm lucky
to have you as a neighbor,

and even luckier to have you as a friend.

Thanks. I'm lucky
to have you as a friend, too.

(SIGHS)

When is Bonnie coming home?
I have to apologize to her.

-Well, you can apologize right now.
-Hi, Meg.

Bonnie, I'm so sorry I got you arrested.

No, it's all right, Meg.

Look, I was a teenage girl
with a crush at one time myself.

I know sometimes it makes you lose touch.

Thanks for being so understanding.

I hope I didn't get you
into too much trouble.

I mean, you're not gonna go
to jail or anything, are you?

No, I'll be around.

I need these voice-over checks
to support my gambling addiction.

Evil Stewie?

Wherever you are, if you can hear me,
I'm completely defenseless right now.

Okay, there you are.

Well, this is a gift, Brian.
Thank you for making it so easy.

Hey, well, you know,
you're doing me a favor.

I've had enough. I can't live
with that stupid family anymore.

Do me a favor
and end it all for me, will ya?

Delighted to oblige, Brian.

(YELLS)

-(FABRIC RIPPING)
-(GAGGING)

Oh, come on, not this thing! Really?

Brian, it's me, Stewie. Shoot him!

No! Brian, you know me.
Look at me. Shoot him.

All right, there's
only one way to settle this.

Look at your feet.

-Why? They're just feet.
-(LAUGHING)

What are they doing down there?
They're like leg hands!

-Nice job, man!
-Wow!

That was really brilliant.

Thanks. Just glad this nightmare is over.

And I'm really glad
I didn't kill the wrong Stewie.

Yeah, me, too.
Hey, come on, I'll take you home.

Oh, a drunk news report from Tom Tucker.

We haven't had one of those
since they canceled <i>Passions.</i>

This should be good.

<i>Okay, our top story tonight,</i>
<i>a local car dealer has announced</i>

<i>a "Hands on a Hard Body" promotion,</i>

<i>in which a used dirt bike</i>
<i>will be R-Awarded to the one customer</i>

<i>who can successfully outlast</i>
<i>his competitors.</i>

<i>And in other news,</i>
<i>they're bringing back</i> Passions!

Yes, they are!

Holy crap! A dirt bike! That's awesome!

Lois, I'm gonna win that thing.

Peter, why would you want a used dirt bike
when you already have a car?

Because this is 1978, Lois,
and dirt bikes have never been hotter.

Besides, I get one of those things,
it's gonna be a buffet of beave.

I don't know, seems stupid to me.

<i>Thanks to all of you for coming out today.</i>

<i>In just a minute, we'll begin</i>
<i>our "Hands on a Hard Body" contest.</i>

<i>And the lucky one of you who can keep</i>
<i>his or her hand on this dirt bike</i>

<i>for the longest amount of time</i>
<i>will get to take it home!</i>

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

<i>Okay, everyone who wants to</i>
<i>win this dirt bike,</i>

<i>come on up and put a hand on it!</i>

Mr. Pewterschmidt?
What are you doing here?

You want a used dirt bike?

No, not at all. But Lois told me
how much you wanted it,

so I decided to win it for myself just so
I could destroy it in front of you.

<i>And the clock starts now!</i>

How are you gonna destroy a dirt bike?
You can't even open your own aspirin.

With that.

Oh, damn it!

<i>Ooh! Our first hand off the dirt bike!</i>

Huh!
I guess you're out, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Well, I already paid for that thing,

so I'm just gonna stick around
and smash other stuff you like.

Hey, fat ass, you like, um...

You like this bus bench?

I... It's okay.

All right, that's good enough for me.
I'm smashing it!

(BEEPING)

(SMASHING)

(CAR ALARMS BLARING)

(BEEPING)

Ha-ha! You loved that thing.

<i>Amazing! Nine hours with no break!</i>

<i>Who's gonna win this thing?</i>

You might as well give up now, Mr. Mayor.
This dirt bike is mine.

Like heck it is!

(DIALING TONES)

-Hey, check your phone.
-Why?

I just sent you a picture
of a kitten in sunglasses.

Well, this I gotta see!

Hello, cool kitty.

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>And we have a winner!</i>

(CHEERING)

Ah, darn it.

Well, I guess I'll just disappear
into that field of corn.

(SHOUTING) Help! I'm lost in corn!

-Hey, where's Peter?
-I don't know.

I haven't heard from him
since he left work.

(ENGINE REVVING)

Hope you made extra. I brought a guest.

What the hell? Who is this?

-This is my dirt bike girlfriend.
-Amber.

I'm a dirt bike guy now,
so I need a dirt bike girlfriend.

Yes, she has small breasts,
but she makes up for it by smoking.

Peter, she has to leave.
We're having dinner.

No, Lois! I will not allow you
to look down on Amber

just 'cause she goes
to an alternative high school!

There's different ways
to measure intelligence

besides someone's grade-point average!

Fact is, she rumpled up
some poetry she wrote

and threw it away in a fit,

but I un-rumpled it,
and it was really good!

(SIGHS) Fine. Amber, would you like
to have some dinner with our family?

Nah, I can't.

I got a wicked bruise
on the back of my throat.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please rise for our national anthem,</i>

<i>performed this afternoon</i>
<i>by Peter Griffin and his dirt bike.</i>

(ENGINE REVS TO THE TUNE
OF <i>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</i>)

There it is, Meg.

What do you say we take it for a spin?

Chris, get off there.
You shouldn't be sitting on that.

Come on!

(CLUCKING)

(DISTANT CLUCKING)

That's fake.

Come on, Meg.

Just get on.

(SIGHS)

Hey, Meg, check it out.

I'm gonna jump that fire hydrant.

Chris, don't!
You're gonna wreck Dad's bike!

Too late, I already narrowed my eyes.

(MEG SCREAMS)

Chris, you idiot! Look at what you did!

You mean look what two black teenagers did

when they stole Dad's bike.

What were you kids thinking?
You could have been killed!

It was Chris' idea. He talked me into it.

Is that right?

So you like taking dirt bikes
that don't belong to you, huh?

Then here,
have a whole carton of cigarettes!

What?

Peter, that's not what this is about.

See how you like them!
Here, I'll even get you started.

(COUGHS)

Dad, I don't smoke.

Sure, you don't now. But keep at it.
You'll get the hang of it.

By the end of that pack,
you'll be smoking like a real pro.

Like a cool kid.

Yeah, that's it.
Getting smoother, isn't it?

-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah!

Wait till you try it after a meal.
Delicious!

And after sex? Forget about it.

It's like putting your penis to sleep
in a feather bed.

I think I may want more cigarettes.

Oh, I'll get you more cigarettes.

But I'm pretty mad about my dirt bike!

Kids, I'm sorry to say this,

but I think the two of you
need to be punished.

Look, it was an accident, okay?

I mean,
you can always buy another one, right?

Buy another one?

You know, I don't think you kids
appreciate how hard your father and I work

to provide you with everything we do.

Sometimes you just seem to
take us for granted.

You know,
it's very difficult being a parent.

No, it's not.
You get to do anything you want

and you get to make all the rules.

Damn right I do, 'cause I make the money!

I'm the big mamoo around here!

Now, when you start bringing in a paycheck

and providing for this family,
then you can make the rules!

Well, I'd do a better job of it than you!

Oh, you think so, huh?

Well, maybe you'd like to try it
for a little while.

You be the adults!

What do you mean?

I mean, maybe we try a little experiment.

You kids switch places
with your dad and me.

For the next week, you'll be the parents
and we'll be the kids.

-Seriously?
-Yeah, that'd be awesome!

That sounds great!

That's a great idea, Lois. Crisscross!

-Yes, that is a crisscross.
-Yes!

So we got a deal?

Yeah, we got a deal.

<i>Face/Off!</i>

No, Peter.

<i>Road House.</i>

Here's your breakfast, Lois.

Thank you, Mom.

(STAMMERING)
What is this? What's going on?

Oh, apparently, Chris and Meg
are switching places

with Peter and Lois for the week.

(LAUGHS)

Hey, Mom, do you mind if I go shopping
with Jennifer after school?

No, Peter, no, no, you're still you.

You're just a teenager.
You're not switching genders.

Ah.

I shall return.

Well, I'm off to work at the brewery.

Okay, have a good day, honey.

-You know, Brian, you and I should do...
-No.

Okay, it just... It looked fun.

All right, time to make all those
popular kids pay for ignoring me!

(COCKS GUN)

Peter, no, you're just
a normal high school kid.

Oh.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)

Hey, Lance, it's off, it's off.
It's off, it's off.

(GUNFIRE, SCREAMS OVER PHONE)

Throw this phone away, Lois!

Griffin, did you finish
those reports I gave you?

Right here, Angela.

Wow. You know, I gotta say,

when your dad told me about
this whole switching-places thing,

I was kind of skeptical,

but you're actually doing good work.

Well, it's a lot easier than high school,
I'll tell you that.

Well, how do you mean?

High school's like <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>
It's a social nightmare.

And I hear Canadian high schools
are even worse.

Well, well, look who matriculated
to grade nine.

Someone wants to get into university.

Hey, guys, I'm sorry.

Well, you're gonna be sorry

when we put you in the hospital
for free, eh?

(CHEERING)

I don't know what the kids
are complaining about.

This ain't so bad.

I know. This is fun.
I haven't been to a pep rally in years.

Do you have school spirit?

Yeah!

Do you have school spirit?

Yeah!

Who's got the most school spirit?

I do!

Show me your school spirit!

(INHALES)

The players will remember this
while they're playing.

Hey, Mom, where the hell's dinner?
I'm starving.

Oh, man, can you imagine the disaster
she's gonna walk out here with?

She has no idea how hard it is to cook.

Yeah, yeah, I bet she comes out
with just like...

Just like a poop on a plate, right?

Poop on a plate would be good,

because at least there'd be traces
of my food still in there.

Oh, snap! Snap! Snap!

Hey, guys?
Give her a (BLEEP) chance, all right?

Here it is, gang.

Seared ahi tostadas,
grilled asparagus, couscous,

and for dessert,
molten chocolate lava cake.

Wait a minute.

Meg, when did you find the time
to do all this?

I had all day to do this.

Mmm! Oh, my God, this is delicious.

What do you mean "all day"?

What about all the housework?

I did it in, like, an hour.

I don't understand why you're such
a freaking martyr all the time.

It's a house. It's a finite area.

I'm not cleaning a town.

Hey, family, I'm home.

Ooh. That smells fantastic.

Hey, buddy, how was your first day
in the real world?

It was actually really great.

And Angela even told me
I might get a raise

for doing such a good job.

Wow, guys, you hear that? A raise.

Interesting.

Seems like the kids are doing pretty well
at this grown-up thing, huh?

I would suggest that you suck that.

Wow, I am already so stuffed.

Guess I shouldn't have had
so many action figure guns for lunch.

Well, hello, you two.

How's your little experiment going?

(SOBBING) Horrible.

Three girls I don't care about
made me cry in the bathroom.

Um, hey, you guys.

I bet you Lois Griffin
doesn't make the track team,

which is an important thing
in high school right now.

Yeah, everyone who's anyone
is running track

at our high school right now.

Yeah, and I bet she also doesn't live
on the south side of town,

which is suddenly important.

(ALL LAUGHING)

(SOBBING)

I hate your north side face!

Lois, that's terrible.

My day was even worse.

I got pegged by a new form of spitball.

(MOOS)

(GASPING)

BOY: Hey, get up, you faker.
It's just a spitball.

Hi, family, I'm home.

Chris, there you are.

Good. Now that you're both here,

your father and I have something to say.

Kids, we're calling off
the experiment early.

What? Why?

Because you were right.

Being a kid is a lot harder
than being an adult.

High school sucks. Everything sucks.

So let's just put things back
the way they were,

and just forget all about this, all right?

You kids go back to school.
Lois goes back to groceries.

I go back to my job.

That's not gonna work out, Dad.

Why not?

'Cause you don't have a job anymore.

What? Chris, what do you mean?

Angela fired you and hired me.

She said I've been doing
twice as good a job as you did.

So from now on,
I'm the breadwinner in this house.

Hey, I forget.
Were you in for this or not?

Chris, you are not taking Peter's job.

You're a 14-year-old boy,
and you belong in school.

Why, so I can get a job someday?
I already have a job.

Chris, we're not gonna allow you
to do this.

I seem to remember somebody saying
the breadwinner makes the rules.

Well, I'm the breadwinner.
And you know what?

I like being a grown-up,
and I wanna stay this way!

Well, Lois, practically speaking,

somebody's gotta pay the bills
around here.

Seems like you don't have a choice
but to let Chris work at the brewery

until Peter finds a new job.

Well, I suppose that makes sense.

I guess it could take Peter a long time
to find a job in this economy.

Well, it may not be that bad, Lois.

I could see about getting back my old job
as a police sketch artist.

Now, did you get a look
at the man who assaulted you?

-I did.
-Okay, can I get a description?

Yeah, he was probably around 5'9", 5'10"?

Which is it, 5'9" or 5'10"?

I'd say 5'10".

Okay, we'll go 5'9" and a half.

-And now, how old was he?
-Late 30s, maybe 37.

I don't know, anywhere between 35 and 40.

Okay, well, let's say 37.

-How about ethnicity?
-Yeah, he was Asian-American.

Asian-American. Are we talking Korean?
Are we talking Thai?

Are we talking Vietnamese?

Maybe Korean.

Could have been Japanese,
but I think Korean.

Okay, Korean.

Now how about identifying characteristics?
Any marks, piercings?

He may have had a tattoo.

He may have had a tattoo?
Did have a tattoo? Which one was it?

I don't know. It all happened so fast.

You know what? It's fine.
I have a preliminary sketch here.

Is this the man who assaulted you?

Peter, they're never gonna take you back.

You got fired for racist drawings.

I guess.

Hey, you know what else
I draw really well? Bullwinkle.

I'd probably still be working
if more crooks looked like Bullwinkle.

Early night, Griffin?

Well, actually, it's 8:00.

Well, did you finish
all the accounts payable

and the accounts receivable?

But that's not my department.

It is now.

The company's making cutbacks.

You can handle it.
It's just a little extra paperwork.

(SIGHS) I am exhausted.

(SIGHS) Can this day
get any more stressful?

"Wanted: Muscular man for
discreet pushing and pulling."

Well, I'm not above manual labor.

Oh, hi, Chris. How was your day?

You know what would be great?

If I could come home and have five minutes

before you jump all over my back!

Also, she broke a plate.

And what about you?
Did you get a job today?

(CHUCKLES) I kind of got one.

Right, Lois? Right?

So, Chris, good day at the office?

You know, actually, Angela said that
the spreadsheets I presented

were beyond the projections
for last quarter.

Oh, is that good?

You know what? Never mind!

Now I'm mad at you!

Peter, I'm really worried about Chris.

All this pressure
seems to be getting to him.

I know. He's turning into a jerk.

Oh, hey, Chris.

You wanna keep it down in here?

One of us has to work in the morning!

Chris, have you... Have you been drinking?

Yes. Have you been aging?

I want you two to do it
right in front of me,

and I'm gonna throw 40 bucks
on your sweaty bodies when you're done.

Let's see the money.

Why do you guys hate me?

(EXCLAIMING)
That pain in my stomach is back.

(YELLING IN PAIN)

What? What?

What are you looking at?

I could fight you both.

You don't know
what I go through every day.

(SOBBING)

Now go to sleep, the both of you.

PETER: (WHIMPERING)
I think we should go live with Mom.

STEWIE: I just heard all of that,

and I just wanna say
this family is (BLEEP) disintegrating.

Oh, hey, Chris, by the way,

the roofer came today
while you were at work.

-And?
-It's gonna be five grand to fix it.

Oh, that's just perfect.

I love spending $5,000
on something nobody can see.

Anyone got more happy news?

I'm gonna need a check for the dentist.
Peter has two cavities.

I'll bet if I go upstairs to that bathroom
that toothbrush is as dry as a bone.

Sometimes I forget.

Anything else I should know about?

Well, my science class
is taking a field trip

to the water purification center.

-And?
-And it costs $10 for lunch and the bus.

Ten dollars?

What the hell is it with that school

that every time you walk in there
somebody wants $10?

Look, I'm really sorry,

but if we're that desperate for money,
isn't there something we can do?

I mean, maybe we could ask
to borrow some from Mr. Quagmire.

You'd like that, wouldn't you?

Like to see me walk next door,
hat in hand, and ask him for money.

Bet you'd have your nose pressed
against the glass

to watch that conversation.

No, you know what?

Instead, let's just go knock on
all the doors of all our neighbors

and tell them I'm a failure!

-No, that's not what I...
-No, no, no, it's a good idea!

Let's just go right now and tell everyone
how much of a failure I am.

But I...

(KNOCKING)

-QUAGMIRE: Oh, hey, Chris.
-Meg has something she wants to tell you.

MEG: Chris, please, I'm sorry.
CHRIS: Say it!

MEG: (CRYING) Chris is a failure.

QUAGMIRE: Uh, okay.
CHRIS: Now we're going to the Swansons!

(MEG SOBBING)

(CHRIS GRUNTING)

(YELLING)

Oh, my God!
I think Chris is having a heart attack!

We're not supposed to leave the table.

Be cool, be quiet, be quiet.

All right, well, nothing to worry about.
Chris is going to be just fine.

Oh, Chris, I'm so glad you're okay.

What happened?

You had a heart attack, sweetie.

A heart attack?

Yeah, you almost worked yourself
right into the ground, buddy.

Oh, it's all our fault.

We never should have let you
take on the pressure of being an adult.

It's okay, Mom.

Boy, I thought being a grown-up
would be easier than being a kid,

but it turned out it was just as hard.

I guess what we all learned

is that no matter who you are,
or where you come from,

life is a terrible thing.

Yeah, but if you got your family
to help you get through it,

it's not quite as bad.

And, hey, at least I get my old job back.

You know, from now on,
let's not complain so much.

(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

PETER: Let's not complain.
BRIAN: Let's be grateful, huh?

Hey, what do you guys do
after the screen goes black?

Peter, I need you
to pick up the dry cleaning.

Here's the ticket.
It's the Chinese one over on Elm.

All right. Well, I need my other
white shirt back anyway.

This one's getting kind of smelly.

And if I wore another color,
I think it would just throw people.

You only have two white shirts?

Well, I had a third one,
but it got ruined at that wine tasting

at Michael J. Fox's house.

Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

Now, we were going to show you
the actual scene,

but it would just make us all sad.

So, I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

See, he has this disease,
and it makes him shake a lot,

and what with all the shaking,
he spilled his wine all over my shirt,

and my shirt was ruined.

So, that's what that was.

I mean, he was very nice about it.

He said, "Send me the bill."

I mean, that's not how he said it, but...

You know, we got there.

Anyway, I sent him the bill,
and he sent me this check,

but it's...

I don't think
I'm gonna be able to cash this.

I don't... You'd think Tracy Pollan would
be in charge of the checkbook, you know?

'Cause I mean, what else
is she doing right now?

I don't think he's got the leverage
to Rita Wilson her around town anymore.

I mean, that's...

That's where it's gotten.

So... Anyway,
that's what happened to my shirt.

I'm glad we took
the high road on this one.

What's that?

Oh, wait, now they're telling me
they do want to show it.

I really like the finish on this Shiraz...

Son of a bitch! What is your problem?

Damn! Which one's the Chinese one?

That's probably it.

Every bing-bong two cent!

What you want?

Yeah. I'm here to pick up my cleaning.

Cool, look at that!

This seems like
it'd be a great place to work.

But I... I didn't go to college.

That $20.

Hey, I think you forgot my shirt.

-There no shirt.
-No, I know you have my white shirt.

-Can you check again?
-No need check. I no have your shirt.

Listen here, Washee-Washee,
you do have my shirt.

-I no have your shirt.
-You yes have my shirt!

-You get out my store!
-You get me shirt!

Well, look who's talking!

What do you mean
we can't go there anymore?

Who gives a crap?
We'll get a new cleaners.

-They're all the same.
-They are not all the same!

Peter, I have been going to
Mr. Washee-Washee for 10 years,

and I am not finding another dry cleaner.

Now, we are gonna invite him over for
dinner, and you are going to apologize.

MR. WASHEE-WASHEE:<i> What you having?</i>

-Number 32.
-MR. WASHEE-WASHEE: <i>Ooh!</i>

Peter, isn't there something
you'd like to say to Mr. Washee-Washee?

-(GRUMBLES) No...
-Peter.

Fine! Mr. Washee-Washee,
I am sorry I was rude at your store.

It's okay. I accept your bad apology.

-Good. Now give me back my shirt!
-Peter!

-I no have your shirt!
-You yes have my shirt!

Enough! You all banned
from my store! Bing-bong!

Great, Peter. Nice going.
This dinner was a disaster.

Eh. <i>Clash of the Titans'</i> owl was worse.

So, you're from Greece? I've always
wanted to go there. What's it like?

(WHIRRING)

(MECHANICAL HOOTING)

I can't...
I can't understand a word he's saying.

Yeah, I told you, Lois,
only Harry Hamlin can.

If you're gonna invite the owl,
you gotta invite Harry Hamlin.

I will not have Harry Hamlin
in this house.

413, 413... I think this is it, Chris.

The <i>Mr. Sulu Show!</i>

(TO <i>STAR TREK</i> THEME MUSIC)
<i>Sulu, he star of the show</i>

<i>Other guys just along for the ride</i>

He's got my shirt in there, I can feel it.

All right, I'm going inside.

I knew it!

MR. WASHEE-WASHEE:
Drop it, or I blow you head off!

Listen, Washee-Washee, that's my shirt,
and I ain't leaving here without it.

-That no your shirt!
-Oh, yeah?

Okay, it's not my shirt.

You break in my house,
I can kill you legally.

Fine, shoot me!
But you're gonna ruin the shirt.

Take off shirt!

Well, it seems we're at an impasse.

How do you propose we settle this?

-We have fight. But I pick venue.
-Deal.

-Hi, I'm here for Peter Griffin.
-Wait over there.

Not the best way to spend
a Thursday night, huh?

(SIGHS) You can say that again.

I was hoping to be at
this Democratic Party fundraiser.

Oh, God, is that tonight?

You know, I promised Barry I'd be there.

I call him "Barry,"
you probably know him as "Barack."

Um. Yeah. So, what are you doing here?

I'm picking up my friend Peter.

Are you picking up a boyfriend?

No, actually. I got arrested for
protesting the Walmart opening.

Yeah. I went to the first part of that,
but then some fireworks went off

and I ran for two miles straight.

(LAUGHS)

-I'm Denise.
-I'm Brian.

Hey, would you mind
if I asked for your number?

Who knows?
Maybe we could get arrested together.

(LAUGHING)

Sure. I'd like that.

Number 3287.

Come on, Peter. I'm here to take you home.

I don't know, Brian.

This is the only world I know anymore.

Peter, you've been in there
for 15 minutes.

Good morning, everyone.

Oh, crap, he's in love again.

I know, I know.
But this time it's for real.

You know, I really feel like Denise is
the girl I've waited my whole life for.

Oh, please, you've only known her a week.

Besides, I thought Jillian was
the girl you waited your whole life for.

Well, Jillian was.
But I'll never get her back.

But Denise... I really think
there's something special there.

Brian, you went
to one protest rally with her.

-It's hardly a date.
-Oh, yeah? You want to see?

I'll call her right now
and ask her out to dinner.

Hey, Denise? It's me.

Brian.

-Brian Griffin.
-STEWIE: Oh, boy.

Hey, listen, you know, I've had
such a great time hanging out with you,

and I was thinking...

How about we go on an actual date?

Uh-huh. Sounds great! Bye.

-So?
-Well, guess who has a date on Saturday?

Not me.

(SOBBING)

PETER: Put the dog out. The dog's crying.

Can someone put...
Lois, can someone put the dog out?

I'm trying to read!

(GROANS) What the hell?
What's the matter with you?

Did an ambulance go by or something?

Hey, Brian... Oh, sweet! Morning drinking!

Woo! Yeah! Party!

Peter, I'm not getting drunk for fun.

I'm drinking because I'm sad.

Because I'm never gonna
meet the right woman.

Because I'm...
I'm going to die old and alone.

Oh, you're Rip Torn drinking.

Listen, instead of sitting here
feeling sorry for yourself,

why don't you take Quagmire's class
on picking up chicks?

Quagmire teaches a class?
How come I've never heard about this?

'Cause Quagmire forbids us
to tell you about his life.

As you may recall, he hates you.

Wouldn't help me anyway.
It's a hopeless situation.

If you ever want to
get anywhere with this girl,

you gotta ditch that negative attitude.

You're as bad as Negatron.

Do as I command,

and we will defeat the Autobots
once and for all!

Nope. Not going to work.

Oh, come on. What did we talk about?

Autobots always win.

You think Optimus Prime's gonna be dead,
but then he's not dead.

I'm taking this from a robot
that turns into a canoe?

When there's a battle
on a gently-moving river, you'll want me.

Now, as I said before,
I can't make you into studs.

I can only help you bring out
your "inner stud."

But there's a lot of potential here.

Now how many of you guys think
a woman is looking for Prince Charming?

Wrong! They're looking
for bastards like me!

-Oh, I don't know about that.
-(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

Mort, how many times
you been laid since your wife died?

-Do Muriel's clothes count?
-No!

You wanna know how many times
I've been laid since last night? 60!

Why? 'Cause I'm not trying
to be a girl's Prince Charming.

I'm trying to be that big mistake
they made at the bar last night.

Look, what's the first thing you say
to a woman when you meet her?

"Pleased to meet you.
That's a handsome scarf pin."

No! You say, "Hi, there!

"How's your relationship
with your father?"

If she says anything positive, move along.

Hey. Sorry I'm late.

Brian! What are you doing here?

-I'm in your class.
-What? No way!

-I don't want you in here!
-Too bad. Here's my class receipt.

Now teach me how to find love.

All right. Fine.

But you lick yourself once in this class,
and you're out!

Don't look, don't look!
I spilled something.

All right, time to practice
what we've learned.

You're up, Brian.
Now go hit on that fat chick.

-What? Why?
-Do it or you get an F.

All right.

Excuse me. I was just looking you over,
and I had a question.

Are those highlights in
your hair or potato chips?

-Highlights!
-Okay.

Hey, will you sign this form
that says I hit on you?

Sassy!

You've got me sweating
above and below my ass.

Let's go, lover.

-Okay, what the (BLEEP)?
-I know, I know.

Quagmire told us to dress flashy
so girls would notice us.

Oh, right, peacocking.
How's the class going?

Well, so far so good, I guess.
But tonight's the real test.

I'm gonna try out
what I've learned on Denise.

Well, good luck.

Hey, who was that fat chick
sneaking out of here this morning?

Oh, that was someone
I met from class. Bettina.

Ooh, that's way too fancy a name for her.

Her name should be "Thud" or "Oof."

You know, I have to admit, Brian,
I'm glad you called.

-I sort of missed hanging out.
-Call me The Paw.

That's what I go by now, The Paw.

-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

A lot of babes here tonight.

Shut up for a couple of minutes,
I'm gonna look around.

Uh, Brian, you're being
kind of disrespectful.

Relax, baby.

Hey, check your phone.
I sent you something.

(GASPS) Oh, my God! Is that your...

Yeah. How'd you like to
get hit in the face with that?

Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go.

Why, you getting more moles put on?

You know, I came here 'cause I thought I'd
made a mistake by not giving you a chance,

but it's obvious
you're just another typical jerk.

Denise, wait...

All right, let's see what
you guys have done

to make yourselves look like douchebags.

You're a son of a bitch.

You're teaching us all this crap
about how to get women,

and it's all a bunch of bull!

I came here 'cause
I wanted to get Denise back

and instead, you ruined my life!

These skills aren't for women
you care about, you idiot.

This course is in getting laid,
not finding love.

So, what's the point?

If you never find love,
then it's just meaningless sex.

How will I get the woman of my dreams?

Only when you're ready.
And maybe not even then.

You see, women are a lot like
<i>Saturday Night Live</i> sketches.

Lots of them are awful, some are decent,
and a few are pretty good.

But then there's that one...
That one woman

who's as amazingly perfect
as "Massive Head Wound Harry."

For me, that woman is Cheryl Tiegs.

You'd never fall for these tricks.

That's why I keep trying to figure out
how to bring you back into my life,

so we can make it work.

I still remember the day we met.

Hey-o! Look at the man on the unicycle.

Look at the man on the unicycle
with a parrot on his shoulder.

Hey-o! Put five cents in the hat.

That's quite a skill you've got there.

Well, ever since I got
discharged from the Navy,

I do anything I can to make money.

I'm thinking about getting
my pilot's license.

Well, I think unicycles are sexy.

Glenn, these past few weeks
have been amazing.

I think I'm falling in love with you.

I know. I feel the same way.

If this is the kind of joy
the '80s has in store for me, I'm ready.

QUAGMIRE: <i>But that wasn't the case.</i>

<i>In fact, things went wrong real fast.</i>

Cheryl, don't you think
it's time for us to go now?

Why? We just got here.
I'm having a good time.

Yeah, I can tell. You've been talking
to John Davidson for half an hour.

Hey, Glenn, great to meet you.

John Davidson, host of <i>That's Incredible!</i>

Oh, hey, John. I like your work... Not!

QUAGMIRE: <i>That was the first time</i>
<i>anybody ever used that.</i>

<i>First time, I swear to God.</i>

Glenn, I've about had it
with your petty jealousy.

I'm starting to think
this relationship is a mistake.

Well, maybe it is.

Wow, did you just break up
with Cheryl Tiegs?

I sure did.

What do you think of that, folks?

That's incredible!

Someday... Someday we'll make it right.

You shouldn't have
tried these tricks on Denise, Brian.

But if you ask me, she got lucky,

because now she's dodged the bullet

of being in a relationship
with a loser like you.

Well, you just think
you know everything, don't you?

You're like a black woman in hindsight.

I told you. What did I tell you?

Didn't I tell you? 'Cause I told you.

Mmm-hmm. And when did I tell you?

A long time ago.

And what did I say
would happen when I told you?

Exactly what just happened.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

(STAMMERING) Are you... Cheryl?

-Hi, Glenn.
-Oh, my God.

Cheryl, what are you doing here?

Well, you know, it's been so many years,
and I was in the neighborhood,

and I thought I'd just drop by and say hi.

My new boyfriend I guess knows you,
and told me where you live.

(CAR HORN HONKS)

Hey, Cheryl, get your fat ass
over here before I dump you.

(CHUCKLING) He's so bossy. I love it.

Well, it was great seeing you, Glenn.

(LAUGHING)

(LOUD POUNDING)

QUAGMIRE:
Where is he? Where's that son of a bitch?

Whoa, whoa! What's going on, Quagmire?

You dirty bastard.
I always knew you were low,

but you're nothing more than
a back-stabbing, junkyard cur.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell, man?

My whole life's been
dedicated to Cheryl Tiegs!

-Yeah, I know. So what?
-Your dog is dating her!

No way. You're banging Cheryl Tiegs?

-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

Light the beacons.

(FANFARE PLAYING)

Cheryl Tiegs. Nice.

-I really like this restaurant.
-You seem to like everything.

-Brian, you're acting a little distant.
-Yeah, get whatever you want.

Oh, hey, guys,
fancy me running into you here.

Oh, hey, Quagmire.

Listen, Brian, I've been a real heel,

and I'd like to make it up to you.

Oh, well, that's very kind of you,
but there's no need.

No, no, I want to. I want to.

In fact, you know,
since you guys are already here,

I'd like to treat
the four of us to dinner.

Well, sure, I... Wait, who's the fourth?

Oh, my new girlfriend. Here she is.

-Jillian?
-Hi, Brian. How are you?

Oh, he's doing great.
Isn't that right, pal?

Guy looks like a million bucks,
all green and wrinkly, right?

Oh, get in here.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Okay, let's have dinner, huh?

So, how did you guys get together?

Um, he showed up at my door

and said he was a Federal Boob Inspector.

And I was gonna tell him to go away,
but he had a warrant.

It was a Snickers wrapper, Brian.
I held up a Snickers wrapper.

But then he started saying things to me

that my father might say
if he were still alive,

and I knew I liked him.

Well, I guess you guys have
gotten pretty close, huh?

Did Quagmire ever tell you
he was obese as a child?

Did Brian ever tell you he once had a tick

on the back of his neck
that he couldn't reach with his mouth,

and it swelled up to
the size of a Ping-Pong ball?

Well, it was still smaller than that thing
you had on your lip for three years.

Oh, three years? You mean like

the three years you have left
on this planet?

Oh, that's nice.

Hey, if you guys are so close,
maybe Jillian should know

that you teach a class
in picking up women.

And Cheryl should know
that you took that class.

Does Jillian know you're
half-Polish, Mr. Quagglecheck?

You son of a bitch!

(SNARLING)

Enough. Stop it, both of you.

You obviously have no respect
for either of us.

Yeah, you're acting all mean.

Now I'm glad you made me
face away during sex.

Maybe you boys
will get it together someday,

but it looks like
that's all you are. Boys.

Yeah. Boys.

Yay, I helped.

-Cheryl, wait.
-Jillian.

I'm sorry. I'll do anything, please!

-Meg?
-Yeah, this still happens sometimes.

Hey.

-You okay?
-Yep.

Just waiting for my car.

Look, I'm sorry I did what I did.

Cheryl's great, and I hope
someday you get the chance to be with her.

No. I'm never gonna get that chance again.

I blew it for good, Brian.

And you know what? I deserve to be lonely.

I'm no saint.
I dated Jillian just to hurt you.

It's okay.

It probably wouldn't have worked out,
like everything else.

Hey, you know, maybe it took us
stealing each other's girls

-to finally become friends.
-Yeah, maybe.

Oh, hey, listen, Cheryl actually drove me,

and I spent all my cash in the restaurant,
even though you said you'd pay.

So, would you mind
giving me a lift home, buddy?

Hi, Peter.

Who is this? How do you know my name?

Give me back my son!

Peter, it's Carol, your sister-in-law.

Carol, how the hell are you?

Not too good. Jason left me.

It's gonna be my ninth divorce.

You know, just hanging out.

Peter, give me the phone.

Carol, hi. What's up?

Oh, my God, that's terrible.

Well, you know, Carol, sweetie,
we are always here for you.

Boy, Carol's lucky
to have a sister like Lois.

You're telling me.

I always wanted a brother or sister,
but instead I got a bro-ster.

Hey, Peter, you want to see my peginas?

Uh...

(STAMMERING) I don't know.

I'm just saying that if you read somewhere
that Gwen Stefani was a grandmother,

you might not even bat an eye.

What the devil? What's going on?

I'm sorry, Stewie.

Your Aunt Carol's gonna be staying with us
for a little while,

so she's gonna need your room.

Who the hell do you think you are?
Stop it this instant!

We're not gonna fit through there.

Only circles can fit through
that rectangular doorway.

Oh, my God, it's going right through.

I got to get better at shapes.

Hey, Stewie.
You gonna sleep in here with us?

Is this how you spend
your free time, fat-ass?

Lying half-naked on a bed in black socks
at 11:30 in the morning?

You want to play
with one of Daddy's socks?

What... Do I want to...
No! What an odd request.

There we go.

The second one's easier, 'cause, toes.

Come on, fella.

That's it.

(SCREAMING)

Carol, you're here.

Hi, Lois.

It's so wonderful to see you.

QUAGMIRE:
Hey, need some help with those bags?

Well, yes. Thank you so much.

Oh, it's my pleasure,
Lois' recently divorced sister.

When I heard you were coming to town,
I figured I should introduce myself.

How you doing?

Well, not so good.

You may have heard
that my husband left me.

I'm so depressed.

I mean,
it can't always be my fault, right?

Uh-huh.

You know, at first I thought

what I needed was the immediate loving,
physical touch of a new man.

Yeah.

But now I know what I really need
is a friend

to just sit and listen to my problems.

-I don't think that's too much to ask.
-No.

I mean, how come men always feel
like they can just use a woman?

-You know?
-Yeah.

I mean, we have feelings.

-We're people.
-Right.

It's like they all have the same mindset.

-It's all about sex, sex, sex.
-Yeah.

And there's so much more to life
than that.

Twenty feet that way, please.

Oh, it's so great to see you kids.

Here, I brought you all gifts from Texas.

Meg, this is a bar of soap
with a scorpion in it.

Stewie, this is a lollipop
with a desert spider in it.

And, Chris, this is a comb
made out of an armadillo shell.

Now, just don't use it to comb your hair

and make promises to women you won't keep.

I probably just won't use it.

Well, if you all don't mind,

I'm gonna freshen up before dinner.

Mom, she's so sad and lonely.

Look who the (BLEEP) talking.

I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It's just that she's my sister.

No wonder her husbands all left her.

Well, that's what her problem is.

She has such low self-esteem
that every time a man shows her

the slightest glimmer of attention,

she rushes into something serious

and gets her heart broken
like a teenage girl.

Hey, Tyler, you on your way to Algebra?

Yeah, I'll see you there.

You can't imagine how it feels
to have your heart broken so many times.

Aunt Carol, Mom says
you'd make a great Florida whore.

What does that mean?

Chris, I said that about Kate Hudson.

You know, I always thought
I'd be a good Florida whore.

Thanks to you,
my hair stays like this when we stop.

Mayor West? What are you doing here?

I'm being a rascal

and ringing people's doorbells
and running away.

Then what are you still doing here?

It's my first house.
I'm not very good at this.

Hello.

Well, dot, dot, dot, hello.

Lois, aren't you going to introduce me
to your handsome friend?

Handsome?

(SPUTTERING GIBBERISH)

Wow!

Oh, sure.

Carol, this is our town's mayor,
Adam West.

Mayor West, this is my sister, Carol.

Well, hubba-hubba, ding-ding,
who invented this thing?

(LAUGHING)

I bet you say that to all the girls.

Only the ones I'm about to ask
to Friendly's for a Fribble.

Well, I don't really have any plans
this afternoon.

Carol, given your present situation,

it's possible that dating
might not be such a good idea right now.

Actually, Lois,
I think it's exactly what I need.

Hooray, it's a date!

But we mustn't let
the local nobleman find out.

Otherwise, he'll assert
his right of primae noctis.

Oh, no, we're too late.

(LAUGHING)

I must bless this coupling
with my soggy English penis.

CAROL: Oh, no! Oh, my!

Come hither,
that I may sire thee a dreary Brit!

You ever wonder
what a seagull tastes like?

You know, I actually have.

I used to wonder, but now I know.

And it's not good.

It's great!

Wow, Adam. I just have to tell you,
I'm having a terrific time.

Me, too, Carol.

That was a great idea you had,
about walking parallel to the water.

It makes for a longer walk.

See? We're already making each other
better people.

Carol, I wanna make this
a night you'll never forget.

-Oh, my.
-Right?

Oh, by the way,
I should tell you I've got AIDS.

What?

Yeah, they're right over there
waiting for me.

Ready to go when you are, sir!

Poor guys, they both have AIDS.

Not okay!

(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

Now let's hear your fake laugh.

How was your date, you guys?

Oh, Lois, it was wonderful.
I wish it didn't have to end.

Well, it's not over yet.

What do you mean?

You're right, Carol.
It was a wonderful date.

And I want to have a million more,

every night of the week
for the rest of my life.

Carol Yastrzemski,
oh, please let that be your last name,

-will you marry me?
-What?

Oh, Adam. Yes, yes! Adam, I will!

Carol, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

You can't just jump right back into...

Lois, this is my life.
And this is what I want.

I will marry you, Mayor Adam West!

Oh, great!

I can't wait to tell
the gals at my singles group.

Oh, come on. This is the goal, isn't it?

Carol, I'm really not sure

you should be rushing
into another marriage right now.

Well, Lois, I appreciate your input,

but I'm capable
of making my own decisions.

Are you sure?

I mean, look at your track record.
Nine divorces!

Do you really enjoy being
Carol Pewterschmidt-Johnson-

Carrington-Stone-O'Craggity-
Canseco-Shteinholtz-

Washington-Proudfoot-Fong?

Look, I know I have a bit
of a checkered past,

but I believe in love at first sight.

Hey, Lois, I didn't flush.
I want you to come see it.

Looks like the Starbucks mermaid.

Peter, Carol is marrying Mayor West.

-You serious?
-That's right, Peter.

Say hello to your future brother-in-law.

Brother?

I don't know those other two words,
but brother?

I'm gonna have a brother?

Well, what we're discussing
is whether or not marriage

is a smart move for Carol
at this point in time.

I was hoping
you might be able to weigh in.

I'm gonna have a brother!

Hey, Adam, want to go get in a fight
over the rules of a game we made up?

Yep!

-PETER: Five points. I win.
-WEST: That's not fair.

You weren't touching the bush.

PETER: I was too touching the...
Cool, this rock has mica.

WEST: Let me see!

PETER: Don't touch it. It's worth money!

-I didn't know you rode bikes.
-I didn't know you rode bikes.

Let's go butts-up and fast.

Oh, no! Patch of sand.

(EXCLAIMING)

Oh, my God! Are you all right?

I'm fine. Let's just keep riding bikes.

Are you sure? That was a wicked wipeout.

I'm fine.
Can we just keep riding bikes, please?

Thanks for coming to dinner, Lois.
I know you have mixed feelings about this.

I was worried you'd say no.

Actually, I was worried
you'd say "Beetlejuice" three times.

'Cause if you say
"Beetlejuice" three times, then...

That was a close call.

Oh, Carol.

I would never miss any
of your meet-the-fianc√© dinners.

This is the 10th one.

Oh, Lois.

Look, Carol, I'm just saying
it's a big decision.

Life is full of big decisions.

Like deciding whether or not
you're going to have time to masturbate.

Peter, I'm gonna run and pick up Stewie.
I'll be back in five or ten minutes.

Well, which is it?

It's like I told you, Lois.
This time it's different.

Adam is the most kind and attentive man
I've ever known.

Oh, that's interesting.

'Cause I remember you saying
the same exact thing about Evan.

Isn't that right, Evan?

Yeah, yeah, I do remember her
saying that about me.

Evan. What are you doing here?

I brought him.

Lois, you didn't tell me
you were bringing Evan here.

We bonded over the Red Sox one time,

and now he's got to bring it up
every time I see him.

How about those Red Sox, Peter?

Yeah, how about 'em, Evan? They exist.

-How about last season, huh?
-Yep.

-How about next season?
-We'll see.

(CHUCKLING) I'm gonna hold you to that.

Look, I see
what you're trying to do, Lois.

And then there was
your second husband, Randall,

who you called your soul mate.

Oh, God, not that guy.

He always comes bearing
really inconvenient gifts.

Hey, you guys.

Peter, I brought you
some saltwater tropical fish.

Now, you got to feed them every two
hours, and I fed them an hour ago.

-All right. You got the food?
-No, I don't have the food.

You get that at a tropical fish store.

It's 9:30 at night.

Well, you better get going.

Son of a bitch!

And then there was
your third husband, Doggie Daddy,

but you couldn't make it work

'cause he had that son
from a previous marriage.

-Heya, Carol.
-Oh. Hey.

Just want to let you know,

Augie's all grown up now out of the house.

So... You know...

Anyway, I'm around.

This is really insensitive of you, Lois.

Do you have any idea how difficult it is
for me to see my ex-husbands?

That's my point, Carol.

This is the kind of pain
I'm trying to spare you

from experiencing all over again.

Why can't you just let me be happy
with the man I love?

Carol, if you marry him,
you're just gonna get hurt again.

Is that what you want?

Well, no.

Look at these men.

Are you psychologically able
to deal with this pain a 10th time?

Oh, my God.

Lois, you're right.

Adam, I'm sorry. I can't marry you.

What? But, Carol...

I'm so sorry, Adam.

(SOBBING)

(SOBBING)

I think you should go now, Lois.

I can't. My husband took the car.

(KNOCKING)

No, yeah. No, I know it's late.
I just need some tropical fish food.

Come on. Where the hell
am I supposed to go? You're in there!

Don't worry, fish.
I'm gonna take care of you,

'cause I know one day
you'll do the same for me.

I'm sorry, but your friend
doesn't have insurance.

I don't care what it costs.
Just make this man well again.

Thank you, fish.

How you holding up, Carol?

Not so good.

Look, I know you're depressed
about Mayor West,

but I promise you made the right decision.

Just give yourself some time,

and I'm sure you'll feel much better
about it.

STEWIE: (DISTANTLY) She says that
to Meg a lot, so that's not good.

You're probably right.

(SIGHING) Oh, well.

I guess
I just better go call all my friends

and tell them the wedding is off.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, hi, Mayor West.

Hi, Lois.

I just wanted to return Peter's BeDazzler.

Tell him I never even opened the box.

Wait, Mayor West.

Okay, I might have opened the box.

But listen, could you also say goodbye
to Carol for me?

Goodbye? Where are you going?

As of today, I'm stepping down as mayor
and leaving Quahog forever.

-Because of Carol?
-That's right.

I've decided to move to Alaska
and become an Eskimo.

Alaska? But that's so far away!

And the summers are so short.

-Yay!
-Summer's here!

-Awesome!
-(WIND GUSTING)

-Best summer ever.
-Let's stay friends.

-I lost my virginity.
-Yeah, right. To who?

You don't know her. I met her at camp.

-Peter, what are you doing?
-I'm running away.

-Why?
-Because you took away my brother!

You ruined my life!

Adam and I were gonna be brothers forever,

and now he's gone!

All you got there is toys
and cans of tuna fish.

Well, I got to eat. And I got to have fun.

-Peter, you're just acting out.
-No, I'm not. I'm acting in.

Okay, now you're just saying
the opposite of what I say.

No, I'm not.
I'm saying the same as what you say.

-Peter.
-Lois.

-God.
-Allah.

Look, I'm not sacrificing
my sister's happiness

so you can have a playmate.

She and Mayor West never would've made it.

Oh, yeah? Well, nobody believed
we'd make it, and look at us now.

I drink, and you use sex as a weapon.

That seems to me like
a successful New England marriage.

Oh, come on, Peter.

My parents may have been
against our relationship,

but a lot of people supported us.

-Oh, yeah? Like who?
-Well, like... Like Carol.

God, if it wasn't for her support,

I don't know that I would've had
the confidence to marry you.

And now that she needs my support,
here I am abandoning her.

(GASPING) Oh, my God.
Peter, I've made a terrible mistake.

Well, that's what I tried to tell you,

but you were as stubborn
as a pigeon at an ad agency.

(CHATTERING INDISCERNIBLY)

Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,
these are all good ideas,

but I think what people
really get excited about

is dropped museum popcorn.

But this is an ad campaign
for a Nissan SUV.

-How does that possibly...
-Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil.

I was put in charge of this meeting.

And we're going with
dropped museum popcorn.

I'd like one ticket to Alaska, please.
One-way.

(SIGHING)

Has the 4:10 flight to Alaska left yet?

I'm afraid so. That's it right there.

Oh, no, we're too late.

I'm sorry, Carol.

But if it helps, you're not
the first person to get a bum deal.

Mr. Edison, we're going to use
your invention to power the world.

And, Mr. Tesla, we're going to use yours
in the background of Frankenstein movies.

Aw! I wanted that one.

I am so sorry, you guys.
This is all my fault.

It's okay, Lois.

I know you tried your best
to make things right.

Well, since I ain't got no brother
to play army guys with,

I might as well go to The Clam.

Hey, Quagmire, it's me.
Meet me at The Clam in 20.

<i>That sounds great, Peter,</i>
<i>but I can't right now.</i>

Crap. Why not?

'Cause I'm working.
I'm flying a plane to Alaska.

Alaska? What the hell?

I never even heard of this place
an hour ago,

and now everybody's flying there.

-What did you say?
-Quagmire's flying to Alaska?

Peter, that's the plane Mayor West is on!

I get what you're driving at.

If Carol can't have Mayor West,
no one can.

Quagmire, I want you to crash that plane.
No survivors, you hear me?

Peter, for God sakes, no!

-Tell him to turn the plane around.
-Hey, listen, Quagmire,

turn the plane around
and bring it back here.

Peter, I can't do that.
The FAA would be all over my ass.

Hey, Quagmire, you know that stray cat
we got in our neighborhood?

-The pregnant one?
-Yep, she's having her kittens right now.

(GASPING) Oh, no way.

Yeah, making all those high-pitched
"mew mew" noises and everything.

I love them already.

Yeah, but Brian's been eyeing them
pretty good.

-What?
-Yeah, and I got to go to work now.

So I hope he's not, like,
hungry or nothing.

This is your captain speaking.
We've discovered a shoe bomb on board.

We're gonna have to return
to the terminal.

Hello, Alaska!

Adam!

Carol?

I don't know what I was thinking.

I made nine mistakes,

and I was afraid that
I was gonna make another one.

And you know what? I almost did.

Adam, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

Oh, Carol, nothing would make me happier.

Hey, when it's your turn to say "I do,"
you should say, "I do the Dew."

And then we both pull out a Mountain Dew,

and then I do, like,
a radical skateboard jump off the altar.

Well, obviously, yeah.

<i>(BRIDAL CHORUS</i> PLAYING)

Good luck. I hope you like weird boobs.

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

The bride and groom
have written their own vows.

Adam, from the first day I met you,

I knew that we were meant to be together.

I know I've said that before,
a lot of times,

-and it's always blown up in my face.
-QUAGMIRE: Giggity.

But this time it's different.
I know it's gonna work.

I love you.
And I'll be proud to be your wife.

That was lovely. Adam?

"Milk. Butter. Cat food.

"Those new potato chips
in the snack aisle.

"Beer. Deodorant.
Garbage bags. Toothpaste."

Adam, I think that's your shopping list.

No. These are my vows.

They're all the reasons
why I'll always love you.

Oh, Adam.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

Peter, I'm so happy for the both of them.

Hey, I just realized I have a sister.

-I'm just gonna look at something.

PETER: (WITH MOUTH FULL) Oh!

What a very interesting thing.

Brian, can I give you money
and you write me a check

so I can order something
from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?

What do you want to order?
Oh, wait, let me guess. Him.

(LAUGHING) He got you, Stewie!

Well, um, if it were you,

you would take the magazine
and you'd put it on the floor

and pee on it,
'cause you're a dog and you're stupid,

and you have a weird toenail
halfway up your elbow.

Nice comeback.

Jeez, that one was all over the place.

I should have been quicker than that.

I should've said, "Really?
Why would I order your ex-boyfriend?"

-And then I'd go like this.

Stewie, what the hell did your machine do?

Just calm down, calm down, Brian.
I've got the return pad.

All right, step on.

-What happened?
-Good Lord!

-This is impossible!
-What?

Well, the return pad works
by first locking on to our coordinates

along the curve
of the space-time continuum.

-But it can't.
-Why not?

Well, the only explanation is

we've somehow been transported
outside the space-time continuum.

(STAMMERING) I don't understand.

Non-existence. No past, no future.
No universe.

But still somehow a large,
brightly-colored promo

for <i>The Cleveland Show.</i>

Hey, y'all, it's <i>The Cleveland Show!</i>

Huh. That's weird. Black guys
usually don't promote themselves.

Come on, Stewie, can you fix
that damn thing or not?

Well, it's not broken, Brian.

It operates according
to the laws of physics,

but we're outside
the space-time continuum,

so there are no laws of physics. Watch.

-How the hell did you do that?
-No laws of physics, Brian.

We create our own physics.
See, watch this.

they would say, "That was good.
You guys should do that more."

Oh, yeah, they totally would, but look,
I still want to go home, Stewie.

How do we get out of here?

Well, if I overload the return pad's
reactor, it might release enough energy

to blow us back into the universe,
but it's too risky.

But it could get us home.

Well, maybe, but it'll break my thing.

And if I overload that reactor,
we could both die.

Well, you at least have to try.

And if you don't, I am gonna

Oh, man.

What? What's the joke?

-What? What is it?
-(CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

You can't say that! But it got said!

What? What? By who?

All right, fine, fine!
I'll try it, you bastard!

Now step onto the return pad.

Now brace yourself.

Hopefully, the explosion will propel us
into reality.

(BEEPS)

(MACHINE ZAPPING)

-We made it.
-Yeah, we made it.

-Okay, now tell me the joke.
-Oh, it's nothing really.

It's just this bit about
a Planned Parenthood clinic on Halloween.

Next.

Brian, I am about to show you something
that's gonna blow your mind!

Do you know what the big bang theory is?

Yeah, the theory that the universe started
with a massive outward explosion

from a singularity of infinite mass
and infinite density.

Check out the big brain on Brian. Good.

Now take a look.

The universe's cosmic
background radiation,

a kind of echo of the big bang,

precisely matches the energy spectrum
of my return pad.

What does that mean?

It means my return pad's
explosion was the big bang.

But the big bang happened, like,
billions of years ago.

No, no, we were outside
the space-time continuum.

Time and space didn't exist
until my explosion.

Which means I created the universe, Brian.

(SCOFFS) That doesn't make any sense.

You were born in the universe.
How could you create it?

It's called a temporal causality loop.

The universe created me,
so I could create it,

so it could create me and so on.

That's... That's the most incredible thing
I've ever heard.

So, wait, that means
that I kind of created the universe, too.

(CHUCKLING) No, no, no, no.

You're sort of the Art Garfunkel
of the universe.

Hey, Lois, check out what I spelled
with my Alpha-Bits.

-(GIGGLING) Oh, my God.
-Yeah! Now watch.

(GIGGLING)

Maybe later you'll want
the real thing, huh?

(BOTH GIGGLING)

I prefer the Alpha-Bits.

Well, I'm off to the farmers' market.

I've gotta pick up some plutonium
for a new return pad.

In case I decide to make
another universe later.

Plutonium at the farmers' market?

Yeah, I'm only using
organic plutonium now.

Think globally, buy locally.

Hey, slut, get me out of this.

-Hello there, Yusuf.
-Hey, Stewie! What can I get you?

Just a little of the good stuff
for a new time machine return pad.

Coming right up.

So, how's the whole terrorism thing going?

Well, the good news is
my son died in a car bombing.

The bad news is he borrowed my car!

(PLAYING MELODY)

(GIGGLING)

Oh, God!

Oh, that's the other reason I come here.

-Come on!
-Oh, sorry!

So, Stewie Griffin
invented a time machine.

(GASPS) Bertram!

Hello, Stewie.

You don't realize it yet,
but your life is about to cease to exist.

What are you talking about?

I am gonna kill one of your ancestors,
effectively erasing you from history!

Here! Play with this!

At least you can spend your final moments
doing something you enjoy.

You know, it's funny, I had actually
stopped playing with that toy,

but now that I see you with it,
I kind of want to play with it again.

(GIGGLING)
Look at me! I'm mowing the lawn!

(DOOR CLOSES)

-What the hell's all that noise?
-Brian, it was Bertram!

He's gone into the past,
and he claims he's going to...

(RUMBLING)

Stewie, what's going on?

(RUMBLING CONTINUES)

(GASPS) Peter, what was that?

Quick, Brian, into the time machine!

Stewie, what the hell was that?

Those were ripples in time, Brian,
emanating from some point in the past.

And there's only one explanation.

Bertram told me he planned to kill
one of my ancestors.

He must have succeeded,

thereby changing the past and erasing me.

-But what has that got to do with...
-I created the universe, Brian!

Bertram didn't know
that by removing me from history,

I wouldn't be there to be
accidentally thrown outside the universe

and subsequently create it.

So the universe never existed!

Well, we have to stop him!

Yes. Unfortunately,
Bertram took the return pad with him,

-so we'll only get one shot at this.
-(BUTTONS BEEPING)

Ah! Here it is.

Now, we'll have to travel back in time to
a point shortly before Bertram's arrival.

Get ready, Brian.

(BEEPS)

How long until Bertram arrives?

I can't be certain,
but I'd say about 15 minutes.

Where do you think we are?

I don't know. Looks like the Renaissance.

It does.

This doesn't count as our trip to Italy.

Brian, look! There's the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

And it's unfinished!

We must be in Leonardo da Vinci's studio.

Quick! Someone's coming!

(GASPS) That must be Leonardo da Vinci.
Stewie, he looks just like you.

Da Vinci must be my ancestor. Good Lord!

That's who Bertram's here to kill!

So that means you're Italian.

Of course! My love for SpaghettiOs
and smoking on the toilet.

It all makes sense.

Ew!

My God, da Vinci is your ancestor.

But why would Bertram
go back this far to get rid of you?

Ah, you're forgetting I initially
encountered Bertram as a sperm

in one of the fat man's balls,

so he couldn't get rid of the fat man

or any recent ancestor
on my father's side.

Bertram had to go back enough generations

to make sure he was snuffing out
the ancestral source of my genius

without affecting his own.

And apparently, it's Leonardo da Vinci.

DA VINCI: Boy, I'm sick of the pizza.

Well, we've gotta stop Bertram.
What are we gonna do?

Don't worry, Brian,
I'll come up with something.

Remember, I'm a genius.
Like Thomas Edison.

-Thomas, what are you doing?
-Experimenting.

(LOUD ZAPPING)

Brian, look!

<i>Mamma mia!</i> What is this?

Leonardo da Vinci, I presume.

Who are you, little lisping baby?

Your assassin, you overrated caricaturist!

-(GASPS) Stewie!
-That's my name, don't wear it out.

(GIGGLING)

See, that's brand new to him.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(METALLIC SQUEAKING)

-Ayyy!
-Ayyy!

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

You're about to be yesterday's
hopscotch chalk on a sidewalk, Stewie!

Erased!

Yeah, no, I got the metaphor,
but, Bertram,

if you erase me,
you'll destroy the universe!

What are you talking about?

Listen to him, Bertram! It's true!

Brian and I were trapped outside
the space-time continuum,

and the only way for us to get back
was to overload my old return pad.

The resulting explosion was the big bang.

So if you kill me, you're killing yourself

and everything else
that ever existed or will exist.

Worth it!

(GROANING)

You fool!

(GRUNTING)

(EXCLAIMS)

(GRUNTING)

Hey, Bertram, what's your
favorite kind of bottled water?

Huh?

Mine's Arrowhead.

(WAILING)

Wow, that was dramatic.

My God, he's really dead.

-This is it.
-Yeah.

But why hasn't the universe
ceased to exist?

I don't know.

Unless there's still a chance
of me being born.

But da Vinci is dead.

Yes, but we're still here.

So I must have done, or will do,
something that will save the universe.

If I can just figure out what that is...

Ugh, Bertram just voided his bowels.

That's it! The genetic material
needed for my creation is inside me.

So I'll take da Vinci's place
and pass it on.

-Wait, how did you get that from "bowels"?
-Huh?

I'm just wondering how you got that
from... You know what? I don't care.

Will that work, though?
You taking da Vinci's place?

Only one way to find out.

All right, I'm going to send you back

five minutes after we disappeared
in the time machine.

If all goes well,
the universe should be intact this time.

Good luck, old friend.

Hopefully, I'll be leaving you a future
to return to.

I'm gonna miss you, Stewie. Good luck.

(MACHINE BEEPS)

You did it, Stewie. You did it.

(SIGHS)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Uh, can I help you?

-Are you Brian Griffin?
-Yes.

I'm from the Vatican, and this is for you.

What is it?

The Vatican has been holding this note
for you for about 500 years.

It was left to us
by Leonardo da Vinci himself,

with instructions that
it be delivered to you

on this exact date at this exact time.

STEWIE: <i>Dear Brian,</i>
<i>it's been a week since you left,</i>

<i>and I'm pretty sure I've set things right.</i>

<i>So I've built a cryogenic stasis device</i>
<i>and am placing myself inside it,</i>

<i>leaving instructions for it to be buried</i>
<i>in very specific coordinates</i>

<i>in what will be future Quahog.</i>

<i>If everything goes according to plan,</i>

<i>I will have spent the next 500 years</i>
<i>buried beneath our basement.</i>

Oh, my God!

(CLEARS THROAT) A tip is customary!

(METALLIC THUD)

Stewie!

Stewie! Stewie, you okay?

You gotta kiss him to wake him up.

What? I'm not gonna kiss you.

Stewie can't hear you. He's not awake.
Only a kiss will wake him up.

Well, I better get Meg.

Oh. Oh. Where am I?

Stewie, what the hell happened?

Oh, well, shortly after you left,
da Vinci's girlfriend showed up,

-so I injected her with my DNA.
-You had sex?

-No, I put my DNA inside her.
-Right. You had sex.

No, what are you not getting?
I put a sample of my DNA in a syringe

and I injected her on the staircase,
the couch and the balcony.

-Well, whatever the case, thank God.
-Yeah, I know.

Oh, hey, I brought you something
from da Vinci's workshop.

A candle? I can get a candle now.

You couldn't have grabbed me
one of his original notebooks?

You know, I didn't have to
bring you back anything.

It's almost like you didn't.

I mean, who's going to put
those three magazines in a neat stack

on the coffee table?

Lois, I realize you're excited
about going away with Bonnie and all,

but could I not have to hear about
the trip when you get back?

I know you're going to have pictures
and stories,

and I just don't want to be
involved in any of that mess.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

-You ready to go, Lois?
-I sure am.

Oh, my God, Bonnie.
We're going to have such a good time.

I know, and it's going to be
so much fun going with you.

Joe hates to fly

Okay. Bye, everyone.

-Bye, Mom.
-Bye!

Oh, Peter, I almost forgot.

Here's some money for groceries

The fat man in charge for a week?
He's going to be in over his head.

Like when he was a boxing coach.

Punch him! Punch him again! Punch him!

Punch him now! Again!
Now you're getting punched!

Punch back! Don't let him hit you!
Get out of the way! Punch him!

You know what I'm going to tell you.

-I got to punch him...
-You got to punch him more.

-Hey, you ever check Joe's Facebook?

"Hitting Cheesecake Factory again.

What? What are you talking about?

I'm talking about homeschooling, Brian.
Just until the crisis is over.

Peter, that's a complete overreaction.

I don't think Lois would be happy
if you pulled the kids out of school.

Well, she left me in charge, didn't she?
And besides, you know me.

When I set my mind to something,
I am not easily deterred.

when I assigned you lab partners.

It has come to my attention
that this is an English class.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)

Griffin?

Chris, Meg, I spoke to
your father on the phone,

and he said you needed to
be removed from school.

I didn't believe it was really him at
first, but then I received another call

from the very person who I thought
was pretending to be him.

It caused quite a stir in my office.

Come on, children.

-Is everything all right?
-Everything's fine. It's me.

I just dressed up like your father

to jazz your teachers
and get you out of here.

-What do you mean?
-I'm taking you out of here.

That place is riddled with goat flu,
so I'm gonna home school you kids.

Oh, okay.

-Dad, where'd you get this car?
-I borrowed it from Quagmire.

He's not home 'cause he got abducted
by aliens last night.

So, do you guys just not do
the anal probe anymore?

-Is that...
-No, that's more or less been retired.

I see, I see.

Do you still have the thing?

Oh, my God, what a beautiful room.

Paris is so incredible.
I can't believe we're really here.

I know.

Look at all the people on the street.

Not a lot of people of color here, but
the ones that are black are really black.

I've noticed that, too.

All right, I've got our whole day planned.
First, we'll go to the Louvre.

Then, we'll go shopping
along the Champs-√âlys√©es.

Uh, Lois, I should probably tell you,

I didn't come all the way here
to go to museums and shops.

(STAMMERING) Well, I don't understand.
Why'd you even want to come here, then?

Lois, I came here to have an affair.

An affair? With who?

-Anyone.
-My God.

Well, can we at least do some Muppet-style
sightseeing first?

All right, settle down.

-Good morning, class.
-Morning, Dad.

We're going to need
a few things for this class,

an eagerness to learn,
a thirst for knowledge,

but one thing we won't need is this.

That's right, I know
you're all used to teachers

wearing tuxedos and Dracula capes,
but not this one.

There will be no pretense
in this classroom.

There will only be open minds
and new horizons.

Get ready for adventure.

I know some teachers think
class should be an exercise in structure,

but not Mr. Griffin.

This is what my class will be, this!
Learn with me!

-Let's teach each other!
-Yay, learning!

Chris, A.

Meg, F.

Ah, you know,
this is how you take a vacation.

Oh, Bonnie, would you look at that?

I've never seen anything like that before,
a croissant with almonds on it.

And could you bring me a beer?
Oh! I feel so elegant.

-What are you going to have?
-You know what I'd really like?

A piece of that.

Bonnie, for God's sake, stop it.

Lois, I already told you,
I'm in Paris to have an affair.

I'll even do a Muslim if I have to.

But I just can't believe you'd throw away
all those years with Joe

just to have some silly fling.

I'm not throwing anything away.

Joe and I have been growing
apart for a long time.

Besides, we've had a good run.

-We've been married for 80 years.
-You what?

Well, that's in
married-to-a-handicapped guy years.

Go, Dallas Cowboys, huh?

-Hello.
-Excuse me?

You are American, no?
I very much admire your Garry Shandling.

Look, I know where you're going with this,
and we're not interested, okay?

So you might as well just keep moving.

I'm interested.

(LAUGHING NASALLY)

Bonnie.

Would you like to sample
a warm French baguette?

Oh, my.

My intention is to void myself on you.

Oh, I'd almost forgotten
what it's like to be romanced.

-Come on, Bonnie, we are leaving.
-What?

Look, I'm doing you a favor.

My stool will sleep alone tonight.

Bonnie, this is insanity.

Promise me you'll put this whole
affair thing out of your head.

Lois, I'm just having fun.

You're playing with fire.

Look, no marriage is perfect,
but Joe's the man you gave your life to,

and besides, you have a little girl.

You really want to be setting
this kind of example?

(SIGHS)

I guess you're right, Lois.

It's just that sometimes I feel
like I don't even know Joe anymore.

It's like I've become
a different person, and so has he.

All right, class, two things today.

I'm no good at math,

and I don't have a certificate
to teach driver's ed,

so I hired a math tutor
and a driver's ed guy.

Okay, so, do you use my car,

or do you have, like,
a special one you brought?

-Umm, I'm the math tutor.
-Really? No way!

-So that means you're the...
-Driver's ed instructor, yes.

Well, I'll be a son of a gun!

Oh! This is such an amazing city!

Like, I could see them

Lois, didn't you see
I tied a tampon to the doorknob?

No. What does that mean?

It's what we used to do in our sorority
when we had company.

Company? What are you... Oh, my God.

Look, Lois, don't make
a big deal about it.

I just needed a change from Joe.

<i>Bonjour.</i>

Lois, this is Fran√ßois.

(LAUGHS)

Oh! You're serious.

Okay, students, 40 of you
will begin this course,

but only ten of you will finish it.

Why is every day an introduction
to the course?

Now I know some teachers think
they're working outside the box

when they have class on the lawn.

Well, I'm gonna take it a step further.
We're gonna do peyote in the desert.

if I were a skunk and you were a cat

who kept repeatedly wandering into areas
where there was wet paint,

I would look at that stripe on your back

and think you were another skunk,
and I would try to rape you.

And it would be legal
because we are in France.

Oh, Fran√ßois, it's like I'm in a dream.

Bonnie, I have something
very important to ask you.

What is it?

I have so enjoyed your intimacy
these past few days.

Will you stay here with me?

Here? In Paris?

Oh, there you are, Bonnie.
I've been looking all over for you.

Lois, this is good timing.

There's something I need to tell you.

What is it?

Fran√ßois has asked me to
stay here in Paris with him.

Oh, my God,
you're not gonna do it, are you?

Well, I don't know. I'm thinking about it.

I can't believe what
I'm hearing right now.

You can't do this, Bonnie!

Oh, is that right?

Now you're telling me
what I can and can't do?

I invited you on this trip to hang out

while I have sex with strangers,
and this is how you repay me?

I'll see you back at the hotel.

I apologize for my friend, Fran√ßois.

So, will you stay with me?

Well, it's tempting.
Paris is such a perfect city.

Ah, that is not entirely true.

We have a lot of mime-on-mime violence.

All right, class, today's final exam
will consist of two parts, oral and anal.

Dad, we got to go back
to school, real school.

-What do you mean?
-The goat flu outbreak at school is over,

and honestly,
I'm afraid we're not learning anything.

Meg, you couldn't be wronger.

You're learning everything. Watch.

-Chris, dates... Battle of Hastings!

I'll take you back to school.

Oh, there you are. Hurry up now, Bonnie.
We're gonna miss our plane.

Lois, I've thought a lot about this,
and I'm not going with you.

What? What do you mean?

I'm staying here with Fran√ßois.

I see. You know, I thought
you might say something like this,

and that's why I called someone
who might be able to change your mind.

(GASPS) Joe, what are you doing here?

I came as soon as Lois told me, Bonnie.
Please don't do it.

I'm sorry that
I've been neglecting you lately,

but I love you and I need you.

Please come home with me.

Oh, Joe, I'm sorry. This is so hard.

Think about what we have together, honey.
Think about our little girl.

-You need to come home with me.
-Bonnie, stay with me.

I promise, it will take
three years with this accent

before you figure out
I'm just a normal jerk.

Bonnie, listen to me. I'm your husband.

He may be your husband,
but I would do anything for you.

Well, there's one thing he can't do.

Bonnie, I didn't think
it would have to come to this,

but I can see there's only one way left
to prove my love to you.

(GRUNTING)

Joe! I don't believe it! You're walking!

I am! I am!

(SIGHS) I would do anything for love,
but I won't do that.

Oh, Joe, I love you! I love you so much!

I love you, too, Bonnie!

Let's go home, Joe.

You know what?
You can keep your Paris, France.

I'll take Quahog any day.

I mean, all that place is, is skinny guys

rubbing up against you
in buses and subways,

jabbing you in the thigh with their thing.

Yeah, countries is weird.

But at least you helped save
Joe and Bonnie's marriage.

I know. Those two lovebirds

haven't left their bedroom

You gotta come back next year,

(AWKWARDLY) Oh...
Okay, we're gonna move on now.

I swear to God...

I know! I know! Nobody told me.

They kind of just dropped him on me at
the last minute. I couldn't say no, man.

Master Yoda, I've come back
to complete the training.

Oh, you're done. There's no more training.

Then I am a Jedi.

No, not yet.
First you have to confront Vader.

Master Yoda, is Darth Vader my father?

Yeah, it's either Darth Vader
or Paul Reiser,

but they don't want to know
which one is your real father,

so they're gonna raise you together.

-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, and I got some more bad news.

I'm getting really old
and I'm not feeling so hot,

and I think I might die soon.

There is another Skywalker.

Okay, see you.

Master Yoda, no!

Hi, Hammacher Schlemmer?
I'd like the wall-size crossword puzzle.

Why, yes, I do have a credit card.
Name is Yoda...

I can't believe Master Yoda's dead.

Yoda will always be with you, Luke.

(GASPING) A ghost!

Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me
Vader was my father?

Why didn't you tell me
you got a new hand?

Let's take that thing out
for a test drive.

But if Vader's my father,

does that mean
I'm vulnerable to the dark side?

Seriously, put your hand like you're gonna
pull a carrot out of the ground.

Obi-Wan, Yoda said
there's another Skywalker.

There is, Luke. You have a sister.

A sister? Who is it?

Who the hell you think it is?

Who's the only damn woman
in the galaxy?

I don't like her.

The Emperor has made a critical error,
and the time for our attack has come.

We've learned that the new Death Star
is not yet operational.

But, more importantly,

that the Emperor himself
is overseeing this mission.

Hey, you know what I find hilarious?

Yeah, we did this already.
That's what's so (BLEEP) up.

Well I just wanted to let you know
there's a rebel fleet massing at Sullust,

they're going to invade or something.

in the Death Star this time?

Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna do that twice!

But, you know, it might be something
to be concerned about.

It's of no concern!

We're still doing that initiation thing
we talked about, right?

Do you mind reading this for me?

"Paging Mr. Herman,
Mr. Pee-wee Herman."

I found my bike! (LAUGHS)

Admiral, we've got enemy ships
in sector 47.

It's a trap! It's a trap!

Also, whose cat?

(CAT MEOWS)

(SIGHS) Someone get your cat.

Fighters coming in!

Listen, you guys,
this is all a crazy misunderstanding.

You think this is gonna work?

Oh, yeah. Those Ewoks had all of

I'm sure it's all gonna work out fine.

that's gonna piss you off even more.

Gee, Dr. Smith, this doesn't seem

Ooh! Look at that! Blowing up rebel ships!

You hate me now?

Come on. Take that lightsaber

will be complete.

I've seen a lot of ships get blown up.
It's no big deal.

Yeah, I guess that wouldn't get
under my skin, either.

Not the way Seth Green
gets under my skin.

Huh?

Yeah. Boy, that guy rubs me
the wrong way.

I mean,
has he ever made anything successful?

<i>Greg the Bunny, Four Kings,</i>
and that godawful puppet show.

It's on, like, channel 100 or something.

Well, I think he's had some successes.
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> was popular.

It was not popular. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>
said it was popular, but it wasn't.

-Hardly anybody ever watched that show.
-Yeah, I never caught it.

Well, he's been in some big movies.

The <i>Austin Powers</i> movies grossed,
like, a billion dollars.

What, because of Seth Green?
Do you ever hear anyone say,

"Hey, let's go see that new <i>Austin Powers,</i>
Seth Green's in it"?

You're not getting to me, man.

You're talking about an actor
who I happen to enjoy.

Well, I certainly enjoyed him
in <i>Entourage,</i>

'cause in that show,
he was playing himself,

Oh! Sorry. (LAUGHS) This is

Then you will meet your destiny.

Oh, my God! Are you okay?

Oh, my God!
I meant to hit you in the shoulder,

and that whole thing just fell!

-Did you see that?
-What?

-That whole thing just fell.
-How?

I don't know. He was up there like,
"I can't do this," I threw the thing,

and I just meant to hit him in the arm,
and then the whole thing fell.

Well, that's good, right?
We want him hurt.

Are you using your brain?

We're lucky if we come out of this

Hi, little squirrel. (MIMICS LASER FIRING)

Hey, a butterfly! Oh, look at

Well, guess what? (EXCLAIMS)

Oh, my God!

Should we help him?

Eh.

(MUFFLED) I think...

I think...

I think...

Give yourself to the dark side, Luke.

CHRIS: I will not fight you.

Well, all right.
I guess that's no problem.

I can always get Seth Green to fight me.

He'll do anything for money.

I mean, did you see <i>Sex Drive?</i>

Oh, of course you didn't.
You're a person.

Of course, I guess it did
respectable foreign numbers.

Asians really liked it.

And you gotta hand it to Seth Green.
I mean, he works hard, you know?

I mean, the work is much harder
when you know the project is no good.

Still, all those small paychecks
must add up.

(GRUNTING)

I wonder if his fan base knows
how Jewish he really is.

(GROANS)

Hey, you got a good hand guy, right?

CARTER: Good. Good!

Your hate has made you powerful.

Now, fulfill your destiny

and take your father's place at my side.

Can we at least put together
a press release

that says I'm resigning of my own accord
to pursue other evil projects?

I'll never join the dark side.

You failed, Your Highness.

I'm a Jedi, like my father before me.

All right, let's everybody
just calm the (BLEEP) down.

Move! Run!

And that's the final chapter
in the <i>Star Wars</i> saga.

What about the prequels?

I think <i>The Cleveland Show</i>
is gonna do those.

Dad, one question.
What do you got against Seth Green?

I just think he's a douche.
You got a problem with that?

Well, we're all entitled
to our own opinion.

For example, me,
I think Seth MacFarlane is a douche.

-What's that, now?
-Yeah, I don't like him, either.

Yeah, me neither.

Wait a second.
I hear he's a pretty nice guy.

Yeah, good-looking guy. Talented, young...

Talented? He ripped off <i>The Simpsons.</i>

Yeah, he watched TV in the '80s.
We get it.

And he only puts out, like,
ten new episode a year.

And then he splits those up
into five DVD sets.

He doesn't make those decisions, Chris.

Those decisions are made
at the corporate level.

But he still takes the money every week.
How noble.

And doesn't he have a whole staff
that writes those episodes anyway?

Well, I wouldn't know about that,
but I think, and I hope, Chris,

that ultimately,
people will just remember the laughter.

We'll just win the lottery.

In fact, I'm going to go buy
my winning ticket right now.

-Peter, what's wrong?
-It's, uh, nothing.

I'm just going to wait a minute.

There's teenagers
in skinny jeans out there.

Everyone, I got big news.

We are going to be rich.

Oh, my God, Peter.

There are thousands
of lottery tickets here.

Where did you get the money for all these?

Simple. I took out a second
mortgage on the house.

-What!
-Peter, this is idiotic.

Your odds of winning
are like 100 million to one.

Don't you know the lottery
is just a tax on stupid people?

Would you be saying that if the prize

was 150 million bags of
the neighbor's garbage?

But it's not. I mean... I mean, is it?

It's... that-that is an
unrealistic, unfair question.

Peter, Brian's right.

How can you be so irresponsible?

You take these tickets back right now.

No way, Lois. We're going to win.

I got lots of good karma built up

That was a test.

These are the lottery tickets.

-Is this another test?
-Yes.

These aren't the real
lottery tickets, either.

These are the real lottery tickets.

So, in addition to buying
200,000 lottery tickets,

you had 400,000 fake ones printed up?

I had to be sure.

Oh, my God. We won!

-What?
-Let me see that.

Yes! We won the lottery!

I'm getting a penis butler.

Sir?

All right, butle my penis. Butle it!

This is awesome. Now that we're rich,

our lives are going to be so much better.

You sure it was such a good idea

to cash that lottery check?

It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank

this money change us.

What are you talking about? This money is

I don't need to be working.
Ah, you should've been there, Lois.

Angela, I just want to thank you

Uh, certain unexpected developments
have created a situation

where I am no longer
in need of employment.

Uh, I would be remiss, however,
if I did not extend my gratitude to you

for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

Hey, what's the point of being rich

Okay, wait, I-I got one.

Who would you rather do?

Susan Boyle or a sex doll
that's been passed around a fraternity?

Well, have they been cleaning the doll?

Please, these guys are Betas,
they're total animals.

Hey, I got one, Peter.
What would you rather do?

Tread water where you are right now
or increase your net worth fivefold

within the next 18 months?

Huh? What? I...
What are you talking about?

Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

and he says he's come up
with a new penis enlargement pill,

and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in start-up money,

he'll triple our investment in a year.

Well, uh... gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

Peter, I've taken the liberty

Wow, that's pretty good.

And this would be our net profits.

Yikes.

You know, Peter, uh,

Bonnie's birthday is coming up,

So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

Of course I can, you dope.

-I said swallow it!
-(GULPING)

Now, smear what's left of it on your face

and look at me with your mouth open.

Look at yourself, you filthy whore.

I don't even want this now.

Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

That doesn't sound safe.

-Action!

Look, you aren't gonna shoot us
in the eye, are you, Peter?

Oh, no, Joe. I wouldn't try
to shoot you in the eye.

<i>-A lot of shoes</i>
<i>-We're throwing shoes</i>

<i>-A lot of rice</i>
<i>-It's all so... </i>(SCREAMING)

Peter, it was really close to my eye!

Relax, Joe. I'm nowhere near your eye.

Hey, Joe, open your eye.

-(SCREAMING)
-Gotcha.

What the hell, Peter!
You shot him in the eye!

Keep singing, you. And keep your chin up,

so I can see your throat.

No, no screw this! You're a jerk!

Jerk? What kind of a way is that

to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

Go to hell, Peter!
We don't need your money!

And we don't need friends like you!

Yeah! We're out of here!

Fine, go on. I don't care.

I don't need you, I got money!

You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

But ever since you won that lottery...

(SCREAMING)

Come on, Joe!

(BLEEP) this guy! Aah!

I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

Come right in.

Peter, my God,
what the hell are you wearing?

It's a solid gold tuxedo, Lois.

I had to fight three rappers

down at the Nonsense Store for this.

Look, Peter, this is not who we are.

I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

and not the way you hoped.

Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning,

and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

Who cares? I don't need Quagmire.

And I certainly don't need Joe.

I got Money Joe.

(LAUGHING) That's a good one, Money Joe!

I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

It's even affecting Brian and Stewie.

(YAWNING) I think I'm gonna take a nap.

-What, here?
-Yeah, I had a giant mobile

put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(SIGHING) This is nice.

I hope that bear comes around soon.

That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

And it's not just them.

Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

Model glue, sir?

Well, what do we have today?

Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

from Michael's Hobby Shop.

Yes, that's very nice.

Bring me my finest rag.

Your fancy rag, sir.

You are relieved for the evening.

(INHALING DEEPLY

You don't see poor people doing this!

Lois, don't you understand?

We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

We don't have to worry about paying bills,

we don't have to worry about saving dough.

All we got to do is enjoy ourselves.

Interested?

(GASPING)

Oh, my God.

Peter, it's beautiful!

Is it a blood diamond?

Ah, the bloodiest.

The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

Oh, Peter, I love it.

Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

I already watched it eight times,

so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father,

you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

-Go.
-Um, say, Dad, did I tell you

I got second place in the yacht race?

Hmm. Sounds like somebody's dad

is happier than me right now.

Well, um, how about this, Dad?

The school paper is doing
a story about me.

That's because I had it arranged.

Uh, I was thinking about joining the Army?

No. Meg, as a girl,
your life holds no merit.

And, Chris, try as you may,
you will never be

as good as your older brother who died.

He was good at sports and talking.

Now, pardon me while I look at scrimshaw

through a magnifying glass.

Ah, brave men all.

Lost sons of New Bedford.

That's good scrimshaw.

Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea

at the Park Barrington every single day.

Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

-Very good, sir.
-Very good indeed.

I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

in North America.

Why the (BLEEP) am I doing this?

I could've just said I did it.

Sir, about your bill...

Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

there's ample gratuity on there for you.

(CHUCKLES) Nyah.

Well, actually, sir,
your card has been declined.

(LAUGHING) Oh, really?

Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

Hello, Schnozzenstein?

This is Peter Griffin.

There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

What do you mean I'm broke?

What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

They did what with it!

No, I don't want it back!

I'm gonna miss you, Carstairs.

I shall miss you, too, sir.

With no one to look after,

Carstairs fell into a deep depression

from which he never emerged.

He died two weeks later.

Some say of a broken heart.

-What, sir?
-But that was Carstairs.

I can't believe it.

We lost everything.

What do we do now?

Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

Holy (BLEEP), we won twice
and we're right back here again.

We had $150 million,
and we blew through it in a month.

Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

-we never would've met Kyle.
-Hey.

-Hello.
-Hey there.

-Hi.
-What's up?

And that's not even Kyle.

Peter, we can't live like this.

Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois?

Everything we had is gone!

We have friends, Peter.

Not anymore, we don't.

They're good people. They'll listen.

And they'll care what happens to us,

even after everything that's happened.

You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

at the fire station, no questions asked.

Well, well. Look who it is.

-Who is it?
-It's me, Peter.

I'm standing right here.

This is a glass eye, Peter.

They had to remove the one you shot.

Oh, boy, that whole day was a mess, huh?

What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

Look, you guys, I messed up bad.

Winning the lottery was the worst thing

that ever happened to me and my family.

I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

Like who my real friends are.

I don't expect you to forgive me,

but if, for some reason,
you do, you can find me

in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

Peter, wait.

That corner's a bit of a hike for me.

I'd rather just come see you at home.

What-- where'd you get this kind of money?

The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

It turned a pretty nice profit.

I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

so you can get your house back.

Quagmire, I don't know what to say.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

Just ask Sandra the waitress over there.

We had a great time last night.

PETER: Tough girl. Made it into work.

Boy, I got to say, it's good to be home.

Yeah. Despite all the ups and downs,

things turned out for the best.

I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

Plus, we learned something.

And you can't put a price on that.

Look, Lois, we all know what happened.

We're all depressed.

All right, let's just
go to different rooms

and stare blankly out the window,
saying nothing.

Oh, yeah, I'm totally cool about that.

I-I-I-I have a lot of friends who do it,

Chris, you treat me like you hate me,

You say hurtful things to me constantly.

what that feels like?

and smells like an old woman
who has birds for pets?

into some big thing, okay?

Yes. You're right, Brian. There is.

Meg seems to think she's
taking some kind of stand here

that's gonna make us all
feel like we're inadequate.

My God, you're condescending.

Geez, look at those two.

Look, the bottom line here, Meg,
is that you're just

taking your own problems
out on everyone else.

Oh, my problems?

Oh, I see.

Is this coming from
my role model mother?

The shoplifter, the drug addict,

the porn star, the whore
who let Gene Simmons

and Bill Clinton go to town on her?

Oh, so what?

All those things are behind me now.

I'm a better person now
because of those experiences.

Are you? Are you a better person?

-What's your point, Meg?
-My point is that with

all the irresponsible, reckless,

idiotic behavior in your past,
that somehow... (SCOFFS)

Somehow you have the nerve,
the arrogance to consistently

and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings.

All right, well, fine, okay?

I'm not the perfect mother. Who is?

Oh, not only are you
not the perfect mother,

you're the farthest thing from.

From the moment you gave birth
to me, I had to trust you.

I had no choice.

I needed you to protect me from the world.

To... To be my guide,
to help me navigate the difficult,

confusing, and vulnerable journey
to becoming a person.

You have done none of those things.

You're my mother,
and you took a child's trust

and smashed it into bits
in a 17-year-long mission

to destroy something that
you killed a long time ago.

And honestly, when I turn 18...

I-I don't know that I ever
want to see you again.

(WEEPING LOUDLY)

Oh, wow, everybody's
already tweeting,

"Stewie Just Said That."

Oh. You're right.

You're right. I'm a terrible mother.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so, so sorry, Meg.

Can you ever forgive me?

Oh, God. (SOBBING)

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

And you never let Dad stir the paint
anymore, whatever that means.

I didn't know you knew that, Meg,
but I'm glad you brought it up.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Oh, Meg, I don't know what to say.

All of those things
you said about me are true.

I have been a very bad mother to you.

I have no excuse.

I just have this horrible,
overwhelming desire

to point out faults in you.

I don't know where it comes from.

Maybe it's because
I'm self-conscious

about being a bad parent.

I'm just... I'm so disgusted
with my behavior.

And I'm so sorry, Meg.

Yeah, you're a bitch.

Well, you know, I... I been sorta
just hangin' back here,

takin' all this in, 'cause I didn't think
I had a dog in this fight,

but my money's on
Harry Potter over there.

Oh, you think that's funny, fat ass?

Well, I don't know if it's funny.
I-I think it's clever.

I mean, y-y-you got

I-I-I don't know. T-T-Tell me...

Dad" to you, young lady.

Oh, God, is she gonna do me next?

You are completely selfish,
and totally irresponsible as a father.

All right, I see what's goin' on here.

You're in love with your old man.

You have no education,
you have no interests,

you just do whatever
reckless thing you want to do

whenever you want to do it
without regard for anyone else.

Oh, oh, and when you're not
terrorizing the community

with your impulsive escapades,
you're being a total jerk to your family.

You shove your daughter's face
in your ass and you fart on it.

-(LAUGHS)
-If someone in the outside world

could see the way you treat me,
you would be in jail!

-(LAUGHS)
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Oh, this is amusing to you.

Well, see if you find this funny.

I like where this is going.

You are a fat, lazy, abusive,
blue-collar Irish Catholic dad

who drinks way too much

and barely makes enough money
to support his family.

You've lived half your life,
and you have nothing to show for it.

Your only arguable accomplishments
are your kids, and look at us.

-We're a disaster.
-Eh, watch it.

You're a total and complete embarrassment
in every possible way.

Take a good look at yourself,
Peter Griffin.

You're a waste of a man.

Wait a second, these are criticisms.

Hey, Lois, tell her to knock it off.

Oh, and where the hell were you
when she was laying into me?

I was thinking about
getting a fancy cane.

Maybe getting more
attention from strangers.

Have either of you guys
been listening to me?

Do you both just have
your heads up your asses?

Dad did! Look, he's got
crap on his ears!

That's unrelated.

Chris, I don't like that language.

Well, I don't like your cooking.

Well, I don't like having
to literally empty

the farts out of your pockets
whenever I do your laundry.

You're the one who's always cookin'
Brussels sprouts and broccoli.

It's like an Irish bar fight down there.

You're from one town over,
so I hate your guts.

Why don't we ever get any good food?

Yeah, Bonnie gives Joe Wonder Bread.

Well, then go live at Bonnie's house.

Then I could finally sleep in

and not have to answer
your stupid questions at 5:00 a.m.

My curiosity peaks in the morning!

You eat all my Danone yogurts!

I don't see your name on 'em!

You don't even like them!
But you know I do,

and you don't want me to have them!

You know, I've never
confronted you on it,

but I've often thought
the same thing, Peter.

Yeah, that's exactly what he does!

'Cause he's a selfish, fat idiot!

You shut up, all of yous!

I didn't ask to be in this family!

Ugh, I'll go get him.

Peter? You come back here!

I faked all my orgasms!

Hey.

What's goin' on?

You know, that was, uh...
That was pretty cool

the way you finally
stood up to everybody.

(SIGHS) I don't know, Brian.

I mean, I...
I meant every word of it, but...

-You saw what happened.
-What do you mean?

They all turned on each other
like a pack of wolves.

Well, so what?
That's not your problem.

Do you think it's possible that...

That this family can't survive
without some sort of lightning rod

to absorb all the dysfunction?

Well, that's a...

That's a theory, I guess.

I mean, it... It's not ideal,
but it's an important piece

that maybe it's just
my lot in life to provide.

Maybe if I feel bad,
they don't have to.

Wow.

You know, that's incredibly
noble and mature, Meg.

You know, I think you might be
the strongest person in this house.

You mean that, Brian?

Absolutely.

Mom? Dad?

(PETER WHIMPERING)

(SNIFFLING, WHIMPERING)

-Dad?
-Go away!

Dad, come out of there.

No! I don't deserve no better
than livin' with the shoes!

Peter, there you are.

You guys, I have something to say.

You're right. It's all my fault.

-What?
-Mom, you're an amazing mother,

and all the things I said about you
were out of anger,

and I didn't mean any of them.

Chris, you're an outstanding brother.

What I said about you was more
about me being a rotten sister.

And Dad, I'm so sorry that
I made you feel this way.

You don't deserve it.

None of you have done anything wrong.

I took all my problems out on you guys,
and that wasn't fair.

Oh, so this was all about you,
it wasn't about us.

Yeah.

All right, that makes sense.

See, I thought it was weird
that I was a bad dad.

Meg, how could you put us
all through that?

I'm sorry, you guys.

You're a (BLEEP) bitch!

Yes.

Yes, I am.

Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin.

Tonight's <i>Family Guy </i>was a very
special episode about drug use.

But the simple fact is,
it's no laughing matter.

To learn more about drugs,
visit your local library.

There's probably a guy
behind there who sells drugs.

Good night.

(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

ALL:<i> He's a family guy!</i>

Good morning. Is what normal families say.

Lois, I'll take my breakfast to go.
I'm going fishing with the fellas.

Peter, I thought we were gonna
have some family time this weekend.

-You're going fishing again?
-Yes, Lois. I love fishing.

Remember, fishing was my
not-at-all-memorable job for two years?

-No.
-You don't remember my fishing boat?

-You don't remember Santos and Pasqual?
-Not even a little.

They were like male Consuelas.

It was a mistake making 'em
Portuguese, though.

People don't even know
what a Portuguese is.

(CHAIRS CREAKING)

That's what I thought a Portuguese was.

Me and my brain, huh?
And we're just getting started.

Boy, it's not like Quagmire
to be this late.

Yeah.

PETER: <i>Jeez, I've never tried</i>
<i>to make conversation with just Joe before.</i>

<i>This is brutal.</i>

JOE: <i>Come on, Joe, you're losing him.</i>

<i>Think of something.</i><i>This was your shot.</i>

-Two thirds of the planet is water.
-Yeah.

PETER: <i>Two thirds of the planet is water?</i>

<i>This guy's okay.</i>

All right, well, um, we should probably
go find out what's keeping Quagmire.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

And you know, Joe, uh, I was thinking,

maybe one night we get dinner,
just the two of us.

I would like that.

-(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-PETER: Hey, Quagmire? You in there?

-(GASPS) Holy crap!
-Oh, my God!

He must have autoerotically
asphyxiated himself!

Yeah, while he was watching clown porn.

(ON TV) <i>Oh, yeah, baby.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah, baby! You make me so horny!</i>

(HORN TOOTING)

Come on, help me get him down!

Peter, he's still alive.
We got to get him to a hospital.

All right, but let's just watch
the end of this clown porn first.

(CALLIOPE MUSIC PLAYING)

(WOMAN GIGGLING)

Oh, Peter, we came
as soon as we heard. How is he?

He's in a coma, Lois.

My God, what the hell happened?

He hung himself
during autoerotic asphyxiation.

Just goes to show anything
can be dangerous.

Is his family here?

His sister Brenda is coming
with her boyfriend, Jeff.

Oh, my God, not that guy.

Is she still with him?
Isn't he the one that beats her?

Yeah, but she's gotten a lot better.

All right, on the way back,

I get to pick the radio station,
because that was awful.

I know, yeah, it was, I'm sorry.

Oh, God, I just... I hope Glenn's okay.
I'm so worried about him.

Shut up and limp!
We're in a handicapped spot, you slut!

Well, Miss Quagmire,
your brother Glenn is lucky to be alive.

You know, we're all lucky
to be alive on such a beautiful day.

In fact, nurse,
all surgeries are outside today.

You know, when we were kids,

our mother used to sing
a song when we were sad.

Maybe that'll help now.

Come on, Brenda, a stupid nursery rhyme

isn't gonna wake him up,
especially the way you sing.

-(LAUGHING) Right, man?
-(EXCLAIMS)

(SINGING) <i>Glenn, don't die</i>
<i>from</i><i>autoerotic asphyxiation</i>

<i>Your friends want to go</i>

This song is from childhood?

(GRUNTS SOFTLY) Where am I? What happened?

Oh, Glenn. Oh, thank God you're all right.

(SHOUTS) Hey, you touching my girl?

-Relax, Jeff. That's her brother.
-Yeah, that's how it starts.

Come on, Brenda,
we got to get out of here.

I need cigarettes and jeans.

Oh, thanks, you guys,
for all your help through this.

Oh, Glenn, we're just
so glad you're all right.

And Jeff and I are happy to stay here
with you for as long as you need.

Fine, then you call my cousin Terry

and tell him we're not gonna be
at his karate recital!

Well, Jeff, he is my brother.

Why do you always got to remind me
I didn't finish high school?

Well, listen, how about
I make us all some dinner, huh?

-Come here!
-(BRENDA GASPS SOFTLY)

(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

JEFF: You fat, ugly bitch!
If today wasn't your birthday...

BRENDA: Jeff. Please, you're being...
JEFF: (SHOUTS) What? What am I being?

Crazy? Unemployed?

Why don't you call the cops
like you did on Christmas?

BRENDA: (STAMMERS)
I didn't call them. They were called.

JEFF: Oh, now you're calling me
a liar in front of this cat?

I got another cat.

Aw, that yellow lab looks like it's dying.

Peter, that's Gwyneth Paltrow. She's fine.

Look, turn off the light.

I just want to get to sleep
and put this ugly night behind us.

All that unpleasantness
with Brenda and Jeff

-was more than I can handle.
-It's no big deal, Lois.

We probably just caught 'em
on an off night.

JEFF: Where do you get off calling me
a deadbeat in front of your brother?

BRENDA: No, Jeff, (STAMMERS) all I said
was that you were in between jobs.

JEFF: Well, it wouldn't matter

if you'd just pick up that
night shift at the prison!

BRENDA: But then I'll be working
a hundred hours a week.

JEFF: So what? I need money
for motor oil and wallet chains!

BRENDA: Okay, I'll ask about it Monday.

Can I put my nightgown back on?

JEFF: No, I'm not done drawing!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, Peter.

Geez, Quagmire, you look terrible.

Oh, I didn't get any sleep.

Hi, Glenn. How are you?

Not great, Lois.

I'm stuck in the middle of
some bad stuff with my sister.

I know, it sounded like
there was quite a ruckus going on

over there last night.
That Jeff seems like kind of a monster.

Yeah, that guy's scary as an Iraq Lobster.

(PLAYING <i>ROCK LOBSTER</i>)

<i>And butter sauce</i>

<i>Don't boil me</i>

<i>I'm still alive</i>

<i>Iraq Lobster</i>

I've tried talking to Brenda
about leaving him,

but I haven't gotten anywhere.

I was actually hoping
you could talk to her, Lois.

She might open up more to you,
you know, 'cause you're a woman.

-Me?
-Yeah, would you mind at least trying?

Well, I guess she does
need someone to talk to.

Well, let's hope she's good at talking
'cause we know she doesn't listen so good.

That, we know.

You know, Brenda,
I'm glad we could get together.

Me, too, Lois. It's nice to have
a girlfriend to chat with.

Don't you have any back home?

Oh, no. Jeff would never allow that.

You know, that's kind of what
I want to talk to you about, Brenda.

Do you mind taking off your sunglasses?

(SIGHING SADLY)

Oh, my God.

No, it's really not that bad.

It only hurts when I see.

You know, you don't have to stay
with a man who treats you that way.

Oh, Jeff's sweet.

You don't see how soft
and gentle he hits me when we're alone.

Do you hear yourself?
He shouldn't be hitting you at all.

I don't think you understand
how serious a matter...

-Close your menu.
-What?

Close your menu,
so they know we're ready to order.

I'll give you another moment.

(SIGHS) Damn it.

I'm sorry. Oh, shoot.

See, this is why Jeff
corrects me all the time.

Corrects you? Brenda,
he's not correcting you, he's beating you!

Well, I can see why you'd think that
'cause of the punches and all,

but it's just that Jeff's been
so angry about immigrants.

-What?
-It'll be better

when he gets back to work.

Our relationship
is just complicated, that's all.

No, Brenda, it's not complicated.

Trying to get a straight answer
out of a 23-year-old girl is complicated.

So, do you want to go out some time?

Out like, go out or hang out
or just do something?

-Like a date.
-Like a date date? Or like a date?

Both, I... I guess.

Yeah, sure, maybe. I don't know. Yes, no.

Here's the first three digits
of my phone number. E-mail me.

Joe, the guy's a menace.

They've been with me three days now,
and all he does is beat her day and night.

And on top of that,
they say they don't need

to be entertained,
but then they're always like,

"Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?"

Hey, Joe, can't you...
Can't you just arrest the guy?

I can't arrest Jeff

unless Brenda files a formal
complaint with the police.

She won't go to the police.
She's afraid of what Jeff will do.

And to be honest, I don't blame her.

I mean, what happens
if one of these nights,

he hits her so hard he kills her?

Sorry, Quagmire.

Police policy, we can't step
in until it's too late.

But if I were you,
I'd set up an intervention.

-What's that?
-It's like a surprise birthday party,

but instead of cake and presents,
there's angry letters

and someone who inappropriately
tries to make it about themselves.

Aw, that sounds great. I bet I would
really shine at one of those.

All right, well,
first we want to thank you all

for being here for Brenda.

Now, I know it's going to be a long day,

but we're all here
because we care about her very much.

What the... What's going on?
What's all this?

Brenda, this is an intervention.

A lot of us don't like
how Jeff's been treating you.

So, we're going to say a few things,
and then you'll say a few things,

and then we'll be done. Sound good?

Um, I guess.

All right, so we're gonna
go around the room

and tell you exactly how your situation
has affected each of us. Meg?

I feel like if he likes you,
maybe you can change him.

Okay, maybe she wasn't
the one to start with. Caleb?

Caleb, you want to go ahead?

-M... Me?
-Yeah, go ahead.

Uh... It's Chris.

You... You don't know my name?

All right, this isn't off
to a flying start.

Peter, why don't you go ahead?

So, you like getting beaten, huh?

Well, why don't you smoke
a whole carton of cigarettes!

Look, I know what you guys
are trying to do,

but Jeff and I are fine.

No, Brenda, you're not fine, okay?

Please, I'd like to say
something, if I may.

(CLEARS THROAT)

"Brenda, the fact that
you are being abused

"has affected my life
in the following ways.

"The sister that I knew
and loved growing up

"no longer exists.

"The person I see before me now
is just a punching bag.

"And I call you 'person' and not 'woman'

"because a woman is a strong,
beautiful, vibrant creature.

"A woman embraces life.

"A woman makes choices
to make her life better.

"Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff,

"proves to me that you have made a choice
to make your life worse."

I... I want the girl I grew up with back.

I want... I want my sister back.

Brenda, I love you.

Please make the right decision.

Which is a perfect time
for me to tell my jokes.

-Peter.
-And I will save them for the end.

Glenn, I am so lucky

to have such a wonderful,
loving brother like you.

So, are you gonna leave him?

Oh, there you are!

Hey, give me some money!
I saw a cool bandana!

What the hell's going on here?

Listen here, you bully!
For your information,

Brenda just agreed to leave you!

Like hell she did.

-Brenda, you tell 'em?
-No, not yet.

Everyone, I have wonderful news.

Jeff and I are getting married.

(ALL GASP)

I'd show you the ring,
but it's under the splint.

My finger fell down the stairs.

You're getting married?

-Yeah, but only 'cause she's pregnant.
-Pregnant?

Oh, congratulations.
Have you thought of any names yet?

Maybe... Maybe "Slappy"?

Or "Bruisey"?

Or "Keep-It-Down-In-There-sy"?

Guys, what the hell am I gonna do?

She can't marry that bastard.

He's just gonna keep beatin' her,
and then he's gonna beat the kid, too!

God, I wish she'd never met
Jeffrey Fecalman.

You know, I was thinking... Wait, what?

-What?
-That's his name?

-Yeah.
-Hilarious.

But you know,
I was thinking this afternoon,

what the hell happened to the days
when a guy does something

like that to a girl,
and a bunch of us guys get together

and just go kick his (BLEEP) ass?

Boy, that'd be satisfying.

-Well... Why not?
-What do you mean?

The three of us.

We go over there and we do what's right.
We kill the bastard.

Whoa, whoa, Quagmire.

You know, I could arrest you
just for saying that.

You know what else
you can get arrested for?

Soliciting a rooster.

I don't know what this
cock-a-doodle-doo thing is,

but it sounds gay
and it sounds scatological.

-I'm in.
-You're about to have a neat day.

Quagmire, you're talking
about murdering a guy.

It doesn't matter what he's done,
it's still murder.

No, Joe, it does matter what he's done!

These kinds of guys don't change.

You think they ever suddenly
wake up and realize

the error of their ways
and clean up their act? No!

They just keep ruining everyone's lives,
and the world is better off without 'em.

It's against the law, Quagmire,
and that's the end of it.

-(SLAPS)
-(BRENDA SCREAMS)

JEFF: What the hell?
Did you change the channel

while I was going to get a beer?

BRENDA: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, honey,

I just wanted to see who was on Letterman.

JEFF: We're watching Leno, you bitch!

BRENDA: I'm so sorry!

JEFF: His soft, gentle humor
connects effortlessly

with my mainstream sensibilities!

-(SLAPS)
-(BRENDA SCREAMS)

Let's waste this dick.

<i>all the inmates to Congress.</i>

I don't get that one!

Hi, there, Jeff.

Hey, what's going on, dudes?
Brenda just fell.

Get your lazy ass up
and get my neighbors some beers!

Actually, we don't have time, Jeff.

We were just about to go on
our annual midnight hunting trip.

We thought you might want to join us.

Yeah, what the hell.

Go shoot some animals,
that sounds like fun.

Hey, it beats sitting at home
watching Meg pop her zits.

Okay, okay, who would you rather do?

Dame Judi Dench
with 30 minutes of kissing first

or Eddie Izzard in drag,
but he has a working vagina?

Would Eddie Izzard tell others about it

-Eddie Izzard is very discreet.
-Then that's your answer.

You know, Quagmire, I gotta say,

I was pretty surprised
you wanted me to come along.

I thought you hated my guts.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, come on, Jeff,

I don't hate your (BLEEP) guts.

Well, then what the hell
are we doing out here?

-I thought we were gonna kill...
-Ah!

(SHOUTS) So, Jeff,
do you like loud sentences?

I guess. I gotta take a whiz.

All right, look, when he comes back,
I'm just gonna do it, okay?

I'm just gonna point my gun
straight at his head

before he even knows what's going on.

-(SHOTGUN COCKING)
-JEFF: Kinda like this?

You know, Quagmire, you are pathetic.

You have to bring your friends
out here with you to do your dirty work?

What... What do you mean, Jeff?

You're gonna kill me, is that it?

Uh-uh!

Not unless you want
your friend's brains all over the place!

Listen, Jeff, just put the gun down
and we'll forget this whole thing, okay?

Oh. Well, that's never happened before.

Kinda don't know what to do next.

-So, now you'll forget the whole thing?
-Yeah, I, uh, guess that is what I said.

No, no, we can't forget the whole thing!

Yeah, you know, he's right.
We can't forget it.

Fine. Now here's the plan,

I'm taking Quagmire for a little ride,

and you guys are gonna
stay out here and freeze to death!

Now, get those hands where I can see 'em!

All the way up!

Oh, my shirt's a little too short.

That's okay. You can keep 'em

the way you had 'em
so it covers your stomach.

Thank you. You know,
if this Jeff was around more,

we wouldn't have tried to kill you.

See you later, schmucks!

(BOTH GRUNT)

(GLENN GRUNTS)

All right, this is far enough.

Well, Quagmire,
sorry it had to end this way,

a tragic hunting accident.

I guess that little baby's gonna
grow up without an uncle.

Actually, I have a brother.

-Gary Quagmire.
-Oh.

I think... I think you got a brother,
too, don't you?

All right, forget the uncle thing!

Get ready to die, Quagmire.

You know, if you had any balls,
you'd put that gun down

and we could settle this like men.

(LAUGHS) That's awful big talk
for a scrawny bastard like you.

Hey, I'm serious, man.
Unless you're scared I can take you.

Suit yourself, man.
Just means you're gonna die slower.

Oh, oh, Glenn, there you are.

Jeff didn't come home last night

Uh, well, actually, about that, Brenda,
he must've left early this morning.

Yeah, we found this note he left you.

"Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you.

"I realized that you are too good for me,

"and you and our unborn child
would be better off

"without me in the picture. Love, Jeff.

"P.S. If the cops ask,

"tell them that Joe, Peter and Quagmire
were with you last night.

"If you tell anyone otherwise,

"I will come back and not only hit you,
but I will murder you.

"And no one will care
because you're garbage.

"And your baby
is going to be a child of garbage."

(WHISPERS) It's a little rough, Peter.

I didn't write it. Joe did.

I wanted it to sound real.
It's gotta sound like he wrote it.

Plus, she kinda is garbage, Quagmire.

"Well, I best be rolling on now."

(WHISPERS) Oh, come on. Who says that?

It's an expression.

Yeah, if you're in a wheelchair.

Listen, you had your chance.
I e-mailed it to both of you.

You wrote back, "Looks fine."

And you just added that
part about Grape Ape.

"P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape. The end."

(SIGHS) Wow.

I guess he's really gone. (CRYING)

I kinda want to kill somebody else now.

I was on my way to Newport

we'd be happy to give you directions.

You take 138 to the Jamestown Bridge,

just follow the signs.

It's probably just the dress

yeah, I think that's what it is, too.

Hey, you made it.

I'm his wife, Lois.
We actually met the other day.

Oh, sorry, I meet so many people.

you could know that.

-Yeah, she's a housewife, she don't know.
-Whatever.

everyone in Quahog likes to tickle fight?
What is that?

-What? I never heard that.
-Yeah, apparently it's, like, a thing.

-It is?
-Yeah.

You know, Ryan,
most people take one look at me

and just assume that I have plans,
so I never get asked out.

But I frequently
don't have plans, so yes,

I would love to do something
with you on Thursday night.

Yes! Oh, my God, right now
would be the worst time

for you to tickle my lower abdomen,

because it's so exposed
'cause I'm cheering.

Yeah, Thursday night!

Aw, your big mouth
just got you in trouble.

Your potato joke was terrible.

I can't believe you drove my car!
You could have gotten yourself killed!

No! No, you can't tell them!
I'll be in so much trouble!

Stewie, I have to.

All right, I have covered for you

This is very dangerous,

and I have to make sure
you never do it again.

I won't, I swear! (CRYING)

It's true. Last night
we were at this restaurant,

and he tried to gay kiss me.
I'm telling you, he wants to get with me.

Peter, come on.

Why would any man dress well,
groom himself and lift weights

just to sleep with other men?
He's not gay.

Well, I don't care what you say.
He likes me.

And we do have chemistry,
I won't deny that.

I... I will take responsibility
for my part in this.

I'm just gonna go over there

Um, perfect time.
Come on in. I was just oiling my legs.

So, hey, what's on for tonight?

You know, my dentist
leaves his office unlocked.

I was thinking we could do some nitrous
and then have dinner in there.

Look, Ryan, you're a great guy
and everything,

but I don't like you in that way.

I mean, there are some things
that I would do with you,

but my heart wouldn't be in it.

What are you talking about?

That you like me,
and you want to be my boyfriend.

(LAUGHS) You think I'm gay?
Where did you get that?

Uh, uh, you... You tried to kiss me.

Peter, I'm not gay.
What the hell's the matter with you?

Look, look, look, let me...
Let me put it to you this way.

I'm attracted to you in the way
that a man is attracted to a woman,

but I'm not gay.

When you live out in Hollywood,
you learn that life is about

different spirits and energies
you meet along the way.

I just thought maybe our spirits
could intertwine, you know?

Our energies could merge.

Like my spirit could go
up inside your energy.

I... I have so much to learn
about show business.

But you know what? I could never really
be attracted to somebody

who uses labels like "gay" and "straight."
Maybe you should just go.

Well... Well, now, wait a second.
What do you mean?

This isn't working. It was a nice thought,

but I think we should
go our separate ways.

No, Ryan. I get it now.
I can be what you want.

-We could...
-Peter. Don't embarrass yourself.

You need to just let this go.

-Tickle fight!
-No, Peter, no!

-Peter, no! No!

it's probably my fault

And if you promise never
to do it again, I won't say anything.

Okay, I promise.

-My baby.
-What?

-I say, let go of me.
-Consuela, we're leaving.

They were very nice to me up until then.

Peter, stop staring out the window.
Ryan's gone.

He finished his movie, he's moved out.

How could I have been so blind?

How could I not have seen what he offered?

I think the whole thing was very strange.

He thought you were strange!
How about that?

Whatever.

I just can't help but wonder...

Will I ever see him again?

Oh, hey, there you are.
Hey, listen, I got something really cool

-I want you to see.
-What is it?

This. I found it in the yard.

A tennis ball.
That's very impressive, Brian.

Yeah, but don't tell the other dogs
in the neighborhood. They'll be jealous.

You son of a bitch.

And this is nothing.

There's one tennis ball out there
that's even cooler 'cause I peed on it.

Buried it years ago,
I just can't remember where.

I'd give anything to find it, though.

Well, if you could recall
exactly when you buried it,

I suppose I could help you out.

I remember the exact day.
January 31, 1999.

Very well, follow me, Brian.

Watch out for Ernie.
He's getting a CAT scan.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Well, here we are.

That's odd. It's our house,
but somehow it looks a little different.

MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin.
Can I please get collagen injections?

Meg, you don't need
to change the way you look.

You know, most of the world's problems
stem from poor self-image.

Oh, my God, what's with Meg's voice?

She sounds like someone
who's about to give up a huge opportunity.

That's nothing. Look at you.

You look like a prize at some
Mexican church carnival.

Excellent. The mind control device
is nearing completion.

Stewie, I said no toys at the table.

Damn you, vile woman!

You've impeded my work since the day
I escaped from your wretched womb.

Oh, don't pout, honey.

You know, when you were born,
the doctor said you were

the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.

But of course. That was my victory day.

The fruition of my deeply-laid plans

to escape from that cursed
ovarian bastille.

Return the device, woman!

Jeez. What, did you carry
a thesaurus around with you?

You know, it's amazing
I could speak at all

with that circumcision still healing.

Hey, wait a minute, Stewie.
That's the spot.

That's where I buried my tennis ball.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Brian, what are you doing?

You can't dig it up here.

Just make a mental note
of where you buried it,

and as soon as we're back in the present,
you can dig it up then.

-Why?
-Because we can't risk

doing anything that alters the past.

You know, I never got that.

I mean, wouldn't you want
to alter the past?

I mean, you could make life
better for yourself.

And not just for yourself, for everyone.

You... You could stop 9/11.

Brian, there's one rule
of time travel, and that is,

do not alter the past in any way
or the consequences could be dire.

-Yeah, where'd you hear that?
<i>-Quantum Leap.</i>

That guy changed the past all the time.

PAST BRIAN: Whoa, ass ahoy.

Hey, Peter, it's 7:00

and you've still got your pants on.
What's the occasion?

Ew, I remember this.
Peter's eye did that weird creepy thing

where it went over his nose.

Come on, you're worrying about nothing.

Oh? Remember when you got drunk
off the communion wine at church?

STEWIE: Ah! Ew! Gross! Look at that.

Wait, what are they doing?

I don't know.
They're just standing there like zombies.

-Do you think they're all right?
-I... I'm not sure.

And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

They're doing it again. What the hell?

I... I'm at a loss.

I mean, I know we're not supposed
to mess with the timeline,

but should we call an ambulance?

That is so creepy.

And remember you had an Irish coffee
the day we went to see <i>Philadelphia?</i>

Oh. They're do...
They're setting up (BLEEP) cutaways.

Oh, my God, is that what we did back then?

Yeah, I mean, now, we just, like,

return text messages
and screw around and whatnot.

Lois, I'm not going back to work tomorrow.

That new boss has it in for me.
He's meaner than a shifty salesman.

You sure you got time to smoke?

Oh, yeah, it's an Al Harrington.
It goes on for a while.

All right, look, we found out
where your ball is buried.

Now, let's get back to our own time.

Okay, get the return pad. Let's go.

Not out here in the open.
Someone could see us.

Remember? No altering the timeline?
Come on, let's get up to my room.

Hey, wait a minute, Stewie,
I got to take a leak.

Will it screw up the timeline
if my future pee goes in a past toilet?

Uh, no, as long as it goes in the toilet.

One splash on a magazine in there,
and we're getting chased by dinosaurs.

Huh. Looks more or less the same.

Oh, my God, my Japanese children's books.

I forgot about these.

blunt-edged, matriarchal despot!

Who the deuce does she think she is?

(GASPS SOFTLY) Quick, Brian, hide.

I shall cleverly disguise
this lethal plasma disruptor device

as a tuna fish sandwich,
whereupon I shall end

that wretched woman's
Draconian reign of tyranny!

(SNEEZES) (GASPS)

Oh. Hey.

Who the deuce are you?

Uh, well, I'm, uh... I'm you.

You look like me,
but that's utterly impossible.

I'm afraid it's true.
I'm you from the future.

-I've traveled back in time.
-That's absurd.

Look, I can prove to you
that I'm you from the future.

I know about the Eddie Bauer catalog.

(GASPS) It is you.

Okay, bye, Lois.
I'm going to the stag party.

Brian, you might as well come out now.
He knows everything.

(BRIAN SCREAMS)

(GRUNTS)

Uh-oh.

(CHATTERING)

(WHOOSHING)

Brian, are you all right?

Yeah, I'm fine. Where'd you get that?

The Stewie from the past has
a lot more gadgets and things than I do.

I've kind of slacked off a little bit.

-How's the party?
-Looks like fun.

Hey, who wants to play Drink the Beer?

-Right here.
-You win.

-All right. What do I win?
-Another beer.

Okay, take a last look,
'cause we're out of here.

Oh, look at that.

There's the old gang we've gotten to know
so well over the years.

TV's not even plugged in.

What is this? Where the hell are we?

JOHN MADDEN OVER PA: <i>The air is electric</i>
<i>here at Super Bowl 33 tonight.</i>

-Stewie, what's going on?
-I don't know.

For some reason, the time machine
didn't take us back to the present.

We're still in 1999.

Wait a minute. I remember this.

I think I'm up in that blimp.

Amazing. You can barely drive a car,
and yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?

Yeah, America's great, isn't it?
'Cept for the South.

Oh, no wonder the return pad
didn't take us all the way.

The batteries are almost depleted.

Are those D batteries?

Yes, ever since we had
that trouble in Germany,

I found a way to convert it

so it takes D batteries
instead of uranium.

Only problem is, I didn't bring
any cash with me. Did you?

I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

Oh, my God. Quick, grab some money.

Do you... Do you have pockets?

Are you putting that in pockets?
That's so cute.

the sooner I cashed the check,

the sooner they'd, uh,
catch their mistake. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

a federal case out of this?

-You're the Kool-Aid guy.
-Yeah.

-What are you doing?
-Just waiting.

-For what?
-I'm just waiting, dude. Relax.

Hey, is there any place
around here that sells batteries?

Guys, d-don't distract me, all right?
I gotta really be up.

Mr. Griffin, I think your words
have touched us all.

I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.

-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

So, there's no organs
or glands or anything, right?

-It's just the liquid?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's just the liquid.

Um, I don't know
if this is a weird question, but...

Can I have some?

All right, fine. Tilt your head back,

and I'll lean my liquid
down into your mouth.

Oh, now I don't want it.

Oh, crap. Did I miss it?

Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times,

he may even be downright, well, stupid,

but I know he only accepted
that money because he...

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah!

You guys did this!
You guys (BLEEP) did this!

Talking about my guts?
(BLEEP) me up? (BLEEP) you!

Okay, this is good.
We got the D batteries.

-Let's get back to the present.
-All right, get on.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF) We made it.

Yeah, the Super Bowl was cool,

but frankly, no Tommy Brady,
no Stewie likey.

Brian, there you are.

Come quick, they're about to announce
the unveiling of your statue on the news.

Statue? For what?

What do you think, Mr. National Hero?

For stopping the 9/11 terrorist attacks
and saving our country.

Oh, you... I can't even express
how mad I am at you right now.

If it wasn't for you, those planes
would've hit the World Trade Center.

Brian, what the hell did you do?

I, uh, may have told
my former self about 9/11.

What did I tell you
about altering the past?

Wait... Wait, when did you even do that?

Well, you remember when I said
I was going to take a leak?

Brian, you shouldn't have done that.

Who knows what unforeseen
consequences are awaiting us.

Saddam Hussein could be president.

Mexico could be the world's
dominant super power.

Cookie Monster could have
invented Facebook!

-What is this?
-Cookiebook.

Yeah, buddy.
Great job stopping those terrorists.

And thank God their follow-up attack
on St. Louis was a bust.

MAN: We missed!

Brian, I promise you,
all of this can only end badly.

Stewie, it's fine. I prevented 9/11.

How could that possibly be a bad thing?

I mean, come on, I...
I saved, like, 200 lives.

-3,000.
-Wow. 3,000?

Oh, you knew what you were doing there.

TOM ON TV: <i>This major</i>
<i>breaking news just in.</i>

<i>Nine Southern states have declared</i>

<i>that they are seceding</i>
<i>from the United States.</i>

<i>The announcement came</i>
<i>from former President George W. Bush,</i>

<i>who reformed the Confederacy</i>

<i>after a bitter loss</i>
<i>in his 2004 reelection bid.</i>

Bush lost in 2004?

Yeah, he probably couldn't exploit
people's fears with no 9/11.

<i>Bush appeared before the press today</i>
<i>to make this brief statement.</i>

<i>If anyone out there can get</i>

<i>It... This... Uh, okay,</i>
<i>that was George W. Bush</i>

Oh, my God. Civil war?

See, Brian? This is exactly
what I was talking about.

Look, Stewie,
this doesn't necessarily mean

things are gonna turn out badly.

In fact, I bet, five years from now,

the world will still be
better off for what I did.

Is that so?

Well, Brian,
if you're that sure of yourself,

then let's go five years into the future,
and you can prove me wrong.

Fine.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Wow. This is the future?
Everything looks slicker.

Hey, Lois, I found some double-sided tape.

I think I can do about seven minutes
worth of funny stuff with it.

That should get us
to the Meg kissing booth story.

Wow. Things have gotten kind of lazy, huh?

Hey, Peter. Thanks for letting me borrow
your screwdriver set.

You know, I just want to say
how nice it is

to be back here
with y'all on Spooner Street.

Oh, I guess things
didn't work out in Virginia.

Chris, I heard you got
a D on your report card.

Here's a cutaway.

Matthew McConaughey is terrible.

Good Lord. What's happened to us?

Okay, maybe things seem a little off,

but other than that, the world seems okay,
which proves my point.

Me stopping 9/11
led to a world that's just fine.

Well, I'll see y'all tomorrow.

(GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS)

Brian, you might want to look outside.

Oh, my God.

(CLEVELAND SCREAMING)

Freeze, Frogmire. You are out past curfew,

and therefore,
in violation of local ordinance.

Ribbity.

What the hell happened?
Could I really have caused all this?

It says here that the new
American civil war

you set into motion ended up in a series

of concentrated nuclear strikes
all along the Eastern Seaboard.

It killed 17 million people.

Oh.

-Including Cesar Millan.
-No!

Okay, okay, I get it...
Stewie, I screwed up.

All right? I shouldn't
have altered the past.

Is there anything we can do?

Well, the only way to fix this

is to return to the moment
when we first arrived in the past

and stop you from spilling
the beans about 9/11.

Okay. Okay, let's do it.

BRIAN FROM INSIDE HOUSE: Whoa, ass ahoy.

All right, look, there we are.

FROM INSIDE HOUSE:
Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00

and you've still got your pants on.
What's the occasion?

Stop! Both of you!

What the hell? Who are you?

We're you, from the future.

Oh, boy, this can't be good news.

-Who screwed up?
-Take a wild guess.

-What did I do?
-Well, nothing yet, but listen.

Whatever you do, you cannot tell
your former self, that Brian, about 9/11.

If you do, America as you know it
will cease to exist.

My God, Brian. What the hell?

We've been here two minutes,
and already you've destroyed America.

Okay, okay. I promise
I won't say anything.

Also, if you don't give
that Stewie a back rub,

it really messes everything up.

All right, can we go now?

-Did that do it? Did we restore the past?
-Well, let's check.

-"9/11."
-(COMPUTER BEEPS)

Oh, there it is. We did it, Brian.
We made 9/11 happen.

-High five! All right!
-All right!

-Yeah!
-High five!

Wow, that... That probably
wouldn't look very good out of context.

There's the writer
of the Harry Potter series.

Must be weird hanging out
with us Muggles, huh, Brian?

-Yeah.
-Well, laundrium insertum.

Huh? (LAUGHS)

Oh, my God. All right,
you obviously have no self-control,

so we've got to go back and do this again.

-BRIAN: Whoa, ass ahoy.
-All right, let's go.

BRIAN: Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00

and you've still got your pants on.

Oh, yeah, that's right. We were just here.

-BRIAN AND STEWIE: Wait!
-Who the devil are you?

-We're from the future.
-So are we.

We're from the further future.

-We came to stop you.
-Why?

What they did actually
turns out to be damage-free.

It's what you're about to do,
stopping them, that causes utter bedlam.

Oh, come on.

-Wait!
-Stop!

We're from the further, further future.

What you guys do eventually works out.

It's what you two are about to do
that ruins everything!

-Stop!
-Don't do anything!

Oh, for God's sake.

We're from the further
further further future.

What these two do is fine.

It's what you two do
that makes things worse.

-Stop!
-Wait!

-Hold it!
-Stop!

-Wait!
-No!

-Hold it!
-Stop!

I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm just looking for the can.

-Don't move!
-Hold it!

-Freeze!
-Stop!

-Wait!
-No!

-Oh, for God's sake, why?
-This is why!

-Don't move!
-Hold it!

-Freeze!
-Stop!

-No!
-Wait!

Oh, my God. What's that?

(ECHOES) I don't know what happened.
This is life for some reason.

Don't do whatever you're about to do.

God help us. This is no way to live.

(BOTH RETCHING)

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

-No, don't do it!
-Halt!

All right, everybody, shut the hell up!

All right, this is (BLEEP), all right?

I can't follow what's going on anymore,

and I'm assuming
the rest of you can't, either.

So, let's make this easy and take a vote.

How many think we should prevent 9/11?
Raise your hands.

One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine...

Okay, all right, looks like 42.

All right, who votes "yes 9/11?"

(MUTTERING)

Okay, all right, 57. All right, 9/11 wins.

Wait, wait, shouldn't it be
an even number?

Why is the total an odd number?

Oh, yeah, I think one of the Brians died.

-What? What do you mean?
-I don't know.

One of them landed here
with its throat slit.

But wait, if one of me is dead,

then shouldn't all the me's be dead?

Brian, I... I don't... It's...

I don't... I don't know anymore. I...
You know what? I guess not. All right?

Okay, listen up. Everybody, get back in

your individual time machines
very carefully.

Nobody touch anything.
No Harry Potter novels.

Don't step on a bug.

Don't give earlier yous investment advice.

Just go back to where
you came from, and stay there!

There. Now, we're going to do

what we should have done
in the first place. Get on.

Wait a minute.
Isn't this where we just were?

-Where are the other two us's?
-They're not here yet.

Just to make sure there are absolutely
no loose ends,

I've sent us back in time to the moment
just before you and I originally arrived.

-Why?
-You'll see.

Get the (BLEEP) back in your time machine!

-Ahhh!
-Who are you?

Never mind who I am!

get back to the present, and stay there!

Look, just calm down. (SCREAMS)

You gonna flap your lips
or you gonna do what I said?

-Okay, okay.
-All right! God!

You just talked to yourself.
Won't that alter the past?

Don't worry, Brian.

If I was successful
in restoring the past just now,

you and I will never have existed.

The chronological tangent
that created us will have been erased.

-Oh. Is it gonna hurt?
-Just a little.

Ow.

Oh, God, my leg is killing me.

Well, time travel is risky.

Every time you step into that machine,

you invite the possibility
of altering the world as we know it.

Thankfully, the alternate versions of us
were there to prevent us from doing

whatever it is we apparently did.

-I wonder what it was.
-We'll never know.

But look on the bright side.

You might be sitting here
with a hole in your leg,

but at least our present
universe hasn't been affected.

Sorry, guys. I'm gonna need the couch.

The gang and I are gonna watch the game.

All right, let's unplug
the TV and get going.

JOYCE: <i>And we're</i>
<i>back with our coverage</i>

<i>of the Quahog</i><i>Thanksgiving Day Parade.</i>

Happy Turkey Day, Quahog.

This is Tom Tucker and Joyce Kinney
live at the parade.

We've got some on-and-off
drizzle here today,

and we're a little wet, as you can see,

because, apparently, there are
no awnings that exist anywhere.

There's your top news story right there.

Mysterious awning shortage
ravages the Northeast,

but miraculously has not
affected Channels 2 or 6.

No, no. Keep the camera over there.
I want everyone to see it.

This is why we're third.

And here comes our first float
of the day, Tom.

It's the James Woods High football team

with their <i>Not Gay Revue.</i>

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>We just won the big game</i>

(SNAPS THREE TIMES)

<i>We just won the big game</i>

<i>-We drilled 'em and banged 'em</i>

<i>And plowed 'em a lot</i>

<i>And though that</i><i>sounds suggestive</i>

BARITONE:
<i>Let me stress that it's not</i>

-(CAR ALARM BLARING)
-And here comes

the Rocky and Bullwinkle float.

Always a popular sight here at the par...

(STAMMERS) Somebody want to handle that?

Does some... Does some...

Does somebody want to deal with that?

The car alarm, "what."

You're kidding.

Well, viewers, to top it off,

that's the Channel 5
news van you're hearing.

Phil, Phil just open it...
Unlock the doors.

You don't have to put the key
in the ignition.

Well, open the driver's side first.

Okay, well, I guess it's broken, then,

and there's nothing we can do about it.

Okay, happy Thanksgiving, Quahog.

Here's a car alarm.

-(ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)
-(SIGHS)

All right, well, I guess we'll just...

-(ALARM STOPS WITH A TWEET)
-Ah, there we go.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Oh, that must be Joe and Bonnie.

Now remember everyone, let's be cheerful,

'cause Thanksgivings
are very hard for them.

-'Cause Joe can't walk?
-No.

'Cause his bum doesn't
open up to poo anymore,

and a nurse has to go digging up there
to get up after his stuff?

(LAUGHS) Oh, my God!

(LAUGHS) I know.

That was told to me in confidence.

No. Don't you remember, Peter?

It was on Thanksgiving
that their son Kevin got killed in Iraq.

Look who's here!

Happy Thanksgiving.

Gobble gobble.

You guys, thanks so much
for having us over.

Well, we're just glad
we can have people over again

now that that giant crab's gone.

Hey, guys, how ya doin'? Come on in.

(RAPID STACCATO) No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no.

Just go around it. He's not gonna hurt ya.

-Just go around it.
-No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no.
No-no-no-no-no.

All right, try just going under him.

I think we should probably just go home.

Maybe we'll do it another time.

No-no-no-no-no.

What the hell? Mom!

Mom, it's me! Mom!

Oh, yeah, it's a baby.

It's a big balloon, baby,
just like you're a baby.

No, it's me! It's a balloon of me!

Peter, come look at this.

He sees a baby and knows
that he's also a baby.

So smart.

Mama's smart little boy.

Ah, check out Quagmire.

It's been a year and a half,

and he still looks
uncomfortable around his dad.

Well, it's a big adjustment.

After all, his dad did have
a sex-change operation.

So, uh, how... How are things, Dad?

Oh, Glenn, I can't tell you
how wonderful it is to be back here.

This is gonna be a really
special Thanksgiving.

Happy Thanksgiving!

We brought chicken wings.

Oh, yum. I hope they're the
kind with the bone removed.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, Aunt Carol. Hey, Uncle Adam.

<i>La la la la la</i>

Don't mention last night's <i>Project Runway.</i>

I've got it on TiVo.

Happy Thanksgiving.

I brought marshmallow Peeps.

Oh. Okay.

I'm gonna need that Pyrex dish back.

Okay.

I'm gonna need it back now.

Oh.

I don't want anything else today
to get as tense as that just got.

Carol, it's so good to see you.

You, too, Lois.

God, that is one nice ass.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

(TV PLAYING)

This is nice.

This is very nice,

the time that we're spending
together right now.

Easy, Joe.

(GROANS)

Sorry. Just making mental memories

for when you're all inevitably dead,
and I'm left alone.

Geez. Quagmire, help me out with this.

No, he's right. I mean, sometimes
chicks die, and it's not anyone's fault.

Okay, everyone, it's 2:30.

-(TV SWITCHES OFF)
-Time for dinner.

'Cause on Thanksgiving,
2:30 is dinnertime for some reason.

Oh, my.

Lois, those sweet potatoes look delicious.

That's the stuffing, Ma.

Now put on your glasses before
you run over another black guy.

Oh, this looks fantastic.

I can't wait to poop this out.

Hey! Who's gonna get
the Thanksgiving dump trophy this year?

-You are!
-Dad's gonna get it!

Who else?

(ALL LAUGHING)

Loving. Loving family.

Well, dig in, everyone!

-Hello, Ida.
-Hello, Brian.

-How have you been?
-Very well, thank you.

He threw up when he found out
you were a monster.

This food is so (BLEEP) good, Lois.

Oh. Okay. Wow.

MAN: Hey! Is there room
at that table for one more?

(ALL GASP)

Oh, my God!

Kevin Swanson!

Son, you're alive!

Aw, and I stayed up all night
writing dead kid jokes.

All right, you know what,
I'm gonna do one anyway.

Kevin, go back outside.

Hey, everybody pretend this didn't happen.

Hey, Joe, what's your favorite
preparation of a tomato?

Is it son-died tomato?

Is it son-died tomato?

Okay, Kevin, you can come back in.

Welcome home, soldier.

(CHUCKLES) Son-died tomato.

(SLIDE WHISTLE SQUEAKS)

Kevin, you're alive!

I don't believe it.

Oh, my God, it's a miracle!

Well, I guess you replaced real butter
as the star of the dinner.

But I don't understand.

The Army said you'd been killed in action.

What happened?

Well, it's quite a story.

In some ways, Army life in Iraq
is what you'd expect,

<i>what with the blistering heat,</i>
<i>the constant sense of impending danger,</i>

<i>and the one gay soldier</i>
<i>awkwardly avoiding the use of pronouns.</i>

Man, I sure miss my sweetheart back home.

I can't wait to get back to that person.

Chow time, boys.

Yes, sir, Sergeant Major General Captain!

Ah, come on, boys, it's Thanksgiving.

Call me Major General Captain.

Now you eat up.

I don't trust that turkey
those Iraqis made.

Ah, you're all wet, Swanson.

I call the white meat!

I call the dark meat!

I call the cell phone
duct-taped to the side!

No!

They're all dead, sir, except for Swanson.

He's in a coma
but he's unlikely to recover.

Okay, well, just send Swanson's parents
a letter saying

that he's dead,
'cause those are already printed.

You know what?
Send one to my parents, too.

I spent five years
in a Kuwait military hospital.

I woke up from the coma last week,

and I flew straight here.

Kind of a Thanksgiving surprise.

Hey, when you get sexually
abused while you're in a coma,

do you know it's happening
and just can't do anything about it?

Or do you not even know what's going on?

I also am curious about that.

Hey, Kevin, you know I put a yellow ribbon
on my car for you guys?

And-and a little thing that says
"I support the troops."

'Cause there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you guys.

But I don't have
any change on me right now.

Well, all that matters
is that my boy is home.

Kevin, I want you to meet
your little sister, Susie.

Wow. Hey, little sis.

I guess we got
some catching up to do, huh?

Hope you don't get scared
when I scream and have night terrors.

SUSIE: (AS PATRICK STEWART)
<i>It's quite all right.</i><i>I've seen worse.</i>

(HORROR MOVIE SCORE PLAYS)

(WOMAN SCREAMS ON TV)

SUSIE: (AS PATRICK STEWART)
<i>A human centipede. How ghastly.</i>

Your mother and I
are very proud of you, Kevin.

You're a war hero.

I don't feel like a war hero.

Only a war hero would say that.

Hey, so what about the female soldiers
over there?

Were they able to contribute?

Eh, you know, they did their best.

What with their regular bleedings,
when they got shot, did they even know?

Look, guys, I'm not a hero.

And I don't want to be treated
any different than before.

Just that you would say that
means we should treat you different.

Come on, guys, let's give him
all our best food.

Okay, now you eat up, and then
we're all gonna go out back

and play some Thanksgiving
touch football... Excuse me,

war hero Thanksgiving touch football.

-Yeah!
-USA!

I didn't even know there was a war.

Okay, let's pick teams.

I'll be a captain,

and, uh, Mayor West, you can be a captain.

All right. I pick you.

You can't pick me, I'm a captain.

No one had ever stood up to me
like that before.

I respected him from there on out.

That's a great story, Grandpa.

I didn't like it.

None of my grandchildren

had ever disliked one
of my stories before.

From then on, he was my favorite.

Well, I don't like that
story, Great Grandpa.

(CRACKLING)

Future old people are wizards.

(SLURRED) Okay, so here's the game:

I'm... I'm drunk,

and I'm gonna throw the football
too hard at my kids.

Oh, Dad, do we have to... Ow!

Don't cry! Don't cry!

Game's over if you cry.

I want you to learn about life, Chris,

'cause of, in life it's like this.

Peter, I think you may
have had one too many.

Maybe it's time to ease off, huh?

What are you talking about, Lois?

Dads getting drunk on Thanksgiving
is a holiday tradition.

(SLURRING) I work hard
to put a cornucopia on this table,

and you're out showing your lower ankle

to every Tom, Tom,
and other Tom in our village!

Don't talk to mother in like fashion!

That's it. The belt is coming off.

All right, Son.

Let's put these bozos in a hurt locker.

Right? 'Cause, uh, "hurt locker" means
some kind of war hero thing, or something.

(SCOFFS) My friends and I used to laugh
about how fake that movie is.

But...

Well, wait, I, uh...

I'm pretty sure that movie came out
after you went into your coma.

Right... No, no, uh, I... I...
I was talking about a different movie.

Let's play ball!

Yeah, let's play ball.

-(BALL PINGS ON SOMEONE)
-(GLENN GROANS)

PETER: (SLURRED)
The world has changed around me,

and I'm mad and scared!

Lois, this pumpkin pie looks delightful.

Hey, Kevin, can I see your Purple Heart?

'Cause I never actually seen one.

One... One time this homeless guy
showed me his purple head,

but looking back, I'm... I'm not so sure
that that was really a military thing.

(SCOFFS) I didn't want that stupid medal.

You know what I did with it?

I threw it back over
the White House fence.

Wait a minute. I thought you said
you flew straight home from Kuwait

after you woke from your coma.

When did you throw your medal
over the White House fence?

(STAMMERING) No, I told you, I flew to DC,
ditched the medals, and flew home.

I guess that was just
his dirty hobo penis, huh?

Kevin, why would you want to get rid of
your war medals like that?

'Cause it was a stupid war, you know?

All it did was put me in a coma
and kill one of my bunkmates

and cripple the other one for life.

(STAMMERS) Wait a minute.
Now, I thought earlier you said

that both of your bunkmates were killed.

Now you're saying only one of them was?

But I just want you guys to know

I barely even stared
at that penis for an hour.

What? Come on, Dad.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Whatev.

(STAMMERS) Hey, why's it so hot in here?

It's too hot in here.

Wait a minute. An Ed Hardy T-shirt?

That particular strain of douchebag
didn't arise until 2007,

while you were supposedly in your coma.

Look, get off my case, Dad!

What do you want from me?

The truth.

Fine! Here's the truth!

I was never in any coma, okay?

I bailed.

-I faked my death and went AWOL.
-(ALL GASP)

I faked my own death once.

(SOBBING)

(DIRT CRUNCHING)

(CHUCKLES)

No dentist appointment for this guy.

So, there it is.

I'm not a war hero.

I abandoned my platoon.

So now what do we do?

Me?

Am... Am I, am I supposed
to say something?

Kevin,

you're under arrest for
the crime of desertion.

Oh, my.

Um, maybe it's time for us girls
to hit the powder room.

You may use the yard.

So you were lying to us this whole time?

You weren't really injured in Iraq?

First Pat Tillman lies about how he died
and now you?

Kevin, I don't understand.

There's nothing to understand.

Our son is a deserter.

Come on, Kevin, I'm taking you to jail.

-Joe, wait!
-Not now, Bonnie.

Joe, you can't!

Bonnie, we'll discuss this later!

Joe! You're not taking my son anywhere.

Damn it, you guys
are ruining Thanksgiving!

And it's my second favorite holiday,

right after Pretend Not
To Notice People's Race Day.

Hey, you seen Reggie around?

Which one is Reggie?

Oh, uh, today he's wearing yellow pants,

uh, yellow shirt, yellow
hat, yellow shoes.

Uh, he's got a gold tooth,
uh, diamond earring.

Um, he's got that big necklace
with the dollar sign on it.

Uh, he's always grabbing his crotch
when he's telling a story.

Like the one about when he found out
his mother is really his grandmother.

Could you be more specific?

Uh, oh, let's see.

Uh, he always wears cheap cologne.

Uh, drives a Mercury Cougar
with a crown on the dashboard.

Uh, never pays his alimony.

Uh, he's extremely cut
for a guy who never works out.

Oh, there he is. Thanks anyway.

Hey, Reggie!

Look, maybe we should just let Kevin
explain why he did what he did.

(SIGHS)

At first, I believed in the cause.

But then I saw what we were
doing to the people of Iraq.

Innocent people.

There was one that I'll never forget.

<i>He was a little Iraqi street kid.</i>

<i>I'd befriended him a few months earlier.</i>

<i>Couldn't have been more than 12 years old.</i>

<i>I taught him how to crack wise,</i>
<i>American style.</i>

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

I guess that store's having a fire sale.

(LAUGHS)

<i>I tell you, that kid was</i>
<i>strong-headed for his age.</i>

<i>Smart, but innocent.</i>

<i>And then one day, there was a fire fight.</i>

<i>We bring in this civilian</i>
<i>who got killed in the crossfire.</i>

<i>I pull back the sheet, and who is it?</i>

<i>Not the kid, but, like,</i>

<i>the kid's dad's, like,</i>
<i>coworker's neighbor.</i>

<i>He was 74 and he had actually</i>
<i>tried to rape someone.</i>

<i>But just looking down at his dead face</i>

<i>and knowing that he lived near someone</i>
<i>who worked with the dad</i>

<i>of the kid whose name I never found out,</i>
<i>I lost all hope.</i>

<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>I had to get out of Iraq.</i>

<i>I just had to wait for my chance.</i>

I call the white meat!

I call the dark meat!

I call the cell phone
duct-taped to the side!

No!

<i>Somehow, I'd been spared</i>
<i>that Thanksgiving.</i>

<i>But I can't say the same for my bunkmates.</i>

<i>There were bits and pieces</i>
<i>of them everywhere.</i>

<i>I knew the Army would never be able</i>
<i>to identify who was who.</i>

<i>So that was my chance to disappear.</i>

So I left.

How could you do that?

-Coward!
-Traitor!

If you think that I'm gonna masturbate
after this tonight, you're right.

We don't have to sit here
and listen to this.

Come on, Kevin, let's get out of here.

-Nice try, skank.
-Worth a shot.

Well, where did you go
after you left the war?

I spent a few years laying low.

Wrote some poems. You want to hear some?

-No.
-Are you sure? They're pretty intense.

-ALL: No.
-Here, let me just read one.

If I can guess a line in there,
will you not read it?

I don't think you'll be able
to guess a line.

Is it something like,
"Ice burns as hot as fire"?

Okay, so then I went to Europe,
Australia, Canada, all over.

But I really missed you guys.

I wanted to be with people who love me,
no matter what.

So I came home.

Well, it sounds to me like

you're a regular Benedict Arnold Drummond.

(STAMMERS) What's he expecting us
to cut to?

I think he wants maybe... I don't know...

Gary Coleman in a Napoleon hat?

But we don't have that.

We... We got to come up with something.

Uh, well, we got, uh, we got

"The Cowardly Lion is
Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist."

Play it, play it.

-But he didn't set it up.
-Play it!

All right, I'm gonna
check her for diseases.

There's just one thing I want you to do.

-What's that?
-What's that?

Talk me out of it.

TIN MAN AND SCARECROW:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

What the hell is going on up there?

Well, I'm sorry
you all feel the way you do.

But I walked away from
an illegal war of aggression

being fought 6,000 miles away
from our shores.

Better there than here
where all my stuff is.

So, what, you figured you'd just
let 'em get away with 9/11?

Mr. Griffin,
Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.

And the war we started in Iraq
has killed a half a million

of their people, which is like 200 9/11's.

So, I guess those moments
of silence we had

at those sporting events
meant nothing to you.

I'm just saying this war is wrong.

Son, your job isn't to decide
whether it's right or wrong.

Your job is to follow orders.

Well, that's what the Nazi
soldiers did, isn't it?

They followed orders.

You're saying our troops
are like the Nazis?

No, I'm just saying that
blindly following orders has resulted

in the deaths of millions of people
throughout history.

You know, I have not talked
to Carol all night.

Carol, how are you?

Look, I think you guys are
all rushing to judge Kevin

without knowing what it was like
to be in his shoes.

He saw horrific things, in a horrific war,

that only one other person here

could possibly come close
to understanding: Ida.

She was in the military.

She's seen battle.

She's seen innocent people
butchered by war machines.

And I'm sure that Ida,
more than anyone else here,

can understand and support
the choice that Kevin made.

No, Brian, I do not understand
Kevin's choice, and I do not support it.

Okay, well,
that's just some dumb drag queen.

Son, when you go to war, you don't end up

fighting for your country
or your family or your flag.

You're fighting for your fellow soldiers
there in the foxhole with you.

You walked out on those men,
and that's what's most unforgivable.

You know what, everyone? Forget it.

Up till today,
you guys thought I was dead.

Well, I'm not. But after all this,

Dad, you may as well take me to prison,
'cause right now I wish I was dead.

If anyone has wanted whip cream
on their pie, it's not my fault.

I can't get a (BLEEP) word
in edgewise around here.

Kevin, I don't want to lose you again.

But I do have a job to do.

So get moving.

'Cause there's at least one Swanson man
in this room who does his duty.

-Doodie means poop.
-It does.

Are you, Dad?

Are you the only one who does his duty?

That's not how I remember it.

What are you talking about?

You don't remember, do you?

I was in first grade.

<i>You took me out with you</i>
<i>on one of your shifts.</i>

I just think it's presumptuous.

I mean, come on,
"the country's best yogurt"?

You know, prove it.

Show me your data.

MAN: Help! Police!

That man's a thief!

Go get him, Dad!

(GRUNTS)

Reach for the sky, dirtbag!

What the hell?

I'm sorry, Officer.

I... I was just trying to feed my family.

I don't care what you were trying to do,
you broke the law.

I know.

I didn't know what else to do.

I have three very wide-eyed children
to feed.

Wide-eyed children are the hungriest.

Kids, Daddy has to go away
for a while, okay?

Take care of Mommy
until she dies tomorrow.

It's okay, Daddy.

I'll be the man of the shack
while you're gone.

(COUGHING)

Uh, listen, there's been a mistake.

I'm not here to arrest your father.

-You're not?
-No, Son.

I just came over to tell you
what a great guy your father is

and how hard he's been
working for all of you.

Wait. You're letting me go?

I don't understand.

I'm not sure I do either. (SIGHS)

I know the law says I have to arrest you.

But sometimes the law
is just a piece of paper.

There's right, there's wrong,

and somewhere in between, there's life.

You folks have a good day.

I never forgot what you did.

Well, thanks for coming, you guys.

You know what you were
doing that day, Dad?

You were breaking the law.

You knew what your duty told you
you were supposed to do,

but instead,
you did what you thought was right.

I haven't thought about that family
in years.

I think about them all the time.

And the example you set for me that day.

It's the very reason I left Iraq.

It sucks how early I have to work.

(SIGHS) Well, Kevin,

I still can't say
that I agree with your choice.

Not one bit.

But I suppose sometimes a man
has to do what he thinks is right.

And if that's what you thought was right,
I guess I can accept it.

I'm glad you're home, Son.

Me, too, Dad.

You know, there's still
some pumpkin pie left, everyone.

That sounds good to me.

Me, too.

Hey, happy Thanksgiving to us all, huh?

(EXCITED CHATTERING)

(CHANTING) USA! USA!

MAN: Wait!

That man's an imposter.

I'm the real Kevin Swanson!

Guys, I don't think we have time for this.

The best roller coaster
in all of Quahog.

The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen: The Ride.

You know, I think they kind
of figured that movie

was going to turn out
to be bigger than it was.

Oh, come on, Lois,
it'll be awesome.

It simulates all the fun of...

of, um... w-what was it now?

It was like a...
like a tall guy in a black hat

-and a cape or something?
-Yeah, yeah,

and there was the guy with
the mask who wore a mask.

And one guy had an umbrella.

Yeah, and I believe
he opened it at one point.

Yeah, and it wasn't overly long.

Yeah, not... not overly long.

Sorry, sir, there's a weight
limit on this coaster.

Oh, really, what's the limit?

The rule is you can't look hilarious
on this motor scooter.

(LAUGHING)

I'm sorry,
there's just no way.

<i>Big news out of Six Flags</i>
<i>Columbus today,</i>

<i>as they unveil</i>
<i>what promises to be</i>

<i>the largest roller coaster</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

<i>That's right, Joyce.</i>
<i>They call it The Holocaust.</i>

<i>The ride has several</i>
<i>Jewish groups up in arms...</i>

<i>as they go over</i>
<i>the first rise.</i>

(CHUCKLES)
<i>No, I'm... I'm kidding.</i>

<i>They're actually pretty upset.</i>

Wow. I had heard
about the Holocaust,

but I never believed it
till right now.

I have to ride that ride.

Peter, come on, they're
not going to let you that ride either.

You're overweight.

Yeah, if you want to
ride that roller coaster,

you're going to have
to go on a diet.

A diet, huh?
All right, well, how's that work?

Well, I suppose you can start
by keeping a food journal,

like Quagmire does.

Yeah, in fact, I got it right here.

"Today I ate peaches...
ginger...

honey... candy... olive..."
You know what?

This is the wrong list.

All right, if that's what
it takes to ride that ride,

I am going on a diet.

And I'm not stopping
till I look as good

as my great Aunt
"Legs-Go-All-The- Way-Up" Griffin.

Hey, baby, do those legs
go all the way up?

Why, yes, they do.

(SCREAMING) Oh, my God!
You're a monster!

Come back.

My legs are shaved
like a little girl.

-Hey, what do you got there, Peter?
-Rice cakes.

Never had one,
but somebody told me

this is a really good
way to start your diet.

(SCREAMING)

(COUGHING AND GAGGING)

(RETCHING)

Who?

Who could think of such
a horrible thing?!

(EVIL LAUGHTER)

We know you not like
rice cake.

<i>Ricey, ricey rice,</i>
<i>no one like rice cakes</i>

(GONG CHIMING)

All right, Peter, the most important thing
when you're on a diet is willpower.

Now I'm going to put this steaming pie
on the windowsill to cool.

Now no matter how many
beckoning fingers

that steam morphs into
or how badly it tries

to sneak its way up your nose,
I want you to resist the urge

to levitate off the ground
and float towards the pie.

Doesn't seem too hard.

All right,
go stand over there.

(LAUGHING)
No, you don't.

No, no,
you can't go in there.

No, no, stay out of there.
That's my special area!

(SCREAMS)
No, stop!

I'm saying no!

(SCREAMING)

What kind of pie is this?!

Peter, it's making me watch!

Peter, I don't understand why
we have to drive all the way

to Ohio to ride a stupid roller coaster.

Yeah, besides, they're still
not going to let you on.

You haven't actually
lost any weight.

Oh, I think my lithe figure
would suggest otherwise.

A girdle is not a substitute
for weight loss, Peter.

Hey, I'm riding that roller coaster,
and that's all there is to it.

Now let's get out of here.

This thing's squishing
all my organs around.

(HEART BEATING)

There it is, kids. Columbus, Ohio.

Now remember, there are no rules
about who can wear stretch pants here,

so you're going to see
some pretty shocking things.

Brian, is this our vacation?

Yeah.

Oh.

Are we trash?

Kind of.

Oh.

I'm sorry, sir.
You're too fat to ride the coaster.

Aw, darn it.

Yeah, why don't you go back
to your pond, hippo?

(LAUGHING)

How about me, sir?

Am I too fat to ride?

No, you don't seem to be.

(LAUGHING CRAZILY)

Well, you got to hand it to him.
He had a dream and he made it happen.

That's what the Wright Brothers did.

So, how's your boyfriend,
Orville, doing?

Ex-boyfriend, if you don't mind.

And who cares?

He's probably off
in a barn somewhere

working on a contraption
with that weird brother of his.

-Ew.
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

ORVILLE:
Ha-ha, bitch.

You're so pretty. I miss you.

(GEARS GRINDING)

(CRASHING, PEOPLE SCREAMING)

PETER: Well, this has given me
a lot to think about.

WOMAN (SCREAMING):
My son is dead!

We are going to have to send
that family money.

-I know we are.
-Mom, I'm hungry.

Can we stop
and get some food?

Well, I guess it is close
to dinnertime.

Chris, Stewie, you hungry?

(YAWNING)

What are you looking at?

You going to propose?

-What?
-Yeah, exactly.

"What?" Eyes front.

-(ENGINE SPLUTTERING)
-What the hell?!

(LOUD HISSING)

Looks like it's the radiator.

Well, we're just going to have
to find a local mechanic.

On a Friday evening? I don't think
we're going to have any luck till Monday.

Besides, probably not a lot
of mechanics around here.

(HORSE NEIGHING)

So, we're stuck here?

Hey, Lois, you see
that barn out there?

You know who it was built by?

<i>By... Mennonites</i>

Well, I guess we better see
if there's a hotel or something.

I can't believe we're
stuck in Amish country.

Yeah, I thought
something was "a-mish."

Hey, uh, excuse me, fella?

Yeah, we're looking for a room.

Are ye indeed, outsiders?

We do not see many of
your folk in these parts,

but we welcome all of God's
children in their hour of need.

Well, actually, I think we need
it for more than an hour.

Or do we, right, Lois?

I... I do not last very long.

Ugh, creepy. What's this?

It's an Amish doll.
They're not allowed to have faces.

Has something
to do with vanity.

Looks like a cross-dressing
Cobra Commander.

-Who?
-Cobra Commander. He's the head of Cobra.

The bad guys from <i>G.I. Joe.</i>

The guys who oddly shout the name

of their terrorist organization
as they're attacking.

-Guys, we're under attack.
-By who?

I don't know.

(GUNFIRE)

Cobra!

-Oh, it's Cobra.
-Oh, of course.

Look, they have the pictures
of the snakes on their planes.

Duke, what have I been
saying for years?

What makes a good
terrorist organization?

-Brand recognition.
-Brand recognition.

Mom, I can't stay here.

There's no electricity,
no telephones, it's horrible.

Excuse me. I assure you,
our community is quite pleasant.

Perhaps I could
show thee around.

(AMOROUSLY) Okay.

My name is Eli.
My parents run the inn.

If there is anything we can do
to make your room more plain,

do not be afraid to ask.

Ah, we'll be all right.

A hotel in Amish country
can't be any worse

than staying in a youth hostel.

Hi, I'd like a room.

Uh, preferably one where I have to sleep
with my bag taped to my body.

We have one where some Italian
backpackers have laid out

every item of clothing
they own on all of the beds.

Oh, perfect. Will my bunkmates be
constantly talking about me

in a foreign language?

-Yes, they will, sir.
-Oh, great.

Uh, also, I'm going to have
some mail delivered here,

and I want it to sit in
that box for four years.

Oh, and what street
is the bathroom on?

So, what do you do
for fun around here?

We do chores and we watch
other people do chores.

Sounds kind of boring.

Alas, there are times when I feel as if
there is much of life I am missing.

Yeah, it'd be tough
having no technology.

I don't think I could
live without my iPhone.

You have an iPhone?

Yeah. You've heard of it?

Yes, but only because
people sometimes search

for Amish farms
on their iPhones.

Here comes one now.

Thanks for a fun evening, Eli.
And... and thanks for being so nice to me.

I think you are the most fascinating girl
I have ever met, Meg.

Here. I want you to have this.

-Your iPhone?
-Yeah.

I made you a playlist
of songs that I like.

Who is this I am hearing?

It's Avril Lavigne.

Why does she shout at me?

I don't know.

Most of my music I just
get pressured to buy.

Thank you for this gift, Meg.

Eli! What are you doing
with that outsider?

Her name is Meg, Father.

And I was just showing her
our community.

You stay away from her.
She will try to corrupt you.

That is not true, Father.
Meg is wonderful.

She is an outsider.

She does not follow
the one true path.

You are not to see
this girl again.

Do you understand?
I forbid it.

(DEJECTED SIGH)
Yes, sir.

Now come home at once.

And, as for you,

I suggest you stay away
from my son, you harlot.

(SOBBING)

Hey, there, young one,
why so sad?

It's just that I really like
this boy, but his dad...

Oh, look out.

-(LOUD SMACKS)
-(SCREAMING)

Sorry, there. Didn't realize
how long it'd been

since Ol' Dumper did his business.

He'll be done soon enough.

-(SMACKING CONTINUES)
-Oh, maybe not.

Doesn't sound
like pooping, does it?

Sounds more like someone
dropping sandwiches off a rooftop.

Watch out below, right?

Look like Hacky Sacks.

You'll be sorry
if you kick 'em, though.

All righty, well he seems
to be all done now.

You have a good evening...

-(SMACKING RESUMES)
-Oh, my goodness.

He must have gotten into
the chicken feed again.

You'd think they'd know
it wasn't in their diet,

but this is how they find out.

You may want to close your mouth.

(SOBBING)

Meg, what's wrong?

Eli's father, Ezekiel, said that
I can't see him anymore! (SOBS)

He said I was trying
to corrupt his son!

He did, did he?
Well, that does it!

We are gonna teach
this town how to dance!

Oh, Meg, I'm so sorry.

I'd try to talk to Eli's father
for you, honey,

but I don't know if it's my place.

Ezekiel wouldn't listen to you
anyway, Lois. You're a woman.

These people live in
a patriarchal society.

The only member of our family
whose word would carry

any weight would be Meg's father.

Dad, will you talk to Ezekiel?

Will you tell him
I'm not trying to corrupt his son?

Please?

All right, I'll do it.

But don't expect any miracles.
I'm not good with confrontation.

Like when I got stuck
behind that giraffe at the ball game.

Yeah! Nice hit!

Frozen rope! Awesome!

What just happened?

Ground rule double! Whoo!

I couldn't even see it.

Yeah, it was something.

Ducks on a pond!
Let's bring 'em in!

Could you please
sit down?

I am sitting down.
You sit up.

I am sitting up,
but I still can't see a thing.

Yeah, sounds
like a "you" problem.

Let's go, Sox!

Before we commence

with Samuel Fisher's
barn raising, let us pray.

Dear Amish Lord,

thou looketh sternly down
upon us, thine flock,

even though we did not
do anything wrong

and have been doing
chores like (BLEEP) crazy,

please make us humble,
and deliver us more hardship,

that we may get thick,
calloused hands,

much larger than other people's.

And grant that we become dull,
like Eric Bana,

who we have never seen,

but are just going by reputation
because it is your will.

We solemnly believe
that although humans

have been around for a million years,

you feel strongly that they had

just the right amount of technology

between 1835 and 1850;

not too little,
not too much.

Please deliver us
from Thomas Edison,

the worst human being
who ever lived.

And protect us from those who laugh
at our buggies or our hats

and deliver us from mustaches.

Amen.

Hey, uh, Ezekiel?

You must be Mr. Griffin.

Look, I know you guys are busy
with your barn raising and all,

but, um, you know,
I just wanted to tell you

how much my daughter Meg loves
your boy Eli.

I promise you, she ain't trying
to corrupt him or nothing.

Mr. Griffin, with all due respect,
we live in two different worlds.

I must do what is best
for my son... and I have.

Hey, how do we know
what's gonna happen?

For all we know,
Meg might want to Amish herself.

I had not considered this.

I was verily preoccupied
with Eli's corruption.

Plus, it is the time of the month
when Eli's mother is on the burlap.

So whaddaya say,
let the kids give it a shot?

-Perhaps, Mr. Griffin. Perhaps.
-Good.

Now on another note,
I notice you don't have

a damn lick of music
in this town.

We do not believe
in such ostentations.

Well, I am about
to change your mind.

Introducing rock 'n' roll!

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>I'm on a highway to hell!</i>

<i>Highway to hell!</i>

<i>I'm on the high...</i>

You are banished from
our community at once!

And take your whore daughter with you!

How did it go, Dad?

Very well, Meg.

My recollection is that
it went extremely well.

Really?! Oh, my God, Dad,
that's fantastic!

So I can see Eli again?

EZEKIEL: Griffins!

(CROWD CLAMORING)

What's going on here?

Your family must leave our community
and return to the outside world.

Dad, what's happening?
I thought you talked to him.

Sir, please, whatever your
quarrel is with my husband,

I'm sure it's probably justified,

but I'm begging you,
don't punish the children for it.

They're innocent in all this.

Innocent, are they?
I found this in Eli's corn hole!

Well, I... His what?

A compartment in Eli's room
where he stores his corn.

Oh. Well, okay, whatever you say.

Look, Ezekiel, we would love
to go back to the city, believe me.

I haven't had a drink in three days.
But our car broke down.

We... we can't go anywhere
until it gets fixed.

I have arranged
to have that taken care of.

This ride's gonna be so frustrating.

I know. These horses are

-so slow.
-Sexy.

Sexy.

STEWIE: Good-bye,
Abraham Lincoln people.

(SOBBING)

I'm sorry, Meg.

Eli was the best boy
I'll ever meet.

And now I'll never
see him again.

ELI:
Yes, you will, Meg.

(GASPS) Eli.

Eli? What are you doing here?

I could not let you
leave without me, Meg.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Hey, Lois, watch me lay rubber
in front of these losers.

Hyah!

Yeah! Choke on that, nerds.

Eli, I agree that your father was being
somewhat unreasonable,

but I don't think
running away is the answer.

I know, Mrs. Griffin.
And I am sorry.

But I just could not bear the thought
of never seeing Meg again.

You ever seen one of these, Eli?
It's a Coleco football game.

Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

You know what?
This is garbage to us.

(CLATTERING)

What the hell is that?

Holy crap! Who did this?

It must have been my father.

This is how the Amish
declare a feud.

But I thought they were non-violent.

We are, but Peter must have
really pissed off my dad.

Hey, who raked the leaves?

And look, somebody mowed the lawn.
I was supposed to do that.

Ha-ha! I have done your chores

to rob you of the joy
of doing chores.

You bastard.

Peter, we don't have a choice.
We've gotta bring Eli back.

Oh, no, we don't.

What are you talking about?

We... we can't be part
of a feud with the Amish.

I didn't start this thing, Lois,
but I'm gonna finish it.

Joe, go round up Quagmire

and all the modern-day
technology you can find.

We are going to war.

Oh. Oh, hey, Bonnie.

Is Joe there?

Well, can I leave
a message for him?

Yeah, it's what I said before
about the... the war thing.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(BEEPING)

All right, men, this is it.

Technology versus
old-timey wooden stuff.

Let's hit 'em hard.

What, again, was the nature
of your beef with them?

I don't know. Something about
a roller coaster. Let's go.

Apples... fire!

(ALL GASPING, YELLING)

-Ah! Damn it!
-Ow! God!

Quilters... advance!

Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Oh!

I bet this hurts so much!

(SCREAMS)

Ow! Damn it! I'm bleeding!

Oh, now it's an AIDS quilt.

(GASPS)

Suck on this,
you furry little weirdoes!

Enough of this crap.

Ezekiel.

Call off your boys and let's you
and me finish this man-to-man.

Indeed. Prepare for a goodly beating.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Dad, stop. Leave him alone.

Father, what are you doing?

I am going to kill that man.

-That man is my girlfriend, Meg.
-(PETER LAUGHS)

This is against everything
our people stand for.

Will you listen to me
for one moment?

You were so worried
about these outsiders

coming into our community
and corrupting me.

But look at yourself.

You're the one who's allowed
yourself to be corrupted.

God in heaven...

you are right.
I am deeply ashamed.

I only wanted to protect you.

I know you did, Father.

PETER: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

(SIGHS)
Son, it is your life to live.

I must accept the life you choose.

I choose to stay here.

-What?!
-What?!

Meg, you are the most beautiful woman
I will ever know.

You have shown me
so many wondrous things

that have opened my eyes
to the world beyond my home.

But this is where I belong.

I'm sorry if this upsets you, Meg.

(VOICE BREAKING)
I love you, Eli.

I'll always love you.

If this is what you have to do,
then all I can say is...

I'll never forget you.

(SIGHS) I am sorry there has
been conflict between us.

Allow me to make amends.

Please help yourself
to anything in my corn hole.

Hey, don't worry about it.
We can still be pals.

And I know just the place for us
to go and blow off all this steam.

<i>You also promised you'd fix</i>
<i>that shelf in the garage.</i>

Oh, Lois, I'm losing you.

(MAKES STATIC NOISES)

Hello? Hello?

<i>-Hello?</i>
-Oh, hey, Lois.

This is somebody else now.

There must've been
a cross connection.

My name is Mike,
and I'm somewhere else

trying to make my own call.

<i>Fine, Mike.</i>

<i>You tell Peter he's in trouble</i>
<i>when he gets home.</i>

You can tell him yourself,
because Mike is Peter!

<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Are you serious?</i>

<i>That was very good, Peter.</i>

I know!

(SIGHS) Jeez.

That's all my life is lately,
just a bunch of chores.

I'm sick of Lois always
making me do stupid stuff.

I know what you're saying, Peter.

Bonnie's always making me do
all these impossible household tasks.

BONNIE: Joe, make sure you get
all the tire tracks out of the carpet.

Learn to live with it, Bonnie!

There are tracks!

People make tracks!

Boy, I hear you, too.
It's a lot of work just to keep

my single guy fridge
sufficiently depressing.

Let's see.
Ex-girlfriend's Yoplait.

Root beer from two Julys ago.

Here we go, expired milk.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God,
Jenny, look how young you look.

I sympathize with y'all.

Donna makes me listen to
Gayle King on XM Radio 19 hours a day.

I tried to kill myself by

swallowing a nail clipper,
but I passed it.

What the hell happened to us?

We used to be able to do
whatever the hell we wanted.

Now here we are,
in the prime of our lives,

and we're slaves to our women.

I know. An exciting day for me

is when I watch wheelchair porn.

Boy, do the sparks fly on those.

Oh, is it hot?

Nah, it's mostly just chairs
smashing into each other.

Sometimes the director
has to come on camera

just to turn
the chairs around.

Well, why don't we make
our own excitement?

-What do you mean?
-I don't know, like,

maybe the four of us should
do something to reclaim our freedom.

Like go on a road trip,
find some adventure.

Quagmire, that's a great idea!

Let's do a road trip!
Who's in?

No. No, no.

No, n... not you, Seamus.

SEAMUS:
Ah, poo.

All right, listen up, ladies.

We got something to say
and we ain't taking "no" for an answer.

We are going on a road trip.

We don't know how long
we'll be gone,

and don't expect a call
from us to check in.

This trip is about men being men.

We will drive after a couple of beers

and not make a big federal case about it.

We're gonna sneeze and not
put our hand over (BLEEP).

And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop us!

Yeah, okay with me.

-Sure.
-Fine.

That'll be nice. It'll give us a chance
to have some girl time.

Oh. All right, then.

Where are you boys going?

We're going to New Orleans.
The party capital of America.

Home of the
All-You-Can-Pee Street.

I'll tell you one thing,
it's all about the beads down there.

We all know what's going on here.

It's just implied, but we all know
what's going on in this thought bubble.

The kids don't know, but we do.

Boy, I'm sure getting my money's
worth out of this rental car.

Okay, all right, I got one.

Would you rather be a hobo
with a five percent chance

of getting inherited
by a rich guy

or be Hitler two years before
the end of World War II?

'Cause you know you're gonna
have to shoot yourself,

but you still got two
more years as Hitler.

If you're the hobo, do you, uh,
have a place to sleep,

-like an underpass or...?
-Different every night.

As Hitler, can I change certain policies
so that maybe I'm looked on

more favorably at the end of the war?

No, you already screwed up
big-time... lot of dead Jews.

Am I a blue state
or a red state hobo?

Blue, but Midwestern blue.

-Oh, boy.
-(GRUMBLING)

I don't think so, it's cold out there.

Am I allowed to alter the mustache?

Dude, why do you keep
trying to make Hitler work?

Am I allowed to kill other hobos
to increase my odds?

Kill anyone you like, you're a hobo.

Am I a walking hobo?

No. Quagmire and Cleveland
are, but you're not.

So, wait, I would also
be a paralyzed Hitler?

Yeah.

Would I be a Black Hitler?

Yes. No.

Well, wait a minute,
now how come I got to be

crippled Hitler
and he's still white Hitler?

If you got such a problem with it, Joe,
just be the hobo!

This one isn't very fun.

Wait a minute, where are we?

Yeah, this doesn't look like
the main highway anymore.

You think we made a wrong turn?

I hope not. These backwoods parts
of the Deep South

ain't a place
you want to get lost in.

-(SIREN WAILING)
-Oh, no.

Don't worry about it, guys.

I read nowhere that Southern
sheriffs really want

to be talked down to by
big-shot Northerners.

Afternoon.

Officer, what is it?

We are in a tremendous
urban rush.

You fellas ain't from
around here, are you?

Hey, Sheriff,
I'm trying to learn Southern.

Is this saying anything?

A-doy-doy-doy-doy!

We're very sorry, Sheriff,
and we want to cooperate

to the fullest extent possible.

-You threatening me?
-Uh, no, sir.

Who you calling "sir," boy?

I'm an officer of the law,
paid by this county.

And I can't help noticing
you got a headlight out.

Really? I don't see any...

And I see that turn signal
ain't working neither.

Now, look, sir,
I'm a police officer, too.

I know all the games,
I use them myself.

So what do you say
we just work something out?

So, you're a cop, huh?

Let me see your badge.

Looks like you're a civilian now.

I'm gonna have to
search your vehicle.

Well, lookie here.
What do we got in this thing?

Oh, come on!
You planted that there!

We had drugs?

Oh, my God, why am I driving drunk
when I could've been driving high?

You boys are in a lot of trouble.

Dispatch, Sheriff Nichols.

Bringing in four perpetrators
under suspicion of drug possession.

Descriptions: one African-American,

-one crippled, one skinny, one handsome.
-Yes.

You're all coming down
to the station with me.

-Aw, crap!
-Hang on, hang on, you guys.

Don't worry. I know how to
speak this guy's language.

Keith Urban.

Go on.

Brett Favre.

Uh-huh. I'm listening.

William H. Macy?

You guys are going
away for a long time.

Look at this, Cleveland.

Front of the bus,
back of the bus,

middle of the bus...
you guys are doing great.

I can't believe this.

Two weeks in prison
on trumped-up charges.

That trial was a total sham.

Yeah, I knew we were in trouble
the minute I saw the jury.

Well, at least they're
a jury of our peers.

I don't think they see it that way, Peter.

Hello, gentlemen.

I am the warden.

You are here
because you are criminals.

This is not a resort.

You will be worked harder
than you have ever been worked

in your miserable, pathetic lives.

And play harder, right?

I bet.

Step forward, maggot!

(GRUNTS)

Next time, that'll be you.

Well, why wasn't it him this time?!

Oh, I'm so scared.

(GRUNTING)

Peter, stop it!

Yeah, you're real big when
you got that stick, ain't you?

Okay, I'll stop now.

This is so much fun, isn't it?

I know.
What should we talk about next?

I know, let's talk about actresses.

Ooh, yeah.

I feel like Natalie Portman

thinks she's so much better
than everybody.

She's nothing,
and her husband's a nobody.

Why does Laura Linney always
look like she's just finished skiing?

I don't know who that is.

Really? <i>The Big C?</i>
<i>Love Actually?</i>

No, never heard of her.

Would you know who she was
if I said Tyler Perry's Laura Linney?

Ooh, I love her.

Oh, God, it's so hot out here.

Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be hot when you heard

that lonesome slide guitar
and that hawk's cry.

(SLIDE GUITAR PLAYS)

(HAWK SCREECHES)

Hey! This ain't break time!

Get back to work!

Gonna see <i>Miss Liza</i>

<i>Gonna go to Mississippi</i>

<i>Gonna see Miss Liza</i>

<i>Gonna go to Mississippi</i>

<i>Gonna see Miss Liza</i>

<i>Gonna go to Mississippi</i>

Man, listen to
what the black guys are doing.

We need a white guy work song.

(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>-Hello</i>
<i>-How are you?</i>

<i>-How's the folks?</i>
<i>-What's new?</i>

<i>-I'm great</i>
<i>-That's good</i>

<i>-Ha-ha</i>
<i>-Knock wood</i>

<i>-Well, well</i>
<i>-That's life</i>

<i>-What do you know?</i>
<i>-How's the wife?</i>

<i>-Got to run</i>
<i>-Oh, my</i>

<i>-Ta-ta</i>
<i>-Olive oil</i>

<i>Good-bye</i>

(SHOES TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)

You Peter Griffin?

Oh, yeah, thanks.

What the hell is that?

It's a jet pack.

I'll come back for you guys,
I promise.

You're my friend and everything
and I feel bad saying this,

but I wanted to see you fail.

Official prediction:
when they let us out of here,

we're gonna have to go through
the prison gift shop.

-(MEN GRUMBLING)
-Oh, I hate doing that.

That's how they get you.

Man, it's gonna feel so good
to walk out of here tomorrow.

Yeah, you know,
the time actually went by faster

than I would have thought.

Uh, you know something?

We left Quahog to find adventure

and get away from all
those lame chores at home,

but I'll tell you this.

Looking back on it now,
I don't think our lives are so bad.

Yeah, I sure do miss Lois
and the kids.

I'll tell you one thing.

When I get home,
I'm gonna sleep like a log.

Hey, I'm gonna plug in
the night-light if you don't mind.

Actually, you know what?

I'm gonna go ahead
and ask you to not do that.

Knock off that chitchat!
It's lights out!

Oh, hey, Warden,
since it's our last night in here,

can I have a glass of milk?

I feel like having dream diarrhea.

Last night?

Where do you think y'all are going?

Says here you got another
30 days on your sentence.

What?! But the court said
we're supposed to go home tomorrow!

Well, the court ain't here, is it?

(WARDEN LAUGHS)

Oh, man, how the hell are we gonna do this
for another 30 days?

(MAN CHUCKLES)

That's the way
it goes around here.

Once you come in,
you're never allowed to leave.

I got my sentence extended
30 days once.

That was 45 years ago.

Oh, my God, you hear that?
We're gonna be stuck in here forever!

Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

If we're gonna be here a while,

I'm gonna find the biggest guy
here and kick his ass.

Wait a minute. That's me!

Oh, no, I have a knife!

Oh, what are we gonna do?!

They're gonna keep us
locked up here forever!

We're not staying in here forever.

-We're getting out of here.
-How?

-We're breaking out.
-What?

Look, sometimes in life,

you got to say, "What the hell,"
and just go for it.

I mean, that's how
we won the Revolutionary War.

Colonel, the British are too entrenched
across the river.

I've told the men
we'll hold our position.

Negative. Tell the men,
we're going across.

But Colonel Goatbanger, we've...

No, we need to do this,

'cause... for... 'cause of...
for strategy.

All right,
if we're gonna break out of here,

we got to get past these guards.

Well, I got an idea.

It won't be pretty,
but bear with me.

(GROANING)

Oh, no, I fell out
of my wheelchair!

(GROANING)

(GROANS, SIGHS)

Don't help me!

I need to do this on my own!

What are you doing, Joe?
You're embarrassing us.

Oh, really? Are they looking?

No. They're actually going
to great lengths to avoid it.

Exactly. No one wants

to watch a handicap
struggle for independence.

This will buy us at least
15 minutes of averted gazes.

All right,
I'm gonna nail this home.

Oh! Oh, this is so humiliating.

I'm about to be an adult man crying.

(JOE CRIES LOUDLY)

I can't walk!

Why the hell can't I walk?!

This isn't part of the act anymore!

No, no, no, no, don't look.

If you make eye contact,
you'll have to help.

Hey, they're getting away!

Release the dogs!

(BARKING)

(HIGH-PITCHED BARKING)

(BARKING CONTINUES)

(BARKING)

Oh, we did it!

Your plan worked, Joe!

I told you those guards
would turn away.

Yeah, Joe, that was amazing!

That was easier than taking
candy from a premature baby.

(RHYTHMIC BEEPING)

I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna take this.

(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

Hey, I got an idea

for something that's gonna
be so (BLEEP) funny.

(WHISPERING)

Okay, Bonnie, go get it.

It's in the closet.

Brian! Brian, come out here!

What are you doing?!

I'm reading.

What... what... what...

What are you reading?

Well, I was just finishing
Jonathan Franzen's book.

You know, I'll admit
it has its moments,

but it's completely overrated.

I mean, I'm not saying
I wrote something similar to it

several years ago,
but I am saying...

-Grab him!
-(LAUGHTER)

What? What? What? What?
Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!

-Get his paw! Hold still!
-Hey! Hey! Hey! What?

-Push him down onto all fours!
-No. What are you do...?

-I don't want to do this.
-If he really starts freaking out,

-put your pinkie in his butt!
-Aah!

(BRIAN GROANING)

Calm down! Calm down!

(GRUNTING)

(LAUGHTER)

Now Stewie!

All right, I guess
this is the night bitches die.

I wonder what the chain gang did today.

I hope we're not missing anything cool.

Maybe we should go back.

Hey, guys, look, there's a house.

Maybe there's something inside
we can use to get these chains off.

It looks like nobody's home.

Hey, these look like
handcuff and shackle keys.

-How do you know that?
-(CHUCKLES)

These are handcuff
and shackle keys.

Hey, it worked!

You know, there's an awful lot of pictures
of the sheriff in this house.

Well, he's a good-looking man.

I'll bet a lot of people
in town have pictures of him.

Oh, no! It's the sheriff!

Quick, into the closet!

-(FLATULENCE)
-Who's there?

PETER (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE):
Just me, sweetie.

Oh, I didn't know you were home.

What are you doing
in the closet there?

-Um... wife things?
-Oh, all right.

Well, I'll only be home for a minute.

Some prisoners escaped
from the work camp,

and I'm helping the warden
track 'em down.

Oh. Well, maybe you should let 'em go.

You know I can't do that.

You're always working.
I wish you'd spend more time at home.

-More time with me.
-Maybe you're right, honey.

Maybe I do work too much.
You know what?

I'm gonna let those fugitives go.

You'd do that for me?

I'd do anything for you.

-I love you.
-I love you, too!

Now, come out here
and give me a kiss!

Peter, no!

Wait a minute!
I don't have a wife!

(GUNSHOTS)

(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

(SIRENS WAILING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)

Head for the tracks!

(GUNFIRE)

Oh, no! They're shooting at us!

Good thing bad guys
are such terrible shots.

Man, these guys are elusive!

Quick! Hop on!

-All right, we did it.
-We made it.

That was a close one!

(SIGHS)
Well, guys, we made it.

Boy, I feel like
I haven't eaten in a week.

Hey, if we pass a McDaniel's

or a Burger Queen,
let's hop out.

Oh, that's right,
we're on television.

Oh, I'd love a flame-broiled Bopper!

So frustrating. We all know
what we're talking about.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)

Well, this was quite an adventure.

Yeah, it's good to be
back in familiar territory.

(GUN CHAMBERS COCKING)

Where do y'all think you're going?

You boys are fugitives of my county,

and I'm gonna take you back.

Oh, no!

I don't think so.

You're in my jurisdiction now,
Sheriff Butt Breath.

Wow, Joe, how'd you pull that off?

I put in a call from
the McDaniel's pay phone

while you guys were getting that
nine-piece chicken McFingers

and those Diet Conks
and those Fresh Fries.

Oh, come on.
They... They don't own "French fries!"

You know, you got some nerve
driving around my town

with a busted headlight.

And a busted windshield.

And an untreated flesh wound.

(GROANS)

You took an oath just
the same as me, Sheriff.

To protect and serve.

Not to harass and douche.

Just 'cause you have
a badge doesn't mean

you can treat people
any way you like.

And as a law enforcement professional,

you have an obligation to be
more ethically upstanding

than the average man, not less.

Now, get the hell out of my town.

Nice going, Joe!

Well, it's great being back in the North
where people are civilized.

Hey, what, are you guys
all on a date?

Gay!

Oh, my God, Peter,
what an experience.

But the important thing is
you're home safe.

Yeah. And you know, I guess
I learned something from all this.

(SIGHS)
You know what?

We've done this a billion
times, so you know what?

I'm just gonna do the cadences.

(LAUGHTER AND EXCITED CHATTER)

Hey, guys, check it out.

I peed my name in the snow.

-Jeez, Joe.
-That's normal.

Wow, looks like the whole
neighborhood's out here.

Yeah, I just hope that weird albino

up the street doesn't show up.

That guy creeps me out.

-Hello, Peter.
-Dah! Dah!

H-Hey. Hey, Bill.

What are you doing out
here in all this snow?

Just taking my rabbit to the vet.

Well, I'm all done shoveling
your walk, Mr. Herbert.

Thanks, Chris, but
there's some in here, too.

BRIAN: Hey, check it out- - lemon snow.

-What?
-Yeah, that stuff's delicious.

Lemon snow? You mean it just
falls from the sky like that?

You bet. One of nature's treats.

-You gonna have some?
-Nah, I'm already full.

But you should have some before
the other kids get to it.

What is it? Like Italian ice?

Yeah, exactly, like a sorbet.

Ugh! That's not lemon!

-No, it's not.
-You bastard!

I was having fun playing in the
snow, and now you've ruined it,

like a pizza place ruins a salad.

Okay, four pizzas and a salad.

Salad? How do you make a salad?

First, you throw in
the whole head of lettuce.

Even the hard-to-eat
white part at the bottom?

That's what the people want!
Now, what else?

I got a can of whole black olives.

Should I slice them up?

What are you, crazy?
No, you keep 'em whole.

You're gonna want to know you've
got an olive in your mouth.

-What about this tomato?
-Cut it into thirds.

It should be big enough to pretend
you've got red teeth.

How about this carrot? Should I cut it up?

Yes, but very thin lengthwise.

The whole length of the carrot.

One thin slice. Okay, what else do we got?

Well, we got these hot peppers,
but you can't really eat them.

No problem. Dump 'em all in.

Now, should we put it in a bowl?

No, let's put it in a lasagna tray.

Okay, great, I'll take it.

Oh, and make sure to stick it
right on top of the pizzas

so it stays nice and warm.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello, every pizza place.

All right, Stewie, you
all set to spend the day

Ugh, I hate being around old people.

in their refrigerator.

Ah, I'm hungry. What do we got?

baking soda and some film.

Ah, sorry. Thought I had more time.

Hi, Daddy. Stewie's all ready.

You boys have fun.

There's my little guy.

<i>Well, Grandpa's here</i>

Oh, God, it's the song again.

<i>Yes, Grandpa's here</i>

It doesn't even rhyme at all.

<i>He's going to buy you a</i>
<i>Soda and drive you around</i>

Let's go.

(RADIO STATIC)

Hey, just so you know, we're not
listening to a radio station.

We're listening to the hiss
between two radio stations.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Whoa. Watch your driving!

Is he... Is he sleeping?

Hey! Hey, wake up! Wake up!

You, lady, wake him up!

You like the "Tom and Jerry,"
do you, dear?

Well, we'll dial them up when we get home.

What the hell are you talking
about?! We're about to...

(GROANS)

What happened?

Where are my knitting needles?

(GASPS) Goodness, dear, I'm so sorry.

No worries. Now I can work at Hot Topic

and make people sick
as I ring up their purchases.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Oh, damn it.

Dude, bad news.

You're dead.

What? But I'm Death!

Sorry, dude. Super Death.

You're done.

So what now? I go to Heaven?

Nope, when a Death dies,
he gets reincarnated.

You're being reincarnated as
a Chinese baby right... now!

(WHIRRING)

-Girl?
-Girl.

Oh, no!

The egg that I was supposed
to take care of

for my high school project!

Mr. Burke was right.
I'm not ready to be a parent.

Wait a minute.

I'm not in high school anymore.

Maybe this is all a dream.

Aah! It was a dream!

I need a glass of water.

Wait a minute.

I moved out of the desert years ago.

Maybe this is a dream!

Aah!

Phew.

I am ready to be a parent, Mr. Burke.

Daddy, I'm so happy you're all right.

We're lucky it wasn't more serious.

Hey, how's the old guy doing?

Ugh, now here's Joe.

Why is everybody we know depressing?

Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

I'm gonna have to revoke
your driver's license.

What?

It's obvious your advanced age
has impaired your ability

to drive safely.

Please, Joe, I know he had an accident,

but can't you look the other way

this one time as a friend?

Yeah, you know, Joe, you owe this family.

I didn't tell anyone about
your Fiona Apple tribute video.

<i>I've been a bad, bad girl</i>

-(DOOR RATTLING)

BONNIE: Joe, open the garage.

I've earned this private time!

Listen, I don't have time for this.

I'm late for a hostile
takeover of a jelly factory.

I'll show those Smuckers.

That's fine, but you can't drive.

Oh, don't be ridiculous!

Driver Pete at your service, sir.

-Peter, we're not doing that.
-Aw.

Carter, you work too much as it is.

You're not a young man anymore.

You need to slow down.

Slow down? I can't slow down.

I'm running a six-billion-dollar company.

If I slow down, the company goes under.

It just seems to me that perhaps

it's time to think about retirement.

Never! Retirement's for old people.

I can work till I die.
Maybe even after that.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, the
gentlemen from Zurich

are here for your 10:00.

Will you need anything else?

Mr. Pewterschmidt!

But, dear, we are old.

We can't keep pretending
that nothing's changed.

I mean, we almost injured
our grandchild today.

Besides, you're always complaining

that you don't have
enough time to play polo

or sit in a chair and moisten your mouth.

That is true.

It does sometimes take me
a while to moisten my mouth.

There we go, all moist.

You see, dear?
And that's only the beginning.

Retirement will be a wonderful adventure,

and we'll do it together.

You're gonna retire?

From what?

There, isn't it fun already?

(SIGHS)

Okay. I'll retire.

Oh, Daddy, I think that's for the best.

I need a doctor! Is there a doctor?

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>

Hey, hey, hey!

What's up, Ginas... 'g-'ginas... vaginas?

What's up, vaginas? Ah-ha, gotcha!

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what are you doing here?

I'm retired now. Got a lot of free time.

So what do you guys do here?

Well, we usually just sit here
and complain about our lives.

Like this morning, Lois was
such a pain in the ass...

Hey! That's my daughter
you're talking about!

Oh. I mean this, um, redheaded lady

who lives in my bed was a real
pain in the ass this morning.

-Oh, she sounds like a bitch.
-Yeah, what a bitch.

Bitchazoid, right, guys?

-Yeah. I hope you're doing her.
-Oh, big time.

Yeah, that's hot.

That's hot. I'm gonna think
about that tonight.

Oh, we do all kinds of crazy stuff.

Sometimes we even have phone sax.

Don't you mean phone sex?

No, Joe. Phone sax.

Are you ready?

You better believe it.

(PLAYING <i>BAKER STREET)</i>

Oh, Peter!

Yeah. Now your turn.

And do it how I like.

(GIGGLES) Okay.

(PLAYING INTRO TO <i>YOU CAN CALL ME AL)</i>

Yeah. Don't wash the mouthpiece.

Good news, guys.
Now that Grandpa's retired,

he's gonna have more time
to spend with us.

ALL: Oh!

We don't want to do that, Mom.

Yeah, all he ever does is
ask you what you want to do

so he can shoot it down and
tell you what he wants to do.

Hey, there's my family!

So, what do you guys want to do today?

I'd like to go to the mall, Grandpa.

No parking at the mall.

It's a terrible place. What else?

Um, how about the zoo?

Too much walking. Too much noise.

You can't have any good conversation.

Not like at Chili's. Where else?

Well, there's always the beach.

No, you got to sit on the ground to eat.

I need a cushioned chair with
back support like at Chili's.

Okay, well... how about Chili's?

Maybe, maybe.

Let's get in the car
and see where it takes us.

(RINGS DOORBELL)

-Hey, Carter.
-Hello, Quandary.

It's, uh... It's Quagmire.

-You looking for Peter?
-No, he's at work. Lame.

Oh. Well, what do you want?

I hear you're kind of a cool guy.

Thought maybe we could hang out.

Uh... okay.

Okay! Carter and Quandary, hanging out.

All right, I just got to go
take a misty, stop-and-go piss

in your bathroom,
then we'll be good to go.

Lois, how the hell much longer is your dad
gonna be hanging around here?

-He's starting to drive me crazy.
-(SIGHS) I know, Peter,

but he's my father and I
don't know what else to do.

Well, I don't know how
much more I can take.

I can't even get any sleep with him here.

Hey.

-Hey.
-Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha- What is it?

I can't sleep. I'm scared of ghosts.

Carter, there's no such thing as ghosts.

Are you sure?

Well, now I'm not. Come on, get in here!

It's safe under here, right?

I think so, but I'm not sure.

I just recently started
believing in ghosts.

Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy.

Lois! What are you two doing here?

Well, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

Hmm. What's that?

Well, we were just thinking,

now that Daddy's retired
that you and he might be happier

in a place where you can be
with people your own age.

You know, make some new friends.

-What are you talking about?
-We actually brought you a few brochures

of some lovely retirement
communities in Florida.

And I helped.

-Florida?
-Mm, this one's even got the word "sunset"

four times in the name of it.

Huh. These people are biking
without helmets.

Must be a pretty kick-back place.

These actually look quite nice,

and we could finally get away
from these dreadful winters.

Yeah. We'll even help you
move in and get settled.

Wait a minute, why would
I want to live in Florida?

Black people's votes go
right in the garbage.

All right! We're moving to Florida!

Oh, Carter, this is wonderful!

Aw, look at that smile, Lois.

Reminds of that guy who was way
too happy he didn't get killed on 9/11.

(GASPING) I'm ten minutes late for work!

Look at that! I stayed up late

watching "Monday Night Football"
and that saved my life, huh?

Isn't that awesome?

Oh, but oh...

Hi there. Welcome.

I'm Ryan, the manager here at Oceanside,

and I'll be showing you around today.

First question, though:

are you two old enough to be here?

(GIGGLES) Oh, dear!

(LAUGHS) I like you, Ryan.

You're cool.

Over there is our statue
of Angela Lansbury.

Protect us, oh, Lansbury,
from rude teenagers,

from soup that is both
too hot and too cold,

and from anyone who calls,
but please have people call.

Our state-of-the-art movie
theater is equipped

with some terrific innovations
to cater to our residents,

including a button on every seat
that will pause the film

whenever anyone has a question.

Hey, guys.

MAN 1: Why is he blue now?
Is it cold on that planet?

MAN 2: Why are they mumbling?

Why does everyone
in pictures today mumble?

I can't hear!

MAN 3: Is that Sig-nory Weaver?

WOMAN: That's not how you say it.

MAN 3: Well, she shouldn't be smoking.

She's a handsome woman,
and that'll ruin her fast.

MAN 4: Is Unobtainium
very easy to obtain?

Well, I hope you enjoyed the tour.

Oh, yeah, it was great.

Except for that lady who
kept yelling "Byaah! Byaah!"

Well, we'll just need you
to fill out this paperwork,

and then we'll get you
moved into your condo.

Oh, isn't this wonderful, dear!

No! No, it's not wonderful at all!

There's no way in hell
I'm gonna live here!

This place is nothing but old
people marching to their deaths!

You hear me? I'm not one of you!

And I never will be!

Hey, look, it's old man Withers,

the guy who owns the amusement park!

But let's see who's really under there.

-(SCREAMS)
-(GASPS)

A skeleton!

-Can I have my face back?
-No!

You're going to jail!

Oh, this is dreadful.

I thought Carter and I were
going to be so happy here.

I'll tell you what, Babs,
let me have a talk with him.

Hey there, buddy.

Go away!

You know, you remind me of a guy I know.

This guy worked and worked
and never wanted to retire,

even though it would've been
the best thing for him.

You know what that man's name was?

Jon Benet Ramsey.

I-I-I think.

I think that's the guy.

-What?
-You're darn right what.

Now, let's get back in there.

Peter, get lost!
I'm not gonna retire, and that's that!

Come on, Carter, everybody's
got to retire at some point.

Like that drill sergeant with Alzheimer's.

Looks like we got a joker here.

What's your name, soldier?

Sir, McArdle, sir!

Well, no (BLEEP)!

You look like some kind of joker to me.

What's your name, soldier?

Sir, McArdle, sir!

Are you (BLEEP) me?

Probably some kind of joker.

What's your name, soldier?

Sir, McArdle, sir!

Well, la-dee (BLEEP) da!

I guess we got some kind of joker here!

Look, Carter, I'll make a deal with you.

You give me just one day
to show you how great

retired life can be for an old fella,

and I'll let you honk the horn one time.

-Really?
-Uh-huh.

(HONKS)

(GIGGLES) I'm pretending there's traffic.

There you go, that's...

-Once!
-God, I wasn't even gonna do it!

So, how do you win this game?

Just fill this out when they
say the letter and the numbers?

Eh, that's a sucker's bet.

There's only one way to win this game--

wait for someone else to win
and steal his card.

G-27.

Bingo!

-It's go time.
-What do we do, sneak up behind him?

No, he's got cataracts. Follow my lead.

(LOUD THUD)

Bingo, bitches!

Bingo.

All right, Carter,
now that you're retired,

you're gonna need a whole new wardrobe.

And what better place to start
than the Slightly Open Robery?

<i>Hey, hobo man</i>

<i>Hey, Dapper Dan</i>
<i>You've both got your style</i>

<i>But, brother</i>
<i>You're never fully dressed</i>

<i>Without a smile...</i>

Yes. The penis one.

All right, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
now, you know how

in your building your office temperature

was controlled by a central air system

-that you had nothing to do with?
-Yeah, I hated that.

Well, check it out--
this room has its very own thermostat

-that you can fiddle with.
-Really?

I can change the temperature in here?

You're retired-- you
can do anything you want.

Well, I am kind of warm. I'll try it out.

Oh, that's perfect.

-Now I'm cold.
-Crank up the thermostat.

Ah, wonderful.

Hotter than blazes in here.

But wait-- I can turn the heat down.

(WHISPERS) He's learning.

Bye, you guys.

We'll be down to visit real soon.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm glad you
finally came around about this place.

Peter, I got to admit,
it's not bad at all.

Never thought I'd get used to the idea

of giving up work and just
devoting my life to leisure.

I guess this is what people
mean by the word "relax."

Take care, dear.

-We'll see you soon.
-Yeah, have fun.

Just remember not to go out
into actual Florida.

You don't want to meet those people.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood,

and I'm required by law to inform
you that I am a sex offender.

Oh, don't worry about it-- so am I.

This whole block is S.O.'s.

We use the abbreviation "S.O.'s"
because it saves a lot of time

over saying "Sex Offender,"
because that's all we talk about.

-Well, I'm also into football.
-Don't care.

No time for F.B. All about S.O.

Make no mistake, Florida
is the South's trash can.

Boy, these eggs are delicious.

Good job, Lois.

Good job, local hen.

Aw, bucka bucka baw.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Hi, Mom.

What?

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God, o-okay, we'll be
down there as soon as we can.

Mom, what's wrong?

We're going to Florida.

Why? What happened?

There's something horribly wrong
with your grandpa.

Oh, Lois!

I'm so glad you made it.

He's been like this for days.

Oh, my God!

(GRUMBLING)

...cream of wheat.

(MUMBLING)

...Jeopardy.

(MUMBLING)

...butterscotch pudding.

This is awful! What's happened to him?

I don't know, dear.

He sleeps 18 hours a day,
he refuses to bathe,

and he's stopped making any sense.

Aw, that sounds like the sad
little fat girl who lives in all of us

and is struggling to get out.

(MUFFLED GRUNTS)

Did my parents call yet?

Nobody's looking for you!
Now, stay in there!

Sometimes she tries
to get out the other way.

That's why I keep a cork in my bum.

Daddy?

Daddy, can you hear me?

Oh, God, we should never
have brought him here.

You're right, dear.

I can't stand to see him like this.

Well, we got to do something.

Don't worry, you guys, I think
I might know how to fix this.

But first look-- I turned
him into Groucho Marx.

That's hilarious.

Peter, what is this
supposed to accomplish?

Don't you see, Lois?
When we forced him to retire,

we took all the challenge out of his life.

Perhaps some people aren't
meant to retire at all.

Exactly! Now, let's see if we
can put some fire back into him.

Margot, it's time to take this
company in a new direction--

starting with being honest with
the IRS about our profits.

(MUMBLING)

We're also gonna stop
reading employee e-mails.

(MUMBLING) ...our servers.

And from now on it's against the rules

to pat female employees on the fanny.

(MUMBLING) ...like touching butts!

And tell the African-American
elevator attendant

he no longer has to wear white gloves.

Why don't you just tell him
he can sleep with my wife, too?

Daddy!

Oh, Carter! You're back!

You're damn right I am!

Don't you ever try to stick me
in one of those retirement places again!

I plan on sitting behind this desk
until the day I die.

Getting old is right for some people,

-but not for me.
-I know, Daddy.

You were right, and we're sorry.

(CELLPHONE RINGS)

Hey, Mom.

No, Mom, you're staying
in the nursing home.

I... I don't care.

I-I don't care.

M-Mom, believe me, no one
is touching you in your sleep.

'Cause you're gross.

And even if they are, so what,
who are you saving yourself for?

Hey, look, I-I got to go.
I don't know if we're coming

to Thanksgiving. Because I don't know!

-She's staying in there.
-I know.

Well, I guess we ought to call it a night.

Come on, Stewie. Up to bed.

I was gonna show a slide show

Anyway, this is a special day
for you, young lady.

Here's a gift for ya.

A scented candle?

As a girl, I love this!

That was originally $30.

Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

Well, it's your 18th birthday, Meg.

That's a very important milestone
in a young girl's...

I mean, a young woman's life.

Hey, welcome to the adult club, huh?

And you know what?

You got another member right next door

if you ever want to talk and stuff.

Happy birthday.

Hey... Hey, where's
that pinky going, huh?

Where's he going?

Wha, what's he doing?
Get back here.

There you go.

Look at Quagmire hitting on that skank.

You know he's gonna close the deal.

Peter, that skank is your daughter.

Oh, my God, you're right!

You know, Meg,
I'd love to see you without your hat on.

Okay.

So, anyway, I'm on approach
into Lambert Field

in some of the worst turbulence
I've ever flown through.

I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

Everyone in the cabin was, like, "Ahhh!"

but I kept my cool.

I trusted my training,
and brought the plane in safely,

and in fact, it turned out, ironically,

to be one of the smoothest
landings I've ever made.

Well, gosh, Quagmire,
this has been a fun night,

but I guess, uh, you better be
getting home now, huh?

Yeah, it is getting late.

I guess I'll go home
and rub out a giggity.

Take it easy, you guys.

See you later, Meg.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

Bye.

Okay, that was weird.

-That was weird.
-Right?

Oh, my God, so weird.

I tell you something,
if he touches my daughter,

I'm gonna be kicking butts
and taking names!

And then giving those names
to other people whose butts I kick.

-What's your name?
-Derek.

What's your name?

-Michael.
-You're Derek now!

(PHONE BEEPS)

(PHONE CHIMES)

Oh! (CHUCKLES)

(PHONE BEEPS)

(PHONE CHIMES)

(PHONE CHIMES)

(PHONE BEEPS)

(PHONE CHIMES)

Okay, Glenn, time to reel her in.

(PHONE BEEPS)

(PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

Ah, it's too much, too much.

(PHONE BEEPS)

I love stars!

<i>We now return to </i>Grainy Footage
of a Potential Bigfoot

<i>that will surely spark a lively debate</i>
<i>in your household.</i>

Oh, my God! That is real!

-No, total fake.
-(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

Look at that. That is obviously a suit.
It's a fraud.

Look at the way it walks.

-Totally fake.
-Why would somebody make that up, Lois?

What's in it for them?

(KNOCKING)

Oh, hey, Mr. G. How's it going?

Quagmire, what are you doing here?

Hi, Glenn. Bye, you guys.

Me and Glenn are going out.

What? Like hell you are!

Don't worry, Dad!
I'll take care of him!

Stay away from my sis!

Okay, you two have fun on your date.

-What?
-Drive carefully.

We'll see you later.

Lois, are you out of your mind?

We can't let Quagmire
take Meg out on a date!

That guy'll bang anything.

Hey, Lois, I'm starving.
What's for dinner?

I made meat loaf. It's in the fridge.

Hey, Peter, do you mind?

But I have to get dinner.

Go out!

Peter, nothing's gonna happen.

Don't you see?

She's only doing this
to get a rise out of us.

If we fight her on it,
she'll only push further.

Well, she may not plan
on sleeping with him,

but you don't know
how smooth Quagmire is, Lois.

-He's like a vagician.
-Oh, that's clever.

I know! Isn't it?
He practices vagic.

"Vagician" was funnier.

Okay, well, the point is,
we ought to be worried.

Peter, trust me.

I know what's going on in her head.

It's just a game.

I used to do the same thing to my parents.

The problem is, they pushed back,

and the results were not good.

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
to other people whose butts I kick.

and we found vodka, Rohypnol,
a fair amount of DNA

that is not her own, and a class ring.

Harvard?

I think it was SUNY something.

Oh, I don't want to hear any more!

So how're your studies going?

They're going pretty good.

School's good

What's your favorite class?

What was your favorite class?

Okay, let's say it at the same time

and see if they're the same.

Okay, one, two, three.

-Hist... Math!
-Math!

Oh, my God,
we have so much in common!

Do you have any brothers or sisters?

Yeah, I have two brothers.

Aw, they sound terrific.

-Hey, you want to blow this joint?
-Sure.

Oh, wow, really?
All right, go for it!

Come on. Let's go.

Oh, oh, you, you mean leave.

No, yeah, sure. No, let's go.

Gosh, Meg,
I sure had a swell time with you.

Me, too, Glenn.
God, it's so amazing

that you've been my dad's friend
for, like, years,

and now we have this connection.

Hey, do you want to come in

for some Crystal Light or something?

Well, I do believe in me,
but it's getting kind of late.

Um, I really want
to see you again, though.

Oh, you know it.

Oh, God, Peter!

Scared the hell out of me!

-What're you doing here?
-I think you know.

Did you have sex with my daughter?

What? Come on, Peter.

Did you have sex with my daughter?

Peter, trust me, it's not happening.

(SIGHS) All right. Good.

Yeah, she's really making me work for it.

Maybe you could talk to her.

Well, I'll try,

but sometimes she can be
as stubborn as a mule.

I tell you, you tell her
to do something once,

she does the opposite.

You know,
it's like she ain't even heard you

in the first place.

It's like talking to a brick wall.

Worse than talking...

Even a brick wall doesn't tell you
they understand you,

and then go do the opposite, you know?

So it's no surprise to me

that you're having these difficulties.

That-that just seems to be the way she is.

You know, whether it's just
that she's not listening

or whether it's that she's
making a conscious decision

to defy your wishes,
who can say, you know?

And I would say, in some respects,

having a strong-willed kid
is a good thing,

but it can get frustrating
as hell on the other side.

So, you know, believe me,

I hear loud and clear where you're...

Wait a second!
No, I won't talk to her!

And I want you to stay
the hell away from her!

Peter it's me, Quagmire.

This is what I do.

Besides, Meg is 18 now
and you've gotta let go.

You've done your job.
It's my turn now.

Look, Quagmire,
you're one of my best pals,

and I'm asking you not to do this.

I want to help you, Peter, I really do,

but it's... It's like you're
asking a fish not to swim.

She's legal and I'm going in.

Well, we'll see about that.

I ain't afraid to stand up to friends.

Just ask Spartacus.

I'm Spartacus.

I'm Spartacus.

That guy's Spartacus.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>
Two Lame Chicks on Vacation in Mexico.

Oh, my God, don't drink the water.

I'm so going to brush my teeth
with tequila.

-Mexico!
-Mexico!

Hey, is this beach topless?

No, but my margarita's bottomless.

-Mexico!
-Mexico!

That cute guy's
been staring at you all night.

Oh, my God. I'm going to go poo now,
so I don't have to later.

-Mexico!
-Mexico!

Hey, you want to see
my pictures from Mexico?

Look, Janine, I just... This is...
I can't with you anymore.

It's all the time. This is a job.

Please take off that silly hat.

(PHONE RINGING)

GIRL: <i>Mexico!</i>

I... I can't talk right now.

-You okay?
-Yeah, babe.

I got to pee, but I don't want to move.

I'm so comfortable right now.

I can pause it.

I guess you could pause it...

But you can't pause me!

Fast forward. Fast forward.

-Fast forward.
-Glenn, stop.

-I can't breathe.
-I can't breathe either.

This is torture for me, too.

No fair. Stop.

I'm going to... (FARTS)

Sorry.

Ah, that's all right. It's just your body.

Sometimes things slip out.

Probably just making room for something.

Like what?

Hey, gang, got room for one more
right in the middle of you two?

Come on, scooch apart, there.

Ooh, what's this? Quagmire's cell phone?

Well, now that you're with Meg,

you don't need to be talking to,
uh, "Backbush" anymore.

Oh, and I'll send a text
to "Possible Nipple Ring"

saying you're off the market.

(PHONE BEEPS)

You're "Possible Nipple Ring"?

All right, well,
I better send a text to "Backbush."

(BUZZING)

Oh, come on. I'm "Backbush"?

This can't be a surprise to you, Peter.

Yeah, I knew.

(SOBBING) I just didn't know you knew.

Okay, what compound is this?

That's sodium chloride.

That's right. How about this one?

Hydrogen peroxide.

God, you're so smart.
How about this one?

QM2? I'm not sure what that is.

It's Quag-megium.

It's the strongest compound on Earth.

Nothing can separate it.

It has an atomic weight of awesome.

You're such a cutie patootie.

If I'm a cutie patootie,
then you're a peenie-vageenie.

Aw!

I heard a cute "aw" in there. Cool down!

(SNARLS)

Meg, there's something
we need to talk about.

Dad, I swear to God, I thought
you could flush those things.

-Meg, you ever heard of Joan Van Ark?
-No.

Here's a picture of Joan Van Ark.

-Oh, my God, she's gorgeous.
-Gorgeous. Yes.

Yes, Meg, gorgeous.

Yes. Every man wanted her.

But one man got her.

A man she trusted to keep her
safe and beautiful forever.

That man was Glenn Quagmire.

And two short months later,

this is what happened to Joan Van Ark.

Oh! Oh, my God!

I don't want this
to happen to you, Meg.

I don't want you to turn into
a hilarious photograph.

Dad, I know what you're trying to do,

and I want you to stop it.

-Mom!
-What is it, Meg?

Mom, tell Dad to leave me alone.

I'm 18, and he keeps
treating me like a kid.

Peter, I told you not to push her
about this Quagmire thing.

If you push too hard, you're going
to push her right into his arms.

-Well, what am I supposed to do?
-Nothing.

This is a big game Meg is playing,

and the only way to win is not to play it.

-Is that a <i>WarGames</i> reference?
-Might be.

-You know <i>WarGames?</i>
-Yeah.

Still finding out new stuff about you.

That's the adventure.

-There's a nerd in there.
-Maybe there is.

I might bang her later.

How about a nice game of chess?

I prefer banging.

Dad, have you seen my book bag?

-What, Chris?
-(SCREAMING)

Oh, Peter, there you are.

Would you go tell Meg
that lunch is on the table?

-Oh, Meg's not here.
-What do you mean?

She and Quagmire went up to his cabin
for the weekend.

-What?
-Yeah, I drew you a crude flip book

to explain what's happening.

Okay, I got a little off track there,
but they went to his cabin.

Peter, Quagmire has a name for that cabin.

He calls it his sex cabin.

No, he doesn't.
He calls it "The Stuffet Inn."

Oh, my God,
I can't believe you knew about this

and you let her go.

Hey, don't give me that crap.

I'm doing exactly what you told me to do.

You said don't mess with her business,
so I didn't.

Peter, this is different.

It's one thing to rebelliously flaunt
an older guy

in front of your parents,
but it's a whole other thing

to go away with him for the weekend
to his sex cabin.

Oh, is that right?

"Oh, don't worry, Peter,
he's not going to sleep with her."

That's you. Nerd.

Look, everyone knows if you go away
with a guy for the weekend

and don't have sex with him,
you're a huge bitch.

We got to stop them.

-So you admit you were wrong.
-Yes.

-You admit you were stupid.
-Yes, yes.

-You admit all women are stupid.
-No.

All right, I'll take what I can get.
Come on. To the Peter-dactyl.

(SCREECHING)

(BUZZING AND CRACKLING)

Oh, no, now I got
to take care of the babies.

Look, Peter, his car's still there.

Maybe they haven't left yet.

Quagmire, let me in, you son of a bitch.

QUAGMIRE ON RECORDING:
<i>I'm sorry I'm not home to receive you.</i>

<i>The reason being that you have</i>
<i>sufficiently scared me away</i>

<i>from your wife or daughter.</i>

<i>I plan to get help and use</i>
<i>better judgment in the future.</i>

Wait a minute, so Quagmire just changed
all of a sudden, just like that?

You want me to read this or not?

No, Grandpa, I don't.

No kid wants to be read anything anymore.

Computers exist.
It's just you won't leave.

Okay, where were we?
Quagmire's front door.

You think they're hiding in there?

-(ENGINE REVVING)
-Oh, no! Peter, look.

See you later, suckers.

-Oh, good luck to them.
-Peter!

Oh, right. Let's go.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(HORNS HONKING)

We're never going to get up there.

I wonder what's causing all this traffic.

Oh, boy.
Yep, there's the problem.

Not drawn yet.

Come on, guys.
Really? Let's go.

What the hell's going on up there?

(SNORING)

What? Yep. Yep.

(OWL HOOTING)

So tell the truth.

Have you brought other women
up here before?

-Honestly? Two.
-Really?

Yep, I brought the ashes
of my third grade teacher,

Mrs. Nicholson,
and spread them across the lake,

per her last request.

Oh.

The other was some skag

I met on a dock four miles from here.

-What?
-(IMITATES BUZZER)

Strike four, Jelly Jealouson.

The other was my sister.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(SIGHS) It's so nice up here.

I know. I love the way the fire

makes the shadows dance
around behind us.

One time, my friends and I went camping,

and nobody could start a campfire,

and then I tried to start
the campfire, and I could.

That's insane.

Wha... What is going on over here?

Wha... Are we taking our shirts off now?

Okay, follow the leader.

Come on, Peter, hurry!

Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

(LOON CALLING)

Listen to that. It's a loon.

That's beautiful.

You know, we ought to get
a (BLEEP) cabin up here.

Peter, we're wasting time.

Quagmire's in there about
to have sex with our daughter.

That son of a bitch.

Let's... Wait... W-wait a minute,
do you hear that?

I don't hear anything.

I know. Isn't it bliss?

Peter, let's go!

Mmm. Thanks for the ice cream, Glenn.

And you're right, somehow it does
taste better in my underpants.

It's like being at the beach, huh?

Now get over here
while the inside of your mouth

is still freezing cold.

There you are, you son of a bitch!

You get away from my daughter,
you pervert!

Meg, get in the car, we're going home.

I'm not going home!

I'm 18, and you can't tell me
what to do anymore.

Meg, I'm only going to say this once.

You may be an adult,
but you're still my daughter,

and it's my job to protect
you from errant wieners.

So, I don't care how old you are,

you're going to do what I say
and get in the damn car!

Yes, Daddy.

If you ever touch my daughter again,

I will cut your thing off
and feed it to Brian.

Okay.

And Peter and I get this cabin
for one weekend a month.

-Do you understand me?
-Yes, ma'am.

Peter, I got us the cabin.

I don't want to see your face
knocking on our door

for at least a month.

Would you sign the guest book
on your way out?

Lois... Griffin.

Peter... Griffin.

We... Heard... A loon.

You know, Mom and Dad,
I'm really glad that you kept me

from doing what I was going to do.

Well, that's what parents are for, Meg.

No matter what age you are.

We love you and we just
never want to see you hurt.

I only wish I'd seen what was going on

from the start, like your father did.

Well, I know the signs...

because the same thing happened to me.

An older neighbor.

Her name was Elaine.

I was 18 and my body was firm
from push-ups and sit-ups.

I was stunning.

But while my body was mature,

I had the mind of a 12-year-old.

Elaine invited me over
with the promise of pie.

Little did I know this would lead

to an eight-year-long
psychosexual entanglement.

She's probably dead now.

Life's funny sometimes.

And scene.

Morning, Opie.

Hey, what's going on?
You going somewhere?

(BABBLING)

You got fired? Why?

(BABBLING)

Oh, well, it's no wonder

Nice to meet you.

W-What is this?

We doing a new secret handshake now?

No, Griffin, she's deaf.

Oh. Can she read lips?

Yes, I can.

So if I do this, I can talk
about what a sweet rack she has?

Yes, but try not to make
a boob-honking gesture

with your other hand
while you're saying it.

-Sorry.
-It's okay.

I'm used to people being

a little uncomfortable with me at first.

If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

Yeah, actually, I do.

Are your other senses better
on account of you can't hear?

Like, can you smell my farts
before they even come out?

'Cause I got one in the pocket right now,

and I want to know if I need
to feel self-conscious about it.

I can't smell it, no.

I might be able to see it, though.

A lot of people make small movements
when they fart.

They twitch their eye or something.

Oh, like subtle giveaways, huh?

All right, well, t-tell me
if you can see when it happens.

(FARTS)

You just farted.

Oh, my God, you saw that?

You can see all my tiny, subtle movements?

(FARTS)

You just did it again.

Well, this is gonna be a delight!

I don't know why Lois always said

she had problems with female coworkers.

So Abby, Elaine and Janet have
their little lunch clique,

and of course I'm not invited.

Seems like you're doing everything

and they're doing nothing.

Well, I don't know,
but what I do know is

-that in the staff meeting,
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Christina said my inventory
system wasn't feasible.

She's obviously threatened by you.

But when the associate sales manager
came back in the room...

It's ridiculous, and I support you fully.

...she told him the idea
as if it was hers...

You can't let them get to you.

They're jealous of what you have.

It's nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with them.

Only you can prevent forest fires.

Hey, Peter, you ready
to go to The Clam?

(QUIETLY) Whoa, who's the hot chick?

Oh, that's Stella.

You don't have to whisper, she's deaf.

Really? Oh, my God, that's hot.

I didn't know you had
a thing for deaf chicks.

Any kind of disabled chick, Peter.

They can do things to you

that regular chicks don't even think of.

Besides, you know me.

I'm into a lot of different stuff.

-What, did you hear something?
-No, it's all good.

All right.

You know, Chris,
a little friendly advice.

Uh, you're gonna start dating soon,

probably good to get in the habit

of chewing with your mouth closed

Doesn't bother me, I'm just...
You know, one friend to another.

Oh, what, you got a problem with me?

You think I'm gross?

Don't do that.
Don't do that.

Yeah. This is what you are
and this is what I am.

Peter, hurry up!

You're missing dinner.

Lois, what the hell?

Oh, my God, Peter, are you okay?

What the hell happened to the stairs?

-They're all slippery now!
-I had them replaced, remember?

The old ones were so rough,
and Stewie got that splinter,

so I thought replacing the wood
was the best way to go.

When'd you do that?

The other day, when you spent
all that time at the drugstore.

Oh, yeah.

Couldn't figure out if that Hispanic lady
worked there or not.

Um, excuse me.

Excuse me.

Boy, I wonder where
the shampoos are around here.

I said, "I wonder where
the shampoos are around here."

Oh, for God's sake, I almost thought
you were a regular person.

Where's the shampoo?

What the hell?

(PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Hey, guys, all the action's over here!

Quagmire, what is all this?

Peter's new coworker gave me an idea.

Welcome to Disabled Ladies Night.

Mine are made from teak.

What are yours made from?

Yeah, mine are actually just
pressboard with wood veneer.

I can't get wet.

Oh. I think I see my friends.

Hey, uh, you guys
enjoy the carnival.

I'm gonna get a drink at the bar.

Hey, uh, anyone sitting here?

No, go ahead.

Thanks.

Hey, would you like to go out sometime?

Wow, that was fast.

Yeah, well, you know, I read
somewhere that women decide

within the first seven seconds
if they're interested in you or not

so I figured I wouldn't waste
anybody's time.

Fair enough.
Sure, let's go out.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Like you said,
I've already decided.

-I'm Kate.
-I'm Brian.

Hey, uh, you want
to go outside?

Maybe a little quieter.

Sure.

Oh, my God, I...

Hey, check out Brian
with the blind chick.

Hey, don't worry, Brian,

you're still doing
better than Quagmire.

He got a hooker.

Ha!

No, no, but she is a prostitute.

Listen, you know, we can do
something else if you want.

Why? I'm having a good time.

Well, I mean, I just don't know

how much fun it is for a blind person
to go to the movies.

Brian, blind people
go to the movies all the time.

We just listen.

I might be blind, but my brain
has been trained to listen

to any movie and know exactly
what's happening on screen.

Like, I loved Titanic.

I'm the king of the world!

(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(WHOOPING)

So you sure you don't
need me to come in?

Maybe show you to your bed.

Pretty sure I can find it, thanks.

Maybe next time
I'll have trouble, though.

You might have to help me
find it next time.

So there's a next time.

-Definitely.
-Great.

Well, all right, good night.

(DOG BARKING)

Ugh! Our stupid neighbor's dog barks 24/7.

God, I hate dogs.

Y-You do?

Yeah, they're just slobbery,
annoying, needy little bastards.

I'm just not really a dog person, I guess.

Oh. Uh, yeah, me neither.

Dog people can get pretty annoying.

Wow, this is a nice apartment you have.

Is this your dog?

Yes. Isn't he the cutest
little cutie-wutie?

Look how cute he is.

Yes, he's very cute.

Yes, he's cute.

Yes, he's cute, cute, cute, cute.

Look at him.
Look at him. Look at him.

(CHUCKLES) Okay.

Look at it! Look at that face! Come on!

Look at that face!
You look at him!

Look at that (BLEEP) face!

PETER: Hey, guys, this is driving me nuts.

Was one of the dwarves named Snappy?

Kind of well dressed?

Or am I-I just making that up?

(GRUNTING AND SCREAMING)

(BLEEP)

Oh, my God, Dad!

Dad, are you okay?

Damn it, I hate these new stairs!

Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm-I'm just gonna
lie here until the pain goes away.

What are you guys watching?

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>

Brian, if I ever take up roller derby,

what do you think my name should be?

Bruisin' B. Anthony,
Alicia Sleaze or Quahag?

How about Harlot O'Scara?

Aw, you dick, that's genius.

How'd your date go?

Aw, went great.
We had an awesome time.

She's really smart, really funny.

-Cute?
-Yeah, hot, actually.

I don't know how she does it,

but she dresses really well
for a blind girl.

I mean, like,
her body is just...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

-What?
-Don't "what" me.

You just said she's blind.

You just said it.

You totally buried the lede.

Yeah, well, it's not that important.

So what if she can't see?

She's amazing in every other way.

Okay, if you say so.

Hey, does she have really
weird, messed-up eyes?

No, her eyes are normal.

They're beautiful, actually.

Bet they're not.

-Bet they look like bowls of milk.
-Shut up.

You sure she isn't just using you?

Seeing-eye dogs are expensive.

She may just be trying
to get one for free.

No, actually, she doesn't want
a seeing-eye dog.

She hates dogs.

What?

She doesn't like dogs.

She's just not a dog person.

What? Does she not
know you're a dog?

How is that possible?

Well, we-we haven't done anything yet.

So I'm-I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna avoid touching her

until a little more time has passed.

And by the time I tell her,
I'll have impressed her so much

that the dog thing won't even matter.

Yeah, well, good luck with that.

You know, I like your delusion, Brian.

Most people would say,
"I lost, I give up,"

but you, you just keep trying.

You're like the Dominican Republic.

Always killing the guy in charge
and saying,

"Oh, this new guy,
this new guy's gonna get it right."

Well, that's just because
I have confidence

that I'll find happiness.

Hey, anything's possible, right?

I mean, I once found the Batcave.

Look, you can't expect to hire 60 workers

to dig a cave under your house
and then keep it a secret.

I mean, those men live in this town.

Yeah, but I told them it was
part of a geological survey.

Batman, Batman.

They built a lazy Susan
for your nuclear car.

That's something they consider
conversation-worthy.

Gosh, this has been
an amazing week, Brian.

I still can't believe you beat up

that guy who tried to mug us.

That was a great dinner.

Yeah, I really liked that
salmon you recommended.

Yes. May I help you gentlemen?

(DISGUISED VOICE)
"Hey, you're in a tough part of town.

"Now, give me your purse, doll face."

Hey, you get your hands off that!

I don't care how many
of you there are,

you're not taking this purse!

"Ah, the hell we aren't.
Let's get him, boys!"

-Brian?
-Stay right there, Kate.

I'll handle this.

(GRUNTING)

Yeah, you like that, huh?

"Ooh! This guy's tough!"

(GRUNTING)

"No fair. He knows karate.

"Usually, handsome guys ain't
so good with their fists."

(GRUNTING)

And stay away from my girlfriend.

Brian, I know karate, too.

I can help you.

"You stay out of this, lady!"

(GROANING)

I got one! I think I got one!

Yeah, yeah, but I-I got the other four.

They're-they're gone now.

They're gone.

Well, they took the gift I had for you,
but at least you're okay.

And that trip to the Eiffel Tower
was just amazing.

(PANTING)

Are we almost at the top?

Yeah, just a few more steps.

Here we are.

Ah, the winds of Paris.

Isn't that what they say?

Oh, that breeze is gorgeous.

And I think I smell... Croissants?

Do you?

You have an amazing sense of smell.

Oh, there it is.

-There's what?
-Oh, nothing.

Just the, uh, Goodyear Blimp.

It says,
"I love you, Kate," all in lights.

(GASPS) Here in Paris?

Yeah, it's... It's here for
Wimbledon or something.

Oh, my God.
That's the most romantic thing

anybody's ever done for me.

Well, get used to it.

You're going to be
hearing a lot of things

I've done for you.

(SCREAMING)

Damn it!

Oh, my God, Peter. Are you okay?

No, I am not okay!

Nothing about this is okay!

You just need to be more careful

coming down the stairs.
That's all.

(GRUNTS) Easy for you to say.

This is stressing the crap out of me.

Like when we had that
easily startled wallpaper.

-(VOICES SCREAMING)
-Ahhh!

Well, it's getting late.

I should probably go.

Brian, this is like our sixth date.

I'm beginning to feel like you're not
attracted to me or something.

No, I... Oh, my God, I'm...

I'm so attracted to you. I...

So why haven't we done anything about it?

I-I just...You know, sometimes

taking things slower is better.

Just ask any sloth.

MAN: Hey, is sometimes
taking things slower better?

Yeah.

I just... I like you a lot, and I...

I don't want to ruin anything

by moving too fast, you know?

'Cause sometimes, when you...

Brian, you never told me
you had a beard.

I love beards.

Oh. Yeah.

No, hey, I'm bearding
it up over here.

Hey, Brian, would you be cool
with meeting my parents?

They're in town this weekend,

and I thought we
could all have dinner.

Uh... Sure.

Are they... Are they driving themselves?

(CHUCKLES)

If you're asking if they can see, yes.

And since you can see,

why don't you tell me
how these look?

Uh... They look pretty damn great.

Then why don't you tell me how they feel?

Uh, next time.

Some things are worth waiting for.

Wow. You're really a true gentleman.

Yep, not too many of us left.

(COUGHING OVER SHUTTER CLICKING)

-Stewie, I need your help.
-What? What is it?

I have a crisis situation here.

Kate wants me to meet her parents.

Hey, guys.

Just gonna... Gonna take this.

Thank you.

What the hell am I going to do?

All right, all right, just calm down.

Calm down?

We're all supposed to have
dinner tomorrow night,

and her parents
are going to see that I'm a dog.

(SCREAMING AND GROANING)

(BLEEP)

Don't worry, Brian.
I'll come up with something.

Remember, I'm the guy who came up

with the choreography to <i>Showgirls.</i>

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, stop. Stop. Stop.

Elizabeth, darling,
too much hands, not enough hips.

Can I just show you?

One, two, three, four.

I'm dancing from my vagina.

One, two, three, four.

I'm grinding, I'm grinding.

Orgasm eyes, orgasm eyes.

And we're done.

You do 20% that, and we got a movie.

Peter, what is all this?

Oh, hi, Lois.

I live upstairs now.

-What?
-That's right.

I made a nest of my old underwears

on which to lay my eggs,

and I shall raise my young
in this room alone.

Peter, you're being an idiot.

Oh, really?

Would an idiot have been able

to rig this rig to that rig?

Peter, that's nothing.

Oh, is it?

I died! I died!

Oh, hi. You must be Kate.

I'm Brian's nurse.

He's had a little accident,
I'm afraid.

Oh, my God, Brian!
Are you okay?

Ah, don't worry. I'm fine.

I'm just sort of bandaged up right now.

You must be Kate's parents.

It's so nice to meet you.

Well, it's lovely to meet you, too.

So what happened?

What happened is this one's a hero,
is what happened.

Rescued two children
from a burning building.

Can you imagine?

Not quite in time,
they were both horribly burned.

Have that sort of cr√®me br√ªl√©e face
going on now,

but he saved their lives.

Oh, my God, Brian.

I know, right? So noble.

Plus he's the only one of my patients

to never ask me for hand work.

Such a gentleman.
Never even tried anything

when I'm giving him a sponge bath.

And I'm very thorough.

I will wash the abdominals.

Not all nurses do, but I do.
And yes, sometimes I graze it,

but you know what?
I'm a healthcare professional.

It's what I do. It's my work.

It's important to me,

and this one respects that.

And I'm very grateful.

Why are you here again?

Oh, my God!
I am so, so sorry.

Uh, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

(SNIFFING) What's that smell?

It smells like wet dog in here.

That is the... The smell of backed up,

unreleased genital essence.

As I said,
he's been an amazing gentleman.

Well, I'd like to propose a toast.

To Brian and Kate.

I know we just met, but you seem

like you're really good
for our daughter.

And risking your life for those kids?

You're a good guy, Brian.

A really good guy.

Wow. Thanks.

(THUMPING RAPIDLY)

What's that thumping noise?

(SOFTLY) It's your tail.
Stop wagging your tail.

I can't help it. Do something.

(GROANS)

(GROANING) Oh... Oh, damn it.

I meant hold it, not cut it off.

You weren't specific.
I've never done this before.

Are you okay, Brian?

Yeah, I'm just so happy
to meet you both.

-(SIZZLING)
-What the hell are you...

I'm cauterizing your tail.
Trust me, I'm a nurse.

-(STIFLED GROANING)
-Brian?

What's going on over there?

(SNIFFS) I think they burned our dinner.

Oh, God, it hurts. It hurts, Stewie.

Here's a little morphine.

What the hell? You're not
gonna stick me with that thing.

KATE'S DAD:
I don't think that's a real nurse.

Just hold still.
Pretend you're at the vet.

Vet? I hate the vet!

(BARKING ANGRILY)

There's a dog in here!

Yes! Okay?

There's a dog in here.
I'm a dog!

(GASPING)

I'm so sorry, Kate.

I-I know you hate dogs, and I...

I wanted to tell you...
I-I really did...

but I-I just thought...

I thought, if we got to know
each other better first,

you would eventually
be able to see past it.

And I... I just...
I really care about you,

and I really want this to work, and I'm...

I'm so sorry I didn't tell you before.

Can you ever forgive me?

Do you think that you can
still be with me?

(SIGHS) You know what, Brian?

I could have gotten over
the fact that you're a dog,

because I really do care about you

and I feel like we had a connection,

but I can't get over the fact
that you lied to me.

You screwed up, Brian.

And now you're
going to have to watch me

walk out that door.

(ALARM BLARING)

-(HORN HONKING)
-(MAN SCREAMING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(CRASHING)

Well, it sounds like I'm needed outside.

Mom, what were all those carpenters
doing here today?

Putting back our old crappy stairs, Meg.

I didn't have a choice.

Yay! I love my old stairs!

(GIGGLING)

Uh-oh, I forgot to cut Joe down.

Joe, what are you doing up there?

Enjoying Heaven, Bonnie.

Come join me.

There's a gun in my nightstand.

Brian, I know you're upset

about what happened
with Kate and everything,

but I did have one more thought.

Yeah, what's that?

Well, since Kate is blind,

you could probably just
do a different voice

and go out with her all over again.

-(NASALLY) Hey. Are you Kate?
-Yes.

-Hey, it's Noah from Jdate.
-Oh, my God! Hi!

There's a rock right there!

There's a huge rock right there,

and it's covered up by grass
and there's no way you can see it.

And I got lucky.

But someone else could
hurt themselves,

and, and a small cut is a, is a
death sentence in these times,

Hi, glad to know you.

Gosh, you know,
our little Scotty seems

to be having such a good time
with your son.

Would you be interested
in getting them together for a playdate?

Oh, that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

Look at them.
They're getting along

like Billy Bob Thornton
and his cat.

Leave me alone!
I'm taking a bath!

Stewie, do you want to be the Autobots
or the Decepticons?

What's with all
these labels, man?

Autobots, Decepticons,
gay, straight--

just pick a few robots,
and let's party.

Hey, what's going on in here?

Oh, hello, Brian.
We're playing Transformers.

Oh, cool.
Who's this little guy?

It's my new friend, Scotty.

Do you mind? We're busy.
Oh.

Hi, doggie.
You want to play with us?

Scotty, Scotty, it's fine. It's fine.
You don't have to.

He doesn't know
Transformers.

Yeah, actually, I'd love to play.
Who should I be?

Should I be one of these guys?

I'll be this guy.
Who's this guy, huh?

What's this guy's story?

That's Optimus Prime.
You can't be him. Scotty's Optimus Prime.

Oh, all right. Well, I'll be,
I'll be this guy.

How about this guy?
(GROWLS)

What was that?
Did you just growl?

What robot growls?
That's Starscream.

He's a Decepticon.
I'm the Decepticons.

-Look, why don't you just beat it?
-All right, all right, relax.

I'll-I'll just, I'll be
this guy over here.

That's He-Man.
We're playing Transformers.

Well, maybe this is the one
where He-Man visits.

Brian, how is He-Man
supposed to get to Cybertron?

Hey, "Up, up, and away," right?

He-Man doesn't fly.

Look, why are you being such a dick
about this? I'm just trying to join in.

Yeah, you don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

-You sound like...
-That's not fair.

-I think I'm doing pretty well.
-No, you don't know the characters, Brian.

You don't know the characters.
If you could hear yourself right now,

you would not stop
throwing up.

You can't just put He-Man
in Transformers' world, all right?

He wouldn't be able
to get to Cybertron

because he lives in Eternia, and Eternia
is in an entirely different dimension.

He can just take his rocket ship.

Get... get out of here.

I'm afraid
he's very sick.

In fact, his lab-work shows he's suffering
from Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Oh, my God!

Are you saying
Scotty has cancer?!

I don't know, I didn't

Look, do you have
any idea

how expensive
medical school is?

No, I don't.

Well, it's probably
pretty expensive.

Lois! We came as soon
as we got your call.

Oh, Hope, Ben,

I'm so sorry to have to tell you this,

but Scotty has...

Cancer. We know.

-You do?
-Yes, we're aware of his condition.

But you shouldn't have
brought him to the hospital

without talking to us first.

Why wouldn't we bring him?
He was unconscious.

He clearly
needed treatment.

Oh, no, he doesn't
receive treatment.

-What?!
-We're Christian Scientists.

We don't accept medical care for ourselves
and we don't permit it for our children.

But your son
has cancer!

Wait a minute.
Christian Science.

Is that, is that that thing
all them gaybo Hollywood actors do

to keep their stuff away
from other guys' butts?

Don't you understand?
Scotty needs help.

And he'll get it...
through faith.

That's right.
We will heal him with the power of prayer.

You can't just let them
just walk out of here!

Oh, I think
they'll be back.

-Are those their keys?
-No, they're my keys.

And they said because of their faith,

they don't believe
in medicine.

Mom, I think there's a lot
of religions that do that.

Well, that may be, Meg, but that
poor little baby has cancer,

and they're just gonna take him
home and pray over him?!

Well, that's what they do.

They believe that disease
is just an illusion.

And the only way to fight it
is to make your faith stronger.

Illusions?! You want to
talk about illusions?!

If you die tomorrow,

you think we're gonna be devastated!
But you know what?!

We're just gonna go out
and buy another dog!

And maybe <i>this</i> dog
will fetch a stick

and bring me my slippers
instead of prattling on

about the pros and cons
of various religions!

Chris, I think you've had
too much sugar cereal.

I think I haven't had enough!

Peter, I have to go talk
to the Jennings

and ask them to reconsider
getting treatment for Scotty.

-I'm going with you, Lois.
-Yeah, I'll go, too.

All right, but try
to keep your mouth shut, okay?

You have a habit
of saying the wrong thing.

During his 22-year reign,

this French monarch known
as "The Spider King" had

an ongoing feud with Charles
the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.

-Peter?
-Who was King Louis XII?

Ooh, I'm sorry, Peter, we were
looking for King Louis XI.

Ah, damn it, I knew that!

Ah, well, (BLEEP) me in the (BLEEP)
with a big, black (BLEEP).

King Louis XI.

Tim, select.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, Lois, Peter,
come on in.

We were just praying
for Scotty's recovery.

If you'd like,
you can join us.

Well, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

You'd better not just have
church toys.

Look, I don't mean to question
your religious beliefs,

but as a mother,
I just can't bear the thought

of little Scotty
not getting the help he needs.

You really needn't worry, Lois.

Scotty will get all
the help he needs.

-From where?
-From here.

<i>Science and Health with Key</i>
<i>to the Scriptures</i> by Mary Baker Eddy?

Let me see that.

This is your god?! A woman?!

Well, she's the founder of our faith.

Oh, really? So with this book
from the 1800s,

you can pray away paralysis
or terminal illness?

Yes, we would pray for
anyone who's afflicted.

Well, then I'll tell you who you
should really be praying for.

Out-of-work clowns.

I need 40.

Ben, Hope, please,

I just want to do anything
I can to help your son.

Well, you can, Lois.
Stay and pray with us.

I think you'll find that with God's love
and a true belief,

all manner of miracles
are possible.

Look, I'm a churchgoer, too,

but sometimes prayer
isn't enough.

He needs professional
medical care.

You know Lois, this couch would be perfect
for one of your red wine pass-outs.

Look, we appreciate your concern, Lois,
but Scotty is our son,

and we have to tend
to him as we see fit.

But your son is sick!
He needs help!

Um, does your god also not believe
in putting out snacks for the guests?

Come on, Lois.
I think we're wasting our time here.

They're obviously very committed
to their beliefs.

But their beliefs
are crazy, Brian.

I don't know who's crazier-- these people
or those Seventh-Day Adventists.

I'm a Methodist.

We believe that the Lord is our Savior,

and we remember Him by going to church
and praising Him every Sunday.

I'm a Seventh-Day
Adventist.

We believe all the same
things that you believe,

but we go to church on Saturdays.

What...?!

(LAUGHING CRAZILY)

Ga-ga-ga-ga-gahh!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

I know it's frustrating, Lois,

but the fact is,
there are no laws that say

those people have to take
their child to the doctor.

How can that be?

Children are citizens, too.
They should have rights.

Well, it's a tricky area, Lois.

You could file a suit,
but that could take months,

and even then,
there's no guarantee

the court wouldn't support the parents'
right to practice their religion.

How could we live in
a country that would allow

a sick child to die?

Look, this country was founded
by people who came here

to escape
religious persecution.

They made sure we all had
a right to religious freedom,

and it's my job to protect that.

So there's nothing
we can do?

You could contribute
to the Policeman's Ball.

What? What does that have to do
with a sick child?

Look, it's
a nice night out,

you're eating
at a fancy buffet,

the captain does
his Al Pacino...

Joe, we're really more
of a Fireman's Ball family.

Oh, yeah? Are the firemen gonna
come and put out the <i>rape?!</i>

(SIGHS)

Peter, we can't let this happen.

I mean, we're parents.

What if this was one of our kids?

It's too bad we're not the A-Team.

'Cause then we could just go
in there and steal that kid.

I don't know
about that, Peter.

Kidnapping is against the law.

It's too bad we're not Taken from <i>Taken.</i>

Then I could dip my head in brown paint

and galumph around Europe
looking for my hot daughter.

Although is it any worse
than what they're doing?

They're letting a kid die.

It's too bad we're not Dragonheart.

Then we could just fly around on a dragon
and forget about all this.

You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.

What? What the hell are
you talking about?

I'm talking about us going in there

and taking that kid
and getting him some help.

I mean, I know it's wrong,
but it's better than just letting him die.

Hey, that's not a bad idea.
It's like we're doing a public service.

Like those idiots who get
together to paint a school.

This underachieving,
crime-ridden school

is now fawn beige,

thanks to guilty white people
with no weekend plans!

OTHERS: Yay!

Peter, what the hell?
Where's your ski mask?

It's kind of hard to
breathe in those things,

so I just dressed up
like Harry Potter.

(SIGHS) All right, let's go.

Lois, if anything
should happen to us,

I want you to know, I haven't
been happy for a long time.

Yes, Peter, you've told me that,
like, ten times.

All right, all the lights are out.
They must be asleep.

It's go time.

Peter, what the
hell was that?

That's what you do, Lois.

Okay, now,
take this walkie-talkie

and confirm that I'm at
the various checkpoints.

Oh. Okay.

"Peter up on a telephone pole"?

Check.

-"Peter cutting the wires to the alarm"?
-Check.

"Sexy Peter distracting the guards"?

Check.

Hello, boys.

Come up and have sex
with me some time.

"Van full of Peters
who all have stern faces

because they're about
to pull off a heist"?

Check.

"Upside-down Peter who isn't
revealed to be upside-down

until the camera spins around
and shows that he is"?

Check.

"Peter in an open airplane door

slapping other Peters on the
back as they parachute out"?

Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go! Check!

"Super gymnastic Asian Peter

contorted into a box that will
be delivered into the house"?

<i>Hai!</i>

"Peter who hasn't answered

because something has gone
terribly wrong"?

<i>Peter? Peter, are you there?</i>

Now, let's go get that kid.

Okay, he's in the
left upstairs bedroom.

All right, you keep the car
going in case there's trouble.

All right, I got him, Lois.

(QUIETLY): Peter, what the--
that's not Scotty! That's Ben!

Oh. Well, you know, we ain't
known this family that long.

I'm still learning
everybody's names.

Damn it, put him back and
go get Scotty, the baby!

Okay, so I'll go get the baby,
and while I'm doing that,

maybe you do something
about that snatchy tone.

Lois, is this the right one?!

Shh! Peter!
Yes. Now, come on.

-HOPE: What was that?
-BEN: I don't know.

-It came from Scotty's room.
-(TIRES SCREECH)

All right, we did it!

Yes! We got the kid
and the treasure.

Peter, there's
no treasure.

Oh, well, never mind, then.

TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>One-Hour</i>
<i>Crime Show Where the Murderer</i>

<i>is the Most Famous Person</i>
<i>in the Credits.</i>

I think you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

What do we got?

Looks like somebody
had a rough night out.

Boy, you can say that again.
Better get the coroner down here.

He's still got his watch and his wallet.
Guess that rules out robbery.

Stabbed 17 times in the chest,

I'd say the murderer knew
the victim intimately.

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker
with some breaking news.

A local kidnapping
has rocked Quahog tonight.

"Rocked Quahog"? Really?

The whole town is r--
The family maybe... is rocked.

But the whole--
All right, well, in any event,

we now go live to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa.

Let's see how much
she's "rocked" by all this.

Tricia?

Tom, I'm standing here
with Mayor Adam West,

with the latest information
about the disappearance

of young Scotty Jennings.

What can you tell us,
Mr. Mayor?

Please, Mr. Mayor is my father.
Call me John Mayor.

Your body is a
wonderland, by the way.

What is the city doing
to help rescue the missing boy?

Well, we're looking
for this child

using all the latest technology,
including the newest,

most advanced
multimedia milk cartons.

Help me! I'm missing!
Help!

Why are you still eating breakfast?!
I'm kidnapped!

Why are you turning me the other way?
I'm still here!

Scotty Jennings?

Oh, my God!

I know she was upset,
but do you think

Lois would've gone
so far as to kidnap him?

Of course she did.
She'll do anything for attention.

I know.
She's like the B<i>oy Who Cried Wolf.</i>

-(SHEEP BLEATING)
-Wolf, wolf!

-Did you hear that? Somebody needs help!
-Let's go!

(GUNSHOT, SCREAMS)

Oh, my God, Charles!

Oh, my God,
I'll run and get help.

No, no, we've got to carry him!
We can't leave him here, there's a wolf!

Um, there's not really a wolf.

-What?!
-Tell my kids I love 'em.

Charlie! Charlie!

This was so funny in my head
when I planned it.

Don't you worry, Scotty.

We're gonna get you
to the hospital

and get you the medical
attention you need.

Yeah, hang in there, buddy.

When this is over, we
can get some ice cream.

Me and Lois can get
some ice cream, not you.

They're gonna be sticking
needles in you everywhere.

You know, Peter, you were right,
this is actually kind of a rush.

I mean, look at us,
we're like<i> Thelma and Louise.</i>

Yeah, but we all know that
didn't end well for them.

(SIRENS WAILING)

You know what?
Let's just turn ourselves in.

I got a great lawyer.

And he says, worst case,
eight to 12 years.

And when we get out, we'll still have
the rest of our lives ahead of us.

-(WOMEN SCREAMING)
-(CRASH)

Good-bye, terrible women.

Oh, my God!

This is Tricia Takanawa.

I am standing outside Quahog Hospital,

where accused kidnappers
Lois and Peter Griffin have just arrived.

Also arriving is
my overprotective boyfriend,

who is suspicious whenever I am
called into work at night,

even though I've been a
reporter for years, Tyrone.

I thought I told you
to mention my painting business.

Lois, Peter, stop right there.

You're under arrest for kidnapping.

I'm gonna have to ask you
to hand over the baby and surrender.

Joe, please get out of our way.

I promise, when this is over,
I'll gladly go to prison

for the rest of my life,
but not until I bring

this defenseless child into the hospital
to get him the treatment he deserves.

Uh, Joe, we would like two tickets
to the Policeman's Ball.

-Too late!
-(TIRES SCREECH)

There they are!

Lois, please!

Stop what you're doing and
give Scotty back to us!

I can't do that, Hope.

But we've entrusted our
son into the Lord's hands.

I know. And maybe that's why
he ended up in my hands.

The Lord can't do everything,
you know.

-Blasphemy!
-Heresy!

Sodomy! Sorry, I don't even know
what's going on. How you doin'?

Ben, Hope, I know you don't believe
in modern medicine,

but you do believe
in the power of prayer.

-That's right.
-And through the years,

when there was disease
or infection,

people of good faith
would pray to God for a cure.

Yes. It's what we do.

Well, then isn't it possible
that penicillin, vaccines

and antibiotics are all
actually answered prayers?

And isn't it possible that
the amazing men and women of medicine

who brought about these miracles

could be the instruments
of God's answers to our prayers?

It's good so far, Lois.

Try to work a few laughs
in there if you can.

Look, I believe life is sacred.

And I know you want Scotty
to live a full life.

-(LAUGHS)
-And if that's true, then I think

it's wrong for you to ignore
what very well could be the Lord's will.

I mean, what's the
point in praying to God

if you're just going to wipe
your butt with his answers?

Hope, Ben,

please let God
answer your prayers.

Please let your son get help.

Well, I guess through
the Lord's will,

anything is possible.

All right, Lois.

Scotty can have his treatment.

Oh, thank you!

Thank you,
and God bless you both!

Hey, everybody!
We're all gonna get laid!

(WILD CHEERING)

TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>Dracula in San Francisco.</i>

Ooh.

Well, that's why
we have the lab.

Well, I just got off
the phone with Hope,

and it sounds like Scotty's
gonna make a full recovery.

You hear that, Stewie?

Looks like your little
friend's gonna be okay.

Eh, I don't care about him.

I've got a new friend
who's got leprosy.

(CHUCKLES) See, he's funny.

Peter, are you actually reading
that Christian Science book?

Yeah, you know, I figured
I'd give it a shot.

I mean, wouldn't it
be cool if you could

pray really hard for something,
and it actually happened?

I am so happy for me.

I deserve this.

When do you think
the Queen's gonna die?

(MUFFLED): Good evening,
I'm Tom Tucker,

and the reason I'm wearing
this mask is because

we've got a Make-A-Wish
kid in the studio tonight,

who, as you'll find out
as the show goes on,

is quite a cougher.

In local news, Mayor West
signed a bill today...

-(COUGHS)
-See? That's what I was talking about.

(CONTINUES COUGHING)

Are we gonna get that,
or are we gonna wait for commercial?

No, no, you have to spray it.

You can't just wipe--
look, you know what?

Let's just throw
the whole camera out.

Okay, Joyce, you talk now.
I don't even want to open my mouth.

You know, Tom,
I haven't seen you in a mask

since you went under the stage
name George P. Wilbur.

Oh-ho-ho, Joyce, you know
we don't talk about that on the air.

Oh, my God!

Did she... did
she just say

that George P. Wilbur was
Tom Tucker's stage name?

Who the hell
is George P. Wilbur?

That's the guy who played
Michael Myers in <i>Halloween 4,</i>

the greatest movie
of all time.

I've only seen that movie
about a thousand times.

How could I not have noticed that?

(SCREAMING)

(CRYING)

(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

(SOBBING)

TOM: Good evening. I'm Michael Myers.

I have enormous
psychological problems,

and I'm going
to take them out on you.

It <i>is</i> him. I
can't believe it.

I mean, that's, like,
my favorite movie ever!

I thought <i>The Flintstones in Viva</i>
<i>Rock Vegas</i> was your favorite movie.

No, that's my
favorite period piece.

Well, that and <i>Good Night and Good Luck.</i>

Even though I was tricked
into leaving early.

Good night and good luck.

And good night
and good luck to you, sir.

Oh, hi, Chris. How was school?

It was great.
I met a girl, Mom!

That's wonderful, honey.

Yeah, her name is Lindsey, like the state.

-Is she nice?
-Yeah, she's really nice and super pretty,

and her bicycle seat
smells like strawberries.

Oh. Okay.

I'm gonna go upstairs
and alternate between

hopeful excitement
and suicidal pessimism!

(SIGHS) Got to get the energy up.

-Found it.
-(KNOCKING)

Hey, uh, excuse
me, Mr. Tucker.

-You got a second?
-Oh, hello, Peter. Sure, come on in.

Thanks. Um, hey, listen,
I just found out that you were the guy

who played Michael Myers
in <i>Halloween 4,</i>

and I just want to say, I think that was
the most brilliant performance ever

in the history
of everything,

and I wanted to see
if you would sign my DVD.

Oh, I suppose.

Thanks. Hey, so, what happened?

How come you never
did any more movies?

Well, I tried to make a career
out there in Hollywood,

but I just didn't realize
how tough acting is.

Well, you know what they say--
"Tough actin' Tinactin."

I wish I'd
known that then.

You see, life after <i>Halloween 4</i>
wasn't exactly smooth sailing.

Once I stepped out
from behind that mask,

Hollywood gave me
the cold shoulder.

TOM: <i>The work I did manage to get</i>

<i>was usually just bit parts</i>
<i>that didn't last too long.</i>

<i>Like the role of Denise's</i>
<i>boyfriend on</i> The Cosby Show.

It's nice to meet you, Martin.

Thank you, Mrs. Huxtable.
So, if you guys are a family,

why are none of you
the same shade of black?

<i>I was also coked out</i>
<i>of my skull most of the time.</i>

<i>But whatever the case,</i>
<i>I was done.</i>

I left Hollywood, moved back
to my hometown of Quahog,

and wound up working
here as a news anchor.

Wow. Well, don't you miss it?

Every second of every day,
but I can't touch coke again.

-It would ruin my life.
-No, I mean acting.

Oh. Of course. But it's over for me.
That's all in the past.

Well, if you ask me, you got the
makings of a star.

-And I want to help you get there.
-Well, that's a nice offer,

but I'm not quite sure
how you expect to do that.

Well, you've brought me
so much joy over the years

as that lovable murderer of teenagers,
and I want to return the favor.

I don't even have
an agent anymore.

Well, then how about this?
I'll be your agent.

You?

Yeah, I've seen every episode of
<i>Entourage.</i> All you need is some fake hair

and a bunch of Hobbits
hanging around you.

You're on in five minutes, Mr. Tucker.

You don't belong here.

You're better than this.

You're <i>Halloween 4</i> better.

Look, I appreciate your offer, but
I've got a pretty good thing going here.

In a few minutes, I've got to be on camera
in front of <i>800</i> people.

Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story tonight: The
Rhode Island Historical Society

is heralding the arrival
of a cast-iron, oak-handled

Colonial bedsheet warmer,

now on display
in the Statehouse Rotunda.

TOM: <i>Okay, there it is.</i>

<i>As I understand it, they would</i>
<i>put the coal inside of that,</i>

<i>and then put the object</i>
<i>between the sheets.</i>

<i>It was very cold back then.</i>

<i>And it would warm the sheets.</i>

<i>And I think that's the gist of it.</i>

<i>How much footage</i>
<i>of this do we have?</i>

<i>Oh-oh, this is live.</i>

<i>This... Can-can she hear me?</i>

<i>Okay, you can put it down now.</i>

<i>You... She</i> can't <i>hear me. Okay.</i>

<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>

<i>Is it... is it... Am I having a stroke?</i>

Wait, Peter! Don't go!

So, you changed your mind, huh, buddy?
We going to Hollywood?

You betcha. But I have to say,
I thought you'd drive a fancier car.

What? Why?

Well, aren't you the Peter Griffin
of Peter Griffin Cadillac?

No, that's another guy.

Hi. I'm Peter Griffin,

and at Peter Griffin Cadillac,
we believe in three things:

fair dealing, family,
and friendship.

I've lived in Quahog
my whole life.

I love it here.

And you're gonna love
a Peter Griffin Cadillac.

Scumbag.

All right, Lois,
remember to feed the cat,

and remember to get a cat.

I still don't understand why you got to go
all the way to Hollywood.

Because I know Tom Tucker
could be a great actor,

and I'm gonna help him
make it happen.

You see, everybody
needs just one person

to believe in their dreams
so they can spread their wings and fly.

Dad, can I have money
for dance classes?

Sit down, you dumpy bread loaf.
I'd pay to see you <i>not</i> dance.

-When will you be back?
-I don't know.

But I'll be sure to be back
before Chris's big dance class recital.

I believe in that boy.

I don't want to dance!

You'll dance!

Boy, I don't know, Peter, being back
out here makes me kind of nervous.

Maybe this was all a mistake.

Don't be silly, Tom, you're an actor,
and this is where you belong.

Now, let's take some of
this complimentary luggage and get going.

Well, so, h-how
do we do this?

You do nothing.
You just sit back and let your agent

knock on every door in
Hollywood till he gets you an acting job.

And that starts right now.

Yes? Can't help you?

No, but I can help you.

You need to hire this man.

Oh. Um, okay.

Well, do you have any experience
handling bags?

Aha! I see!

Typical casting-couch stuff.

All right, kid, you want to make it
in showbiz or don't you?

I thought the airport
was Hollywood.

Hey, Mom, I want you to
meet my new girlfriend.

New girlfriend?

Yeah, you remember that girl
Lindsey I told you about?

Well, I asked her out,
and now we are dating.

Lindsey, this is my mom,
my little brother Stewie,

-and my dog Brian.
-Hey.

Oh, my God.

My goodness,
look at you.

Do you even realize
who you look like?

Cameron Diaz, that's who.

You are gorgeous!

Well, she's awful pretty--I
know <i>that,</i> Mom.

Very pretty. Stunning.

Are you kidding me?

Are they not seeing this?

I know, it's kind of creepy.
It's almost like

-he's dating Lois.
-Yeah.

Looks like somebody's
getting a little Oedipus-y.

-Can we say that?
-Just did.

All right, Tom, this is
totally gonna work.

All the biggest Hollywood
players eat here,

and we just got to make them
think we're one of them.

That's why I got these
old Hollywood Jew glasses.

Waiter! Oh, waiter!

Yes sir. Are you gentlemen
ready to order?

Yes, I will have the Big and Fancy,
and my client here

-will have a bottle of your best steak.
-Right away, sir.

Peter, I'm not sure what any of this
has to do with getting me acting jobs.

Tom, who's the agent here?

-You are.
-And who is the actor?

Well, I am.

-Wait, which one am I again?
-The agent.

And who's paying for dinner?
I assumed you were.

Ah, then we best load
our pockets with bread

and get the hell
out of here.

We have to go!

Not expensive enough!

Excuse me, I couldn't help but
notice your glasses,

your poor table manners and
your huge sense of entitlement.

-Are you an agent?
-I am.

You've got ten seconds
to dazzle me. Go.

Well, I'm the casting director for <i>NCIS,</i>

and we need an actor for a
mall role that shoots tomorrow.

This is your man.

That's great! He's got just
the look we're after.

Show up here at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

How about that, huh, Tom?
You're back in the business.

Wow, Peter, I can't believe it!

Hey, don't be
so surprised.

I've been pounding the
pavement for you, buddy.

I even gave out all my business cards.

Call me! Call me! Call me!

Call me! Call me!
Call me! Call me!

Ah, show business.

Oh, hi, you two.

You know, Lindsey, I just
want to say how nice it is

to have such a beautiful young
woman in our home.

Oh, a baby.

I almost had one of you, twice.

(LAUGHS) Who didn't, right?

So, what are you
two up to tonight?

Well, we really
haven't decided yet.

Eh, I'll think of something
while I'm taking

a chick dump in your
parents' bathroom.

And I will hold your purse.

Good for Chris, huh?

He picked a
peach, didn't he?

Lois, don't you think maybe part
of the reason you like Lindsey

could be because she
looks so much like you?

(CHUCKLES) What?
What are you talking about?

Come on, she's clearly
an awful person.

And I think it's possible that your vanity
has made you a little blind to that.

Oh... I see what's going on here,
you're jealous.

Chris has a wonderful young woman
in his life, and you've got nothing.

She's kind of right, Brian. All you've got
is a worn-out rope toy

and that squirrel who comes
by once a day to taunt you.

-(RUSTLING IN BRUSH)
-Hey!

Hey, get out of here!
This is our yard!

You don't belong there!
Don't you touch anything!

I told you all this yesterday!

To your first big TV acting job.

MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to</i> NCIS.

Oh, here it is.
Here comes my part.

Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ed Manzelli.

Good evening. I'm Ed Manzelli.
What can I do for you?

I'm looking for a guy
who used to work here.

Name's Mario.
Got any idea where he could be?

I haven't seen him
in over a month.

That's the end of my line.

Your line, <i>NCIS.</i>

You son of a bitch,
you made me feel again.

Oh, don't you go 'cause I'll go.

You know, Peter, I just want to thank you
for all you've done for me.

You... You are one
hell of an agent.

Well, with you
as a client, it's easy.

WOMAN (OVER INTERCOM): Mr. Griffin?

-Yes, Sandra?
-You have a secretary?

She calls herself
an assistant, but yes.

-What is it, Sandra?
-There's a man here to see you.

He says he wants to talk
to you about being his agent.

Really?! Well, then,
by all means, send him in!

Hey, knucklebutts!

BOTH (GASP): James Woods?!

But I... I don't understand!
I... I thought you were dead!

Well... (CHUCKLES) I'm not.

I don't believe you.

God, is that true?

God?

God, are you there?

(MUSIC PLAYING THROUGH HEADPHONES)

Come on, don't touch yourself.
You're God.

I-I don't get it.
Last time we saw you,

Diane Simmons had just stabbed
you in the back with a knife.

Yeah! How the hell
did you come back to life?!

Well, gentlemen, sometimes being
a big Hollywood star has its advantages.

-Hey, is this guy somebody?
-Yeah, that's James Woods!

We got a celebrity here! I repeat,
this is not a normal dead person!

This is a celebrity!

JAMES: <i>Being a famous movie star</i>
<i>entitled me</i><i>to topnotch medical care</i>

<i>not available</i>
<i>to the rest of society.</i>

<i>My body was immediately taken</i>
<i>to a Hollywood hospital,</i>

<i>where I was hooked up</i>
<i>to a 17-year-old ingenue.</i>

<i>And in accordance</i>
<i>with Hollywood law,</i>

<i>her life force was infused into me,</i>
<i>bringing me back from the dead.</i>

TOM: <i>What happened to the girl?</i>

JAMES: <i>I threw her out a car window</i>
<i>at Nora Ephron.</i>

Stop making
Jack Nicholson a pansy!

You're thinking of Nancy Meyers!

You're the same thing!

Wow. That's amazing.

So, what do you say, Peter?
Will you be my agent?

I don't get it.
Why would a big shot

like you want me for an agent?

Because you're an up-and-comer,
because you're hungry.

I am hungry.

But you put me and my family
through a lot of crap over the years.

Why would I want to help you?

Well, because you're my agent.

Oh, my God, you're right! I am!

Hey, hold on now.
You came out here to be <i>my</i> agent.

Tom, relax,
I can take care of you both.

You'd be surprised
how much I can handle.

Peter, I need you to drop
Stewie off at day care,

and then shred this big
stack of old bank statements.

You got it, Lois.

Is he always
this quiet?

So, Kevin made another attempt
on his life last night.

He drank two bottles
of dish soap.

Well, we have some news, too.

Chris is dating the most wonderful girl.

You know, everyone said, "Don't
smoke during your pregnancy,"

but I think some of it rubbed
off on him 'cause now he's cool.

That's nice.

Well, I should go, Lois.

Yeah, I should probably
get going myself.

Oh, my God!

What? What is it, Lois?

That girl over there--
that... that's Chris's girlfriend!

Hey, you know, she kind of
looks like you, Lois.

Maybe <i>she'll</i> thank me
for buying the coffee.

You think she looks like me, too?

Oh, my God.
I'm starting to think Brian was right.

Maybe I have been blinded
by my own stupid vanity.

That girl is
nothing but trouble.

Are you gonna tell Chris?

I guess I'll have to,

but he doesn't take
bad news very well.

Oh, Chris, honey,
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

but your grandfather died.

(GASPING AND HISSING)

(SCREAMING)

(YELLING)

All right, gentlemen.
So, what do you got for my client?

Well, we're making a
mediocre action film,

and we think James is just the
guy to do a serviceable job

in a supporting role that
Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum,

and Craig T. Nelson
have already passed on.

Well, we'd need to see a script first.

Oh, looks good.
What do you think, James?

-I like it.
-Good.

I say we move on this.
All right, then, let's negotiate.

-We want everything.
-We'll give you nothing.

-We want something.
-Deal.

(PHONE RINGING)

Ugh, not this hillbilly from
Rhode Island again. No thank you. (BEEP)

<i>This is Peter Griffin,</i>
<i>famous agent,</i>

<i>but you can call me PG-13.</i>
<i>Ba-boom!</i>

<i>Leave a message.</i>
(BEEP)

Hi, Peter, it's Tom.
Uh, just trying to reach you again.

And you know, about that meeting
you set up with me and Heath Ledger...

He... He never showed.

Maybe I was at the wrong
Panda Express, but I...

Anyway, uh, call me back.

Hey, listen, thanks for
inviting me to lunch, Peter.

I was starting to get nervous
when you weren't returning my calls.

Tom, I... I didn't know
how to say this to you,

so, here, take this piece of paper.

And you're on in four,
three, two...

"Peter Griffin drops Tom Tucker
as a client."

You're-you're dropping me as a client?

Yeah, just heard it on the news.

How could you do this?!

Look, it's a whole different landscape
out here since Thursday.

Everything's on computers now.

Peter, I left a very good job for this!

You're the only reason
I came back out here!

I wish I could help you, Tom,
but this is coming from upstairs.

The karate studio?

Tom, I have to go now.

But if you're ever Kevin James,
I want you to give me a call.

(PHONE RINGING AND BUZZING)

Mm. Hello?

Peter, it's me, Woodsy!
I need a favor.

What?! It's, like, 2:00 a.m.

Yeah, so listen, I'm
at Chateau Marmont,

I just met this
18-year-old chick,

and I can't decide
whether to take her home

or keep doing blow
with Tom Sizemore

and see if I can do
better later in the night.

Well, okay, um...

Do, uh, do-do you love her?

What?! Look, I'm
texting you her picture.

Just tell me if you
think she's hot enough.

(PHONE CHIRPS)

I... What is this
a picture of?

Is that the bottom
of a white pumpkin?

Is she hot or not?

-I guess.
-Okay, good, great.

So clear out of your apartment;
we're gonna be there in 15.

What?! I'm sleeping.
Why can't you bring her to your place?

I don't know, man.
It's my aunt's daughter. It's weird.

Chris, honey,

there's something
I want to talk to you about.

Why, sure, Mom. Come on in.

-Chris, you know your girlfriend, Lindsey?
-Yeah.

Well, honey,

I saw her making out
with another boy.

Was she kissing with her mouth,
or her pants-mouth?

Because she does both.

Chris, I can't believe
you knew about this! That's terrible!

Why would you even date
a girl like that?

Well, because...
I thought she'd be like you.

Like me?

Well, you got to admit, Mom,
she does look a lot like you.

I mean, I just look at
you and Dad, you know?

He's a complete train wreck,
and you put up with him.

And I'm no prize myself.

So, I guess I figured if I don't
find a girl just like you,

I might never find anyone.

Oh, Chris.
Of course you'll find someone.

And you <i>are</i> a prize.

You're a handsome,
kind-hearted, young man,

and any girl would be lucky
to have you in her life.

You really think so?

Of course I do, sweetheart.

Thanks, Mo

Now I'm gonna take the child
filter off the computer,

and I want you to have a fun night.

Okay, this is it, James.
I got your next project right here.

Peter, you've pitched me
dozens of projects,

and all of them involve me
playing a hayride driver.

I don't know, I just
see you doing that.

You know, this year, it's
vampires, next year, it's hay.

These things go in cycles.

Peter, this is probably
a good time to fire you.

-What?!
-Come on, Peter, who are we kidding?

You're a one-man operation.

You know me.
I need a whole crew.

I need a drugs guy,
a girls guy, a fitness guy,

a guy with a boat who can dump
stuff way-out-there kind of guy.

But... But you're
my only client! Without you, I'm ruined!

Well, that's show business.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to answer this fake phone call.

Hello? Grimace from McDonald's?
Sorry, Peter, I got to take this.

No, I understand.

(KNOCKING)

Hey, Tom.

How you doing?

What do <i>you</i> want?

James Woods fired me.

Listen, I been thinking.

I was a real jerk to you.

I dragged you out here, only to dump you
when you needed me the most.

I guess what I'm saying is,
I'm really sorry about everything.

Sorry doesn't cut it, Peter.

I quit my job, I left everything behind
to come out here.

I know, but I was just trying to help.

I never wanted to let you down.

Well, I suppose your only crime
is that you believed in me.

And then stopped believing
in me rather abruptly.

So what do you say?

You ready to go back
to where we both belong?

Yup. Let's go home.

Sounds good.

Hey, check out this picture
James Woods texted me.

What is that?
A balloon running out of air?

Yeah, see, I was hoping you would know.

(SNAPS FINGERS)
It's his cousin's anus.

Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

And I'm Joyce Kinney.

Tom, I think I speak for all of
us here at Channel Five News

when I say it's good to have you back here
at half your original salary.

Still twice yours, Joyce.

Our top story tonight: Quahog's first
organic supermarket opens this weekend.

So head on down
before the gays turn it

into a cruising ground like
they did the Barnes and Noble

upstairs coffee bar,
which they had to close.

Well, I'm just happy
Tom got his job back.

But I'm sorry I missed meeting
your girlfriend, Chris.

That's okay, Dad.

Yeah, Chris, I
never asked you.

What did Lindsey say when
you broke up with her?

Oh, she didn't seem to mind.

I think she already moved on
to someone else.

-Thanks for buying me these clothes Glenn.
-You're welcome.

And you're dismissed.

Do I still get to keep the 20?

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker
bringing you news

you heard four hours
ago on the Internet.

Our top story:
A mishap in Quahog harbor today.

That's right, Tom.
A ferry carrying a shipment

of brand-new Mercedes Benzes from Germany

crashed and sank just a few miles
off our coast.

Thus far, the cars remain
on the ocean floor

as the Germans refuse
to clean up the disaster.

The German Environmental Minister
called a press conference to issue

the following statement:

I see nothing! I know nothing!

Holy crap! Did you hear that, Lois?

All them fancy cars out there in the ocean
just free for the taking?

I'm gonna get me a Mercedes!

Peter, that may be the
stupidest idea you've ever had.

And you've had some
pretty stupid ones.

Hi there. Peter Griffin.

You know, a lot of us here
at <i>Family Guy</i> are, frankly,

sickened by the sorry state
of education in this country

and how little
you people read anymore.

So, for this next cutaway,
we're gonna make you read it.

That's right, you heard me.

Do a little work once in a while,
instead of having everything spoon-fed.

You want your yuks,
put in a little effort.

All right, go ahead.

Okay, that one might
have been more of a visual,

but you feel that feeling
you got right now?

That's satisfaction.
You just read something.

And no one can take
that away from you.

Proud of you.

Geez, you're a mess.
What is that?

-It was finger-paint day.
-What the hell?

Why didn't they clean
you up before you left?

Brian, there's, like,
37 other kids in there.

One was in a drawer all day.
Wow, seems like Lois would've

checked that stuff out
before sending you.

Yeah, you'd think so, right? I mean,
it's clearly not a place of business.

It's someone's house.

You know, half the time you
can hear someone showering.

I mean, you never see them, but
you can hear the shower going.

-Really? That seems weird.
-Yeah, and is it normal

that Miss Emily tied
us all to the sink

while she went out to
return a birthday present?

No, that's not normal at all.

You know, Stewie, maybe I should
come by tomorrow and check things out.

That teacher sounds really irresponsible.

She is. Adults are stupid.

The world would be so much
better if it were run by babies.

Tonight on NBC... <i>Shapes!</i>

And then... <i>Colors!</i>

Followed by
an all-new... <i>Dad's Keys!</i>

-Man, I can't wait to get a Mercedes.
-Me, either.

Yeah, it's gonna be sweet.

-Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell is that?
-A sun hat.

-No, no, no, no, no.
-What do you mean, no?

I'm protecting my face
and neck from the sun.

Use sunscreen! You don't need
to put a circus on your head.

This is a ploy for attention.

Sunscreens are bad for you.
The chemicals get in your skin.

Boy, you really want
to wear that hat.

-That hat's coming off!
-No!

(ALL CRINGING)

You guys are jerks!

I can have my own identity
besides you two.

Not this way.
Not the hat way.

(ROPE SQUEAKS)

Holy crap!
I think we got one!

Aw, damn it!
It's just a dolphin.

Sorry, did I get in the way of something?

No, it's all right. We were just trying
to get some of them sunken Mercedes.

Oh, yeah, there's a great big
pile of them down there.

Me and my mates, right,
we was having a laugh

sitting in of one of them,
pretending to be people.

You know, like, driving around getting
into incidents with other motorists.

Honk, honk. "Stay out
the way, you old bat!"

-Asian.
-Not all Asians are bad drivers.

No, no, not
all terrorists are Arab.

But, you know, they <i>are,</i> so...

Uh, well, I'm Peter,
and that's, uh, Joe, and that's Quagmire.

Name's Billy, Billy Finn.

It's got "fin" in it.

I didn't pick it.
Luck of the draw.

Say, you want me to try
and get you one of those cars

-from down there, yeah?
-(GASPS)

-You would do that?!
-Well, I could try.

Here, let me
give it a go.

He seems nice.

-He does.
-Yeah.

So, uh, what do you have
planned for the summer?

I'm sure he'll be right back.

Sorry, mate, all I could get
was this hood ornament.

(GASPS) This is just as good!

Thank you so much!
Hey, you know,

if there's ever anything
I could do for you...

Actually, you could
do something.

You could eat only
dolphin-safe tuna.

Wait, is that the brand
that costs five cents more?

No, I can't do that.

Things ain't so good in America right now,
which is why we're all so fat.

What did I tell you, Brian?

It's a nightmare in here.

Oh, my God!

-Oh, what happened to that kid?
-He fell off a stool

trying to turn off Maury Povich.

This is awful! Where's your teacher?

Probably out back.

Excuse me, are you Miss Emily?

Yeah. Hi. Who are you?

Uh, Brian.

Brian Steel.
I was just dropping Stewie off.

Oh, yeah! I should
probably go back in there,

see how everyone's doing, I guess.

Ah, they're fine.

In fact, I see Stewie
reading a book.

Scratch-and-sniff
<i>Lindsay Lohan Goes Jogging.</i>

Oh, God! That's terrible!

Oh, here's a pop-up book.

<i>Tommy Lee Goes Boating.</i>

Move, Lois! You're on
the hood ornament's pillow.

Peter, put that away.
It's time for bed.

Wait, hang on, Lois, before I go to bed,
I just got to do one thing.

(DIALING)

<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt, it's me, Peter.

You remember how you said
I'd never amount to nothing?

<i>-Is that a Mercedes?</i>
-Peter, hang up the phone.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

My God, who could be at the door
at this hour?

I don't know, but this late,
it's got to be bad news.

Everyone knows you always get bad news
in the middle of the night.

-Wake up, wake up, wake up!
-Huh? What?

-You have cancer!
-What?

Yeah. I thought you should know.
Okay, go back to sleep.

Wait, I have questions.

It's <i>very</i> late.

Oh, hello. This <i>is</i> the right house.

-That's good, then.
-What the hell?

It's me, Billy. Billy Finn.

Just wanted to take you up
on your nice offer from earlier.

What... I-I don't... What offer?

You know, the bit about
"If there's ever anything I can do,"

-so, yeah...
-Oh.

Yeah, thought I might
make a go of it on land.

So, "anything you can ever do."
Here I am. Thank you.

Squid pro quo.

Thank you for not being "shellfish."
(CHUCKLES)

I just said that for the "halibut."

(LAUGHS) Fish puns.

Ah. Oh, cod.

Oh, God, come on.

-Let me in.
-Peter, who is it? Is Meg dead?

It's that dolphin--
I think he wants to crash here.

And I have no info on Meg.

He wants to what?

-I'm not sure that...
-I brought a gift.

Put it to your ear.
You can hear the ocean.

<i>Caribbean Queen</i>
<i>Now we're sharing...</i>

It's broken or something.

-All I hear is...
-It's <i>Billy Ocean!</i>

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, God! I got loads more.

I think you and I
are gonna have a lot of fun together.

So, Billy, I, uh, I hope
the couch was all right?

Yeah, a lot better
than the floor.

And I should know, 'cause
I went down on the floor,

thinking it had to be a
lot better than the couch.

Okay, well,
breakfast is ready.

Oh. Uh...

Is everything all right?

Yeah. Well, it's just...

would you mind tossing
it up in the air for me?

-Well, I don't know...
-Lois, he is our guest.

Toss it in the air.

Uh, I'm used to a
little applause, so...

All right, all right.
Not bad. Afternoon crowd.

Lightly attended.

So, Billy, how long will
you be staying with us?

Are you kidding?
As long as he wants!

Yay! We live with a dolphin!

Correct, fatso.

Anyway, I'm off to read Meg's diary.

Only been here one night,
but I get the sense we all dislike Meg.

Um, I'm a dolphin-- smart, intuitive.

Also, Peter told me
in the hall. Ha.

Peter, I'm not so sure about
Billy staying here with us.

-What you talking about? He's hilarious.
-I don't know.

Listen, just leave it to me.
I'm great with animals.

Remember when I lived
with those ants?

We're working on something.

Yes? May I help you?

Hey, put him down!

Who are you? I can't stop him!
Can anyone stop him?

No? Well, he's gone.

Hey, Stewie.
How's it going?

-Brian, what are you doing here?
-Came by to check on my pal.

Where's, uh, Miss Emily?
I haven't seen her yet today.

She gave me the keys to open
up when she left yesterday.

I thought you said you
were gonna talk to her.

I did, a-and she's doing
her best, you know?

She's got a lot on her plate.
She's got school. She's got work.

-This is her work!
-Oh, hi, Brian.

I thought you had a busy day
at your legal practice.

Oh...

Hey, Emily! Yeah, I had
some time between cases.

I thought I'd see how you were doing.

That's so nice of you!
Let me just put these bags away

and throw some saltines
in the yard for the kids.

You're disgusting.

Hey, I'm sorry, but Miss Emily and I have
a connection, which is totally unexpected.

And by the way, I actually think
she's doing a pretty good job.

-She's teaching you guys independence.
-We're one!

Independence means we die!

Do you like this?
I just got it.

Say you like it, or
she's gonna spend

the rest of the afternoon
out returning that stuff.

Looks great!

Wow, you really
fill these things up.

Hey, do you think maybe you'd
want to hang out sometime?

What, you mean like
a movie or something?

Yeah, or maybe lunch?

I had a bad experience last
time I went to the movies.

We're good friends,
aren't we, Milo?

We're best friends, Otis.

No! No!
I reject the premise of this!

Okay, who's ready for
Family Movie Night?

All right, tonight's selection:

Tim Burton's
<i>Alice in Wonderland</i> in 3D.

Now let's all sit down
and take our headache.

Or... or-or...

we could watch... <i>The Cove,</i>

<i>The Cove?</i>

Isn't that that horrible documentary
where they kill all the fish?

Dolphins, actually.

Well, yeah, but this one was in
the video store under "Ethan's Picks."

Come on, Peter. Billy's our guest.

All right, we'll watch <i>The Cove.</i>

(FISH LINE REELS, DOLPHINS SQUEAL)

-Oh, my God!
-I don't want to see this!

I know you can't tell this, but the one
who's about to get her throat cut,

she's sorta hot.

Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

-What do you think I'm doing?
-You're stoolin'?

What, you gotta
do that in here?

Well, where else am I
supposed to do it?

I can't just do it
on the floor, can I?

You'd be all, like, "Ooh, who left this
coil of rope on the floor?"

It's very... comes out
very ropey is my point.

-But I gotta take a bath.
-Go on, then.

We're both men.

Well... all right, I guess.

There you go! (LAUGHING)
Look at that!

What is... Whoa! Solar eclipse.

Blocking the sun.

Do not look directly at it.

Wh-Wha-What the hell?
What're you doin'?

I'm just making a comment.
Um, need to know somethin'.

Do you hear the word
"morbidly" a lot?

-This is not fair.
-O-O-Okay.

And, again, I'm gonna ask 1 more question,
and don't take this the wrong way,

-but have you actually got a penis?
-Yes.

Where-where is it?
Where is it?

-It's in there.
-Are you sure?

-So it's like Mr. Snuffleupagus, is it?
-Aw, the hell with this.

Lois, get the ruler,
we're measuring again.

And this time, <i>I</i> decide
where the base is.

So then I'm reading the funnies,

and right before I get to the last panel,
Billy blurts out, he goes, he goes,

"You know, those firemen showed
up to get a cat out of the tree,

but it turns out it's really
Marmaduke up there."

It ruined the whole damn thing!

Peter, in Billy's defense,
the strip is called <i>Marmaduke,</i>

and Marmaduke had not yet
made an appearance.

You probably should've
seen that coming.

I tell ya, he was fun at first,

but now I'm not sure I can take
much more of him living here.

Well, Peter, you've more than
paid back your debt to him.

I mean, what did he do?
He got you a hood ornament.

If you ask me,
it's time for him to go.

Yeah, you're right.

Plus, the sooner
we get him out of here,

the sooner I can get back
to my cocaine and dollhouses.

(SNORTING)

-(BELL RINGING)
-Dinner is served.

Get out!

-(PANTING)
-Stewie, what's going on?

Aren't you supposed to be at day care?

-(BREATHLESS) I escaped.
-What happened to your arm?

I finally stood up for all of us

and told Miss Emily we should
be given a proper lunch

and not just what's left over
from her Baja Fresh.

And she said I shouldn't raise my voice

and pulled me really hard
into the other room,

and my arm came
out of its socket.

Are you sure?

Are you sure you didn't
just sleep on it funny?

Does this look like I slept on it funny?
I'm gonna tell Mom!

-Mom!
-You are not going anywhere.

I finally have a date
with Miss Emily tomorrow,

and I'm not gonna let you
or anybody else get in my way

until I have seen
every inch of her naked.

Do you even hear yourself?!

And what am I supposed
to do about my arm?!

I'll just pop it back in.

You most certainly will not!
I need to go to a hospital.

LOIS: Brian, is Stewie in there with you?

-Mom!
-(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

We're in here, Lois. He's napping.

Relax. I'm gonna pop it back in.

-(BONES CRACKLING)
-(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

Get in there! C-Come on!
Hold still, Stewie!

-(THUD)
-(COUGHING)

I'm not saying
I like pain.

But I'm not saying
I don't like it either.

Hey, uh, listen, Billy, it's
been fun having you stay here,

but we really need to talk about
making some new arrangements.

Oh, do we?

Is this because there's one kind
of problem with the hood ornament?

No, that's... it's...
that's... it's-it's fine.

Oh, good, good.
That's good to hear,

'cause it dawned on me
that the only thing better than

you having one of them would
be you having two of them.

Don't you say those things.

Don't you say those things
unless they're true.

Yeah, be quite a thing
for you to have two of them, wouldn't it?

Would it ever!

(APPLAUSE)

-Wonderful!
-The best!

Very fancy!

Now, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

-Nothing, nothing.
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Tricia Takanawa?
What are you doing here?

Peter, I'm standing here
on your front porch,

hoping to kill that dolphin
with this harpoon.

So the thing about dolphin
lullabies is that they're all

in the key of
"eee-eee"!

(LAUGHTER)

"Eee"!

-That's loud.
-I get why that's factual.

I don't see why it's funny.

-Eh-eh! What the hell, man?!
-(LAUGHING)

Drink beer much?

I just learned that
"much" thing from the telly.

Hey, here's a question:
When are you going back to the ocean?

Yeah, I mean, don't you have
family back there?

I used to, but not anymore.

Um, the wife won't have me back.
Threw me out, actually.

Well, maybe you
should talk to her.

Peter, believe me, if she'd take
me back, I'd go in a second.

But she won't, so as much
as I love her, moot point.

Moving on. Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

Well, gotta go
and drain the eel.

It's electric. (LAUGHS)

My penis.

Hey, throw darts much?

Boy, I see what you're saying, Peter.
Billy's annoying.

Yeah, and P.S., that guy
doesn't throw darts much. He's new.

Peter, I thought you said you
were gonna ask Billy to leave.

He's still sleeping
on the couch out there.

I know, Lois, but I found out he's only
here 'cause his wife kicked him out.

So I figured out a way to kill
two birds with one stone.

Like this.

The key to that, Lois,
is big rock, small birds.

Oh, and I also figured out
how to achieve two goals with one action.

See, I'm gonna help Billy
get back together with his wife,

and then he'll move out
and stop annoying us.

How do you plan to do that?

Are you kidding?
I'm great at getting people back together.

I even recorded a song about it.

("REUNITED" INTRO PLAYING)

<i>Reunited</i>

Hey, guys.
Everybody having fun playing with...

What is that?

A piece of wood with a,
with a nail in it. Neat.

He can't hear you.

There was a kitchen explosion today,
and half the kids are deaf.

-Oh, hi, Brian.
-Hey, Emily.

Wow, you look great. You're ready to go?

Yeah, one sec.
I'm leaving, honey.

Okay, babe, have fun.

I'm probably just gonna take
a couple more showers.

-Who-who was that?
-That's my boyfriend, Devin.

Are you ready for lunch?

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

What you did to these kids...

There is a special place
in hell for people like you.

Come on, let's go home.

Man, when she gets to jail,
she's gonna be major lez-chow.

She sure is, Stewie.
She sure is.

I'm telling you, Peter,
you're wasting your time.

She's never taking me back.

Well, you'll never
know until you try.

Hey, I brought this sack
of garbage from my home.

Where do I put this?
Just anywhere?

Yeah. Anywhere.

Yay, people!

All right, here she comes.

Oh, hello, Joanne.

Billy?! What are
you doing here?

He's here because he loves you,
and he wants to patch things up.

Hey, how come you ain't got boobs?

You like a runner or something?

Who's this, then?

He's just a friend, trying to help.

Look, Billy, I don't care

what you or your fat friend
here has to say, it's over.

(SIGHS) Well, thanks for trying.

I knew she wouldn't listen to you, though.

Well, maybe so.

But I know someone
she'll <i>have</i> to listen to.

Hey, gang,
I'm Aquaman.

Get back together.

Boop-boop-boop-boop-
boop-boop-boop.

That's not Aquaman!

-Billy, what is going on?
-Let me answer that.

Look, Joanne,
Billy had nothing to do with this.

It was just a dumb plan my
buddies and I put together

because we know how
much Billy loves you.

And he misses you very much.

Look, just give him
another chance.

And if you won't do it
for me, do it for Fish Jesus.

-Do you have Fish Jesus?
-Of course.

He was nailed to a board
and hung in a man's study

as a novelty to
sing funny songs.

Your god is a gag gift,
did you know that?

Would you excuse us?

Is it true, Billy?
Do you really miss me?

Joanne, I am so sorry.
I promise I'll do better.

You know what?
I had to live on the land

to learn there might
be a million fish in the sea,

but there's only one you.

Oh, Billy...

Aw, look at that.
That's nice.

Oh, cool,
they're already using my garbage!

Hey, Brian, thanks for helping
get rid of Miss Emily.

Although I've got to say,
my new preschool teacher is even hotter.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Let me know if you want his number.

Oh, you!

Okay, now just stay like this
and let Peter and Lois finish their thing.

Wow, Peter, you did
a really nice thing

helping Billy get back
together with his wife.

Yeah, and the best part is, he's out of
the house and back in the ocean.

I guess everything
worked out for everybody.

Arr! 'Tis a mighty haul!

Hey. Oh.

Yeah, it's me as Neptune.

before we get your prescription,

let's grab some bandages.

God, this is such
an East Coast pharmacy.

How are we gonna find gauze and
bandages in the middle of all this crap?

Uh, I think he keeps them next to
the 1,000-piece puzzle of a lobster trap.

I don't see it. You mean,
next to the Kadima paddles,

or next to the basic black
sweatshirt with no writing on it?

No, I think they're over there between
the rain ponchos and the cap guns

and just below the balsa wood gliders

and the net-bag of flip-flops
and a beach pail.

Above the set of jacks?

Yes, above the jacks
and the bicentennial playing cards

and across from the giant cage
with the beach balls,

next to the Wiffle ball bats
and the spark-spitting cars.

I don't... Oh, next
to the wax bottles of weird juice.

Yes, behind the plastic bag

Hey, Mort. How's it going?

Oh, it's awful, Peter!

-Yeah, I get that.

-Is that, like, a Spanish word?

QUAGMIRE: (CHUCKLES) All right!

(GASPS) Quagmire, look out!

Oh, no!

Geez, that was a close one!

Yeah, but at least nobody got hurt.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(BURBLING)

Goldman's Pharmacy!

Now, that could be a good place
to get new shoes for my dog.

<i>Good evening, Quahog.</i>

<i>Grim details continue to roll in</i>
<i>at this hour</i>

<i>in the story of the detached</i>
<i>airplane advertising banner</i>

<i>which caused a school bus</i>
<i>to plummet into the Pawtuxet River.</i>

<i>That's right, Joyce.</i>

<i>Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy</i>
<i>made headlines across the country</i>

<i>after a banner of theirs caused</i>
<i>the bus to drive off a bridge,</i>

<i>tragically killing</i>
<i>all the teenagers on board.</i>

<i>Many of the students</i>
<i>tweeted about the accident</i>

<i>as it was happening.</i>
<i>We have a few here.</i>

<i>From @Jenny94:</i>

<i>"Water seriously cold, yo."</i>

<i>Here's @TheTed69:</i>

<i>"I'm gonna survive this.</i>
<i>LOL jk."</i>

"Jk," indeed.

Oh, God, I'm ruined!

Nobody's ever gonna shop
in my pharmacy again!

I'm gonna lose everything!

Aw, gosh, Mort,
I feel terrible about this.

I wish there was some way
we could fix it.

You know, my cousin
had the same problem,

but he lucked out, 'cause his business
burned to the ground.

The insurance made him a very rich man.

(CHUCKLES) Too bad
we can't just torch the pharmacy.

Aw, come on, no,
we can't do that.

That'd be like stealing
from the insurance companies.

It wouldn't be right.

Aw, they're bastards.

Last year,
after I lost my beloved Muriel,

our life insurance company
refused to pay on her policy.

They took what should have been
a pleasant experience

and made it into an ordeal!

Well, that doesn't totally surprise me.

A friend of mine staying in my house
got, um, injured,

and my homeowner's insurance
wouldn't pay her doctor bills.

Said the policy didn't cover
an "act of rod."

Yeah, come to think of it,
they wouldn't even pay

for the fetus Lois lost
when we went to visit

the Museum of Staircases
and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.

Yeah, you know, they don't seem
to pay out on anything.

-No, not at all, right?
-Yeah, that's true, they don't pay.

Well, then I say, screw the bastards!

Let's burn the place down!

What? Peter, we're talking
about a major crime here.

This is not smuggling Oriental women
into the country in steel cans.

This is a serious felony.

Quagmire, this whole mess was our fault.
We got to make it right.

And, look, as long as nobody sees us,

and we don't tell anybody,
then we're in the clear.

Well, I guess I did kind of
destroy your business, Mort.

All right, then let's do it...
tomorrow night!

Good. I'm just gonna have to reschedule
my weekly re-circumcision.

So, what are we doing today,
a little off the top?

Yeah, but leave a little up front

-so I have something to play with.
-Sounds good.

(UNZIPS ZIPPER)
And take a look at the back.

-You see that there?
-Yeah.

Yeah, let's trim that.
I don't know when that started,

but let's get rid of that.

Okay, guys, listen up.

This is a very flammable mixture
that's also undetectable.

If we put it on the electric box
and two of the outlets,

then light them all at once,
it'll look like a short circuit.

Geez, Mort, how the hell
do you know how to do all this?

Oh, it's all covered in the Torah.

Right after the chapter
on writing complaint letters

that will result in
compensatory merchandise.

Dear stuffed shirts at Ritz Crackers.

A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

Just as a box of crackers
is only as appealing

as its least intact sleeve.

I am paying for fully formed crackers,

not butter crumbles.

I don't buy your product
with broken quarters.

Don't stick me
with broken pieces of cracker,

you miserable dicks!

Regards, Mort Goldman again.

All right, let's get to work.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

(EXPLOSION)

Oh, my God, we did it!

Hey, Peter,
what are you gonna tell Lois

when she asks where you were tonight?

Don't worry, I got it all covered.

(HARSH BRAYING)

(SCREECHING BRAY)

Ha-ha! This is awesome!

And Peter has no idea!

Well, Mr. Goldman,
we've ruled out foul play.

It looks like it was just
a case of faulty wiring.

Well, you're still gonna
have to buy something.

This is rubble, not a library.

Okay, well...
I'm sorry for your loss,

but the good news is your insurance

will be covering all of your damages.

You hear what he said, fellas?
Looks like we pulled it off.

Yeah, for now.

I still got a bad feeling.

He's gonna find something,
I just know it.

Will you relax?
We got an ironclad alibi.

We were all seeing The Beatles
live at The Ed Sullivan Show.

-(SONG ENDS)
-(AUDIENCE SCREAMING)

(SCREAMS)

PETER: Sorry. I rode a bike here.

All right, guys, all we got
to do now is keep a low profile

and not mention a word
of this to anybody.

Not even the police.

That's right, not a word to anyone.

Nobody. Lips are sealed.

(SQUEALS) I want to tell somebody.

-Peter!
-You shut your mouth!

Hey, Mort, I, uh, was really sorry

to hear about the pharmacy.

Oh, thank you, Joe.

I was very, very sorry, too.

Yeah, Joe. The insurance guy
said it was an accident.

Yeah, he seemed pretty smart.

His shirt was tucked in,
so I bet he went to Harvard.

Well, you're my friend, Mort.

I want you to know
that I'm going to personally

go over all the evidence.

I'd hate to think there's someone in town
who's out to get you.

Hey, Joe, they said it was an accident.

-Roll away.
-No, I'm just saying,

as your friend,
I wouldn't feel right

unless I left no stone unturned.

Geez, Joe, let it go.

Yeah, Joe, even Robocop
took a day off once in a while.

(PHONE RINGING)

Nope.

(TURNS RINGER OFF)

I don't like Joe sticking
his nose into this.

Maybe this was all a big mistake.

You're damn right it was.

Why did I ever agree to do this?

This isn't who I am.

I looked in the mirror
this morning, and it was like

I was looking at a man
I'd never seen before.

Hi.

Scott Bakula.

Just take it easy, Quagmire.

There's nothing to worry about.

-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-JOE: Hey, it's Joe, open up.

(ALL GASP)

Uh, hey, Joe.
What's going on?

Oh, hey, I forgot, I brought you guys

souvenirs from my trip to Vegas.

They're T-shirts that say
"I lost my shirt in Lost Wages."

(LAUGHING)

I think maybe you should keep them.

All right,
I'll see you guys later.

I got to go see the forensics team
about the pharmacy.

Don't you worry, Mort.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

I don't like this, you guys. This is bad.

Joe's gonna find out, I just know it.

Geez, Quagmire, you need to relax.

And I know how to help.

Calgon, take him away.

(HARP ARPEGGIO)

QUAGMIRE: This is worse, Peter!

Relax, this is supposed
to be your time.

This is the right way
to deal with your problems.

All right, guys,
if Joe really is nosing around,

I think I know how to get him
off the case once and for all.

(DIALING)

JOE: <i>Hello?</i>

Officer Swanson,
this is the chief of police.

I'm afraid you're fired.

<i>I see. Well, that's too bad.</i>
<i>I was looking forward</i>

<i>to giving you</i>
<i>your birthday present next week.</i>

Oh.

Apparently, there was a mistake.
Forget I called.

Guys, I got to become
chief of police by next week.

Chief, this just came in for you
from Officer Swanson.

A Starbucks gift card?

This has been
an unproductive use of my time.

Okay, I got it.

Joe can't investigate
if he's distracted, right?

Well, what's more distracting
than texts about dinner plans?

Hmm. These burn ignition
patterns aren't consistent

with an electrical fire.

(CELL PHONE CHIRPS)

"Would... love to."

(CELL PHONE CHIRPS)

"Probably...
about 7:00... or 7:30."

-(CELL PHONE CHIRPS)
-(JOE SIGHS)

"Any... of...

"those places would be... fine."

-(PHONE CHIRPS)
-God! No way!

"I don't know.

"Probably just a collared shirt

"and jeans.

"Have you never been
to... a restaurant before?"

Oh, he's getting annoyed.
Look at that.

He sure is. Okay, now
tell him you want a vegan place.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Oh, my God,
he's so pissed, he's calling.

-Well, answer it.
-No, no, no.

I'm gonna send it to voicemail,
then call him back,

but pocket-dial him
while I walk a few blocks.

JOE: (ON PHONE) <i>Peter?</i>

<i>Peter? Hello?</i>

<i>I'm getting very little work done!</i>

You guys,
I just can't take this anymore.

I've been giving it a lot of thought,

and I think we all just need to confess.

What? Now just hold on, Quagmire.

If you start yapping to the cops,

we're gonna rot in prison
for the next 30 years.

JOE: Evening, gentlemen.

-(ALL GASP)
-Joe!

Glad I found you here.
I had a question for you guys.

Did any of you happen
to be at Mort's pharmacy

on the night of the fire?

-No.
-None of us were.

I'm triplets.
Could have been one of my triplets.

I see. Well, then it's kind of peculiar
that I would find this.

A pocket-dial voicemail from Peter
on the night of the fire.

PETER: <i>Oh, my God, look at that fire</i>
<i>we started, Quagmire and Mort.</i>

<i>You know who I don't miss is Joe.</i>

That's a piece of evidence
that hurts all of us.

You three are under arrest
for burning down Goldman's Pharmacy.

Well, the pocket-dial giveth,
and the pocket-dial taketh away.

You'll never take me alive!

Aren't you gonna run?

I would, but I don't want
my gym teacher to laugh at me.

He's been following me around
since junior high.

Watch this.
Watch this Jewish kid run.

First, I have to read you
the Miranda rights

for Jewish people.

You have the right to remain
silent, even though you won't.

You have the right to infer
an insult where none was intended.

What's that supposed to mean?

You have the right to a lawyer,
who you are probably related to.

This interview is over.

What were you doing
the night of March 8th?

(BLEEP) your mother.

Come on, man, that's not cool.

Oh, yeah?
Maybe this is cool enough for you.

(FARTING)

(BLOWS)

It's gonna take a lot more
than a fart in my face to make me...

Whoa! Whoa.

Yeah, and there's more
where that came from.

(STRAINING)

(SIGHS) No, there isn't.

Where were you the night of the fire?

-I was at the movies.
-What did you see?

<i>-No Strings Attached.</i>
-How was it?

-Sucked.
-Okay, that checks out.

Boy, that Ashton Kutcher sure was a cad
in that movie, wasn't he?

Yeah, totally.

Wrong! He had a heart of gold.
You're going down.

-Your husband's in here, ma'am.
-Lois!

Peter, what's going on?

Is it true? Did you really
burn down Mort's pharmacy?

Hi, Lois. Hi.

Look, Lois,
we were just trying to help Mort.

Peter, how could you do this?
You have a family.

Did you ever stop to think about us

before you did something that
could send you away to prison?

(SIGHS) For once, could you visit me
in jail and not criticize me?

Wait a minute.

This isn't Carvel, you lying bitch.

All right, that's enough.
Visiting time is over.

You know you guys
are gonna do time for this.

Come on, Joe. You're really
gonna put us away?

You think I want to do this?

You know how hard it's gonna be
for me to make new friends?

Hey, do you think Chris
is old enough to be my friend?

Old enough? Yes.

But I wouldn't bark down that alley.
You frighten him.

He thinks you're a Transformer
that broke halfway through.

I get that a lot. I understand.

Look, Mort was in trouble.

We-we were just trying to help him out.

Well, insurance fraud is not
the way to help somebody out.

Listen, Joe, insurance agencies
are all scumbags.

They deserve to get hurt.

You don't decide that.
What you did is against the law.

It's easy for you, Joe.

You don't know what it's like

to be screwed over
by an insurance company.

Oh, I don't, do I?

Well, let me tell you a little story.

<i>It was hours after my accident.</i>

<i>I was barely conscious</i>
<i>on the operating table,</i>

<i>but I'll never forget the phone</i>
<i>call that changed my life.</i>

Hello, I'm calling on behalf of
your policyholder, Joe Swanson.

He's badly injured his spine.

Well, there's a new procedure that,
if administered immediately,

should restore his ability to walk.

$200,000.

We also have a wheelchair.

$60.

Okay.

They're going with "B."

Those sons of bitches
made it about money.

Yeah, Joe.
So, what do you say?

They didn't care about you.
Why should you care about them?

The thing is,
you guys committed a crime,

and I've still got the evidence
to prove it.

Too bad I lost it.

FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Message deleted.</i>

Was that... was that supposed
to mean something?

Yeah, I'm letting you guys go.

Oh. Oh, well, that's great.

Yeah, I didn't get that, either.

Yeah, why didn't you just say that?

I'm starting to regret
erasing that message.

Too late, butt-face.
Have a great summer, Joe.

Peter, I don't understand
how they just let you out of jail.

Yeah, Joe had all kinds
of evidence against you guys.

Seems like a huge
miscarriage of justice.

I thought if you do something wrong,
you're supposed to get punished.

(LAUGHING) Oh, Chris,
not if you're white.

Well, now that I've wrapped
things up with you guys,

I better wrap things up
with my basement family.

Well, did you guys learn your lesson
about eating uncooked antelope?

Our top story tonight:
In a shocking turn of events,

the city of Detroit
has officially given up.

The now former mayor
has given the key to the city

back to the Huron Indian tribe.

So, farewell, Detroit.

From Bob Seger to Axel Foley,
we never really cared. Joyce?

Thanks, Tom. In local news,

Quahog is expecting
a special guest this weekend,

famed Asian competitive eating champion
Charles Yamamoto.

Yamamoto has not yet lost
a hot dog eating competition

on his world tour.

But if you think
you have what it takes

to beat the best eater in the world,

come down to the James Woods High
parking lot this Saturday

with $50 and a large appetite.

Wow, maybe you should
enter the contest, Dad.

I'll bet you could win.

Well, I would, Chris,
if I wasn't so obsessed with my figure.

Wait a minute. Chris,
have you ever eaten anything?

Only, like, all the time!

Perfect! Now we just need the 50 bucks.

Damn it, I knew I shouldn't
have named that star for Mort.

Ugh! Just give me the money.

Peter, we're not spending $50
so Chris can stuff his face with hot dogs.

All right, fine. I'll figure out a way
to get the cash myself.

-I'm a smart guy.
-Peter, no, you're not.

Don't you feel ridiculous now?

All right, Chris,
if we're gonna pay the entry fee

for that eating contest,

we got to sell some of my old stuff.

-What are these, Dad?
-Oh, wow.

I haven't seen those in a while.

Those are my old <i>Playboys </i>from the '70s.

Oh, my God, this one's so hot.

You can almost see
a little bit of woman.

Wow, Peter, you've got some
pretty cool albums here.

Yeah, well, I was one
cool potato back in the day.

You know, some of these might
actually be worth something.

Look at this...
Beatles, Rolling Stones.

Oh, my God, I haven't seen
this one in forever.

Look at this.
Queen, <i>News of the World.</i>

Check it out.

-Aah!
-Oh, what's the matter?

What the hell is that?
A killer robot monster?

No, it's <i>News of the World.</i>

It's an album by the band Queen. See?

-Aah!
-Stewie, relax.

No, Brian! You keep
that thing away from me!

Is it... Is it looking at me?

Can it see me?

(CHUCKLES) Man,
you're really scared of this thing, huh?

Does it eat little boys?

I don't know.
Maybe, if it's hungry.

(YELLING)

Here's 50 bucks.
I'm taking this album.

Oh, wow, check it out, Chris!

We got our entry fee
for the eating contest!

Now for the next five days,

we're gonna focus
on nothing but training.

We'll even get up
at the crack of dawn.

(SNORING)

(WHISPERING) Dad?

Dad, it's time to get up.

Oh, jeez, Chris,

Yeah... Yeah, but, uh...

(MUMBLING)

Just... get... get... get in...

It's gonna be a close one!

Chris, you're four hot dogs behind!
Come on! Hurry!

Oh! I can't eat anymore.

Remember what I told you.

I get these weird cyst things
right on the fringe of my sac.

I want to get 'em checked,

but I'm afraid
of what they're gonna tell me.

He's right. I can do it!

Yeah, it's a pretty warm day.

Oh!

Hey, hey, hey, there, champ!

Aw, look at him, Lois.

Relaxing after his big victory.

Peter, he's not relaxing.
He's in a great deal of pain.

Damn it, don't you see
what you did to him?

I told you not to take him
to that eating competition,

and you deliberately defied me!

All right, what's this really about?

Peter, Chris is already overweight.

We need to start taking
responsibility for his health.

So I decided to sign him up
for fat camp.

What? Mom, I don't want
to go to fat camp!

I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's for your own good.

And trust me, you'll feel
much better about yourself.

Everyone's gonna make fun of me!

Oh, come on,
who's gonna make fun of you?

Hey, fatty, I hear
you're going to fat camp.

-That's where you belong!
-Peter, stop it!

And I'd better not see you
at the big dance!

Come on, you.

Sorry, Chris.
I-I'm gonna go with him.

Hi. Welcome to Camp Fresh Start.

Yeah, our son's gross,
so here we are.

-The name's Griffin.
-Ah, yes, Chris Griffin.

We have you staying
in the Broccoli Cabin.

So you guys are just
gonna leave me here?

Yeah, honey.
That's what camp is.

I don't want to stay!
Please take me home!

I don't want to go to fat camp! (SOBBING)

Aw, come on, Chris. Your mother's right.
This'll be good for you.

Well, how come you don't have to go?
You're fatter than I am!

Huh. Good question, Peter.
How come you don't have to go?

What are you talking about?

Well, you're the one who entered him
in that hot dog eating contest.

Besides, he's right.

You could stand
to lose a few pounds yourself.

Unless you don't think
you could handle it.

Oh, yeah?

-Well, I think I can.
-What was that?

Never you mind what that was.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(TRASH CAN LID CLANGING)

Rise and shine, everyone!

What do you got there?
A candy bar, huh?

Got any other contraband?

-No.
-Don't lie to me.

My father was a lawyer.

Oh, so your dad gets guys off.

(LAUGHING) Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

Where's your bag, fatty?

You're welcome to search my "beef case."

But there's "mutton" in there.

(LAUGHING) Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

You're in big trouble, mister.

Oh, there's no pulling the wool
over this guy's eyes.

Looks like I'd better go on the "lamb."

Peter Griffin. Cabin clown.

I think I'm gonna do okay here
at fat camp.

You sure you got the "chops" for it?

Knock it off.
I'm the cabin clown.

(OWL HOOTING)

And then he went into the kitchen,

slowly opened the refrigerator,
and it was empty!

-(ALL GASP)
-So then, the man,

weak with hunger,
raced from the refrigerator

to the counter
to look for a delivery menu,

but all he could find
was one for a vegan place!

(ALL SCREAMING)

Vegan places aren't real, right?

No, they're not real. Or are they?

Aah! Salad!

(ALL SCREAMING)

Thank you for sharing, Leonard.

And I think getting a new couch
was the way to go.

Is there someone else who has a story
they'd like to share? Peter?

Uh, yeah, sure.

This one time,
I was on a city bus,

and the guy next to me
was eating a bucket of fried chicken.

-Mmm!
-Yum!

And the smell was
getting to me, you know.

And even though
I didn't know the guy,

I just dug in and started stuffing
that chicken into my mouth.

-Oh!
-Embarrassing.

-I've done that.
-It was so delicious.

But... it wasn't fried chicken.

It was a baby!

(CRYING) It was a baby.

(SOBBING)

Stewie?

Rupert, we won't give that evil robot

the satisfaction of killing us.

We'll go together on our own terms.

-See you on the other side.
-(GUNSHOT)

Oh, my God! Stewie, no!

What the hell's wrong with you?

It's that robot!

He killed Queen,
and now he's going to kill me!

He didn't kill Queen.
They're all fine.

Most of them are fine.

Look, Stewie, I'm sorry
for scaring you, all right?

But come on, it's not a real robot.

See? It... It's just an album. Look.

Here, you want to hit it?

Well... I'm usually more
comfortable around things

if I can put them in my mouth.

So, can I put it in my mouth?

I guess.

This is just an album!

Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

So, you know, can you forgive me?

Oh, I suppose so.

I mean, Magellan forgave
the "Land ho!" prankster.

Land ho!

-Where? Where?
-Psych! Made you look, loser.

Good thing there wasn't land
or else you'd have to meet the natives

with that mustard stain on your shirt.

-What stain?
-Ah! (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Ugh! Why did I even
bring you on this trip?

Because I'm the best
damn land spotter in all of Europe.

It's true. You are the best.

Yeah, I don't need you
to tell me that.

(BOTH PANTING)

Dad, I can't take this anymore.

I'm so tired and I'm so hungry.

I got an idea, Chris. Follow me.

What are we doing?

I saw a forest like this
in a book one time,

and I know there's a gingerbread
house out here somewhere.

Do you think we could find it?

We have to, Chris.

We-we gotta eat something
besides what they're feeding us.

I know what you mean, Dad.

I'm so hungry I could
eat this dead camper.

Holy crap!

(FLIES BUZZING)

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

Well, we clearly don't have
all the evidence yet,

but that's never
stopped us before, right?

(LAUGHS)

Oh, there's no other cops here.

But we do know one thing,
this kid was murdered.

(ALL GASP)

Murdered? Who in the world
would want to kill a camper?

Don't look at me.
I'm just here to drop off my son.

Justin? Justin,
that does not work for me.

And it looks like
there are signs of trauma

around the throat.

Somebody strangled this fat kid.

-Wait. He was strangled?
-Yeah.

Joe, I know who did it.

You do? Who?

Well, there's only one person I know
who likes to strangle fat guys.

Patrick Pewterschmidt.

-Who's that?
-My brother-in-law.

<i>People call him</i>
<i>"The Fat Guy Strangler."</i>

<i>He's always had a thing</i>
<i>for strangling fat guys.</i>

I guess he fits the profile, Peter,

but Lois's brother
is locked up in an asylum.

Well, either way,
we gotta get out of here.

Otherwise, we're just sitting ducks!

Hey, we all know this guy
goes for the classy ladies.

In fact, I once caught him
trying to pick up a quack whore.

(ALL LAUGH)

All right, calm down.

We all make bad choices.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Lois, I hope you're sitting down.
I got something to tell ya.

Oh, God, what's wrong?

Is everything okay?
Is it Chris?

No, it's Peter, your husband.

But I'm calling with big news.

I was Anita in
the camp production

of <i>West Side Story.</i>

Peter, you know you're terrible
at patter songs.

I did okay.

(SINGING, MUMBLING) <i>...America</i>

(MUMBLING) <i>...America</i>

(MUMBLING) <i>...America</i>

(MUMBLING) <i>...America</i>

I got other news, too.

One of the fat kids at camp
got strangled!

(GASPS) Oh, my God!

Yeah, but don't worry.
It ain't your brother.

He's still locked up in that asylum.

Um, Mom...

look who dropped by for a visit.

Hello, Lois.

(GASPS) Patrick!

It's been a long time.

(WHISPERS) Peter, he's here!

Wait a second, Lois,
I want to go back

to what you said
about my patter singing.

Who gives you the right?

You know I carried
<i>Pirates of Penzance</i>

that season
at Quahog Community Theater.

(SINGING)<i> I am the...</i>
(GIBBERISH)<i> ...general</i>

(GIBBERISH) <i>...mineral</i>

(GIBBERISH) <i>...historical</i>

(GIBBERISH) <i>...with the eggs on top</i>

Man, I hope we get back
to your house

before Patrick hurts anyone else!

If he even lays
a finger on my family,

I'll do to him what I did to the Riddler.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Freeze, psycho!

Oh, Peter, thank God!

Patrick Pewterschmidt,
you're under arrest

for the murder of, uh... (BLEEP)

I didn't get the kid's name.
We're supposed to do that.

Lois, you called the cops?

Patrick, you're my brother
and I love you, but you're not well.

But I'm better now.
I've put my past behind me.

Save it, Patrick.

We know you escaped
from the asylum and killed...

Bill, we'll just call him
"Bill" for now.

Escaped? I-I didn't escape.

Just this morning, a very nice
gentleman opened my cell door

and said I was free to go.

Yeah, nice try.
That's not how it works.

Uncle Patrick,
why do you strangle fat people?

It's probably a weird fetish thing.

Some criminals have 'em.

Like those anal-retentive bandits
who robbed Quahog Bank last year.

All right, hands in the air!
Vertically!

Both arms should be
parallel to each other!

You, fill this bag with clean,
unmarked bills!

But first fix that notepad

so it's at a right angle
with the corner of your desk!

And tap that pile of receipts
against a flat surface

so they're not sticking out
haphazardly!

You know what?
Forget about the money!

Everybody grab a broom!
We are straightening this place up!

All right, campers,

until the Fat Guy Strangler
is caught,

everyone has to stay
inside their cabins.

Now I'm gonna do
a stomach count.

When I call your name,
please respond. Jenkins?

-(STOMACH GROWLS)
-Robertson?

-(STOMACH GROWLS)
-Davis?

-(STOMACH GROWLS)
-Elliot?

-Where's Elliot?
-I think he's asleep.

Elliot? Elliot, wake up.

Elliot? (GASPS)

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Officer Swanson here.

What? Oh, my God!

What is it, Joe?

Another camper was strangled
half an hour ago.

But... that means...

Patrick can't be the killer.

That's what I was trying to tell you.

Acknowledged. I'm on it.

Joe, would you settle
a camp argument?

Is it "Bombardment" or "Dodgeball"?

-Dodgeball.
-Ah, you don't know.

Well, I'd better put out an APB

to all the neighboring towns.

Oh, the murderer
won't leave the camp.

What? What are you talking about?

He's "feeding."

He killed twice
and he's gonna do it again.

He's got plenty of places
to hide out there

and a fully stocked corral of victims.

How do you know that?

Trust me. I know.

You know, Joe, maybe Patrick
can actually be of help.

I mean, who better
to get inside the mind of someone

who's strangling fat people
than someone who's done it himself?

Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

Like I did with scary teenagers.

I used to be afraid of 'em,
until I realized

they were just misunderstood.

Hey, fat ass,
give me your wallet!

I could give you my wallet,

but what I think you really want...

is love.

(VOICE BREAKS) It's true!

I'm taking your shoes.

Poor kid.

You know, the weirdest thing is
his bunk is right next to Chris's.

Yeah, that was a close call.

Oh, it was more than a close call.

You said the first victim
was wearing a baseball cap,

this second one is blond...

The killer wasn't trying
to murder this kid.

He was trying to murder Chris.

(GASPS) Oh, my God!

Why would anyone want to kill Chris?

I don't know, but I do know

that he's in a great deal
of danger right now.

-Come on. Let's go!
-Yeah!

But wait, this is our last chance
to do a panty raid!

(WOMEN SCREAMING)

Yay! Fat camp! We got it!

Oh, no, a gust of wind!

(WIND WHOOSHES)

(BRANCH CREAKING)

(WIND WHISTLING)

(GASPS) Wha...
What are you doing here?

You dishonored me, Chris Griffin.

No one has ever eaten
more hot dogs than me.

Now you must die!

I got news for you.

(SCREAMS) Why does robot
hold dead people?

Is that future or past?

(GASPING AND GROANING)

Oh, my God, Stewie,
you saved my life!

Ah, you would've done
the same for me, Chris.

The important thing is,
we're all gonna be okay.

Right, Giant Robot?

Charles Yamamoto...

went from eating champion
to cold-blooded killer.

Who'd have thought?

Wait a minute, Joe.
That's the guy who opened

the door to my cell yesterday
and told me I could leave the asylum.

Huh. Is that right?

Well, then it all makes sense.

Yamamoto wanted it to look like
you broke out on your own.

That way,
when he murdered Chris,

it was a cinch
that you would take the blame.

Well, Patrick, I guess
we all owe you an apology.

Patrick?

-Where did he go?
-He was just right here.

What happened?

Damn it!
He must've gotten away!

How is that possible?

I don't know,
but I'd better make it

look like there was a struggle.
Someone punch me in the face.

I'm a good friend
to you.

with Joe and Quagmire.

What? No, you're not.
Tonight's our family night.

We agreed that every Sunday,
we'd do something together.

-(MEG CLEARS THROAT)
-What?

Oh, nothing.
I was just clearing my throat.

Good. I thought you were
going to say something.

But, Lois, we already made plans.

Yeah, I can't leave those guys alone.

Last time they hung out
without me was a disaster.

All right, movie night.

I am so psyched for <i>Reindeer Games!</i>

What, I thought we were watching
<i>La Vie En Rose.</i>

What do you mean,
<i>Reindeer Games</i> is great!

Everything goes wrong
on the one day it has to go right.

But<i> La Vie En Rose</i>
is a beautiful movie

about the real life tragedy of Edith Piaf.

Usually, Peter would break the tie.

Well, Peter isn't here, is he?

Because you were
supposed to be watching him,

but you were smoking
marijuana and he drowned!

What? No, he's at a PTA meeting.

Where the hell did you get that story?

I don't know! I just can't
stand it when he's not here!

Peter, you've got
every other night of the week

to spend with your buddies.

This is the one night
we've set aside for our family.

Is that really too much to ask?

(SIGHS) I guess you're right.

Come on, Brian. Come upstairs.

I wanna show you a freckle
on my sack that I'm concerned about.

It has irregular edges.

(DOOR CLOSES)

BRIAN: (WHISPERS)
Peter, what are you doing?

PETER: (WHISPERS)
I'm not goin' to Family Night.

My agreeing with Lois
was just pure theater.

Come on, we're jumping off the roof.

BRIAN: Are you insane?
We'll kill ourselves!

Don't worry, we can fly.

I got this pixie dust from a magic fairy.

Either that or it's speed

I got from a transvestite at a diner.

(SNORTING)

(YELLS) It's the speed!
It's the speed from the diner!

Peter, let go of me!

(YELLS) Damn it!

So what are we gonna do
for Family Night?

Oh, would you shut up?
All the good people are gone.

Hey! Welcome to Quahog Laser Tag.

Please pay attention while I show y'all
how to put on y'all's vests.

Sir, can I use you to demonstrate?

Thank you, I have
longed for your attention

since the moment I arrived.

Now, put this on
over your shoulders. Good.

Now, I'm gonna need you to squats down

like your underwears is done for,

but you might still save the jeans.

Now, you's gonna wanna latch
the front to the back like so...

Did everybody get that?

Boy, a lot of heat
comes off you, don't it?

-(LAUGHTER)
-(LASERS ZAPPING)

All right, keep an eye out for Peter.

He's oddly competitive at this stuff.

Yeah, and he seems to be weirdly
physically fit at this place.

Yeah, it's almost like
he has unrealistic abilities

when we play laser tag.

All right, well,
if we just stick together, then...

Zap! Zap! Zap!

-What the...
-No way!

How'd you learn
to do that?

The question isn't how I do it.

It's how I forgive myself
for what I've done.

(ZAPS)

Yeah, winner! Right here!

All right, pal,
what do I get?

Well, for five dollars, you could get

your picture in a fake newspaper
with a humorous headline.

Wow, my picture in the paper.

I didn't even get that when I brought
that kitten and gorilla together.

Huh? Did I tell ya, Lois?

Oh, that's beautiful, Peter.

She's taking care
of that kitten like it's her own.

Yep, I knew eventually
she'd stop tearin' 'em in half.

There you two are!

We waited for you for four hours!

Where the hell have you been?

Look, Lois, I know you're mad,

but I think this will prove
that I did the right thing.

I put our family on the map tonight.

No longer will we be
just those faceless nobodies

who brought the bird flu
to Quahog.

You know, there's something
seriously wrong with a man

who always puts
his friends over his family.

Come on, Lois,
I think you're overreacting.

What's so wrong about a guy
hanging out with his buddies?

Buddies? You're one of his buddies?

Yeah. And you know why?

'Cause I don't try to tell him
what he can and can't do.

Oh, please, Brian.

You're just two people
who live in the same house.

If you didn't,
you'd never hang out

with each other in a million years.

He owns you. You're his property.

He used to hang you
in the garage

so his fender wouldn't hit the wall.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)

You're there.

You're there!

I couldn't hear you.
The radio was too loud.

I'm going to bed.

You know, Lois is right, Brian.

You think you're Peter's pal,
but you're really not.

You're just his dog.

Well, that's where you're wrong.
Watch this.

Hey, Peter,
you want to go hit The Clam?

Nah, there's no way she's in the mood.

-Let's just go to the bar.
-Sounds good.

Headin' to the bar with my friend, Peter.

You're lying to yourself, Brian.

Like those girls who insist
their best friends are attractive.

Oh, Stewie, I can't wait for you
to meet my best friend.

She is so cute.

Yeah, she sounds awesome.

Oh, my God, yeah.

People ask her
if she's a model all the time.

Here she comes!

(CHUCKLES) Okay, okay,

that was an extreme example,

but face it, ladies,
your best friends are not hot.

Uh, Peter, your seat belt
back here doesn't work right.

What's gonna happen to you
that hasn't already happened?

Peter, look out for that car!

(HIGH-PITCHED TONE RESONATES)

That's not a car.

What is that?

(ALL SCREAMING)

Hello?

Hello?

Anybody here?

Hey.

Hey. Do you work here?

I don't know. Doesn't look like it.

Who are you?

I... I don't know.
I-I just woke up here.

I seem to be a heavyset fellow.

-You do.
-JOE: Hey.

Thank God someone else is here.

You two seem to be
the only ones in this hospital.

No, I'm here, too.

Any of you guys
know what's going on?

I just woke up in one of these rooms.

I have no idea how I got here.

I don't even know who I am.

All I know is,
I'm extremely important

because there are drawings of me
on all the bathroom doors.

See?

It's glued on there, too,
so I'm pretty sure it's permanent.

This is really weird.
We seem perfectly coherent,

it's just we can't remember who we are.

It's like our identities
have been wiped out somehow.

Maybe we can find somebody
to help us.

(DIAL TONE DRONING)

The whole town seems to be deserted.

Well, if there are only four of us,

I propose we start a band.

And I propose
we call ourselves "Robes of Teal".

Aw, damn it.

Well, we could still be a band
and choose a different name.

Oh, no, Robes of Teal
was the whole thing.

What the hell happened?
Where is everybody?

You don't suppose...

Do you think
we're the only people on Earth?

I don't know. I tell ya what,

I'm gonna open up
this bag of Chex Party Mix.

If people don't show up,
then we're it.

(RIPS)

Yep, we're it.

All right, look, we know
we woke up in the hospital,

so maybe there was some kind
of catastrophe

that we were all spared.

Or maybe we were all
in some kind of accident.

Well, that would explain
why you're in a wheelchair.

You must have gotten hurt
worse than the rest of us.

Yeah, I got hit so hard,
it knocked my pee into a bag.

None of this makes any sense.
Where the hell is everybody?

Well, if we wait till tax day,
I'm sure the tax man will show up.

Ha. You should tweet that.

Okay.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

(LAUGHS) This guy's hilarious.

I'm gonna retweet this.

(CELL PHONES BUZZ)

-Huh.
-JOE: Mmm.

Social media is bringing us
all closer together.

Unfollow.

Hey, you know,
if we're all gonna be

tryin' to figure this out together,

maybe it would be easier
if we gave each other names.

That's a great idea.

Hey, maybe my name
is on this collar.

"Cremate, don't bury."

Okay, that's a downer.

You know what?
I'm gettin' a feeling about my name.

I think my name
might be Shirt Pants.

Shirt Pants? What kind of name is that?

I don't know. What's your name?

I kinda think it's Manly Walker.

-Wheeler?
-No, Walker.

-Wheeler?
-No, you're not hearing me right.

-It's Walker.
-It's probably Wheeler.

I sorta think my name is Earl.

<i>(MY NAME IS EARL </i>THEME MUSIC PLAYS)

-What was that?
-I don't know.

Apparently, I made
some sort of reference.

Hey, check it out. Looks like a bar.

(SIGHS) I could go for a stiff one.

I think they got a pill for that.

Shirt Pants!

Who else but Shirt Pants?

<i>He's Shirt Pants,</i><i>Shirt Pants</i>

<i>He's tryin' to remember,</i>
<i>but he really can't</i>

<i>He's Shirt Pants, Shirt Pants</i>

<i>All I know for sure is</i>
<i>I'm</i><i>wearing a shirt and pants</i>

Hello?

SINGER: (OVER JUKEBOX)
<i>A-well-a everybody's heard</i>

<i>About the bird</i>

<i>B-B-Bird, bird, bird,</i>
<i>b-bird's the word...</i>

That's annoying.

BRIAN: It just doesn't make sense
that there aren't any people.

This couldn't have happened naturally.

Something must have
caused this, or someone.

Well, when I find that person,
I'm gonna strangle him.

I had a life,
and he took it away from me.

I don't remember it,
but I bet it was pretty good.

Yeah, me, too.

I bet I was a doctor
who had to deal with

a lot of serious stuff,

but always found a way
to keep things light.

Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

Yeah, she is.

It's not yours. Yours died.

Yeah, and I bet I answered

the customer complaint line
at a Danish cookie company.

Hello, Danish cookie company.

No, I know they don't taste very good.

Well, because they're very dry,
aren't they?

I mean, they came in a tin,

how fresh did you think
they were gonna be?

Look, it's dark
and freezing in Denmark.

Everybody who made these cookies
has shot themselves.

Well, I bet I did something
really important and exciting.

Like-like maybe I was
a speechwriter

for the first ever Black president.

Hey, can he say the word "ask"?

Or-or is that a word
we should avoid?

Yea, and I bet you I was
the voice of an animated bird.

(JOE'S VOICE) I thought I saw a cat.

I did see a cat.

Oh, my God, look at that.

Wow, that looks pretty bad.

Is the Chinese guy dead?

(SNIFFS) Wait.

(SNIFFS) We-we were in this car.

I can smell us all in this car!

This must be the accident
that put us all in the hospital.

See if there's a registration
in the glove compartment.

"Peter Griffin."

One of us is Peter Griffin.

Look at this indent
on the steering wheel.

It's a perfect match.

Oh, my God!
You're Peter Griffin!

Yeah, I am.

And you live at 31 Spooner Street.

Finally, a real clue. Let's go!

Wow, I own a house!

I just hope it doesn't have

one of those mailboxes
that looks like a cow.

<i>I just want to seem cool</i>
<i>to these guys, but I really hope</i>

<i>I have one of those mailboxes</i>
<i>that looks like a cow.</i>

<i>"Moo," says my mailbox.</i>

Well, this is 31 Spooner Street.

I'm home.
All right, see you guys.

I'm gonna go shove
my hand down my pants

and see if that goes someplace.

Guys! Guys! It goes someplace!

(SNIFFS) Hang on, I got something.

(SNIFFING)

I poop a lot on this lawn.

This must be where I live!

Hey, Shirt Pants, come in here.

Oh, my God!

I know, I know!
You're my owner!

I knew it!
I knew we were pals!

Yeah, I mean,
there's no pictures of me,

but I see you've got
a dog collar and a leash.

And look how big
your doggie cage is.

You could fit a human in there.

Clearly, you're a good owner.

It's such a weird situation.

I-I just think somebody
should be writing about it.

Yeah.

Do you... do you think
it should be me?

S-Should I be the one
writing about this?

-Uh, I don't know.
-I-I think it should be me.

Then just do it, stop talking
about it, for God's sake.

Oh, hey, guys.

Well, we got it all figured out.

Turns out my name
is Glenn Quagmire,

-and this is my dog.
-JOE: Hey, you guys!

Hey, I found my house.

Turns out my name's Joe Swanson,

and I found this
police uniform in my closet.

Do you know what that means?
I'm a stripper!

Well, it's good
we found out who we all are,

but we still haven't found out
what the hell happened to everybody else.

Yeah, I've been thinking about that,
and I think the best course of action

is for us to just go ahead
and start repopulating the Earth.

-But there are no women.
-Well, let's try some stuff.

Hey, you guys
want to see something cool?

There's a bedroom upstairs
that belonged to some girl,

and she's got bras in there,
and the cups are different sizes.

Like one of them's a martini glass
and the other one's some kinda melon.

Guys, you know
how we were thinking

that something must have
caused this situation, or someone?

-Yeah?
-Look at that.

Oh, my God.

-It's him.
-He did this.

What do we do?

Check it out.
I got the little freak's bra.

I'm gonna put it on.

Huh, this actually
fits pretty well.

Oh, wait, there's a name on it.

It's mine.

My God.

Peter is responsible
for killing everyone on Earth.

But how could a guy like that
cause all this destruction?

Well, he's clearly not just a guy.

He's some kind of omnipotent alien,
with powers we can only guess at.

Look at him... watching, learning...

absorbing.

This janitor's in love
with this redheaded ashtray.

-RICKY: (ON TV) <i>Lucy!</i>
-(LUCY CRYING)

But why didn't he kill us?

I don't know, maybe...
maybe he needs us.

Maybe we're important.

I mean, I do have all these
profound ideas and thoughts.

Maybe I was a deep thinker of some kind.

Deep thinker?

I spent the whole morning
trying to teach you one simple thing.

Give me paw.

Paw?

Good. Other paw.

No. Other paw.

No! We practiced this!

You're gonna make me look bad
in front of the other guys.

Other paw!

Finally!

You know,
this actually reminds me

-of a quote by Milton...
-Shut the (BLEEP) up.

Well, what are we gonna do?

-What are we gonna do about what?
-(ALL GASP)

Oh, about the...

The, uh... (HESITATES) the pie!

The pie we're all
gonna make for you for...

being such a great guy.

Oh, my God,
that sounds awesome.

I would kill everyone
in the world

and leave three survivors
for a piece of pie right now.

(NERVOUS LAUGHING)

Guys, really,
what are we gonna do?

Well, it seems obvious.

We gotta find a way
to kill him before he kills us.

Kill him?

How about we just
get the hell out of here?

Are you kidding me?
He'd catch us.

If this guy's an alien,
I bet he can fly.

He can probably hear us right now.

He's probably got a laser beam
that can shoot us through the walls.

(SCREAMING)

He can't hit us if we keep moving!

Can you... Can you not...
Can you...

I just took a bunch
of random stuff I found

in my medicine cabinet,

and you're really freaking me out
right now.

Okay, maybe he doesn't have a laser.

But listen, if we're gonna
kill him, we gotta find some guns.

Okay, well, let's go.

Not all of us.
Somebody's gotta go over there

and keep an eye on him,
make sure he doesn't go anywhere.

Oh, come on. Why me?

'Cause I'm your owner and I said so.

But I don't want to.

All right, then, you asked for it!

What, what is that?

I found it in my night table.

I thought it was a dog whistle,
but now I'm thinking

it's something you jam in your urethra
to make you last longer.

Man, I wonder if
I'm one of those secret assassins

who doesn't even know it,
but I'm a highly trained killing machine.

Well, I could test that by attacking you.

If you repel my attack,

maybe that means
you're a secret assassin.

Good idea.

I don't, I don't think
I'm a secret assassin.

(KNOCKING) Hey, uh...

Knock, knock, a-anybody home?

Oh, hey, buddy. Come on in,
I could use some company.

Um, okay.

Hey, I know we're the only
people on Earth and all,

but what's with all these Mexicans
coming here to steal our jobs?

Hey, what are you doin' down there?

Come on, sit up
on the couch with me.

Are you sure?

Mr. Quagmire says dogs
aren't allowed on the furniture.

I don't care about that stuff.

Besides, you look like
you got a clean bum.

It is pretty clean. I just cleaned it.

Ha! Bums are funny.

(CHUCKLES) They are kinda funny.

-We all got one.
-We all got one!

I was just gonna say that!
Isn't-isn't that weird?

(CHUCKLES) Everybody's got a bum!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Mine's even got
a secret compartment in it

where you can store stuff.

-Hey, you want a pretzel?
-I'm okay.

You know, you ever think
if we could all just

spend more time celebrating
our similarities instead of just

standing on our differences,

the universe would be a much better place?

Not really.
But that bum thing,

you're-you're on to something there.

Y-You're, uh...

you're some kind of
deep thinker, aren't you?

(TIRES SCREECH)

-Where you goin'?
-I-I think your...

your pie might be about ready.

Hey, we're gonna share
that pie, buddy,

'cause, you know,
there's no "I" in "pie."

Except for the "I."

But enough about numbers. You go.

So, we ready to do this?

You guys, I'm not sure
that Peter's the guy we think he is.

He seems harmless
and actually kinda nice.

Oh, my God.

You slept with him!

What? No, no.
We were just watching TV,

but listen, you've got to believe me,

he's not capable of hurting anyone.

Clearly he's controlling your mind
with his superior alien brain.

PETER: Ah, don't let 'em
get you down, Paul Blart.

Your life has dignity.

(LAUGHS) And comedy!

Oh, heavens! (LAUGHS)

Look, there's pretty solid
evidence that this guy

is responsible for the elimination
of the entire human race,

and we need to take him out.

Okay, okay, you're right.

But he trusts me,
so you guys wait here,

and I'll go lure him out.

(DOOR CLOSES)

I have a lot of dirty stuff in my house.

Wait, what the hell's he doing?

(INAUDIBLE)

He's supposed to be
luring Peter out here.

He's not doing anything like that.
He's warning him!

They think I'm an alien?

Yes, and you have to get
out of here right away!

But you're...
you're Quagmire's dog.

Why would you be
helping me instead of him?

Because...

I-I don't... I don't know why.

I-I can't explain it.
I-I just...

I feel like you're my friend.

(SIGHS) You wouldn't understand.

No, I think I kinda do.

Come on, buddy. Let's go!

I knew I couldn't trust you,
you filthy mongrel.

Guys, he didn't do it, I swear.

Get out of the way, dog.

(BRIAN GRUNTS)

(WHIMPERS) Please! I didn't do anything!

When you've been a stripper
as long as I have,

you know when
you've met a bad egg.

And you're a bad egg.

No! You bastards!

(SOBBING)

(SCREAMS)

(MACHINE BEEPING)

What the hell...

What's going on?

Stewie?

Well, Brian, you proved me wrong.

What the hell
are you talking about?

What, what is all this?

You see, Brian,
I conducted a little experiment.

Remember our little argument

about whether you and Peter
were actually friends?

Well, I wanted to prove
to you that I was right,

that your friendship was purely
a result of circumstance.

So I created a scenario in which
everyone's memories were erased,

to demonstrate that you and Peter

would never naturally
associate with one another.

But I was wrong.

It appears you two
have a genuine bond after all.

Wow.

So we really were meant
to be friends.

I guess you were, yes.

So, are they gonna
remember any of this?

No, I'll wipe out their whole day.

It'll be like it never happened.

Wow. Hey, what's going on over there?

Oh, I wanted to see how three women
would react in the same situation.

ALL: (ARGUING AND SCREAMING) Stop it!

-Ow! Ow!
-Let go! Let go!

They've only been in there
for three minutes.

Haven't even tried to figure out
each other's names yet.

All right, I'll see you

Where are you going?

I'm off to take pictures
of lesbian butts.

What?

Joe and Quagmire and I are
making a coffee table book

called <i>Lesbian Butts</i>
<i>in '80s Jeans.</i>

I already got the first
chapter right here.

LOIS: Where'd you take
all these pictures?

PETER: You know, coffee houses,
Chevy dealerships,

all the usual places.

Peter, you're not doing that.
I got a ton of errands to run,

and I need your help
around here.

Well, fine, if I
can't do the book

I'm gonna hurt
something you love.

(GRUNTING)

You happy now?

Maybe we should discuss this

I don't like fighting

No, I want to fight
in front of the kids.

I feed off the excitement
of an audience.

Peter, for once
you're going to stay here

and help
around the house.

Now, I need you to watch
Stewie till I get back.

Whoever did this, thank you.

All right, Stewie,
since Lois says

I got to keep
an eye on you,

we might as well have
some father-son time,

so I'm gonna measure
your penis

and then I'm gonna
measure my penis,

whose is bigger.

Doesn't really

Stupid game anyway.

(SINGING) <i>Head, shoulders, knees,</i>
<i>And toes, knees and toes</i>

<i>And that's how you make a duck</i>

This is the greatest show

Mother Maggie, you are
a kindred spirit.

This must be how twins
who are separated at birth

feel when they first meet.

Trade house keys,
bang each other's wives?

Yep.

I can't dissect
this pig, Mr. Kingman.

It's against
my religion.

Believe me, Neil,
it's no thrill

for the pig to
touch a Jew either.

Okay, how about you,
Meg, how are you doing?

Pretty good.

It's, it's kind of cool
cutting something that's not me.

Wow, that's some
very impressive work.

It's easy for Meg to dissect
a pig because she is a pig.

-(LAUGHS)
-Hey!

All right,
I'll let that one slide.

Meg, you have some
real potential.

Have you ever thought
about becoming a doctor

when you grow up?

I always just assumed
I'd work on the docks.

Don't limit
yourself, Meg.

Doctors wear a mask
most of the time,

so this isn't
an issue.

If you're interested
the school has a program

where you can shadow
a real doctor

and learn more about
the medical field.

Yeah, wow, I'd love
to check that out.

Great, I'll
set it up.

I didn't know a pig
could be a doctor.

Hey!

You get
just a few more of those.

MOTHER MAGGIE: <i>Now, children,</i>
<i>we're going to learn who wears a hat.</i>

<i>Can a fireman wear</i>

<i>Can a policeman</i>

-No way.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
Yes, he can, I knew that.

<i>Now, you at home, tell me,</i>

A very formal horse?

<i>Very good.</i>

<i>Even a bowling ball</i>

<i>if you use</i>

(LAUGHING)
A bowling ball wearing a hat?

This is what high-def

Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

Being a good dad
like you asked.

I've been watching
<i>Jolly Farm </i>with Stewie

for the last
three hours.

That's not Stewie,
that's a pineapple.

Oh, my God,
where is Stewie?

I don't know, but
I'm sure he's fine.

Peter, he's a baby.
You can't leave him alone.

Come on, it's good to
have some alone time.

You know, I spent a year
alone on a desert island

with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.

You're saved, sir, we're going
to get you back to civilization.

And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?

Okay.

Yeah, we can teach
him sign language

and he can
tell us stories

about what you two did
on the island together.

No, n... No, no, no, let's, let's not,
let's not bring the monkey.

Um, I have a peanut M&M
up my nose

and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.

I am ready to farm
this out to someone.

Oh, Stewie, there you are.

Peter, I asked you to do one
simple thing, watch the baby,

and you couldn't even do that.

Come on, Stewie.

Geez, why's she got
to be such a nag?

I wish she was more
like Mother Maggie.

<i>Mother Maggie has an</i>
<i>announcement, lads and lasses.</i>

<i>I've had such fun playing</i>

Peter, it's just a
stupid kids' show.

Just a stupid
kids' show?

What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?

I... I... I don't know.

This is going
to leave a void,

and somebody's got
to fill it.

I think you're
overreacting.

You don't understand,
Brian.

What am I supposed to do
without<i> Jolly Farm?</i>

I'll be like an Italian mom
without bad kids.

Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?

We're not doing anything.

You getting
fresh with me?

I'm tired of bailing both
of youse out of prison.

We're both
in college

and we consistently make
the dean's list.

I'm telling
your father.

Good.

Where the hell
is our food?

Yeah, where are
Mom and Dad?

And where's
that awesome finger painting

Stewie did this morning?
Oh, here it is.

Thank you for bringing it up.

I wasn't going to bring it up.

Wha... What's
going on?

-You haven't eaten yet?
-No.

Where's your father?

He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.

I ask him to do one thing
while I'm at yoga.

You go to an intro class

and it's not even
at the yoga studio.

It's in someone's living room.

And that's not even a yoga mat.

That's the old pee pad
from my crib.

Uh, Lois, you might want
to check this out.

-What is it, Brian?
-Take a look.

PETER: <i>And now, boys and girls,</i>
<i>it's time for</i> Petey's Funhouse.

(CHILDREN CHEERING)

(SINGING) <i>It's gonna be fun</i>
<i>And we'll have lots of yuks</i>

<i>And maybe learn some stuff</i>
<i>But not definitely</i>

<i>It's the</i> Petey's Funhouse <i>show</i>

Ugh, another
Aaron Sorkin show

that's way over
everyone's head.

How the hell did you even get
a TV show, Peter?

I just answered an
ad off Craigslist,

and after several hours of
sexual torture, I had a show.

-(PHONE RINGS)
-Don't answer that.

I gave out that
number under duress.

Lois, Peter's show is on the
local public access channel.

Anyone can have one.

Yeah,<i> Petey's Funhouse</i>
is actually replacing

<i>The Bad Audio Basement Show.</i>

(DISTORTED) <i>And once the hot glue</i>
<i>dries, your birdhouse will be complete.</i>

Peter, you already do
nothing around the house

and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.

Geez, you're still getting
on my hump about this?

I help out
around here.

Just this morning I
changed Meg's diaper

and I sent her
off to school.

Boy, can she kick, but
she left here spotless.

Dr. Hartman, thanks for
letting me shadow you.

I just know I'm going
to learn so much.

It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.

You see that diploma?

Yale Medical School.

Wow, that's
impressive.

Thank you, I work very hard
on my calligraphy.

So, how about we take a little
stroll around the hospital?

This area is known
as a hallway.

Don't worry,
you'll pick up

on all the technical
doctor jargon pretty soon.

Hey, is it prescription
or perscription?

I think
it's prescription.

Prescription... That just
feels weird in my mouth.

Perscription is better.

Oh, and there's the E.R.

Don't go in there unless you
want everyone to yell at you.

-Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.
-ALL: Hi, Petey!

We're going to have so much fun
on<i> Petey's Funhouse </i>today,

but before we begin, your
friend Petey wants to sing you a song.

(SINGING)
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

<i>The fact that you are special</i>

<i>But if everybody's special</i>

<i>That kinda waters it down</i>

<i>So some of you ain't special</i>

<i>I can tell you who is special</i>

<i>Like you and you ain't special</i>

And you are
and you're not.

Okay, kids, it's story time here
on<i> Petey's Funhouse.</i>

Today's story is
<i>Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.</i>

Ooh, that's a classic.

Once upon a time, some chick in
a leather jacket in front of me

in the parking lot walked
into Home Depot,

and her butt looked like this.

Everybody see this?

Everybody see
how shapeless this is?

She walked out of there with
a bag of soil on each shoulder.

Now, before I show you
this next one,

has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

I know we have a lot of yuks
here on<i> Petey's Funhouse,</i>

but one thing
that's not fun is a bully.

Now, how many of you kids out
there have ever gotten bullied?

Aw, come on up here

and tell us
about it, champ.

Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.

One time I tried out
for Little League

in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made

so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.

What, wait,
what, like pee?

-How old were you?
-Eight.

Aah, too old!

Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.

All right,
you kids finish him off.

Hey, what do you
got there?

Oh, I'm just playing
with some Lee Logs.

What the hell
are Lee Logs?

A little something
I created... Lee Logs.

Robert E. Lee.

You know, you got Lincoln Logs,
you got Lee Logs.

I don't get it, can,
can you build a house?

You can build
quarters.

And people live there?

They live there if you
tell 'em to live there.

I don't know if I like
the idea of Lee Logs.

Yeah, they're not
selling very well.

Peter, dinner!

No dinner for
me tonight, Lois.

I have to go work on
a bit for tomorrow's show.

If I can kill 25
butterflies in a minute,

I won't have to show
the audience my balls.

Peter, this is the
fourth night in a row

you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.

Once again, I'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,

helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.

You know, I'd lay off
the nagging if I was you.

I'm a children's TV star now.

I can have any three-year-old
girl I want.

Just know that, Lois.

Peter, I'm only asking
you to do your share.

Well, it's getting
on my nerves.

Like, right now,

you are the most
annoying thing

in my life, with the
possible exception of Evite.

-What's this?
-It's this Web site you can use

to invite people
to stuff.

Does it have to be
a significant event?

No. Not at all!

Well, do you just
get the invitation,

and that's the end of it?

No, it'll remind you
about it constantly!

Is there any way
I can customize this

to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?

Yes!

And what about
those replying?

Can they demonstrate
their sense of humor

through hilarious replies?

Yes, yes, yes to
everything you're saying!

I'm so excited
to get started!

You do that while
I jump out this window!

(GLASS SHATTERS)

ANNOUNCER: <i>Evite.</i>

<i>Tell a friend and</i>
<i>then kill yourself.</i>

And then when you
get a little older,

stuff will come out.

(OLD-TIMEY CAR HORN HONKS)

Uh-oh!

Sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.

I hope she doesn't
come over here

and give me the business.

(KNOCKING)

Peter!

Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

Never mind with "hi!"

It sounds like someone's
having fun over here!

You know I don't
like that!

Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.

Real nice lady, huh?

AUDIENCE: No!

What can I do for you,
Saggy Naggy?

You can stop having fun!

But we like fun,
don't we, kids?

AUDIENCE: Yes!

Well, too bad,

'cause you're all gonna
eat your vegetables,

listen to long stories
about my cousins,

and help me
fold sheets!

And you! You're gonna
help around the house,

take out the garbage,

and give Stewie
his bottle!

Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name

on TV all the time,
calm down, bitch.

Make me dinner,
and go rent<i> Twilight,</i>

and do mouth
stuff on me,

even though it's been
a day-and-a-half since I've showered,

and I've used several public
bathrooms in the interim!

Sounds like this could
go on for a while, kids.

Hey, Saggy Naggy,

I know what'll cheer you up.

Do you like pie?

I guess.

Well, how does this taste?

(AUDIENCE CHEERS)

Well, I guess she thought

it was a no-pies-in-the-face
kind of neighborhood.

Wrong assessment of
the neighborhood, sweetheart!

And how are you today, Mr...

Pa-ti-ent?

My last name is Saunders.

That's an interesting
pronunciation.

This is Meg, she's
shadowing me today.

And boy, could she put the applesauce
away in the commissary.

Hi.

Little tip, Meg:
The inside of this folder

has a diagram
of the human body.

Kind of a cheat sheet.

Now see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.

Do you mean
his heartbeat?

Maybe. Here,
you take a turn.

Wow, your heartbeat
sounds a little fast.

-Do you smoke?
-Actually, I do.

Ah, me, too.
Isn't it great?

Well, that's
bad for you.

You shouldn't do it.

It raises your heart rate

and can lead
to emphysema or cancer.

-That's impressive, Meg.
-It's no big deal.

It's just stuff
I learned in health class.

Well, you're clearly
a bright, young lady.

And you've got quite a...

Head on your...

Shoulders.

Thanks.

Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.

Oh, dear.
Prilosec, huh?

No, it's below that.

Oh.

Oh, my God.

Meg, I'm afraid
my brother

just tried to kill
himself in prison.

I... I have to go.

You're gonna have to take
things from here, I guess.

What? What are you
talking about?

Well, you now know
about as much as I do

about this whole
doctor thing.

But I have no formal
medical training.

Ah, you'll be fine.
I think that book on the shelf

has most of the
stuff in there.

And don't forget
the cheat sheet if you need a helping...

Hand.

Are we really
buying fish

at the same place
we buy tires?

And, w... What... "Fazio"?

What, is that a brand
of Blu-ray player?

Stewie, this sweatshirt
is so sophisticated.

Look, it says New York.

People will think
I'm from there.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

<i>Put your phone away,</i>
<i>we're at a funeral!</i>

Oh, my God.

-(LAUGHS)
-Look!

It's Saggy Naggy.

GROUP:
Boo!

You're mean.

I don't like you,
Saggy Naggy.

You stink, Saggy Naggy.

My goodness, that's
a very rude thing

to say to someone.

Calling them Saggy...

(ALL LAUGH)

What the hell?

Young man, what do
you think you're...

Lois, I just saw
Jessica Alba on television.

We've got 90 seconds,
let's go!

Peter, I'm not
in the mood!

That's okay. We can
do it anyway.

Peter, I was assaulted
in public because of you!

Oh, my God, what happened?

I'll tell you
what happened.

A group of kids
attacked me at CostMart

because you portrayed
me on your show

as a raging
puppet bitch!

Writers take
from their lives.

You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.

What's that
supposed to mean?

Well, the last few weeks, you've
been nagging the hell out of me.

Peter, you think
I like nagging you?

One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,

and it's clearly not you.

Is this about me wetting
the bed just now?

Peter, don't
you understand

that I'm just looking
out for this family?

Besides, without
my nagging,

you'd probably
get yourself killed.

Or laid. Right,
frat house?

-Yeah!
-(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

(LAUGHS) Those knuckleheads
should be studying.

Okay, you know what?
Fine, Peter, that's it.

From now on, I'm not
nagging you anymore.

-You're not?
-No, you're on your own.

I'm done with it.
I'm done with all of it!

Well, great, I should
probably get some sleep.

Tomorrow on<i> Petey's Funhouse,</i>
we're doing "Who's on First."

I'm gonna play
Costello,

and Abbott is gonna
be played by live puma.

Peter, that sounds
really d...

You know what?
Sounds great.

Have fun.

Thanks, Lois.
Good night.

Lois? Other families
fight, too, right?

Not this much.

Do you think maybe we should
think about getting a...

It is what it is.

Let's just get Stewie to
college and go from there.

Sir, if you're gonna
want me to examine

where you're
having an issue,

you're gonna have to be more
specific than "thingee."

Okay. It's not
the front thingee.

What's going on in here?
Where's Dr. Hartman?

He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor

but I've been sort of
filling in for him.

You what?

Well, I think I want
to go into medicine,

so I was shadowing
Dr. Hartman.

I've actually
been learning a lot,

but then he just left me here!

Well, you don't belong here!

This is a professional
medical institution

with standards
and regulations to adhere to!

But, but I...

I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

I'm sorry.
I'll go.

(BOTTLE CLINKS)

My issue has
resolved itself.

PETER:
<i>And don't go anywhere, kids,</i>

<i>'cause coming up,</i>
<i>we got some classic comedy</i>

<i>with me and a puma.</i>

Is Dad really gonna do this?

I told your father I was
gonna leave him alone.

Saggy Naggy is
keeping out of this.

Is the puma ready?

Maybe we should
poke him with the

"is-the-Puma-ready?"
stick.

(ROARS LOUDLY)

Oh, my God, I can't
let him do this!

Come on, kids! We got to get
down to that TV studio!

Okay, yeah, just step
on the coloring book.

That's cool.

(BRAKES SCREECH)

I'm asking you
who's on first?

(SCREAMING)

(AUDIENCE SCREAMS)

Oh, my God! Peter!

Cut the camera! Cut it!

Roll a
"Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMS CONTINUE)

(TO TUNE
OF <i>THE FARMER IN THE DELL)</i>

PETER: <i>Kentucky is a state</i>

<i>Kentucky is a state</i>

<i>All the people there are dicks</i>

<i>Kentucky is a state</i>

Oh, he's hurt bad.
Someone call 911!

He's bleeding too much!

He needs attention now!

Somebody help him!
Do something!

Now she's nagging everyone.

Does anyone have
any medical training?

It looks like his
jugular is severed.

I learned this
at the hospital.

Mr. Swanson, find me
a first-aid kit!

Mom, hand me those towels.

Did I hold on to the ball?

Hang in there, Dad.

I'm gonna get you fixed up.

You can do it, Meg.

Come on, Meg.
You've got to save him!

(QUIETLY)
Peter, you need to let go.

L... Lois?

Oh, Peter, thank God!

You're okay.

I guess you were right
about that puma.

I don't know what
I was thinking.

I should've
listened to you.

Peter, I don't
care about that.

I acted like a real jerk,
and I'm sorry, Lois.

I know you just
get on my case

'cause you're
looking out for me.

I am, Peter.

And it's only because
I love you

and I want the best for you
and our family.

I love you, too, Lois.

Isn't anybody
gonna thank me?

Yeah, I'll have a water
if you're getting one.

Mr. Griffin,
you have a visitor.

Hey.

Hey. I get it now.

"Who" is the man's name.

Aha, ah!

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

Come on, Stewie. Hurry up.
I want to get good seats.

Ugh, I hate going to hear
authors read from their work.

That Dr. Seuss reading was dreadful.

And when the drugs
stopped numbing the pain,

the sex became even more violent.

It doesn't rhyme.

MAN: The new stuff doesn't rhyme!

Hey, there.

You a big fan of Jonathan Franzen?

Oh, my God, I worship him.

Yeah, yeah, of all my writing students,

he's probably done the best.

I'm sorry, everybody.

Mr. Franzen has informed us
he's not coming.

Like most real authors,
he's too good for this dumb town.

(ALL GROANING)

MAN: I hate it here.

Well, this crowd was promised an author.

No!

Oh, well, you know,
I guess I should be getting back

to my dorm anyway.

I've got a short story due
for my creative writing class tomorrow.

Oh, creative writing, huh?

Well, if you'd like me to look
it over before you turn it in,

-I'd be happy to.
-Really?

(GIGGLES) That'd be great.

Cool, cool, I'll follow you in my car.

(WHISPERING) Come on. We're going.

All right, hold on.

Is this what your parents are
paying all that tuition for,

so you can (BLEEP) dogs?

I'll print up for you what I have so far.

Okay, I'm gonna go in there with her.

You just sit out here and be quiet.

Here, watch one of her movies
or something.

Ugh, Charlie St. Cloud?

A-And why are there
so many fingerprints on this?

Who's handling their Charlie
St. Cloud DVD all the time?

Lois, can I have
a Pop-Tart in bed, please?

Lois?

Hey, Chris?

CHRIS: Yeah?

Do you think Lois would be okay
if I ate a Pop-Tart in bed?

Probably.

Probably, right?

Lois, you in the bathroom?

(GASPING)

Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you have three crushed ribs,

but I was able to stop
the internal bleeding.

Doctor, this has happened
seven times in the last month.

Peter rolls over in his sleep
and almost kills me.

I see.

Well, that sucks.

Look, I don't do it on purpose.

Well, it looks like you got
a handle on it then.

No, we don't.

He practically smothers me every night.

-Well, are you hogging the blankets?
-No.

"Probably hogging blankets."

And if he's not smothering me,
he's keeping me up all night

writing with that giant plume of his.

"Dearest Augustine,
I do hope this latest damp

has not aggravated your gray lung."

Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

"Matters stateside
have taken a tragic turn

"as this year's gourd crop
has fallen prey

"to a rather unexpected infestation
of saltmarsh cutworms."

Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

Peter, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Come to bed!

"Marital concerns continue to bedevil me."

Look, I'm sorry.

I wasn't planning on
spending all night there.

Look, how about if I take
you to the park, huh?

Come on. You like the park, right?

We're about to pass the turnoff.

Here it comes.

You may take me to the park.

Um, excuse me.
I didn't bring any of my toys.

Can I play with some of yours?

No! Mine!

Are you all right?

I'm fine.

I-- I didn't push him back
because he has leukemia.

My name's Penelope. What's yours?

Stewie.

I've never seen you
around here before.

I'm new to town and I
don't have many friends.

(CHUCKLING) All right.

A lot of pressure on me instantly,
but okay.

Would you like to play
with some of my toys, Stewie?

Well, what have you got?

I have a set of jacks, a paddleball,
and this taffy with superglue.

Isn't that the little
boy who pushed you?

Hmm, yes.

You there,
would you like a piece of candy?

(CHOCKING)

Don't push.

Uh, Lois, why do we have
Lucy and Ricky beds?

Because I'm sick of you crushing
me in the middle of the night.

Dr. Hartman called about my X rays.

Lois, if God wanted me
to not sleep with my wife,

he would have made me John Travolta.

Peter, I'm really tired, okay?
Just give the bed a try.

There you go.

Good night, Peter.

I can't sleep like this, Lois.
I need someone to cuddle with.

Believe it or not, men like to cuddle,

even cold, unfeeling men
like Charles Bronson.

Hey, Charles Bronson's wife.

Scooch over. I want to cuddle.

Mmm, that's nice.

I don't know what the big deal is.

I stopped for one drink after work.

Yes, but it's every night.

There, now you can be
upset about that.

This is fun.
I like playing with you, Penelope.

What shall we play next?

Well, let's see what you have.

You have a pop-up version
of the Unabomber's Manifesto?

Yes, at the end the brother
pops up and turns you in.

What's this on your Etch A Sketch?

Oh, those are some advanced
mathematical formulas

I've just been tinkering with.

You're kidding? I do that, too.

But what are these formulas for?

For these.

(GASPS) Oh, my God,
you've got a weapons room, too?

And look at the size of it. It's amazing.

Yes, although sometimes
I think it's too big.

It takes the cleaning woman
forever to clean it.

Was already broken.

My word, Penelope,

you and I seem to have
quite a lot in common.

Do you actually use these?

Only when fear, spite, jealousy,
and revenge demand.

I bought that to kill the women
from <i>Sex and the City,</i>

but time seems
to be doing it for me.

(GASPS) You're wicked.

Do your parents have any idea?

My mother's not a concern.

I don't really have to worry
about her anymore.

Oh, do you have one of those
white wine zombie moms?

No, she died.

She was taking a tub

and somebody came in
and cut her head off.

Wait a moment.

Did... Did you kill her?

Well, I held the knife...
And her hair.

Oh, my God, I've been dreaming
about doing that for years,

and you've actually gone ahead
and done it.

Penelope...
I've never said this to anyone before,

but I feel like I may have
finally found, in you,

my one true soul mate.

Do you feel this way, too?

I do, Stewart.

It's as if our meeting were
more than a mere coincidence.

It's as if we were meant to be together.

Indeed.

This must be how Maverick felt
when he met Goose.

I feel the need.

-The need for speed.
-The need for speed.

-And Scientology.
-No, just speed.

So, listen, Quagmire, there's something
I kind of wanted to talk to you about.

E-- Ever since Lois got us twin beds,
I can't fall asleep.

I'm used to having another person there.

I know. I always sleep better
when I'm next to someone.

Yeah, it's only natural, right?

I'm glad to hear you say that

'cause, you know, I guess
what I'm trying to say is,

I...want to propose an arrangement
that could benefit the both of us.

Okay.

Men need someone to spoon with
and snuggle with

just the same as women,
and when you don't have that, it-it's...

I... Well, what I'm getting at is...

I would like for you
to sleep with me in my bed,

and this, this is not about sex,
it's about sleep.

No, no, I totally get it, Peter.
Snuggling is a basic human need.

Right, I mean,
who says that the body next to you

has to be male or female
or...whatever?

-Or alive.
-Yeah... Well, no, but, yeah.

Look, I, I think it's a great idea
and I, I'm completely with you.

I'm in. Let's try it.

Yay, that is such good news.

And I'm so happy they gave us a booth.

I know,
'cause they're supposed to be reserved

for parties of three or more.

I know!

Oh, Stewie, it's so nice
to finally have someone

to do naughty things with.

Definitely.

All right, I made a wallet bomb
and I planted it on Mort.

As soon as he opens it, boom.

(BOTH GIGGLING)

Oh, bloody hell.

How do you go two weeks
without opening your wallet?

Yeah, he's been out to dinner,
like, four times.

We're clearly not going
to get him this way.

I know, which is why
I just planted another bomb

that's set to go off every time
he burps into his hand.

(STIFLED BURP)

Oh, I'd better make sure
my wallet's okay.

I say, we're on quite a run.

We blew up the Great Wall of China,

bombed the Eiffel Tower, and
look at this note I sent off.

"Dear Pakistan, Up yours.
Love, India."

Let's see what happens.

They did not need much.

All right, Stewie, your turn.

Okay, I have to destroy
Copenhagen with a...

tidal wave, and the theme is...

the Roaring Twenties.

(STUTTERS) Tha--
That's, that's, that's a challenge.

(ALL SCREAMING)

Peter, what's going on?

Quagmire's having a sleepover with me.

You can't be serious.

Look, Lois, I told you that I need
to have somebody sleeping next to me.

All right, now if that's
not going to be you...

Fine. Do what you want.

I don't care,
but I think it's very strange.

-Okay, that's the one thing it's not.
-Yeah, it's not strange.

I already told you, I don't care.

-It's not strange.
-I know.

All right, let's see here.

Now just, uh, wrap yourself around me.

Is that okay?

Yeah, actually,
you can hold me even tighter.

Okay, I just need to put
this arm right around here.

Yeah, there we go.

Good, now let's just
fall asleep like this.

Your boxers are a little starchy.

Can I take 'em off with my foot?

Sure.

Come on, you.

<i>That could've fit on there.</i>

<i>There was a long space</i>

My God, it's you, isn't it?

It's you and Penelope

who've been doing
all of these horrible things.

So? I've always been
about world domination.

What the hell did you think
I was talking about when I said,

"Victory shall be mine"?

You have not said that
in a very long time.

Well, I'm back on it.

Stewie, Penelope is taking you
down a dark path.

Look, in the past
you've done terrible things,

but it's always been
about the pursuit

of your greater goal
of world domination.

But this girl, she just creates
chaos for the sake of chaos.

So, what are you saying?

I'm saying she's a bad influence on you,

and you should stop spending
time with her.

I shall do no such thing.
Penelope is wonderful.

We're going to be together forever.

Well, Rupert, this is a big mess.

What the hell were you
doing talking to him?

You know who I think
is an ugly slut?

Miss Sharon.

-Miss Sharon from your day care?
-Yes.

This is a map of her house.

I thought we could burn her in her bed
while her children watch.

You know, Penelope,

maybe we don't have
to kill someone every day.

-There are other things to do.
-Like what?

I-I don't know.

You know what? Forget it.

I-I think Brian just got
in my head a bit. That's all.

Brian?

Why? What did Brian say?

Oh, nothing.

He just thinks that
you're a bad influence on me.

(CHUCKLES) T-Thinks
I should stop seeing you.

He does?

How dare he!

Babe? Babe?

Don't worry about it, all right?

Stewart, do you love me?

More than anything.

Then swear on that love
that you'll do what I ask.

Just name it.

Kill him.

Kill Brian for me.

But I was only having a child

because you and the mister...

You don't get to speak
of me and the mister!

Ah, Stewie. So did you do it?

Have you removed that wretched
cur from our existence?

I just couldn't bring myself
to kill him, Penelope.

Brian is my best friend.

Perhaps you're right.

Perhaps it was wrong of me
to ask you to do such a thing.

Oh, thank you.

I'm so glad you're being
so understanding about this.

I was actually dreading
having to tell you about this.

Bleah.

It appears I'll have to kill him myself.

What?

I knew you were too weak to do this.

You're nothing but a coward.

No, Penelope, wait!

(GROANS) Strong women always
turn out to be nightmares.

Like Joan of Arc.

Hey, guys, I'm not like other girls.

I kill people and burp
and watch so much porn.

-No.

Hey, guys, don't come in my room.
I might be rubbin' one in.

Peter, this is ridiculous.
It's time for you to come home.

I live here now, Lois.

Look, I'm sorry
that I ever got us separate...

Is that a bracelet you're wearing?

It's a giggity band, Lois.
You wouldn't understand.

Look, Peter, if you come home now,
we can get our old bed back,

and you can snuggle with me
as much as you want.

Well...

You promise?

I promise.

'Cause, you know,
I missed cuddling with you, too.

-You did?
-I sure did.

Well, then, hey...

What do you say we go home, huh?

Sounds good to me.

(GASPING)

Oh, Brian, there you are!

-Thank God.
-Oh, hey, Stewie.

Did you make that coffee?

Um, no, it was here when I came in.

-I assume Lois made it.
-Don't drink that!

Hey, that mug was my crew
gift from <i>Class Holes.</i>

Did you take a bite out of this donut?

Yeah, it was from a box on the counter.

-So what?
-How long ago?

I don't know. Five minutes?

There's still time.

(COUGHING) God, Stewie,
are you out of your mind?

Trust me, I'm only doing

Why isn't everybody doing this?

I've got a package here for Brian Griffin.

Oh, that's me.

Brian, no!

Stewie, what the hell is going on?

I'm so sorry, Brian.

Penelope told me I had to kill you

because you said
we should break up,

but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

So then she said
she was gonna kill you and...

This-- This is not for you.

That was weird.
W-What was he doing?

Anyway, Penelope's trying to kill you!

I told you she was bad news.

Look, let's just get you
someplace safe.

Dude, get out of here.

Stewie, step aside.

Penelope, I can't let you do this.

Stewie, she's one year old.

are most likely members

If she's not found within 96 hours,
chances are she's gone forever.

Then we've gotta hurry!

Sorry, we can't begin our search
until she's been missing for 96 hours.

Oh, my God! My baby!

Yeah, there's a pretty grisly
sex trade over there.

Usually we just end up
burying framed pictures.

Oh, Peter! This is a nightmare!

(SOBBING)

What's going on down there?
Are they gonna find her?

Doesn't look good.

Stewie, I think there's only one way
we're ever gonna see Meg again.

You and I have to take matters
into our own hands.

What? What are you talking about?

Look, you're the only one
who's got the know-how

and the technology
to help us track her down.

Hmm. Interesting.

Last week, all my gadgets were "hooey,"
I think was the word.

-I didn't say...
-You said "hooey"!

All right, I've booked us on a flight
that leaves in two hours,

so, um, whose credit card
shall we put it on?

Just put it on yours
and I'll pay you back.

Yeah, I feel like when that happens,
I sometimes don't get paid back.

Like when?

Jersey Boys, Morton's Steakhouse,
Foxwoods...

Foxwoods and Jersey Boys
was the same trip!

(SIGHING) You know what? Fine.

I'll-- I'll put it on my card,
but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift

because that's the only way
I can do this anymore.

All right, the first thing
we've got to do when we land

is check the apartment
where Meg was abducted

and see if we can find some clues.

That sounds good.
That's what I was thinking.

Excuse me, do you mind if we switch seats
so my family can sit all together?

No, we don't... We-- We don't switch.

'Cause when we booked,
they didn't have three together...

Ma'am, ma'am, your poor planning
does not constitute an emergency for me.

You'll see him in Paris. Go sit down.

God, Meg's kidnappers
could be anywhere in France by now.

Well, we do have one lead, Brian.

I have a recording

I recorded the kidnapper's phone call

if we just tried to track Meg's movements

from the moment she arrived in France.

That's a good idea, Brian.

All right, we've got to find this man.

Let's see, this was taken at the airport.

He could be some sort of lookout
who spots girls fresh off the plane.

Yes, you're probably right, Brian.
Such scum.

I'll bet they target young girls the way
Army commercials target minorities.

Hey. Other black guys.

we can use.

Grow up.

All right, this is the address
that was in his wallet.

Help... me.

Oh, we're here to help
somebody else, sweetheart.

Go, go, go, go.
Don't... Don't look at her.

Don't look at her. That was my mistake.

Stewie, I don't see Meg anywhere.

Brian, look!

(SOBBING)

Oh, my God!

Meg!

-What the hell?
-Where'd you get that hat?

Uh, a girl gave it to me.

-Well, what did she look like?
-She had a great personality.

That's her.

Where is she? Is she here?

No, uh, they took her
just a little while ago.

Every Wednesday night,

they auction some of the girls off.

Wednesday? What a weird night
to auction girls off into slavery.

Well, you know, on the weekend,
people probably have plans.

Have plans?

What are you doing that's more important
than buying somebody?

Look, where is this place?
Where do they have the auction?

I don't know,

but there is a courtesy shuttle
that runs every 20 minutes.

What?

Aw, damn it. We just missed it.

What do you wanna do for 20 minutes?

Well, I don't know 'bout you,
but I'm gonna work out.

That's how you stay in shape.

You just fit it in
when you have free time,

wherever you are, wherever you can.

There's semen on this floor.

Stewie, look!

We gotta get in there!

Hey, got one more here!

(SOUTHERN FALSETTO) Oh, where are we?

I'm from Atlanta.

I don't know where we are!

Hey, you better hurry.
They're starting soon.

You know what's messed up?
This is all for charity.

All the proceeds are going to Oxfam.

I hope we're not too late.

You should not be out here.

-Bidding is about to start.
-What the hell?

Stewie!

I bought you for my son,

Wife?

Faisal!

This is Faisal,

my son and the heir to my throne.

My father was correct.

Your beauty knows no bounds.

Fair goddess, it is my hope
that you will agree to be my wife,

If you say "no,"

I will have you flown back to your family

I'm just putting up my new sign.

Don't put that thing on our door.

If you want to hang it somewhere,
hang it in the basement.

Oh, why? So you can hog it
while you're doing laundry?

-No way.
-Peter, we're not a business.

Hey, I saw your sign. So, you're open?

-That's right.
-What do you do?

-What do you need?
-Milk.

We have milk.

Peter, I told you, I don't like

all these strangers
walking around in our house.

They're not strangers, Lois,
they are our valued customers.

And if we don't show them
we appreciate their loyalty,

they're gonna go someplace else.

For what?

Not to alarm anyone,
but some guy took me in the closet

and tried me on.

She's right, Dad.
None of this makes any sense.

Meg, go take your ten.

And you may consider this
a verbal warning.

Peter, I want these people to leave.

I fit, by the way.

Lois, I'd love nothing more
than to sit here and chat with you,

but I have a business to run.

Hi there. May I help you folks?

Yes, my family and I would like
our portrait painted.

Well, you came to the right place.

Looking good.

Almost done.

And...there.

Done.

What have you done!

I painted the truth.

I painted my truth.

Gimme a spin, sweetie.

What do you think, Mom?

Is that the most beautiful
bride you've ever seen?

I love it!

Oh, it's just so much money.

It's true. It's true.

Take the dress off, sweetheart.
Your mother says you can't have it.

W-wait, wait, wait a minute.
Do you really love it?

I do. It just feels like my wedding dress.

Oh, Mom, she loves it.

Okay. We'll take it.

Peter, what is that girl doing
in my wedding dress!

PETER: She gone?

No.

Okay, well, while I'm down here
let me give you my card.

There you go.

Here you go. A half-pound of
honey maple turkey, sliced thin.

I wanted a duplicate key made.

You have a good one.

Oh, hey, Joe. What's going on?

Peter, I'm afraid
I'm here to shut you down.

You're running an unlicensed business,
and that's against the law.

Aw, that is such bullcrap.

Well, you can't fight City Hall.

Oh, we'll see about that!

City Hall knows karate.

I'm sorry, Peter,
but the government makes the rules.

I just enforce them.

I don't believe this, Joe.

This is like living in Russia.
I might as well just move there.

You don't want to do that.

It's dark, it's cold, and hooking up

is just a crapshoot
'cause of all the big coats.

All right, drop the coats on three.

Geez, what's your problem, Peter?

I'm sorry, Quagmire.

I'm still just upset
about the damn government

-sticking its nose in my business.
-I hear ya'.

Wasting our tax dollars
on ridiculous causes.

We gotta protect bald eagles?

Bald eagles should be allowed
to make their own decisions!

Honey, I don't care that you're bald.

and I am joining the Tea Party!

You're still not knitting honestly, Peter.

You're knitting like

It's not coming from inside.
It's very superficial.

Thank you! You've made my decision easier!

Yes! That! Knit that!

Good Tea Party morning, everyone!

Peter, you joined the Tea Party!

That's right, Brian.

I finally got something better to do
with my Saturdays than sit at the mall

and watch Japanese girls
laugh at normal conversation.

So, I drove to work this morning...

(ALL GIGGLING)

And I had to stop for coffee.

(ALL GIGGLING)

So, there's a Starbucks near my house.

(ALL LAUGHING)

You people are a circus.

Finally, I'm part of
a movement of regular people

trying to take back our government.

Look, the Tea Party isn't
the grassroots movement you think it is.

It's actually funded by Big Business types

who are using you to get
the government out of their way

so they can roll over everyone.

Mom held hands with a woman
at the gas station this morning.

Don't know what that means.
Just reporting it.

All I'm saying is you're being used
and you're too clueless to know it.

Boy, you just think
you're so superior, don't you?

Like that first creature
to walk on dry land.

Hey, where'd you go?

-Ah, I went for a jog.
-What's a jog?

It's a great way to stay
in shape is what it is.

Is it like a swim?

(LAUGHING CONDESCENDINGLY)

No, no, it's, it's nothing like a swim.

Wow, a lot of people here today.

Yeah. Man, I love street fairs.

They got rides, games,

and ethnic food cooked horribly
by white Americans.

Tack-os! Hot tack-os here!

Oh, are those tack-os?

You better believe they're tack-os.

I love tack-os!

Especially on a corn tor-tilla.

Oh! I love tack-os on a corn tor-tilla!

Boy, they're really against socialism.

That's right.
The Tea Party is all about self-reliance.

Look, there's even a Tunnel of Self-Love.

Would you like to buy a photo
of yourself on the ride, sir?

No, I would not.

Welcome, everyone!

It's great to see
so many regular people out here.

Folks who are tired of big government

and are ready to stand up
for their rights.

-Yeah!
-Down with the Spend-o-crats!

PETER: We are Marshall!

And now, it's my privilege

to introduce another regular,
blue-collar guy,

our Quahog chapter spokesman,
Joe Workingman!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Good afternoon, friends
and socioeconomic equals!

Is anyone else out there
sick of government crap?

Oh, my God.

It's like he's saying everything
I'm listening to.

That's right.

The government wants to tell you
what foods to eat.

(BOOING)

And what church you can go to.

(BOOING)

And that you can't own a chimpanzee
because you're not responsible enough.

(BOOING)

I would feed it!

Also, the government wants to tell you
how many children you can have.

What? No!

And the government wants to tell you

you can't throw
your old TVs into the river.

Then how I supposed to find TV?

If you join the Tea Party, together,
we can fix all that.

But you probably don't wanna
join the Tea Party

because all you get are these
stupid, awesome keychains!

Oh, my God,
it's the keychain from the dream!

I got to say that guy made a lot of sense.

He sure did. The government's
really gotten outta hand.

Yeah, those bastards
have ruined everything.

The same way the Village People
ruined any gathering

of a cop, an Indian chief,
and a construction worker.

Oh, my God,
can we get a picture with you guys?

We're not those guys.

Yes, please leave us alone.

We're very busy.

Now, where were we? Oh, yeah.

We've gotta solve that security problem
for the Indian Casino we're constructing.

Hey, you guys want to head to the Clam?

I'll catch up with you.
I got to hit the john.

Hey, buddy. Is there
a bathroom around here,

or a second floor window?

(GASPS) Carter?

Oh... hey.

You're involved with the Tea Party?

Wait a minute.

This is what Brian was warning me about,

that the Tea Party is run by rich guys
who are only out for themselves.

Brian?

You mean that arrogant,
unemployed dog of yours?

Peter, he's just one
of those liberal elites

who spreads lies and hates patriots.

Yeah, he kinda is.

You and I are both businessmen
who work hard and pay taxes.

Except that I make
10,000 times what you make.

Yeah, we're the same, you and me.

You know, Peter, the truth is,

I could actually use
a regular guy like you

to help get our message out,

and I know Joe Workingman agrees with me.

Love to have you on board, Peter.

Wow, thanks, Joe. You can count on me.

Aw, Carter, you just missed
Joe Workingman.

(LAUGHS)

Oh, I think he'll know I was here.

(LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

I'm not sure what's happening.

Oh, hi, Peter. How was your rally?

Oh, it was great, and now I know
it's the right cause to get behind

'cause a smart guy
like your dad is involved.

What, Carter was at the Tea Party rally?

Yeah, he was running the whole thing.

Peter, what did I tell you
about rich guys?

Look, I know what you're thinking, Brian,
but don't worry, it's all okay.

Turns out you're the enemy.

They're the ones who are on our side.

Oh, of course, Carter Pewterschmidt,

an industrialist
with oil refineries in this city,

is on your side.

He wants to get rid
of environmental regulations

for you.

Brian, he doesn't get sarcasm.

No, it's not just environmental
regulations, Brian.

Carter wants to get rid

of the whole city government of Quahog.

He even put me in charge
of the PR campaign to do it.

Get rid of the government?

Peter, if I know my dad,
he's probably using you.

Lois, I'm so glad
you're done with the dishes

so that you can hang out
and chime in on this.

Actually, Peter,
I haven't done the dishes.

Oh, you haven't?

Well, then, I'm confused.

Oh, he does get sarcasm.

All right, now, remember,
the Tea Party is a grassroots movement.

We're not covered
by the lame-stream media,

so we got to reach out to
the common man individually.

Right, common man.

You know, for years
I've been sick of taking the roads home,

so today I took the yards.

Didn't hit one light.

Man, getting rid
of the government has been

the best thing to happen
around here in a long time.

That's right.

Without government
I'm free to take a lot of mescaline

and drive to Vegas.

Wait till you see
Debbie Reynolds on stage.

Yeah, and now my Spanish teacher and I

can finally hold hands in the halls.

Meg,<i> d√≥nde est√° la biblioteca?</i>

Because I'm going to bang you
in the <i>biblioteca.</i>

Well, I'm glad you're all
enjoying your freedom,

but have you taken a look
out the window lately?

What is that?

Where's all that smoke coming from?

The Pewterschmidt Industries refinery,

and it's not smoke,
it's a giant cloud of pollution.

Oh, my God.

If that gets past the bad
neighborhoods and reaches us,

that's going to be a big problem.

They can't do that. We should report them.

To who? There's no government.

Then it's up to us,
the people, to find a solution.

Close the curtains.

Ah, Tea Party.

Damn it, this is what I was
afraid was going to happen.

This town is going to go to hell.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

I'm glad we waited.

(BLEATING)

-Giraffity.
-Yeah, see, that's not mine.

Hey, Mort, what gives with the blond hair?

Yeah, you look weird like that.

Historically, in instances
of mass lawlessness,

the first thing they do
is round up the Jews.

Excuse me, fellow Aryan,
have you seen any Jews around?

Is there a reward?

Wait a minute. Are you Jewish?

I mean, uh, unashamed locker room nudity.

This guy's kosher.

Oops.

Let's get him!

<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>It's day five of the new</i>
<i>government-less Quahog,</i>

<i>and I'm wearing a T-shirt.</i>

<i>Tom, I don't think the government</i>
<i>was requiring you to wear a suit.</i>

<i>Well, they were stopping me</i>
<i>from punching you in the face.</i>

<i>Is that what you want?</i>

<i>No, you know what? You know what?</i>

<i>-Give me your wallet.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

<i>You heard me, I said give me your wallet.</i>

<i>This is a crappy wallet.</i>

<i>You have bad stuff.</i>

Oh, what the hell?

Lois, the TV went off again.

It's the electricity, Peter.

There are power lines down,
and there's no one to fix 'em.

The cops don't come,
the toilets don't flush,

and there's garbage
piling up in the streets.

Ryan Phillippe's been out there for days.

Would anyone like to be impregnated?

We had a nice town, Peter.
I had a nice life,

but you and your antigovernment buddies
ruined it.

Hey, so how's that Tea Party going, huh?

More like T.P. Party.

Toilet paper.

I don't know what happened, Brian.

Not having a government
worked great in Somalia,

but somehow we seem
to have botched it all up.

-Looks that way.
-Wait a minute.

-There might be a way out of this.
-What?

We just talk to the guy
who got us into this.

He'll know what to do.

Mr. Pewterschmidt. Mr. Pewterschmidt.

CARTER (OVER INTERCOM): <i>Go away.</i>

But, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you got to do something.

The potholes ain't getting fixed no more.

The stoplights ain't working.

Tampon commercials
no longer use blue liquids

in their demonstrations.

(ALL GROAN)

Make it blue. That's always been the deal!

You show whatever you want,
but you make it blue!

Come on. You got to help us out.

<i>Go to hell.</i>

I don't think he's going to help, Peter.

But if rich people aren't
looking out for us, who is?

Well, maybe we need
to look out for each other.

Come on, Brian.
It's time to make this right.

<i>Wait, before you go,</i>
<i>take two steps to the left.</i>

<i>Look up.</i>

<i>Okay, smile.</i>

<i>Aw, I suck.</i>

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

People of Quahog, I have something to say.

Now that we've freed ourselves
from the terrible shackles of government,

it's time to replace it
with something better.

(ALL GRUMBLING)

The first thing we need
is a system of rules

that everyone must live by.

(ALL GRUMBLING)

Got to have rules.

And since we can't spend
all our time making rules,

I think that we should elect
some people to represent us,

and they should make rules
and choices on our behalf.

(ALL MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)

Now, this may be kind of expensive,
so I got a plan.

Everyone should have to give some money

from their salaries each year.

Poor people will give
a little bit of money

and rich people will give
a larger amount of money,

and our representatives
will use all that money

to hire some people
who will then provide us

with social order and basic services.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Ugh, there's not one shirt
I wish I had out there.

Now, it won't be perfect.

Some of our representatives
may end up being bastards.

But you know what? That's okay.

'Cause later we're going to have
more elections,

and we can use those elections
to get rid of the bad guys

and replace 'em with good guys,

and then the system
will just keep going on and on

just like that.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So who's with me?

(CHEERING)

Will you join me
in trying this new crazy thing?

(CHEERING)

Then let's do it.

(CHEERING)

Yeah, and we did it all
without government.

I'm very proud of you, Peter.

Oh, Lois, that means nothing to me.

I only care what they say
on the Internet message boards.

Aw.

-Hello, I'm Brian Griffin.
-And I'm Stewie Griffin.

A few years ago, we did an
episode called <i>Viewer Mail</i>

where you, our fans, wrote in
and suggested ideas for new episodes.

Well, it's ten years later,
but you're still sending in ideas.

Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock,
we wanna let you know

we kicked around your idea,

<i>Make the Baby Go Wild</i>
for a while,

couldn't really find an angle on it.

Here's one from Lee Mills of Iowa.

Lee writes, "Dear <i>Family Guy,</i>
was your show based on anything?"

That's a great question, Lee.

In fact, <i>Family Guy</i> is based
on an American television series

called <i>The Simpsons.</i>

(CHUCKLES) Actually,<i> Family Guy,</i>
much like <i>The Office,</i>

is based on a British series
called <i>Chap of the Manor.</i>

<i>-Sorry, everyone!</i>

All right, kids, enough telly.

I hope everyone's peckish
for some boiled lamb shank.

None for me, Lydia.
I'm meeting me mates down at the pub.

Again? But Neville,
you spend all your time

down at the Fox and Pig
and Dog and Wolf and Cat

and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.

And that's where you're wrong.

The Fox and Pig and Dog

We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat

But I need you to stay and have

I found him with another fag

Oh, is that right?

So you fancy fags, do you?

Well, here. Have a whole carton of fags!

I just want a comely lass
to look upon me with favor.

I look on you with favor.
I look on all of you with favor.

Shut up, British Meg.

What a two-bit Wichita whore.

One of these days,

Ah, matricide.

<i>Good evening, Billingsbury.</i>
<i>I'm Clive Crowley.</i>

<i>Coming up, a man with a gun</i>

<i>Her Majesty, the Queen,</i>

<i>Thank you, Tricia. After the interval,</i>

<i>find out which 12 football teams</i>
<i>tied tonight.</i>

The Queen's comin' to Billingsbury?
That's bloody sweet!

You know, I'm actually
a relation of the royal family.

You most certainly are not.
Where would you get that idea?

Me mum used to claim
she was a Windsor.

And I always heard my Nana
talk about how she took a duke.

Must've been a difficult marriage, too,

'cause every afternoon
she'd be belly-achin'

about her bloody duke.

I think you just had a gross grandmother.

No, I'm quite sure of it.
And to prove it,

I'm gonna nick one of the Queen's hairs
during her visit tomorrow.

And when the DNA proves a match,
you'll see I'm royalty.

The Queen, eh?

I'd like to mash my banger
in her blood pudding.

Googity. Googity. Glop.

-Hello, lads.
-Oh, hello, Seamus.

Right fine performance
at the cricket match today.

Aye. I was spirited to have you

Yes, I know. Yes.

Very well. Time for action.

Oh, bloody hell!

All right, time for Plan B. Let's go!

I'm not going any lower.

Well, Father, you gave it a good go.

Oh, we're not done yet. Come on!

It's just a squirrel.

-BRIAN: Yeah!
-Oh, God!

(STEWIE GROANS)

He can't hurt you anymore.

Hey there, little fella.

We sure got a lovely day for it,
don't we?

Stay away from my brother's butt.

Okay, Stewie, let's get
that little face washed off.

Then you can play
with your bath toys, huh?

No, I hate getting my face washed!

Oh, look! It's just Mr. Frog!

Hello, Mr. Frog...

(SPLUTTERING)

My God, how the hell
do I keep falling for that?

Now you play with your toys
and I'll go get you a nice, fluffy towel.

Stewart Griffin, explorer, adventurer,

(STEWIE GROWLS, SCREAMS)

I'm swimming at night 'cause I'm a slut,
and now I'm paying the price for it.

(PANTING)

PETER: Hey, Stewie!

Wow, looks like you got
some cool bath toys in there.

Is it okay if I join ya?

STEWIE: No! (SCREAMS)

(PANTING)

Hey, is that my froggie butt cloth?

Okay, Stewie, bedtime's in ten minutes.
I'll be right back.

Hmm. I think I have time for a quickie.

-(WHIMPERING)
-Excuse me, Mr. Cobain.

Look, I know you're depressed.

Made some bad choices with women,
but there's another way.

H√§agen-Dazs, lots of H√§agen-Dazs.

(WHOOSHING)

Well, let's see if it worked.

Here we go.

Ha! You're still alive, you fat (BLEEP).

Okay, Stewie, time for bed.

You want Mommy to read you
a night-night story?

Oh, how 'bout this one?

STEWIE:<i> Good Night, Town from Footloose?</i>

(LOIS READING)

STEWIE: Who is this book for?

(LOIS CONTINUES READING)

(SLURRING) Hey, Lois.
I'm home from The Clam.

You know what that means.

STEWIE: You spent the last 10 minutes
parked in front of the house,

crying in your car?

Not now, Peter.
I'm doing story time with Stewie.

STEWIE: Yeah, scram, Drinky.

I got a story.

It's about the little penis that could.

It thinks it can, it thinks...

In fact, it's pretty sure it can.

It... It... It's gonna.

STEWIE: Hey, am I gonna
have to handle this?

Do you want me to handle this?

Peter, just go wait in the bedroom.
I'll be right there.

Fine, but if I gotta pee first,
this night's gonna be ruined.

Ruined.

Good night, sweetie.
Mommy loves you.

Mwah.

(STEWIE YAWNS)

(RHYTHMIC THUDDING)

STEWIE: Huh?

(BOTH GRUNTING)

It's big, isn't it?

Yes, Peter. It's very big.

Yeah, it's big.

Oh, God, yes!

Ah, yes...

Ah, yeah.

Oh, you're gonna use that thing. Good.

I love you so much.

You need someone looking out

Someone you can trust.
Give me some money!

Man, that was some pretty
impressive police work, Joe.

Thanks, Quagmire. I'll be honest,

it was nice to be acknowledged
by the chief for once.

Usually, he's just reminding me

that whatever punk
I'm roughing up ain't worth it.

You son of a bitch!

You're right.

You're not worth it.

aren't doing anything later,

That's great, Joe.

You don't seem very excited.

I mean, this is a huge deal for me.

The chief is even
throwing me a party tonight.

I don't know if I can take another
evening of sympathetic eye contact

(ALL CHEERING)

Officer Swanson, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

I'm Nora. I just joined the force.

Nice to meet you.

Wow, I've heard so much about you.
You're like a legend at the academy.

Is it true you got straight As

in Officer Henderson's
Overintensity Workshop?

You're damn right I did!

Well, you did some great work today.

And I mean regular-person great,
not just wheelchair-person great.

(SIGHING) Yeah, I guess.

You seem a little distracted.
Is everything okay?

Yeah, sorry, I was just thinking about...

someone should have come
tonight, but they didn't.

Ah, it's nothing.

That's good.

-Hey, Officer Swanson?
-Yeah?

You know how they say
never meet your heroes?

Well, they don't say anything
about kissing them.

Whoa!

Geez, every cop in town is here.

I know. Who do you think is
taking care of the city?

-No.
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

No.

No.

No.

MAN: What the hell? Come on!

No drive. Is wet.

Hey-hey, fun party last night, Joe.

You guys, I got something to tell you.

The weirdest thing happened
to me at that party.

I got kissed by this chick cop.

No way! What's she look like?
Is she hot?

Well, I don't know. Uh...

Is Elizabeth Perkins hot?

I... I, uh... I...
I don't... I don't know.

Way to go, Joe. Did you bang her?

What? Of course not, Quagmire.

I mean, I'm a married man.

I could never cheat on Bonnie.

Well, under normal circumstances,

you'd be right to say that,
but in this case,

cheating would be the only fair thing.

What? What are you talking about?

Come on. Didn't Bonnie
have that affair in Paris?

Oh, yeah. I don't want
to talk about that.

Joe, how can I put this delicately?

He used his stinky French wiener
to defile her.

Wow. That's a... Real hit above the belt.

But I'm still not sure that's
a reason to betray Bonnie.

Come on, Joe. Sleeping with
this girl will even things up.

You can't have that kind of
imbalance in your relationship.

In fact, you owe it to Bonnie
to have sex with this woman.

It's for the good of your marriage.

Yeah, you should go for it, Joe.

Secrets are what keep a marriage fresh.

I have a CB radio in the basement.

I go down there a couple times
a week to have CB sex.

Lois has no idea.

Breaker breaker one-nine. What's your 20?

(WOMAN SPEAKS
IN GARBLED, STATICKY VOICE)

Ah, it's so hot
just knowing you're in a truck.

Good morning, Officer Swanson.

Oh, hey... Nora.

-Uh, listen, I...
-It's okay, Joe.

You don't need to explain.

I stepped over the line
at the bar last night.

I'm... I'm sorry.

It's not that I don't find you attractive.

I do. I just...

-I'm married and...
-I get it.

I totally understand, Joe.

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Excuse me.

-Hello?
-BONNIE: <i>Joe?</i>

-Bonnie?
-<i>Oh.</i>

<i>I... I meant to call someone else.</i>

-Oh.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

So, how is everything?

<i>have that affair in Paris?</i>

<i>Hey, let's mess with him.</i>

<i>I'm going to leave a fart trapped in here.</i>
(PASSES GAS)

(PETER AND GLENN LAUGHING)

PETER: <i>All right, let's get out of here.</i>

(RAPID FOOTSTEPS,
CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

I want you.

I want you, too.

Come on.

I have a little place we can go to.

NORA: Wow. I've never seen a sofa
in a bathroom stall before.

JOE: Well, I'm the only one
who comes in here,

so I figured I'd make it my own.

How are you enjoying your steak?

NORA: Mmm. It's delicious.

JOE: Let me put another log on the fire.

(FLAME WHOOSHING AND CRACKLING)

Thanks, Joe.
It was getting a little chilly in here.

JOE: That's 'cause you're
all the way over there.

NORA: Well, let me fix that.

(KISSING)

-Oh, Joe.
-Oh, Nora.

NORA: Did you bring protection?

JOE: Oh, don't worry.
Nothing comes out of the front.

What a great day for Joe and Bonnie.

This is Kevin's first birthday
since he came home from Iraq.

Why does Kevin always sit
at the bus stop,

but never gets on a bus?

Please don't bring that up.

Don't bring anything he does up.

Hey, you guys.

You're right on time.

Kevin just woke up screaming
from his afternoon nap.

Mom, it's my birthday,
and you invited your friends.

All yours are dead!

Hey, guys.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

I did something terrible.

Ah, hey, we've all done terrible things.

Attention, everyone.
The plane is sinking, so I need you all

to proceed onto the floating slide.

PETER: <i>Dear airplane people,</i>
<i>I owe you one floating slide.</i>

<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>the guy stewardess</i>

<i>was angry gay, not happy gay.</i>

-What does it say?
-Nothing.

Just instructions and stuff.

Oh, my God. You actually
went through with it? How was it?

I don't know, you guys.
I thought I would feel better

after I slept with Nora, but I don't.

I just feel really guilty.

And I'm not mad at Bonnie anymore.
I'm just mad at myself.

Guys, am I the only one
who thinks it's weird

talking about Joe cheating on Bonnie
in front of their baby?

BABY: (THINKING IN PATRICK STEWART'S
VOICE) <i>I think we can all benefit</i>

<i>from a little strange now and then.</i>

<i>I know I will.</i>

Uh-oh.

-The baby monitor.
-Wha...

The baby monitor.

You cheated on me?

I... I, uh...

You bastard!

Bonnie, please.

After all I do for you,
this is how you repay me?

Well, how do you think
I felt when I found out

you slept with that French guy, huh?

I never slept with Francois.

What? But Peter said...

Lois, didn't you say
that Bonnie slept with him?

No, Peter. I said she wanted to.

Damn it, Peter!

Now, hold on.
In my defense, it is my experience

that I am generally correct
about most things.

Uh, you know what, it doesn't matter.

Bonnie's been driving me away
for some time now.

What? Driving you away?

Do you have any idea
how hard it is living with you?

They still have one of those TVs
with the big, fat back.

Maybe we should all leave.

-No!
-No! Everyone stays.

I want this to be a disaster.
'Cause this has been a long time coming.

You care about nothing except yourself.

You son of a bitch.

I got a license to operate
a sex crane for you.

And I got earplugs
so I could put up with that...

(IMITATING BONNIE'S VOICE)
Horrible voice of yours.

I'm not an impressionist,
but you get the idea.

I perform purification rituals
on my body after we have sex.

I find it cleanses
the immeasurable sadness

of having lain with a wretch.

I want a divorce!

You got it!

Sorry. I opened some of the gifts.

Does the Swanson divorce mean that I
have to go live with Grandma and Grandpa?

No, Chris, it does not.
That doesn't even make any sense.

Peter, I can't believe
you would encourage Joe to have an affair.

Look, Lois, it's in the Bible.

What's in the Bible?

I... I don't know.

Doesn't that always cover it somehow?

Peter, you blew up their marriage.

This was a huge mistake.

Well, we've all made mistakes.

Eh.

(STEWIE SCREAMING)

Why did the sign say "not an exit?"

It should have just said "gorilla door."

(SCREAMING)

So, it's really over, huh?

After all these years?

I'm afraid so.

But let's be honest, Peter.
Bonnie and I seem to have grown apart.

Boy, I never would have seen
this day coming when we first met.

<i>Africa</i> by Toto was playing.

<i>(AFRICA</i> PLAYING)

<i>I hear the drums echoing tonight</i>

<i>But she hears only whispers</i>

<i>Of some quiet conversation</i>

<i>I stopped an old man along the way</i>

<i>Hoping to find some long forgotten words</i>

<i>Or ancient melodies</i>

<i>He turned to me as if to say</i>

<i>‚ô™"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"</i>

<i>It's gonna take a lot</i>
<i>to drag me away from you</i>

<i>There's nothing that a hundred men</i>
<i>or more could ever do</i>

<i>I bless the rains down in Africa</i>

<i>Gonna take some time</i>
<i>to do the things we never had</i>

<i>Ooh, ooh...</i>

Lois, I know how to get
Joe and Bonnie back together.

Joe just told me
how he and Bonnie met.

So I figure, all we got to do
is find a way

to recreate the magic of that night.

Well, we better do something soon,

'cause I just talked to Bonnie
and she's already on D-Date.

What the hell's D-Date?

Diarrhea Date. It's filthy.

But she found someone,

and they're doing whatever
they do tomorrow.

What the hell's wrong with people?

Thanks for inviting me to lunch, Lois,
but why are we eating at a strip club?

I know the waitress here
from water aerobics.

She said she'd give us 20% off.

All units, all units.

<i>We have a disturbance</i>
<i>at the Fuzzy Clam.</i>

This is Officer Swanson.
What's the problem?

<i>Well, one of the dancers</i>
<i>was dancing with a guy</i>

<i>and saying, "You're my favorite,</i>
<i>you're my favorite,"</i>

<i>but now she's dancing with another guy.</i>

That's not a crime.

<i>Well, shouldn't it be?</i>

I'll be right there.

(SIREN WHOOPING)

<i>(AFRICA</i> PLAYING)

Boy, I haven't heard
this song in a long time.

Police! What's going on?

Bonnie?

Joe?

What are you doing here?

I'm here with Lois.
What are you doing here?

I got a call.

Is that... Is that <i>Africa </i>by Toto?

Yeah.

That's our song.

It is.

<i>But she hears only whispers</i>
<i>of some quiet...</i>

Well, it seems like things are fine here.

Listen, Bonnie, I, uh...

I just want to say I'm sorry.

I was a real ass, and I miss you.

I'm sorry, too.

I know I haven't been
that easy to live with lately.

Okay.

Well, I'm gonna go now.

Joe, wait.

You want a lap dance, mister?

-No. Sit down. I'm giving you one.
-(SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

<i>The wild dogs cry out in the night</i>

<i>As they grow restless</i>

Oh, Joe.

Oh, Bonnie.

Can you ever forgive me?

It's gonna take some time, Joe.
