① What lies behind the picture is clear: a culture of one nation may become international, which is not only necessary but also indispensable. ② In other words, a nation's unique culture can become international through worldwide economic and cultural exchanges.③ According to an international survey, attracted by Chinese traditional culture, about 90 million foreigners come and visit China every year. As a result, the Chinese traditional culture is well integrated with the international culture.④ Were there no such cultural exchanges, nations would make much less progress through learning from each other.

① In my point of view, traditional culture is the most cherished thing of a nation. ② Therefore, national culture as a kind of priceless spiritual treasure should be preserved and cherished.③ Meanwhile, there are good reasons to advocate international culture because different cultures can provide a different perspective for us to observe the world in the long run.④ Nevertheless, when we are confronted with a different culture, we should be sensible enough to absorb its essence and neglect the drawbacks. ⑤ Only in this way can we promote cultural development positively and make our world more colorful and vigorous.

① What lies behind the picture, or “buried“ in the hotpot is clear: cultural integration has become a popular trend in China. (2) However, is this phenomenon a blessing or a curse?③ Admittedly, some citizens argue that cultural integration may result in the ignorance of our traditional culture and customs. ④ However, most people argue that multi-cultures, as part of humankind,s spiritual heritage, are a powerful way of bringing diverse peoples together, which has become indispensable as a means of promoting further culture development and maintenance.⑤ Were there no cultural integration, we may never live in such a colorful world. However, if we over-emphasize foreign cultures, our traditional cultures such as kung-fu or Peking opera might be ignored and then fade.

On the earth exist several islands, which are so pretty
that plenty of tourists come and visit them. However, because of various inappropriate behaviors of the tourists, these islands have become trash-littered with no tourists visiting.③ According to one latest survey conducted by a certain international authority, the average damage caused by inappropriate behaviors of tourists has reached as much as 1 billion dollars a year, which can help thousands of students from poor families finish their studies.④ Were the situation to continue, we would pay a heavy price.

① Recently, it often hits the headlines of the newspapers that an increasing number of graduates know nothing about knowledge outside their majors, which is really common in daily life. ② As is shown in the cartoon, in front of the poster of a campus lecture stand two college students, facing the same lecture but making different decisions. (3) The left student says indifferently, ςtUseless, it has nothing to do with our major.^^ ④ By contrast, the other student says with great interest, ςςUseful, if we listen to it."⑤ The implication of the cartoon is not only informative, but instructive as well.

① Actually, the author leads us to find the reasons why college students have different attitudes. (2) Students, views might vary about whether it is necessary to learn knowledge outside their majors.③ On one hand, some students might hold the view that they are likely to get higher scores via concentrating on their own majors, which may bring them better job opportunities.④ On the other hand, students who back up the ideas of the student on the right are not among the minority.⑤ They
believe that mastering more knowledge and stepping out of the comfort zone will facilitate the comprehensive development of their future career.

① It is high time that we took effective and efficient measures to help college students establish a correct view of study.② On the macro level, society should take the responsibility to advocate enterprising and innovative spirit and encourage the young generation to broaden their horizons.③ On the micro level, we ourselves should enhance the consciousness of lifelong learning and think out of the box.④ With comprehensive analysis after seeing, touching and experiencing every aspect, it is reasonable for us to expect the comprehensive development of the future career.

① Undoubtedly, the chart is to remind us that due attention should be paid to the importance of healthy life, especially regular physical exercise, no matter what form it takes. ② To be specific, a large proportion of citizens would like to exercise alone and enjoy their own leisure time. (3) By contrast, the rest prefer to spend their exercise time with others. ④ On the one hand, with the development of economy and the improvement of living standard, modem people pay more attention to health instead of simply indulging themselves in food and entertainment. (5) On the other hand, an increasing number of corporations encourage their staff to work overtime. @ As a consequence, worse health condition caused by great pressure and overwork makes young people gradually realize the importance of physical health.⑦ Nowadays, exercising in different ways is becoming a new fashion.

A Report on the Series Activities of “Empty Plate"
This report aims to make a brief review about the 4ςEmpty Plate“ activity last month.
The survey was conducted from freshmen to senior in Nanjing University by means of a questionnaire about the campus cafeteria both before and after the Empty Plate Activity.
From the data, the most significant items are as follows. To begin with, most of the departments have already held several different activities relating to this issue. In addition, hardly can we see any misbehavior on campus. For example, in cafeteria, few food is left in the plates and dumped into the trashcan since the beginning of this activity.
To sum up, we can safely draw a conclusion that this activity is successful until now.
Yours,
Li Ming
