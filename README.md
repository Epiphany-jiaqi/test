[��The outbreak��]

[��� of swine flu��]

[�� that was first detected��]

[����� in Mexico��]

[�����was declared��]

[����� a global epidemic��]

[������� on June 11, 2009.��]

[��]

[��It is��]

[�����the first worldwide epidemic��]

[����designated��]

[������by the World Health Organization��]

[����� in 41 years.��]

[��]

[��The heightened alert��]

[����followed an emergency meeting��]

[����� with flu experts��]

[������ in Geneva��]

[������that��]

[���assembled��]

[����after a sharp rise��]

[������in cases��]

[����� in Australia,��]

[���and rising numbers��]

[��� in Britain,��]

[�����Japan,��]

[������Chile��]

[����� and elsewhere.��]

[��But the epidemic��]

[���is "moderate "��]

[����� in severity,��]

[�������according��]

[������to Margaret Chan,��]

[�������the organization's��]

[������� director general,��]

[�������� with the overwhelming majority��]

[������of patients��]

[�������experiencing��]

[��������only mild symptoms��]

[������and a full recovery,��]

[�������often in the absence��]

[������� of any medical treatment.��]

[��The outbreak��]

[���came��]

[��� to global notice��]

[����in late April 2009,��]

[���when Mexican authorities��]

[�� noted an unusually large number��]

[����� of hospitalizations and deaths��]

[������� among healthy adults.��]

[��]

[��As much��]

[��� of Mexico City��]

[����shut down at the height��]

[������of a panic,��]

[���cases��]

[����began to crop up��]

[����� in New York City,��]

[���the southwestem United States��]

[����� and��]

[������ around the world.��]
