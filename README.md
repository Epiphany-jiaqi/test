<i>Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes</i>
<i>in Greg's jacket.</i>

<i>-Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?</i>
<i>-No, Dad.</i>

<i>He's lying. There's no doubt about that.</i>

<i>Greg, I'm afraid your punishment</i>
<i>will be four hours in the snakepit.</i>

<i>That'll give you time to think about</i>
<i>what you did.</i>

<i>Man!</i>

<i>That'll teach him.</i>

<i>Jan, I'm afraid you've earned</i>
<i>a day in the fire chamber...</i>

<i>...for tattling on your brother.</i>

Smoking. How does
a boy like that go so wrong?

-They live in a crummy neighborhood.
-The Bradys?

Yeah. They got robbers, thugs,
drug dealers. You name it.

You folks want some pancakes?

PETER: No, thanks. See, that's the worst
we got is Jemima's Witnesses.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin.
Can I please get collagen injections?

Meg, you don't need to change
the way you look.

You know, most of the world's problems
stem from poor self-image.

[Polka music playing in gym]

[Man and women laughing]

[Growling]

Excellent! The mind-control device
is nearing completion!

LOIS: Stewie, I said no toys at the table.

Damn you, vile woman!

You've impeded my work since the day
I escaped from your wretched womb.

Don't pout, honey. When you were born...

...the doctor said you were
the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.

But, of course. That was my victory day.
The fruition of my deeply-laid plans...

...to escape from that cursed ovarian
bastille! Return the device, woman!

No toys, Stewie.

Very well, then.

Mark my words, when you least expect it,
your uppance will come!

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Mom, can I turn the heat up?

Don't touch the thermostat, Meg.
Your father gets upset.

Come on. This thing goes up to 90.

Who touched the thermostat?

God, how does he always know?

Brain implant, Meg.
Every father's got one.

Tells you when the kids mess
with the dial.

GUY: My thing went off!
Your thermostat okay?

-Yeah, it's all right.
-Is my kid over here?

Forget it! False alarm!

BRIAN: Ass ahoy.

Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got
your pants on. What's the occasion?

He's going to a stag party.

Lois, I work hard all week
to provide for this family.

I am the man of the house.

As the man, I order you
to give me permission to go to this party.

Look, at least promise me you won't drink.
Alcohol always leads to trouble.

Come on. You're worrying about nothing.

Remember when you got drunk
off the Communion wine at church?

And so the Lord God smote poor Job...

...with festering boils all over his body.

Man, I hate it when he tells this story.

PRIEST: Yet, miraculously,
Job was still able to retain his dignity.

-Is that really the blood of Christ?
-Yes.

Man, that guy must've been wasted
24 hours a day.

And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

Butter Rum's my favorite.

Remember you had an Irish coffee
the day we went to see <i>Philadelphia</i>?

[Audience crying]

I got it. That's the guy from <i>Big</i>.
Tom Hanks, that's it.

Funny guy, Tom Hanks.
Everything he says is a stitch.

<i>I have AIDS.</i>

-Promise me, Peter.
-Lois, honey, I promise.

Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch
these lips tonight.

Who wants to play Drink The Beer?

Right here.

-You win.
-All right. What do I win?

Another beer!

I'm going for the high score!

Actually, Charlie's got the high score.

Man. Your clock won't flush.

I feel kind of bad, guys.
I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.

-Don't feel bad, Peter.
-Gee. I never thought of it like that.

Did you bring the porno?

Did I bring the porno?
You're gonna love it. It's a classic.

<i>Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out...</i>

<i>...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.</i>
<i>Not today or tomorrow.</i>

RICK: <i>But soon,</i>

Come on, Ilsa! Get on it!

[Funky music on TV]

NARRATOR:
<i>The statue was a gift from France.</i>

What is this?

Man. My kid must've taped
over this for history class.

[Groans]

The Statue of Liberty?
What are we gonna do?

-Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.
-That's just crazy enough to work.

Meg, finish your pancakes.

-Chris, elbows off your father.
-Thanks, son.

37 beers. You're setting
a great example for the kids, Peter.

Yeah. A new family record.
Way to raise the bar, Dad.

Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.

Kids, Daddy only drank
so the Statue of Liberty...

...would take her clothes off.

-What did you promise me last night?
-I wouldn't drink at the stag party.

-And what did you do?
-Drank at the stag....

I almost walked right into that one. God!

Feels like accountants
are cranking adding machines in my head.

[Machines whirring]

Dick, you ever wonder
what's outside those walls?

That's dangerous thinking, Paul.
You best stick to your work.

Okay.

You see, Peter?
A hangover is nature's way

of telling you I was right. I mean....

MEG: Mom, are you all right?

LOIS: My goodness. This chair leg
was loose. Isn't that silly?

I could've broken my neck.

Damn!

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Honey. I took a cab home,
I slept on the table...

...so I wouldn't wake you up.
Nothing bad happened.

I guess you're right.

Apology accepted.
All right, I'm going to work.

Somebody's gotta put food on this table.

How are you coming, Johnson?

Mr. Weed, I've been working
on the new G.I. Jew line.

And as you can see, they look great.

<i>You call these bagels?</i>

I'm glad he's on our side!

[Snoring]

MR. WEED: Peter!
PETER: What?

Are you sleeping on the job?

No. There's a bug in my eye
and I'm trying to suffocate him.

Peter, I like you. But I need you to be
more than just eye candy around here.

It's your job to watch for toys
that could be hazardous to kids.

-Now, look sharp!
-Yes, sir!

[Snoring]

[Foreboding instrumental music]

And now back to <i>Action News 5</i>.
Our top story tonight, "When Toys Attack."

Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.

Quite a situation we've got here, Tom,
indeed, Diane.

The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company
of Quahog, Rhode Island...

...has released highly unsafe
products into the retail market.

Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball!

Boy! A Pound Poochie!

Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.

Peter, I'm appalled.

Your negligence has damaged
this company's reputation.

You're fired!

Jeez. For how long?

[Sad instrumental music]

My God! You got fired?

-Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
-How do you know about the machine?

PETER: Don't worry.
I'll still put food on this table.

Just not as much.
So it might get a little competitive.

Who cares about food? Now we'll never
be able to afford my lip injections!

BRIAN: Can we put her
out in the yard for a while?

LOIS: Okay, who's hungry?

Jeez. How the hell
am I gonna break this to Lois?

If she finds out I got fired for drinking,
she's gonna blame me!

DEVIL: Lie to her. It's okay to
lie to women. They're not people like us.

I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy?

[Cars honking]

Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.

This is perfect!

Look, I don't want your mom to worry,
all right?

When she worries, she says,
"I told you so" and:

"Stop doing that. I'm asleep."
So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?

Not a word to your mom
about me getting canned.

LOIS: What's that, Peter?

-Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
-What?

Meg, honey, can you pass
the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?

LOIS: Peter, are you feeling okay?

I feel great! I haven't
got a job in the world.

All right, then let's eat.

I know you all hate eggplant, but....

What on earth was that?

What the deuce are you staring at?
It's tuna fish...

...and nothing else.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

How's your job search going?

It sucks, Brian. I've already
been through two jobs this week.

I got fired off of that commercial.

DIRECTOR: Try it again.
PETER: "I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs."

DIRECTOR: No, damn it! Take 26!

Then I had that job as the sneeze guard
for that restaurant's salad bar.

Take it outside, lady.

I thought I could win money
in that talent show.

EMCEE: <i>And the prize goes</i>
<i>to The von Trapp Family Singers!</i>

That is bull....

[Loud applause]

Peter, I know it's a
dangerous precedent...

...but you might want to tell
Lois the truth.

What? That I can't provide for my family?
That she's always right?

That I didn't stand up to a tank
in Tiananmen Square?

Screw this!
I just came over to buy some fireworks!

You can't keep lying to her
about losing your job.

Eventually, she'll find out
where you're going every day.

Yeah.

[Bells and music on TV]

Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll tell her tonight.

[Crickets chirping]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Mellow instrumental music]

Victory is mine!

LOIS: I'll need the checkbook
in the morning.

I'm going to Stop 'N Shop
for some sweet corn.

You're spending money on food again?

Lois, we just had dinner.

I enjoyed it so much,
I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.

Since when are you so concerned
about our food budget?

I just....

Lois, this is really hard
for me to say, but....

What is it, Peter?

-You're getting kind of fat.
-What?

It's just.... It's not healthy.

Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape
three times a week.

When was the last time you saw your toes?

I thought you people were
supposed to be jolly.

Peter, what the hell is the
matter with you?

Honey, if there's something wrong,
you can tell me.

-Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss?
-Thank God you're here. What do I do?

Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.

I don't know.

Where's the other guy?

[Cars honking]

This is unbelievable!

I promise you, everything's fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

STEWIE: Well, well, Mother!
We meet again!

Stewie, I thought
I tucked you in an hour ago.

Not tightly enough it would seem.
And now you contemptible harpy...

...I shall end your reign
of matriarchal tyranny.

LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey.

Right now it's bedtime.

Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!

PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo.

You have the power to end this!

How'd she take it?

I told her she was fat.

No.

I hate lying to Lois. It's just....

It's the best way to keep
her from the truth.

You have no choice.
Your unemployment will dry up soon.

She'll probably sense something's amiss
when they repossess your house.

You really oughta think
of your family's welfare.

Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

Okay, do you have any disabilities,
past injuries, physical anomalies?

I didn't have gas
for the first time until I was 30.

[Breaks wind]

What the hell was that?

PETER: Guys, our money problems are over!
We're officially on welfare.

Come on, help me scatter car parts
on the front lawn.

How much are we getting?

Let's see. $150 a week.

Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.

[Uplifting instrumental music]

Whoops.

No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.

I was giving a piano lesson.

Stewie, why don't you play
in the other room?

Why don't you burn in hell?

No dessert for you, young man.

Who would've thought getting drunk
would get me...

...$150,000 a week from the government?

This is why I don't vote.

Maybe somebody down there
was drinking, too.

Mr. President, why do you think
the public supports you...

...during these impeachment proceedings?

Probably because you're so fat.

Peter, you might want to call
the Welfare Commission.

That check is obviously an oversight.

Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like
their one millionth customer.

BRIAN: What?
You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?

-Yeah.
-On what?

LOIS: Oh, my God!
Peter, you bought the statue of David?

No. I just rented it.
But they're gonna be ticked.

The penis broke off
while I was loading it into the car.

I shall call you "Eduardo."

Peter, how can we afford this?

You won't believe it, Mom!
Dad's getting--

A big raise!

Peter, that's wonderful!

But, Dad, I thought--

The kind of raise that'll allow me
to give my kids a big allowance...

...just for keeping their big mouths shut.
Come on, guys.

I'll buy us
the most expensive meal we've ever had.

Yeah. I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas,
please.

CLERK: <i>I beg your pardon?</i>

6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas.

And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.

Peter, what's the big surprise?

You know how I always said
you should be treated like a queen?

I got you your own jester.

JESTER: Good to be here in New England.

And what's the deal
with "New" England anyway?

It's over 200 years old!
Last time I checked, that's not that new.

This is great.

I can finally afford to give my little
girl the lips she's always dreamed of.

MEG: Thank you, Daddy!

[Kisses Peter]

I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing.

But did you have to buy
breast implants for Chris?

It makes him happy.

These are cool.

MAILWOMAN: When did you get a pool?

It's a moat.

I know it's silly...

...but my husband thinks our family
needs extra protection now that...

...we're rich.

Does it work?

It does keep the Black Knight at bay.

[Horse sputtering]

Congratulations in all your success.
Here's your welfare check.

What the....

[Foghorn blowing]

Hi, honey.

What?

PETER: I know what I did was wrong.
But I only did it for you and the kids.

Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
That was for Peter.

Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
I am so mad I can't see straight.

No problem.
We got money to get that fixed...

...with enough left for us
to buy our way

out of any trouble our kids
might get into.

Just like the Kennedys.

LOIS: I feel like I don't
even know you anymore, Peter.

The man I married would never think
he could fix a problem...

...just by spending money!

Boy, she's pretty pissed.

Who thought fraud
would be one of her buttons?

Why have a jukebox
in the john if your wife's mad at you?

Peter, you may have to return
that money to the taxpayers.

But I gotta make sure
Lois knows I'm doing it.

I need an event with thousands of people.

Something that everybody cares about.

We might have to leave
Rhode Island for this.

ANNOUNCER: <i>The air is electric here</i>
<i>at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!</i>

Pat, it's safe to say that all
these fans came out here...

...to watch a game of football!

John, we're in commercial.

Yeah, I know.
I'm just making conversation. Come on.

Football!

Amazing. You can barely drive a car.
Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?

Yeah, America's great, isn't it?
Except for the South.

Boy, I hope Lois is watching.

Okay, taxpayers, here you go!

PAT: <i>Looks like we're getting some rain</i>
<i>here tonight, John.</i>

Yeah. Hey, wait a second!
This is no ordinary rain!

It's some kind of crazy money rain!

I'm being told it's a man and his dog
throwing cash out of a blimp.

Man. I hope this works. Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to start dropping these.

[People cheering]

JOHN: <i>The crowd is storming the field!</i>
<i>This is pandemonium!</i>

Have you ever seen anything like this,
Pat?

Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl.
This is the old "trying to make amends...

"...for spending $150,000 a week
in misappropriated welfare funds" play.

I don't care what it is! That guy's
ruining a perfectly good game of football!

-Madden to Fox Security.
-Go ahead.

JOHN: <i>Take them down!</i>
GUARD: Yes, sir.

How was your shower?

I tell you, all of the rumors
about dropping the soap are true.

Really?

You can't hold onto that thing
to save your life.

It was slipping everywhere.
Guys were laughing.

GUY: There's the guy
that couldn't hold the soap.

That was classic.

Boy. I really let Lois down this time.

Do you think she'll wait for me?

If every woman dumped her husband...

...for crashing a blimp,
no one would be married.

Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I got the top bunk.

My collagen is wearing off.

Honey, sagging lips are
just nature's way...

...of telling you you shouldn't
cover for your father's lie.

What does it mean when your armpits
cry stinky tears?

It means you're becoming a man.

But hopefully not the kind who stays out
all day and doesn't call...

...like your father
who shall remain nameless.

STEWIE: Hello, Mother.
LOIS: Hi there, sweetie.

You know, Mother,
life is like a box of chocolates.

You never know what you're going to get.

Your life, however,
is more like a box of active grenades!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

STEWIE: Now, I offer one last
chance for deliverance.

Return my mind-control device
or be destroyed.

You just want your toy back.

Okay, here you go, honey.

Yes.... Well, victory is mine!

[Explosion]

STEWIE: Damn you all!

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Oh, my God!

Lois, am I glad to see you.

I have nothing to say to you, Peter.

I gave the money back.
Why are you still steamed?

Peter, you lied to me,
you betrayed my trust.

Compared to that,
welfare fraud doesn't even matter.

Really? Let's hope the judge
feels that way.

This court will come to order.

I figured the sooner I cashed the check...

...the sooner they'd catch their mistake.

Why are we making a federal case
out of this?

Don't you think you should
have alerted the government...

...of such a gross overpayment?

I was gonna call them.
But my favorite episode...

...of <i>Different Strokes</i> was on.
The one where Arnold and Dudley...

...get sexually molested
by the bike shop owner?

All right. Now I want you boys
to scream real loud at my ass.

And everybody learns a valuable lesson.

Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?

Yes. Stay the hell away
from that bike shop.

[People murmuring]

Okay, everybody, I feel really bad
about what I did. I just....

I don't know. I saw the one chance...

...I'd ever have to give my family
the things they deserve.

I guess I screwed it up.
I cheated the government.

And worst of all, I lied to my wife.

<i>And she deserves better.</i>

I'm sorry, honey.

Mr. Griffin, I think your words
have touched us all.

I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.

No!

-No!
-No!

No!

Yeah!

[Rock music]

[Rock music stops abruptly]

LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor?
JUDGE: Yes?

Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times.

He may even be downright stupid.

<i>But I know he only accepted that money...</i>

<i>...because he wanted to be</i>
<i>a good husband and father.</i>

But what he needs to remember
is that we love him.

And no matter what,
I'll always stand by him.

I love you too, honey.

That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin.
Okay, you can go to jail with him!

What?

24 months in prison? Unacceptable!
Intolerable as it may be...

...I'm completely dependent upon
those wretched drones for sustenance.

Let us see how the constitution
of American justice fares...

...against the device!

[Device pulsates]

Is that your boy?

What? Yeah. That's Stewie.

Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young
from his father. It's unjudgmenly.

-Hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
-Yeah.

-All right. You're free.
-Wow! Can you give me my job back?

No.

-Yes.
-All right!

[Cheery instrumental music]

[Man laughing on TV]

ED: <i>That was a crazy one, Dick.</i>

DICK: <i>It sure was. In this next blooper </i>
<i>from</i> Joanie Loves Chachi<i>...</i>

<i>...watch what happens when Scott Baio</i>
<i>tries to say:</i>

<i>"She sells seashells </i>
<i>down by the seashore."</i>

What does your mom do?

She sells seashells down by the....

That is kind of a tongue twister.

It's good to have you home, Peter.

Honey, I knew everything
would turn out okay.

I sure am gonna miss being rich.

PETER: Don't worry.
I got a way to get money.

Not another welfare scam?

No. Minority scholarship.

[Giggles]

[Jazzy instrumental music]

LOIS AND BRIAN: No.
STEWIE: Are you insane?

Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.

[Giggles]

BRIAN: No.
LOIS: Don't think so.

STEWIE: Absolutely outrageous.

Okay, disability claim.

You can't leave the table
until you finish your vegetables.

Then I shall sit here until
one of us expires.

You've got a good 40 years on me, woman!

Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good
for you. Now open up for the airplane.

[Makes airplane noise]

Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you!
And damn the Wright Brothers!

My, aren't we fussy tonight.
Okay. No broccoli.

Very well then. I--

Who the hell do you think you are?

Honey, it's not gonna go away
just because you don't like it.

Well, then. My goal becomes clear.
The broccoli must die.

[Sinister instrumental music]

Mom, will you take me out
to practice driving?

I'm teaching a piano lesson
in half an hour.

Maybe your father can take you.

Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you.
But Daddy also loves <i>Star Trek</i>.

And, in all fairness,
Star Trek was here first.

KIRK: <i>Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7.</i>

<i>The Enterprise has just discovered</i>
<i>a strange new planet...</i>

<i>...in the Gamma Faloppia star system.</i>
<i>Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.</i>

LOIS: For God's sake, Peter.

You've been in front of the TV
since you got home from work.

Why don't you spend some time
with your family?

I will, during the commercials.

And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing
the point of having commercials.

[Sighs]

Please. My road test is tomorrow
and you haven't taught me anything.

You may want to find
a better teacher than Peter.

What are you talking about?
I'm a great driver.

Remember your trip to the Southwest?

[Road Runner meep-meeping]

-Jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich?
-No.

-Are you sure?
-He's fine. Keep going.

Don't believe that.
I always keep my eyes on the road.

PETER: I don't miss a thing.
TV: <i>We now return to</i> Star Trek<i>.</i>

Holy crap. Uhura's black?

All right, Meg.
Now here's your first lesson.

You always want to be aware
of other cars on the road.

If you catch eyes with the guy next to you
at a red light, you gotta race him.

-This guy's asking for it.
-But Dad....

I don't make the rules, honey.
Now rev your engine twice.

Okay.

[Engine revving twice]

[Horse sputtering twice]

Go!

[Fast-paced instrumental music]

[Screaming]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

PETER: You forgot to flip him off.
But other than that, nice job.

You're back already?
That wasn't much of a lesson.

I didn't want to overload her
on her first time out.

Besides <i>CHiPs</i> is about to start.

So let's sit back and get lost in a world
of California Highway Patrol fantasy!

[Police siren]

[Funky instrumental music]

-What's the charge, Officer?
-Driving without my phone number.

[Gunshots firing]

Or maybe I should arrest you
for being too beautiful.

[Teeth sparkling]

So, broccoli, Mother says
you're very good for me.

I'm afraid I'm no good for you!
The first rule of war is know thine enemy.

And I know this! Cold kills broccoli!
It's so simple.

<i>All I need to do is build a machine</i>
<i>to control the global environment.</i>

Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles
of genius with a chance of doom!

[Sinister instrumental music]

PETER: This is taking forever!

Come on. Let's go. Fox is running
one of those new reality shows at 8:00.

<i>Fast Animals, Slow Children</i>.

[African instrumental music]

<i>Come on, guys. Wait up.</i>

[African music continues]

<i>Dang. I got honey all over my legs.</i>

Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life
depends on getting my license.

If I can't drive, I'll never have
a boyfriend, never get married...

...and then I'll have to adopt a kid
like Rosie O'Donnell.

Are you implying
that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?

I'm so nervous.

You're gonna do great.
Remember everything I taught you.

-Let's start by going down Main Street.
-Okay.

[Engine revving twice]

[Police siren]

-What are you doing?
-I'm driving.

[Screaming]

Are you gonna mark me down
for not flipping him off?

God, my life is over.
I am the biggest loser I know!

I know how you feel, pumpkin.
I've had my share of disappointments, too.

DOCTOR: It's a girl!

Can you check again?

You just have to remember that life
has its little ups and.... Jeez!

We're gonna miss the beginning
of my show. There it is.

MEG: Dad, watch out!

[Horn blaring]

PETER: Meg, honey, are you okay?
MEG: Yeah, I think so.

PETER: The Quahog
Cable Television Transmitter.

[Citizens grumbling]

You just knocked out cable TV
for the whole town!

Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot!

Whoa. This isn't about me.
This is about you.

At least I bought us some time.

-She did it.
-What? Dad, you were the one driving!

I was teaching her to drive
and she lost control of the car.

Come on, we all did stupid stuff
when we were kids, right?

I remember when I tried
to sneak into an R-rated movie.

-Come on. Give the kid a break, huh?
-Why should we?

She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.

[Murmuring]

GUY: Poor kid.
MAN: What a senseless war.

I can't believe you just sold out
your own daughter.

I know what I did was wrong. And I know

it's not the first time
I've embarrassed you.

And if you add the measure of the angles
of a right triangle, the sum--

Meg, clean out the shower
the next time you shave your legs.

It's like a carpet in there.

I hate to see you so upset.

I know. Let's play a little game
called Taking the Fall for Daddy.

If you win, I'll buy you a convertible
when you get your license.

Really? Daddy! Now I love you again!

You're gonna make
some Jewish guy a great wife.

[Metallic clanking]

Because of an accident
at the Quahog Cable Company...

...television transmission will be out
for an undetermined amount of time.

Of course, no one can see
this news program...

...so it doesn't really matter
what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.

Think I'll go get drunk and
beat up midgets. How about you?

Tom, I just plain don't like black people.

You guys, we're still on in Boston.

Excellent.
The weather machine is nearly completed.

What do you say to that, broccoli?

Stop mocking me! What's this?

<i>It appears the witless provider</i>
<i>has finally brought me something of value.</i>

I can use that crude device
to amplify my deadly signal.

Victory shall yet be mine.

Guess what, Mom?

Dad crashed the car
into the city cable transmitter.

-What?
-It's okay.

If I take the blame, he'll buy me
a convertible when I get my license.

Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame
if you go around telling everyone.

Peter, you're bribing your daughter
with a car?

Come on, Lois.

Isn't "bribe" just another
word for "love"?

You wanted me and Meg to bond.

That's what we're doing.

CHRIS: Dad, I was in a chat room
on America Online...

...and Doomie 22 told me
some idiot knocked out the cable.

We could be without TV for weeks!

Now, Chris, now let's not panic.
We can manage just fine without TV.

[Brian scoffs]

-What's that supposed to mean?
-Face it, you're addicted to television.

You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey.
Remember when you gave up candy?

I'll ask you one more time.
You didn't eat anything in my factory?

No.

-I'm just asking--
-Are you calling me a liar?

-I'm just saying--
-Shut up, Wonka.

Yeah. That was different. I'll be fine.

-Are you sure, honey?
-For God's sake, you guys.

You think I'm some simp who can't live
without TV? Give me a break.

What's happening now?

Sipowicz is finding who
stabbed the super.

<i>Are you gonna tell me,</i>
<i>or am I gonna have to show you my ass?</i>

<i>I ain't saying nothing!</i>
<i>All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!</i>

Forget it, Mike.

Without actually seeing his ass,
this is just radio.

Class, we were scheduled to watch
a PBS program on the mating rituals...

...of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe
of New Guinea.

Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV.

So instead, we're having a surprise test.

<i>WONDER YEARS</i> VOICE: <i>Suddenly I was</i>
<i>public enemy number one.</i>

<i>It was time to tell the truth.</i>

Wait! I didn't drive into
the satellite dish!

And who did?

<i>WONDER YEARS</i> VOICE:
<i>I was just a 15-year-old girl.</i>

<i>But at that moment, I realized I had</i>
<i>a whole lifetime to make new friends.</i>

<i>But only one chance to get a new car.</i>
<i>And I had to take it.</i>

Okay, I did it.

PETER: I don't know how much longer
I can last.

It's been a whole week
since I seen a TV show.

I wonder what Scooby and the gang
are up to now.

NARRATOR: <i>We now return to</i>
The Scooby Doo Murder Files<i>.</i>

<i>Gee whiz, gang.</i>

<i>The killer gutted the victim,</i>
<i>strangled him with his own intestines...</i>

<i>-...and then dumped the body in the river!</i>
<i>-Jinkies! What a mystery!</i>

[Moaning]

<i>You're right, Scoob. We're dealing </i>
<i>with one sick son of a bitch.</i>

You just need to find something
to fill the void that's left in your life.

Lois has knitting, Chris has video games,
Meg's learning how to drive.

And me, I like the sauce.

Whose leg do you have to hump
to get a dry martini around here?

[Moaning]

Can't live without TV. Must see TV.

[Frightful instrumental music]

[Whimsical instrumental music]

[Sinister instrumental music]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Sighs]

Stewie, I expect you
to finish off your vegetables.

Rest assured, you relentless harridan,
I expect I shall finish them all off!

And you as well!

Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter.

Last night I woke up and he was
channel surfing through static.

I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.

-Morning, Lois.
-And you were worried.

-Peter, what the hell is that?
-It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.

Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning

to think you're losing
your grip on reality.

PETER: Boring.
I'll go see what else is on.

LOIS: Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.

Don't move!

[Making ridiculous noises]

[Screams]

STEWIE: A little help?

PETER: It's Glen Quagmire,
the wacky next-door neighbor.

PETER: What's he up to this time?
QUAGMIRE: I'm going to work!

Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.

We have to find your father, Chris.
He's not well.

I never knew anyone who went crazy
before except my invisible friend...

...Col. Schwartz!

I get all the channels on this thing.

<i>Lifetime.</i>

<i>CBS.</i>

<i>Hey, UPN.</i>

<i>All right.</i> 90210<i>.</i>

-Dad?
-Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly?

They're really reaching for guest stars
in the 10th season.

Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here!

I'm already a total
outcast because of you!

You're just upset because you wrecked
the cable transmitter.

I did not! Forget it.
What good is a car if I have no friends?

I didn't wreck TV! My dad did!

-What?
-What'd she say?

-Peter Griffin ruined TV?
-And blamed his daughter?

That's the lowest thing I've ever heard.

Peter, take that thing off and come home.

Hey, Lois. You're just in time
for the exciting conclusion.

Looks like some boob's
about to get lynched. Let's watch.

There they are.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

That's the guy who ruined our cable.
Let's get him!

Stop! What is wrong with you people?

Okay, yes. My husband is responsible
for knocking out TV.

But we should be thanking him.

He's broken television's hypnotic spell
over us.

Now we can see the world for what it is...

...a beautiful place full of wonderful
things just waiting to be experienced.

Another chick flick.

She's right. All the hours we've wasted
on that damn idiot box.

-I'm gonna paint my house!
-I'll build a ship in a bottle.

I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick
down a dirt road.

LOIS: I'll take you home, honey.

I can't believe I let Meg take the blame.
You were right, Lois. TV is evil.

I hear that Manson guy watches it
in jail all day long.

If I haven't seen it, it's new to me.

You just went a little overboard.
You need a little balance in your life.

There are other things to appreciate
besides television.

-You mean like this lamp?
-Yeah. Okay.

-The lamp gives us light.
-I get it.

And your family gives you love.

You should spend some time
with our kids, Peter. And with me.

What could me and you do together?

[Naughty laugh]

Lois! You've got a sick mind!

Peter, I'm talking about making love.

I thought you wanted us to murder
the children and harvest their organs...

...for beer money.

[Amorous giggling]

What a gorgeous day.
Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?

It's always a nice day
with two scoops of raisins, Peter.

[Car alarm blaring]

-Top of the morning, everybody.
-Excellent!

Thus completes the penultimate
adjustment to my weather control device!

Victory is.... Release me at once!

Your mother was right. It'd be a crime
to sit around and wait for the TV.

Great. You can teach me how to drive.

There'll be time to drive
when you're dead.

There's a world out there waiting
for us to grab it by the short hairs!

-Damn!
-Let's go.

[Cheery instrumental music]

I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing
really wore me out.

Wake up! You promised you'd get
this hook out of my mouth.

[Screams]

Thank you.

Now, kids, your father's just trying
to spend time with his family.

Or kill us. I'm not sure which.

TOM: <i>The Chinese sure like to spit,</i>
<i>don't they?</i>

Diane, that last report was so good,
I think you deserve a spanking.

I don't think your wife
would appreciate that.

That frigid old cow lives in Quahog.
She can't hear a word I'm saying.

Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog.

STEWIE: Thank God!

Their puerile minds are once again
distracted by that flickering box.

Time to be bad!

PETER: Come on, everyone.

<i>We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival.</i>
<i>You know those Germans.</i>

You don't join their party,
they come get you.

But Dad, the TV's back on.

What do you know? Okay, let's go.

Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend
so much time with the family.

But we're exhausted.

Maybe we could just sit
and watch some TV together?

We're too busy living life to the fullest.
Come on, let's go.

-I'm sick of life.
-Yeah. My dogs are barking.

-But I thought we were having fun.
-We were.

But now it might be nice to watch
other people have fun or get killed.

-You know, whatever's on.
-Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.

<i>This is a dangerous mission.</i>
<i>And it's likely one of us will be killed.</i>

<i>The landing party will consist of myself,</i>
<i>Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.</i>

<i>Crap.</i>

Sorry, Lois.

There's only one show I want to see.
It's called...

...<i>Make Every Day Count</i>,
starring Peter Griffin as himself.

LOIS: Come on, Peter.
Don't you miss TV just a little?

The familiar stories, the broadly drawn
characters, the convenient plot turns...

...that bring a character around
at exactly the right moment?

Hi. I'm William Shatner.
My car broke down...

...on my way to give a speech
on how TV keeps families together.

Would you like to hear it?

No, I don't want to miss
the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.

Wait a minute! I love schnitzel!

Come along. I bet you could squeeze
into Lois' lederhosen.

I'll change in the car.

If I had a nickel for every time
one of my parents walked out...

...instead of teaching me how to drive,
I'd be one rich little--

Let's go, Meg.

[Sinister instrumental music]

Fare thee well, broccoli!

[Band playing German folk music]

I don't know. I can't imagine
choosing life over television.

I'm telling you, it's great, Bill.

The only thing that would make this

perfect day better is if
my family was here.

My God!

It was sunny a moment ago,
but now it's pouring!

Let's take off our shoes
and run home barefoot!

Griffin, you're a madman!
Barefoot, you say?

LOIS: This is not safe.

<i>I'll teach you how to drive </i>
<i>some other time.</i><i>Pull over.</i>

Mom, I can't even tell where "over" is.

[Giddy laughter]

You were right, Peter.
I've never felt so alive.

Victory is mine!

[Screams]

STEWIE: God damn it.

[Giddy laughter]

My God.

[Car colliding]

My God. I hit William Shatner.

Light growing dimmer.
Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.

I did not see that coming.

Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over
and killed Mr. Shatner.

Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast,
I'll do enough living for me and Bill.

Honey, can't we go back
to the way things used to be?

There's a big dent in that couch
that nobody else can fill.

Haven't you guys learned anything?

TV took over my life once.
I'm never gonna let that happen again.

My God.

We've lost him.

If you help me out of here,
I know a meadow where...

...the blueberries are begging
to be picked.

Look, buddy. Just go in the pan.

And don't call me
unless you're flatlining.

PETER: Turn that TV off. Nurse?

ANNOUNCER: <i>What would you do</i>
<i>for a Klondike Bar?</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>Would you stand on one leg?</i>
MAN: <i>Sure.</i>

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Would you act like a monkey?</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>Would you kill a man?</i>

[Gunshot]

Daddy, now that I've finally passed
my driver's test...

...can I still get a convertible?

No. But I'm proud of you
for getting your license, sweetheart.

And I'm proud of you, Peter.
You taught us all a valuable lesson.

It's not what you do
that defines the quality of your life...

...it's who you do it with,
and your family--

It's on.

I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie,
but you'll thank me...

...when you grow up big and strong
like your father.

A compelling argument.
You've swayed me, woman.

That is good. I feel stronger already.

It's good tasting and good for you.

Nice try.

-Quadruped.
-Mutant.

I can't believe he's almost a year old.

Yeah. I'll never forget the
day he was born.

DOCTOR: One more push, Lois.

DOCTOR: This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin.
Would you like to see?

PETER: Yeah, I've never actually seen
a baby being.... Oh, God!

DOCTOR: Congratulations. It's a boy.

DOCTOR: Wait a minute.
I don't think we're through.

Oh, my God! Is it twins?

DOCTOR: No. It's a map of Europe.

[Sinister instrumental music]

I confirmed everything
with the birthday party planner...

...at Cheesie Charlie's.

-Why Cheesie Charlie's?
-It's cool, Dad.

They have this game where you put in
a dollar and you win four quarters!

I win every time! I get to go, right?

Why can't we have
the same kind of party we always do?

Peter, this could be
our last first birthday ever.

When Meg and Chris turned one,
I had so much to do, I missed everything.

[Kids chattering]

[Sighs]

PETER: Lois, you won't believe this!
Meg just said "Da-Da!"

Her first words?

Then she stood up by herself
and started walking!

-Her first steps?
-Yeah.

What the hell are you doing
in here anyway?

[Drums playing]

PETER: All right! Her first drum solo.

[Applause]

Thanks to Cheesie Charlie...

...I'm not gonna miss a moment
of Stewie's party.

I say, am I to spend the entire day
wallowing around in my own feces?

A little service here!

Hey, Stinky.
Have we got some big plans for you.

Plans? What the devil
are you talking about?

It's your birthday, dude.

Saturday's gonna be real special, honey.

I've hired a professional
to make sure everything goes just right.

A professional? There's treachery afoot!

[Crying]

Meg, you're home late.

I stayed after school
to try out for cheerleading.

Don't keep me in suspense.
How'd you do?

I'll give you a hint.

I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked!

Yay!

I mean, sorry, honey.

MEG: God, I hate high school.
I don't fit in with anyone.

Boy. Do I know that feeling.

[Suspenseful, jazzy instrumental music]

Okay, man. Okay.
You are really throwing me off.

It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it?

I thought we were gonna rumble
with those greasy Sharks.

Not without seven years of ballet
and two of jazz tap, we're not.

From the top, people!
Why don't you just hang back and stretch?

I don't get it.

The more I try to make friends,
the more people hate me.

Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl
with a mind of her own.

-Now, see, that's what people hate.
-Really?

I'm telling you, just be the girl
you think everyone else wants you to be.

Wow, it's so obvious.

Thanks, Daddy.

MEG: Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.

LOIS: I haven't seen Meg this happy
since that bus broke down...

...in front of our house.

Hi. Can we use your phone?

Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn!

Meg and I had a little
father-daughter talk.

It seems to have worked.

I wasn't just blowing smoke
when I bought this T-shirt.

Well, you're the number-one husband, too.

I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt.

The man in white. Of course.

He must be the hired professional
of whom they spoke.

He failed to thwart my escape
into the outside world.

And now, one year hence, he's returning
to rectify his mistake and...

...put me back in the womb!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Boy, it sure is great being
thin and popular.

GIRL 1: Let's throw up.

GIRL 2: Sure!
GIRL 3: Good idea!

I love throwing up.

[Laughing]

[Sighs]

Hi. I'm Jennifer.

I'm Meg.

My God. Your hair is so beautiful.
I just want to brush it.

Really?

You want to go throw up?

[Western instrumental music]

Hey, Dad, let's go whack some moles!

Now, Chris, we're not here for fun.

[Children giggling]

Now your mom is counting on us
to drop off the deposit.

So let's just deliver the check and....

PETER: Hong Kong Phooey!

Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!

PETER: Come on, move it! Oh, man!
Chris, this place is great.

Pull over, you bastard!

Man.

CHRIS: Hey, Dad, they even got games
in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon!

Yeah, way to go, Chris.

Where's my watch?

All right. I won a watch.
What's <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i>?

That's mine. Come on.
Come on, give that back!

-Give it!
-Come on!

UNCLE JESSE: <i>Folks in Hazzard County</i>
<i>hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time.</i>

<i>Them boys rassled for a full five minutes</i>
<i>before the manager stepped in.</i>

Come on!

Hands off, fatty!

Sir, I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

I'm a paying customer.

I got a deposit check
for my kid's party right here.

Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry.

We're really looking forward
to Stewie's special day.

Now I don't know,
after the emotional trauma I've endured...

...on your premises,
I think I deserve a little discount.

Sir, our prices are set
by the corporate office.

Then maybe I'll just take
my business elsewhere.

Good luck filling our
spot by this Saturday.

MAN: I got cash!
WOMAN: I'll take it!

Suit yourself.

Wait. I was just bluffing.
My wife has her heart set on this place.

[Peter yells after him]

Chris, this is a big day for you.
The day you become the man of the house.

Because when we get home,
your mother is going to kill me.

So the man in white is coming
to put me back in the womb, is he?

If I'm to defeat him,
I shall require professional forces.

STEWIE: Here we are. "Come to Managua,
the Mecca of mercenaries."

I must prepare for my journey.

Let's see.
Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios....

-So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's?
-Actually, I canceled the reservation.

What?

-How could you?
-Lois, I got a very good reason.

Wait a second.

These are always classic.

Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good.
See, it happened like this.

[Spooky instrumental music]

[Screaming]

Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's.
<i>Heil</i>, Hitler!

Actually, the name's Griffin.

I was sent by my smart, beautiful,
and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.

Yes.
We're all set for your little boy's party.

I understand we're getting
a terrific bargain here.

Absolutely.
The children get to play our games.

And if they win enough tickets,
they get a prize.

I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough?

Sorry, Timmy.
But you need 15 tickets to live.

[Screaming]

They also get food, cake,
and your choice of ice-cream flavors...

...vanilla, strawberry, chocolate,
or people.

-What was that?
-Chocolate. Give me the check.

Hold it! Lois may have
had her heart set on this place...

...but I love my family too much
to risk their lives.

-Come on, Chris. We're leaving.
-No, you're not!

Please don't make me angry, pal.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

[Eerie instrumental music]

LOIS: <i>All right, Peter. That's enough!</i>

Bravo, Peter.
You are the Spalding Gray of crap.

Do you know how hard it was
to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's?

I had to book it the day of my ultrasound.

We'll never find another place in time!

For once, it was all gonna be so perfect!

Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect.
We'll give him the best birthday ever...

...right here in the safety and comfort
of our own home.

-Peter, we've been over this.
-Honey, you won't have to lift a finger.

I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo,
a big-ass piñata, the works!

-You got all those things?
-You bet I did.

LOIS: Wow.

Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have
a petting zoo.

Okay, I'll call the parents
and let them know the party's here.

-You don't have any of those things.
-How do you know?

Face it. You're a terrible liar.

[Sniffing]

It was you.

Clowns and petting zoos
book months in advance.

You're gonna have a tough time
finding a.... Hold on.

DRIVER: Ya! Ya!

[Horses neighing]

Some day.

Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?

STEWIE: Now, listen to me, Jolene.

I've got an army to raise,
and I must get to Nicaragua.

I require a window seat and
an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles!

-God help you if I find pickles.
-Henry, I have a lost little boy.

Hey there, little fella.
Why don't you come with me?

STEWIE: Damn you!
You're one of them, aren't you?

<i>What are they paying you? I'll double it!</i>

<i>I'll give you whatever you want!</i>
<i>Money! Women! Men?</i>

Dad, what are we doing here again?

Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for
Stewie's petting zoo.

[Blower starting]

[Pig squealing]

[Pigs squealing]

[Motor stopping]

Crafty swine.

UPS.

Little bastards ain't as smart as....

Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer.
She gave me a ride home.

Meg, you made a friend.

JENNIFER: What a lovely house, Mrs. G.

Meg, you didn't tell me
your mother was just like Martha Stewart.

Oh, no. Once you get to know me,
I'm really very nice.

You know what's nice?
Having a friend like Meg. And kittens.

It was super swell meeting you.
Bye, Meg. Friends forever.

Forever and ever.

[Giddy laughter]

Wow! What a great yard!

Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me
to a party on Saturday.

This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss
Stewie's first birthday.

MEG: But Mom--

Meg, our entire family is
going to be here for Stewie's party.

And that includes you. Understood?

I can't believe you'd put your family
before your own daughter!

She's a whiny little runt, isn't she?

I said "runt."

I don't think I'm in the right place.

I'm looking for a guy to entertain
the kids at my son's birthday.

Sure. I can do that.

You do children's parties?

Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand,
and some somersaults maybe.

I can make pretend like
the children are little bugs in my web.

Do you know your phone number, son?

The only way you'll get me to talk
is through slow, painful torture.

And I don't think you've got the grapes!

It sounds like you don't want to go home.
Are you running away?

Stewart Gilligan
Griffin runs from nothing!

You know, son,
running away never solves anything.

You're getting to be a big boy now.

And part of growing up means
facing your problems head on.

The ruptured capillaries in your
nose belie the clarity of your wisdom.

You're saying I must return to face this
man in white myself. So be it.

As for you, kind sage, I only hope
my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm...

...as you spend the next 10 years
in frozen carbonite!

Peter, you've only got
a couple of hours left.

If you pull a party out of your ass,
you'll want to stand up.

My friend Jennifer invited me
to hang out with her friends.

Can I go?

I won't fall for this trick.
Did you ask your mother?

Yes.

Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart.

Thanks, Daddy!

Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck.

The only stuff I could get on such short
notice was a cake and that big-ass piñata.

I sure hope candy comes out of that.

Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father,
a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser.

I'll never be able to face Lois.

The circus is in town.
Maybe you could run away and join it.

The circus!

[Marching band playing]

[Elephant trumpeting]

Hi. This is the right day, isn't it?

Oh, yes.
Peter should be back any minute...

...and then we can start the party,
I hope.

Hey, Lois, look.
The two symbols of the Republican party...

...an elephant and a big fat white guy
who's threatened by change.

LOIS: Peter, this is the most wonderful
celebration I could have imagined.

PETER: Yeah. Where's Stewie?

He's upstairs, resting up for his big day.

[Oriental instrumental music]

I'll get him. If you see Meg,
tell her to take plenty of pictures.

Meg's not here.
She went to a friend's house.

What?
She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday.

I dropped her off an hour ago.
Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?

Peter. How could you let her go?

What's the big deal?
So Meg's with her new friends.

They seemed like some nice kids.

JENNIFER: I'm glad you could join us.
We're gonna have a great time on our trip.

A trip? Like to the beach?
Because I didn't bring my swimsuit.

You won't need anything
where we're going.

Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch.

[Whimsical music playing]

CHRIS: Birthday dude?
Do you want some ice cream?

Yes. But no sprinkles! For
every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!

Come on, Lois.
I hate to see you so upset.

We got animals. We got clowns.

I mean, a party couldn't be any better
if Jesus himself showed up.

Okay, everybody. For my next miracle,
I'm gonna turn water into funk.

[Disco music playing]

Peter, the circus is terrific.
But it's not just Stewie's birthday.

We're also celebrating the day
our family became whole.

Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.

Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day.

I know. It's just that
I really like that guy over there.

But he doesn't even know I exist.
He must think I'm a total dog.

That is so not true.

Then what is it?

-He's a eunuch.
-Really?

Sure. All the guys here
have been castrated.

It's cool.

-Do you think that girl is hot?
-No.

Me neither.

[Elephant trumpeting]

Hey, you. Hit me.

There. Now, if I can just find a midget
with some gin, I'll be in business.

Where are you off to?

I gotta make things right for Lois
and get this monkey off my back.

PETER: Ow! Knock it off!

All right, men, the man in white
is coming to put me back in the womb.

Today he comes for me,
but tomorrow it could be you or you!

I offer you the opportunity to join me
in glorious battle.

<i>I know that for some of you,</i>
<i>your motor skills are not developed.</i>

Sadly, you will be used as decoys.

But your children's children
will know that you fell for a noble cause.

Now, who's with me?

Duckie?

Useless, every one of you! Fine.

I'll defend myself,
and the hell with all of you!

There, I've gone and soiled myself.
Are you happy now?

[Gong goes off]

Our leader is here
to take us on our journey!

My children, rejoice. The hour
of transformation is close at hand.

Who are you?

This is Meg, wise one.
Can she come with us?

Perhaps. Do you have a mind
that seeks enlightenment...

...and a heart that seeks purity?

Not really.

Okay. Are you a confused adolescent
desperately seeking acceptance...

...from an undifferentiated ego mass
that demands conformity?

Wow, that sort of sounds more like me.

Great! Then all you need is
a dark-blue jogging suit.

Let's see what we have in stock.

What are you? About a 9?

No. A 6.

Right. Dispense the refreshments.

Meg, there you are.

Dad, what are you doing here?
I'm so embarrassed, I could die!

GUY: Not before the rest of us!

Meg, your mother wants
the family together today.

It's just Stewie's birthday.
So what if I'm not there?

Who's gonna remember?

Your mom will, trust me.
She remembers everything.

In fact, she always says the best memories
she has are when you kids were born.

Meg, that's it. This day is more
for your mom than it is for Stewie.

With all she's given us,
she oughta get whatever she wants.

And, Meg, today she wants you
to be with the family.

Really?

Daddy, you must think
I'm the worst daughter ever.

No you're not, honey.
What about that fat girl from the Judds?

I'm sorry I've been so selfish.

TEEN 1: I miss my mom.
TEEN 2: Me, too.

I also miss my nads.

Mr. Griffin, can we come
to Stewie's party, too?

Sure. The more the merrier.

Meg, you have the coolest family.

She sure does.

Here's to family!

To family!

Jeez, look at the time! Come on.

Come on, kids. Let's get going.

[Bodies falling over]

Sorry, Meg.

It's another bunch of people
that'd rather fake death...

...than go to a party with you.

Children, the time of
ascension has arrived.

For the love of God. Haven't any of you
ever been in a cult before?

Damn it!
I can't achieve transcendence by myself.

That would just make me
some kind of lone nut.

Somebody's got to die with me.

Come back, Meg!

Whoops. Can't forget
my ceremonial white robe.

I guess there's nothing left
but the birthday cake.

MEG: Right here!

Meg!

I'm sorry, Mom.

Thank you, Peter.

No problem.
I cannot wait to taste this cake.

The guy who sold it to me
said it was delicious and erotic.

Peter, there's a naked man on this cake.

There were only two left.

And trust me, you did not want the one
of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.

LOIS: Gather round, everyone.
It's time for Stewie's big moment.

[Knocking]

LEADER: Hello?

Is anybody home?

STEWIE: <i>Greetings, man in white.</i>
<i>I've been expecting you.</i>

Who said that?

STEWIE: <i>Peek-a-boo! I see you!</i>

<i>You're getting warmer.</i>

Where are you? What do you want?

STEWIE: <i>Freedom! What do you want?</i>

I want to get the hell out of here!

STEWIE: <i>I'm sorry. </i>
<i>We're fresh out of that.</i>

<i>I'm afraid all that's left is </i>
<i>untimely death.</i>

[Dramatic instrumental music]

What the hell is this?

It's a boy!

[Energy pulsing]

Anybody seen Stewie?

Yeah. Where is the birthday boy?

Victory is mine!

Yes. And this cake is yours, too.

Stewie, make a wish. If you blow
out the candle, it'll come true.

That's right, little buddy. What do you
want most in the whole world?

In the whole world, you say?

[Bombs whistling]

[Troops marching]

[Bombs exploding]

What the hell.

STEWIE: Blast you, woman!
Awake from your damnable reverie!

Honey, I'm doing the dishes.

A thousand pardons for disrupting
your flatware sanitation ritual.

But you see, I'm in searing pain!

You're just teething, Stewie.
It's a normal part of a baby's life.

Very well then,
I order you to kill me at once!

Honey, I know you're hurting.

But Mommy has to clean up the house,
all right?

No, it's not all right!

For the love of God, shake me!
Shake me like a British nanny!

Oh, man. This is the life.
Hand me another one of them...

...Pawtucket Patriots.

Guys, I want to say a toast to you,
Quagmire, Cleveland....

Brian.

Yeah. If you guys were beers,
I would drink every one of you.

And I wish you were because we're out.

[Giggling]

That's funny. That's even more humorous
than that joke you told us last night.

Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
walk into a bar, right?

Wait a second.

Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
walk into a bar.

And there's a naked priest sitting there.
And he....

Oh, sorry, Father.

No, I've heard them all.

Look at the time.

I promised Loretta I was gonna trim
the hedges and be tender with her.

Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need
some time off as much as we do.

This is when Lois does all those
little things that women like to do.

[Grunting]

[Car honking, Lois sighs]

I'll be on your bed. No calls.

PETER: Hey, Lois.

You've been busy all day.
So I took care of dinner.

Really?

All you gotta do is gut it, clean it,
scale it, and cook it.

LOIS: I spent all morning
cleaning up the house.

And in five seconds,
you turn it into low tide at the pier.

Jeez. I'm sorry, honey.
I'd help you clean it up.

But you know how lousy
I am with housework.

Remember when I tried doing the laundry?

Let's see. Shirts, pants....
I'm missing another sock.

Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus.

Give me back my sock, you goat bastard!

PETER: Hey!

You're right. It's better if I do it.

STEWIE: Damn it to the bowels
of bloody hell!

The baby's up. Can you get him?

Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing.

I'm a little gun-shy
after what happened last time.

No, you imbecile!
That's not talc! That's paprika!

<i>Take that!</i>

All right, I'll do that, too!
Can you at least take Chris to his game?

Jeez, Lois.
I spent all morning on a boat...

...drinking beer, telling jokes,
and screwing around.

How about a little me time?

Honey, I'm begging you.
Drop Chris off at his soccer game...

...and come right home.

I need you to look after Stewie
while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!

All right! You know I spoil you.

CHRIS: Thanks for the ride, Dad.

All right. Have fun, Chris.

Hey, Petey!

Quagmire? What are you doing here?

Soccer moms!

[Soccer moms giggle]

All right.

I'd like to hang around with you.
But Lois needs me at home.

I got beer.

PETER: Boo, Lois! Yay, beer!

[Playing classical music]

[Lois shushing]

It's okay, Stewie.
Where the hell's Peter?

That was good, Reuben.
Now play Brahms' <i>Lullaby</i>.

[Sings] "Lullaby and good night"

Enough! The only thing worse
than the wretched pain...

...in my mouth is the excrement
spewing from yours!

I wish I could make the pain
go away sooner.

But I can't turn time forward.

Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course!
I'll simply build a machine...

...that can move time!
I shall call it a time machine.

E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!

PETER: Go, Chris! Daddy loves you!
I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.

[Whistle]

Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!

That's the 10th time today!
Nice grab, orca.

Get Moby Dick off the field
before he burps up a license plate!

Easy, fella. That's my kid.
Now apologize.

Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead
stinking blue cheese feta!

That's it!

Way to go, Dad!

You hit my mom!

No, I hit your dad.

Stand back. Give her some air.

You mean, "Give him some air."

Call an ambulance.
She's going into labor.

You mean, "He's going into labor."

[Baby crying]

Whoops.

PETER: I can't believe I punched a woman.

A pregnant woman.

I just hope she accepts my peace offering.

I sent her a little something
for the baby.

[Melodic strumming from box]

I would've brought it over myself
if I wasn't under house arrest.

You're just fortunate
this is your first offense, Peter.

Could've been a lot worse if the cops...

...knew about the other times
I broke the law.

And there was that time
I took a whiz in public.

And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.

Me and Cleveland are gonna "amscray."

Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.

Why don't you come with us?

I can't leave the premises.
They're monitoring my every move.

[Electronic beeping]

PETER: I gotta get out of here!

There's my little house husband.

It's been so wonderful
having you home all week.

Thanks, honey.
But I don't know how you...

...stand it here all day.

I mean, I'm so bored,
I can't even watch TV anymore.

All the shows are
starting to run together.

Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!

[Comedic instrumental music]

I know you can't understand
what I'm going through.

All the stuff that makes you happy...

...like cooking and cleaning, is right in
the house just waiting for you.

-You are one lucky--
-Stop now.

Peter, I don't do those things
because I enjoy them.

I do them because I love my family.

[Giggling]

Lois loves her family.
Lois loves her family.

"Lois and the family sitting in a tree"

See, Lois, the guys would've
found that hilarious.

Why don't I go buy some groceries
and make us a nice romantic dinner?

Like when we were dating.
That oughta take your mind off the guys.

It already has.

I wonder what the guys are up to?

That's nasty.

Where's the damn pull string?

[Yells]

You never know what you're gonna
find down here.

[Dog barking, Peter yells]

PATRIOT: Peter!

PETER: You're the Pawtucket Patriot.

Verily. Come hither and give heed.

Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal.

Look, I got a date with my female wife.
I just came down to get some beers.

PATRIOT: Why spend time with your wife?
If you build a bar in this basement...

...and stock it with plenty
of frosty Pawtucket Patriots...

...your friends will come down here
for a beer as well.

Build a bar! That's a great idea.

Wait. One last question.

If I walk through you,
does that mean, like, we've done it?

PATRIOT: Jeez.
What's with you and the gay jokes?

[Cheerful instrumental music]

[Snoring]

[Instrumental music slows down]

[Sighs]

[Door opening]

LOIS: Where the hell have you been?
We had a date.

Sorry, honey.
I must've lost track of the time.

What do you say?
You think the guys will like it?

This is why you missed our dinner?
To make a bar for your friends?

Yeah, isn't it great?
Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen.

I build stuff and I have
a criminal record.

[Macho grunting]

[Sniffing]

[Guys laughing]

Okay, guys. I got another one.

What's the difference
between pornography and art?

[Chuckling] Here it comes.

A government grant.

Peter, you are in the zone.

You know those little clam cakes
you make whenever...

...we have company? I need about a dozen.

Actually, better make it like 600.

That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant.

And I'm through taking care of you
and your bar buddies!

Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?

LOIS: Watch the kids.
I'm taking a hot bath.

Put me down, you blunderbuss!

He's a little cranky from teething.

I can fix that.

[Mumbling]

Good God, man!

One can only imagine what foul regions
that finger has erstwhile probed!

There you go.

My mother used to use whiskey
whenever I had a toothache.

My tooth hurts!

PETER: There. How's that feel?

It's delightful.

[Bathwater running]

[Applause]

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Lois, you are a wonderful woman.

Words cannot express the depth
of my appreciation and love for you.

Peter!

You must be Lois.

No, not silicone. Silicon.
And the design of the device...

...is quite ingenious
if I do say so myself, Misty.

What a delightful moniker.

You see, Misty...

[Stewie giggles]

...my time manipulator employs axioms...

...from the quantum theory
of molecular propulsion.

I've broken my pencil!

I have a<i> Barney</i> pen in my purse.

You are spectacular!

Chris, what are you doing here?

Sorry, Mom.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

Chris, go to your room!

Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one...

...of your oh-so-exhilarating games
of peekaboo?

Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!

PETER: No, I'm not!

Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight.

Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

[Sings] "Show me the way to go home"
Everybody!

"I'm tired and I want to go to bed"
Just the women!

Peter, in the 17 years
that we've been married...

...I have never been as angry as I....

What is my piano doing down here?

It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet,
but.... Never mind.

That does it, Peter.
Either this bar goes or I do!

PETER: I haven't even told you
the other reason your piano's down here.

I wanted you to play it.

Like it was an instrument.
I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?

Come on!

I couldn't.

Come on!

Maybe one song.

Pretend you like it
no matter how bad it stinks.

[Lois chuckles]

[Starts playing piano]

[Sings] "You'll never know just how much

"I love you

"You'll never know just how much I care"

Yeah!

"And if I try, I still

"couldn't hide my love for you

"You oughta know
for haven't I told you so?"

Okay, guys. Thank you.
You can stop pretending now.

GUY: All right!

"If there is some other way
to prove that I love you

"I swear I don't know how"

MAN: Sing it.

Something troubling you, Peter?

Nothing. Just all my friends
are eye-humping my wife.

"You'll never know if you don't know now"

[Applause]

GUYS: Wonderful! Wow!

[Cheery instrumental music]

It was absolutely amazing.

The second that spotlight hit me,
I became a whole different person!

Silence, you contemptible shrew!

I bet your gums are still sore.

You're so observant, aren't you?
Are you a detective?

Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this!

I must complete my time machine,
move time forward, and end this agony!

CHRIS: Hey, Dad.

Mom says she was really on last night.

Yeah. About that. Lois, see,
the guys were just being polite.

They thought your singing was too....

I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.

Tonight? Honey, I don't think
anyone's gonna come back tonight.

LOIS: [Sings] <i>"Gimme, gimme, gimme</i>
<i>what I cry for</i>

<i>"You know you got the brand of kisses</i>

<i>"that I die for"</i>

This one takes me back.

Now that's a woman!

That's a house. That's a fish.
That's a bee!

<i>"You know you made me love you"</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

[Band strikes up]

<i>I was born in a little town called Quahog.</i>

FAN: We love you, Lois!

[Lois laughs]

<i>Let me finish the story, fellas.</i>
<i>You don't want to be up all night.</i>

<i>Or do you?</i>

"Or do you?"

She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she?

Are you a woman?

No.

My house arrest is over, Brian.
Round up the guys.

Now that I'm a free man,
we can do anything we want.

The guys only want to do one thing.

And that's ogle your wife.

If Lois were my woman,
I'd keep an eye on her.

Then again, I'm the jealous type.

Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act.
Nice melons.

Listen, pal--

Peter, I'm holding melons.

And her hooters ain't bad either!

Now hang on a second there!

Peter, I'm holding hooters.

Sorry.

No problem.

Your wife's hot!

PETER: That's it!
Your singing days are over.

If I wanted to marry Lola Falana,
I would have.

Look, Lola. This whole thing
is just going way too fast for me.

For the last time, I'm not Lola!
I'm Leslie Uggams!

Peter, having me sing was your idea
in the first place.

I just wanted to keep my bar.

I built that thing so my friends...

...would come to see me, not you.

Is that so? Let me tell you something.

I love singing!
And I will continue to sing!

How dare you upset me
this close to showtime!

Lois.

Watch where you're going, buddy.

Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you.

Listen, I don't want any more trouble.

Thanks to your wife...

...my husband hasn't been home all week!

That singing hussy is destroying
our marriages!

[Women murmuring]

Yeah, then do something about it.

Come to my basement tonight and
drag your husbands out of there.

Maybe we will.

Yeah!

Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?

LOIS: <i>This next number is dedicated</i>
<i>to my very supportive husband, Peter.</i>

Hit it!

[Sings] <i>"Don't tell me not to fly</i>
<i>I've simply gotta</i>

<i>"If someone takes a spill</i>
<i>it's me and not you</i>

<i>"Don't bring around a cloud</i>
<i>to rain on my parade"</i>

Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?

Yes, your judgment lately
has been rather....

You have crappy judgment anyway.

STEWIE: This is intolerable!

This foolishness is preventing me
from completing work on....

Egads! The blueprints
for my time machine!

Those are for my eyes only!

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Look everyone,</i>
<i>Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.</i>

No!

[Fan whistling]

Hold up the picture. Let's see.

No! Nothing to see here.

GUY: How cute. It's a time machine!

No! It's a....
Blast, what the devil do children draw?

It's a pheasant!

A time machine. Sure.
Here's where the flux capacitor goes.

I can't wait to build
one of these of my own.

I'll not stand idly by
while you abrogate my plans.

You shall rue this day.
Go on! Start ruing!

Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs
to kiss you good night.

Burn in hell!

<i>Hell. Hell has fire.</i>
<i>And you know what else?</i>

[Sings] <i>"It's got steam heat</i>

<i>"I got steam heat</i>

<i>"But I need your love to keep away </i>
<i>the cold</i><i>I got--"</i>

ANGRY PARENT: All right, break it up!

What's going on here?

Your little peep show is over!
We're taking back our men!

Peep show? I just do this for fun.
Look, all day long I scrub and cook...

...and take care of my kids.
And nobody cheers.

No one even says thank you.
But when the band starts playing and...

...the music's flowing through me,
I feel, I don't know, special.

I guess you all think that's pretty silly.

Not at all.

You didn't tell us that part!

Peter, you're behind all this?

Yes. And you'll never catch me!

[Giggles maniacally]

[Screams repeatedly]

I bet he also didn't tell you he never
helps me around the house.

Or takes me out to dinner.
Or notices when I get my hair done.

-Oh, no, that's just....
-My husband's the same way.

So's mine.

[People chattering]

Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons.
I'm gonna go grab some ozone.

Peter! There's a king in the cards!

They saw my blueprints!
What a grievous breach of security!

Damn! What do to? Wait for it.... Yes!

Instead of moving time forward
to bypass this wretched teething...

...it might just be possible to reverse
time's heady flow...

...and undo ever having drawn
those damnable blueprints.

-You'll never get away with this!
-Silence!

Lois, you make it sound
like I don't appreciate you at all.

Peter, when was the last time
you told me you love me?

You know I do.

I want to hear it!

Is that what this is all about?

Run for your lives!

Holy crap!

Hot!

[Explosion]

[Screaming]

LOIS: There's no way out!

At last! My time device is complete!
Just one final adjustment. There.

Now I shall negate ever having drawn
those damnable blueprints.

Blast!

Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise
if we get out of this alive...

...I'm gonna help out around the house
and say "I love you" every day.

You mean it?

I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man.

And to think, if I hadn't taken
Chris to his soccer game...

...I never would've learned
this valuable lesson.

[People talking backwards]

[Mystical instrumental music]

[Backwards speech slowing]

Honey, I'm begging you.
Drop Chris off at his soccer game...

...and come right home.

I need you to look after Stewie
while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!

All right! You know I spoil you.

My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll
have to take Chris yourself.

[Giggles]

-My device! My teeth!
-I'm free! Free!

I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor!

I think not!

Bicuspid! We meet again.

-Have at you!
-En garde!

Shall we bite the tongue then?

On three. One, two....

[Screams]

[Theme music]
S01E05.en
[Cheery instrumental music]

Machiavelli! You've told me nothing
I don't already know!

Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>.

LOIS: Stewie, those books aren't
for babies. Here. Watch the <i>Teletubbies</i>.

How dare you! That book may hold the key
to my enslaving of all mankind.

Fuzzy.

[Giddy laughter]

<i>Tickle.</i>

God. The more I resist, the more
intriguing they become! I can't look away!

TELETUBBIES: <i>Again! Again!</i>

Yes! Yes! Again! Again!
Dear God, please once more!

PETER: Sorry, Stewie.

<i>A&E Biography</i> is doing the life
of the other guy from Wham.

I'm free! Free from the spell
of those diabolical Teletubbies!

Thank you. When the world is mine,
your death shall be quick and painless.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Attention, please.

Tomorrow is softball practice. We have
a lot of work to do for Saturday's game.

Don't forget how badly we were humiliated
last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.

[Raucous laughter]

[Peter giggles]

Look at those morons
and their stupid glasses.

Oh, man. I hate those guys.

More than I hate spinach, traffic jams,
and the last few years of <i>M*A*S*H</i>.

When Alan Alda took over
behind the camera...

...and the show
got all dramatic and preachy?

Am I right? Who's with me?

This year we will defeat those Pranksters
with our secret weapon...

...Guillermo.

[Screaming]

Bravo!

I hired Guillermo because I believe
he'll be an asset to our company...

...on and off the field.

MR. WEED:
You have impeccable credentials.

I'm sure I can find a position
for you somewhere.

Back to work, people.

PETER: Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for
a new line of TV action figures.

<i>Facts of Life</i> Transformers, huh?
Watch the transformation.

Cute as a button...

...fat as a cow...

...radioactive scorpion.
Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.

-I'll consider it.
-He'll consider it!

I got another one where Natalie's one of
those spittin' lizards from <i>Jurassic Park</i>.

[Applause on TV]

<i>Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle.</i>
<i>"Go tuck yourself in."</i>

PAT: <i>You got it.</i>

Well, you were close, Dad.

Yeah. I still can't believe we missed
the phrase, "My hairy aunt."

Come on, Brian.
I gotta get to softball practice.

Practice? I thought we'd go next door
and welcome our new neighbors.

No. I don't want anything to do
with neighbors.

Last guy who lived next door
borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.

If that slut wants full custody
of the kids, she's got it.

[Short-circuiting]

Peter, they might be very nice people.

"Very nice people."
Yeah, that's what they always say.

Then you open up the septic tank and...
Skeleton city!

[Panting]

Pervert!

Don't flatter yourself, honey.
I don't have any sweat glands.

MR. WEED: Okay, time for batting practice,
my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys.

Guillermo, you're up.

Unfortunately Johnson isn't here
to pitch today. His wife is in labor.

Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him?
Jeez, I'll pitch.

I don't know what's more questionable,

your pitching arm
or Bill Clinton's integrity.

Oh, how hard--

[Laugh track]

Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?

-Okay. Take your base.
-Somebody call 911.

Tell them he is allergic to penicillin
and white zinfandel!

Idiot! If you don't find a ringer
to replace Guillermo, you're fired!

Man. What'll I do if I get fired?
I'll have to go back to my old job...

...as a Calvin Klein model.

FEMALE VOICE 1:
<i>I don't wanna be</i><i>like everyone else.</i>

MALE:<i> But I don't want</i><i>to be different.</i>

FEMALE VOICE 2:<i> I just want to be.</i>

PETER: <i>What was the name</i>
<i>of the bad guy from</i> Tron<i>?</i>

<i>This is gonna drive me nuts!</i>

LOIS: Moving is never easy on a family.

Well, we are gonna miss
the go-go-go pace of Providence.

But with number two on the way,
Joe thought it was time to move.

And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.

Quahog can be pretty exciting, too.

Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.

I-17. Darn it.

[Screams]

I haven't played Bingo in years!

Silence! Ever since you two met,
you've done nothing but wax idiotic!

I must escape this infernal babble!

[Chuckles] What a little explorer.

Yes. He's so full of wonder.

To be the Lindbergh baby right about now.

BONNIE: Joe, you have to meet
our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.

It's a pleasure, Lois.
Who's the little guy?

This is Stewie.
Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.

You will bow to me.

MEG: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.

I know.
I've admired you in the garden from afar.

-Will you go out with me?
-I'd love to.

[Romantic instrumental music]

CHRIS: Oh, he's gay.
MEG: You wish!

Get out of here, you mouth breather!

PETER: <i>I'm as good as fired.</i>

Where the hell am I gonna find a guy
as strong as Guillermo?

One time I walked into the locker room,
I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.

PETER: Great. Lois is getting chummy
with the new neighbors.

BRIAN: She wants you to meet them.
PETER: She's always making me be social.

Cocktail parties, school functions,
that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

What? Look, all I'm saying is
put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy...

...and I can't tell the difference.

-You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
-Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil.

You got a neighbor
on the other side of your house, too.

So, don't think you always have to bug me.

I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have
a screwdriver I can borrow?

Man, you neighbors are like viruses.
Starts with a screwdriver.

Before you know it,
you're using my supermarket...

...my dry cleaner, and even my postman.

Can you believe that guy?
"Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"

What an ass.

-Did you find a replacement for the team?
-No. Believe me, I've been looking.

Hideo-san would be honored to play
for your team.

But he wishes to know
what compensation you offer.

Me love you long time.

Gosh, I'd like to help.
But I've gotta go out in the hall...

...and chew on my ass for five minutes.

LOIS: Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie
to your game on Saturday.

Lois, I don't want those people there.

See, this is why I ask you to submit
everything to me in writing first.

Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan.
He played in college.

He did?

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Hiya, Joe.

-Peter!
-Don't get up.

This is a surprise.
I kinda thought you didn't like me.

What? Because of what I said
this afternoon. No.

See I have that disease
where stuff pops out of your mouth.

Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?

I'm so sorry.

I thought maybe I crossed the line
when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.

Are you kidding?
You can borrow whatever you want.

Great. Say, you don't happen
to have any picture wire, do you?

Picture wire? You son of a bitch.

[Dreamy ringing]

Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
There it goes again.

I don't want to impose.

No problem. That's what neighbors do.
You know what else they do?

They play on their neighbor's company
softball team like this Saturday.

PETER: What do you say, neighbor?
JOE: Sounds fun.

So much fun it should be illegal
like copyright infringement.

[Mickey voice] See you at the game, Joe.

[Cheery instrumental music]

-Hey, you want a piece of gum?
-Thanks.

-That was joke gum.
-What do you mean?

Now you're addicted to heroin.

I'm cold.

LOIS: Hey, Peter!

MR. WEED:
It's nice that your family is here.

If your ringer doesn't arrive soon,
you can spend every day with them...

...at home.

He'll be here, Mr. Weed.
You should see this guy in action.

PETER: He can hit, he can throw--
JOE: Peter!

MR. WEED:
What's he doing in a wheelchair?

Holy crip, he's a crapple!

Peter, our new secret weapon
is this very attractive paraplegic?

Okay, Joe, you got me.
Rise and shine. Come on.

-Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.
-You're a hoot, Peter.

-Play ball!
-Let's do it!

I swear I didn't know. Maybe
they won't hit a lot of balls to him.

JOE: I got shortstop.

The movers tracked grease
all over my carpet.

-I tried everything to get the stain out.
-What about lemon juice?

-What about club soda?
-What about shutting the hell up?

Isn't baseball great?

They say baseball's the national pastime.

I can't taste salt.

Crap! Don't hit it to Joe.
Please don't hit it to Joe!

[Fans cheering]

You're out!

All right, Joe!
Way to earn that parking space!

BONNIE: All right!
LOIS: Did you see that?

BONNIE: That's my Joe!
STEWIE: What the deuce?

Half man, half machine.

STEWIE: Why with that technology,
I could escape these wretched harridans!

Go, cyborg!

[Fantastical instrumental music]

MR. WEED: It all rests
on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!

[Whooshing]

MR. WEED: All right, Joe! Run!

All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!

MR. WEED: Hurry! Joe!
All right! Yes, <i>vamos</i>!

PLAYER: Let's hear it for Joe!

Yeah, let's hear it for the guy
who found Joe!

Okay.

That's finger suckin' good, huh?
It's an old policemen's recipe.

Eat up, everyone.

Tonight my wife won't be the only one
enjoying a pig in a blanket.

BONNIE: Joe, you're so funny.

They love that one down at the Precinct.

This sucks, Brian.
Joe is stealing my thunder.

Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!

-Face it. He's the life of the party.
-Yeah?

I'll show you who's the life of the party.

Hey, look!
I fell in the pool with my clothes on!

How hilarious is that?
That is so Peter Griffin. Guys?

Guys?

JOE: That's my idea.
MR. WEED: Peter, come here.

Finally. A little recognition.

Joe has the most wonderful idea.

Hey, I just suggested a line
of handi-capable toys, you know...

...to show kids the fun side
of being physically challenged!

That's what kids want to play with.
Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble.

What about my idea? Come on!
Tootie morphs into a stink bug.

Joe, you're exactly the kind of man
we need at our company.

Peter, make yourself useful.
Go get Joe a drink.

Jeez, first he takes my friends.
Then he takes my job.

But the way I wear my hat...

No, no. He can't take that away from me.

You! How came you
by this metal construct?

-I demand to know who made you!
-Stewie, it's not polite to point.

I'm so sorry.

That's okay, Lois.
He's just curious about the chair.

About 10 years ago I was investigating
a robbery at an orphanage.

JOE: <i>It was Christmas Eve</i>
<i>and some presents had been stolen.</i>

[Tense instrumental music]

[Grunting]

Reach for the sky, dirtbag!

All right, pal!
You've stolen your last Christmas.

[Exciting instrumental music]

"You think you have won
You think all is well

"But kiss my green ass
I shall see you in hell!"

[Screaming]

Are you Timmy?

Merry Christmas, Timmy.

Enough!

If you won't share your technological
schemata with me peaceably...

...I shall take the information
from you by force!

Wow. Looks like you have a fan.

-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Peter, you can't leave.

Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd...

...take them on a dream vacation
to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.

What are you talking about? We want to
hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.

He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.

Well, technically he was killed
by the state, but funny story.

He did curse my name
just before the injection.

LOIS: Peter, what's the matter with you?

Why are you guys making such a big deal
over Joe?

You don't admire wheelchair people.
You're supposed to feel sorry for them.

When did it become okay
to be handicapped?

Don't talk like that!

He's a remarkable man
and the rest of your family adores him!

Fine. Then why don't you all marry him?

And if he's so remarkable,
let's see him do this.

Hey, look at me. I'm walking.
I'm a remarkable man.

[People laughing next door]

Well, look who finally came home.

I thought you were gonna spend
all night at Joe's.

I could've.
That man has got magic fingers.

He found this one spot behind my ear, I...

Forget about it.
I thought my leg was never gonna stop.

I don't believe this.

My whole family worships the ground
that guy can't walk on.

It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero.
He makes the world a better place.

I've done lots of things to help people.

Remember the time I sang to the kids
at the Sunday school?

Yes, you forgot the words.

[Singing] "Jesus loves me

"He loves me a bunch

"Because He always puts Skippy

"In my lunch"

No. It's not the same thing.
Joe puts himself in real danger every day.

You're right.
I'll never be that kind of hero.

Unless I put myself in real danger, too!
For my family's sake!

BRIAN: Why are the pretty ones
always so dumb?

[Creepy instrumental music]

[Screaming]

[Cat squealing]

DISPATCH: <i>Gang shooting on</i>
<i>Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.</i>

Is it me or is rap music
just getting lazier?

No. It's my new police scanner.

This hero thing is gonna be easy
once I find the right crime.

DISPATCH: <i>Domestic disturbance--</i>
PETER: Boring!

DISPATCH: <i>Report of a stabbing in--</i>

DISPATCH: <i>All units! A major robbery</i>
<i>is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust.</i>

<i>Suspects are armed</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

-Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
-Over at Joe's.

Well, go fetch 'em.

They're about to see
a real hero in action. To the Batcave!

[Adventurous instrumental music]

[Bats crying]

PETER: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

PETER: You thought Joe was something.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

LOIS: Peter, what's the big rush?

All right, you guys wait right here.

Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal.

ROBBER 1:
Give Tammy a round of applause.

This was her first robbery
and she was very brave.

[Muted laugh]

Now before we go--

No, don't go.

Oh, princess, we have to.

PETER: I hope you brought
your striped pajamas, boys.

Because there's a five-year sleepover
at the big house. And you're invited.

ROBBER 2: You'll never take us alive!

[Gunshots]

Lois and the kids
should be in here to see this.

Yes. It's going very well.

Mom, what do you do when you like a boy
but he doesn't even notice you?

Meg loves Kevin.

Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!

Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl.
He'll come around.

Such a mom answer.

Have you tried showing off the goods?
How's that for a mom answer?

Creepy.

I saw some cute dresses down the street.

If nothing else, it'll make you
feel better. Come on, you guys.

BRIAN: If you want to be a hero,
now might be a good time.

This isn't what I was expecting.

I thought being a hero
would be all fun and games.

[Heroic instrumental music]

PETER: Sorry, Wonder Woman. I got
three kings. Now let's see your pair.

[Wonder Woman sighs]

All right. Robin, what are you looking
at me for? Look at her.

[Space whooshing]

ROBBER 2: Come on. Let's go.

<i>Oh, perfect.</i>

ROBBER 2: We got hostages!
Don't try anything funny!

Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.

Good. I was afraid
you were just gonna improvise.

Actually, I was gonna use
the little girl as a human shield...

...and run like hell.

But improvise,
that'll be easier on my back.

[Space whooshing]

Okay, in this improv, Tammy and
the short robber are husband and wife.

PETER: Okay. And where are we?
GUY: A bar!

MAN: A pet store!
GRANNY: Guadalajara, Mexico!

Okay, okay. I heard pet store.
And I'm the gruff but lovable owner.

All right. Begin. Hello, married couple.
I see you found a puppy.

Yeah. His name is Sparky.

PETER: Well, before you take Sparky home,
let me check him for worms.

Okay, drop it!

All right, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

COP: All right, stand back!

Whoa. Hang on. Sorry, no one can leave.

Listen, the whole reason I saved
you guys today was so I could be a hero.

This wheelchair guy moved in next door
and he can do all these great things and--

Your family idolizes the lousy cripple
and not you?

That's right! How'd you know?

We've all been there.

CHRIS: Cool! The bank is getting jacked!

LOIS: Officer, my husband's in there!

-Can you tell me if he's okay?
-What's he look like?

LOIS: He's wearing a white-collared shirt,
kind of big, with glasses.

COP: I got him.
LOIS: Oh, thank God.

-Take him out.
-No!

Check it out! It's John F Kennedy
Pez Dispenser.

Oh. Good thing I still have
my Bobby Kennedy Pez Dispenser.

Hey, there's my family.

I just want you to know I rob banks...

...because a deaf man stole my job
at the phone company.

So if anyone's gonna bust me,
I'm glad it's you.

[Tense instrumental music]

But... But I was gonna be a hero.

Nobody's going anywhere!

Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!

<i>A failed robbery at</i>
<i>Quahog Bank and Trust...</i>

<i>...has led to a terrifying </i>
<i>hostage situation.</i>

<i>That's right. A hostage situation.</i>

-I gotta go.
-I know.

If we want the cops to take us seriously,
we have to waste a hostage. But who?

-Excuse me. Shouldn't that be "whom"?
-Okay, you.

Crap!

JOE: <i>This is Police Lieutenant</i>
<i>Joe Swanson.</i><i>I know we can work this out.</i>

Not him again. I hope this place
isn't wheelchair accessible.

Bonnie, it's Peter.

Don't worry.
Joe's an excellent negotiator.

I was a virgin when we met.
It took him three hours.

I can't believe my dad is in there.

This'll probably scar me
for the rest of my life.

I got a new dress.

Try talking about him.

So do you like music?

Yeah! I played guitar
in a band before we moved.

But it interfered with my studies.
What do you listen to?

You first.

I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur.

My parents don't like me
listening to that stuff.

But I do anyway because I am not a robot!

I also like Radiohead.

<i>And even though society has turned</i>
<i>its back on you...</i>

<i>...I promise you there are </i>
<i>people who care.</i>

<i>And you know what? I'm one of them.</i>

He sure gets it.

Maybe he's right.
We can make a new start.

Come on, guys.

Don't let him sweet talk you like that.

Wait. You can't leave now.

PETER: I'm supposed to be the hero. Wait!

Can you let me pistol-whip you
a couple times for the camera?

Stupid robbers with your guns
and your make-out parties.

[Crowd cheering]

[Cops cheering]

Excellent!

They detached the human component
from the machine.

Machine, I am your new master
and I order you to go!

Engage!

Blast! Must be some kind of
proprietary command system.

Now on the Russian MiG,
it's next to the altimeter.

LOIS: There you are.
I can't turn my back on you for a second.

One day I shall unlock the secret
of that device.

And when I do, Mother, victory shall be--

Peter, you had us so worried.
What on earth were you trying to prove?

I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy.

I guess I was just tired of him
being your hero.

Peter, Joe is a hero.
But he's not our hero.

-You are.
-Really?

Yeah.

You're always right there on the couch
for us, making us laugh when we're upset.

Changing the channel
when something boring comes on.

Eating the last slice of pizza
so the rest of us don't fight over it.

Yeah, Daddy.
If you hadn't pulled this stunt...

...I wouldn't know
how to manipulate Kevin.

And when the kids at
school see us on TV...

...they'll think you're a total psycho.
And I can say, "That psycho is my dad!"

I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano,
had you not driven me...

...to the ice rink every
morning at 6:00 a.m.

I guess being a hero isn't always
about saving lives and catching bad guys.

It's also about just being there
for the people you love.

OLD WOMAN: Help!
Someone just stole my purse!

Who cares? I don't even know you.

[Theme music]
S01E06.en
Blasted matriarch!

She has failed once again to replenish
this frigid box with potations.

I shall give her a piece of my mind!

Damn it!

Now look here, you.... Oh, my God!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie.

What you saw was actually
a very beautiful thing.

Evidently, madam, you and I differ greatly
in our conception of beauty.

What I just witnessed
was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!

Stewie, mommies and daddies
like to hug each other that way.

In fact, sweetie,
that's sort of how you were created.

That is a vile and odious lie!

How dare you fill my head
with such loathsome propaganda?

Get out, you horrid woman!

Okay, honey. I'll go get your teddy bear.

[Stewie moaning]

Good Lord.
You saw them together, didn't you?

You know the tub
where you take your little baths?

They've done it there, too.

[Exclaiming]

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"He's a family guy"

What in the name of our Christian God?
You're out of the semicircle!

All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!

Why?

Why? Saunders, tell him why!

Because it's Rule 142-B!

Because it's Rule 142-B!

Good job, Scout.
Now drop and give me 20!

Thank you, sir!

Ladies, this Saturday at 0800
there will be a soapbox derby...

...as a reward for all your obedience.

[Scouts barking]

[Cheery TV theme music]

<i>Mom, Dad, I really like Potsie.</i>

<i>Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.</i>

<i>No, Mom. I mean, I really like Potsie.</i>

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
<i>We heard you the first time.</i>

<i>You have a homosexual attraction</i>
<i>to Potsie.</i>

Anything on that remote lower than mute?

I got a surprise for you, Chris.

It'll have to wait.
This is where the Fonz goes....

[Exclaiming]

[Exclaiming]

[Laughing]

Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.

Chris, this is the speed machine
that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.

But, Dad, I was supposed to
build it myself. It's a rule.

Come on. Rules were made to be broken.

[Peter grunts]

Here, let me show you the turbo booster.

Dad, what would you say if I told you
I didn't want to be in the Scouts?

I'd say come again?
And then I'd laugh because I said "come."

But thank God that's not the case.
You're a Scout.

And you know what that means?
That means I love you.

Meg?

Chris, get out of here!
You're not allowed in my room.

I thought that was just
when you were asleep.

What do you want?

I don't want to be in the Scouts anymore.
I just want to draw.

I was kinda hoping you could tell Dad.
But try and open with a joke.

Tell him yourself.

I can't.
I don't want to disappoint him again.

You remember when he tried to sneak me
into the County Fair?

One, please.

[Chris sneezes]

Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed!
And horses can't talk! No!

Nothing about this adds up at all!

Okay, look. Dad is really easy.
All you have to do is sit on his lap...

...give him a big kiss on the cheek, look
him right in the eye, and he's butter.

What the hell?

Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And I....
Wait a minute.

Chris, I am going to stand up,
walk out of this room...

...and we will never speak of this again.

[Moans]

[Exciting instrumental music]

Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha!

The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!

But Pops, I must race! Ha-ha!

Very well.
But I am not really your father! Ha-ha!

[Exclaiming]

[Crowd cheering]

Okay girls, get ready...

[Scouts making revving sounds]

...get set....

[Stammering]
Please God, I don't ask you for much.

But let my boy win this race.

Do not go until I wave my flag.
I can't stress that enough.

I'll wave it once
just to show you how it looks.

CHRIS: Look out!

LEADER: Griffin is disqualified!

[Leader grunting]

LEADER: Your boy is out of the Scouts!

Who died and made you President Nixon?

Look, it's been two years!

Your idiot son hasn't earned
a single merit badge.

If you'll excuse me,
I've got to administer some spankings.

Come on. Give him a little more time.

All right!
You've got three days to earn a badge!

Three days! That's tomorrow!
We gotta get going!

[Cheery instrumental music]

Stewie, look what
Mommy made for dessert.

Jell-O. How exotic!
I feel like I'm on the deck of the <i>QE II</i>.

Me and Chris will take ours to go.

We've only got one more night
to get that badge.

Dad, maybe we should just give up.
I mean, we tried everything.

We almost got that one for insect study.

Look, Chris.
It's a whole family of WASPs.

My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.

Perhaps I can't bake a ham.

But what I can cook up is a little
grace and civility at the table.

Patty, did you know that your mother
is a whore?

I think it's great that you and Chris've
been spending so much time together.

But he's the one
who should be earning that badge.

Where do you get off telling me
how to raise my son?

Right. Okay.
We'll try it your way, honey.

[Laughing nervously]

PETER: There's my Scout!

Not anymore, Dad. I'm out.

They made me turn in my uniform
and everything.

What? Those bastards!
Don't you worry. I'll get you back in!

It's okay, Dad. I'm not really--

Don't take no for an answer, Chris.
You're a Griffin.

And a Griffin never knows when to stop.

PETER: Clear!

PETER: Clear!

[Gasping]

You saved my life, Doctor!

PETER: Clear!

I'm calling that troop leader.
We're going over his head.

Straight to the Scout head office
in New York.

Pack your bags, you guys!
The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!

Ha-ha! Did you hear?
The Griffins are going to New York!

This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!

I can't believe we're going to New York.

Dad, you don't really have to do this.

Yes, I do. No boy of mine is gonna get
booted out of the Scouts.

[Chris moans]

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Strapping you in, honey,
so you don't get hurt.

So I don't get hurt.

That's the best you can do,
you dull-witted termagant?

I brought your Raffi tape.

Play <i>Wheels on the Bus</i>
and get the hell out of my sight.

Where's Brian?

Aren't you coming?

No, thanks. I've been to New York.

It's like Prague sans the whimsy.

Will you be okay by yourself?

I think I'll manage.

All right, you guys. We're off!

Those Scouts are never gonna know
what hit them.

And neither will that guy.

[Tires squealing]

[Adventurous instrumental music]

Okay. I'm thinking of a movie.

-Is it an action movie?
-No.

-Is it a musical?
-No.

-Is it a good movie?
-It has its moments.

-<i>Cool Runnings</i>.
-Right!

Would you please ask for directions?

We are not lost. And even if we were...

...I can't ask a human being
for directions.

-Why not?
-Because I'm a man.

Haven't you ever seen
a stand-up comedian, Lois?

Dad, maybe we should go home.

No way.
We came to get you back into the Scouts.

And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

[Gurgling]

-What was that?
-Nothing.

[Gurgling]

Peter, the car is making funny noises.

You're wrong again, Lois.
That wasn't the car.

Although you were right
about that prune smoothie.

Are you okay?

I'll be fine.
I just have to concentrate on driving.

Excuse me.
Can you tell me how to get to New York?

Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am?

Don't you want to play first?

Thank you.
But I really don't approve of gambling.

Technically it's not really gambling.

We're trying to rebuild

PETER: Where's your mother?

Over there.

I didn't know you knew how to play poker.

-Yeah.
-How you doing?

-Yeah.
-That's good, honey. Let's go.

Yeah.

It's funny. I never knew video poker
could be so much fun.

You win a few hands
and all those lights go off.

And you just feel so good inside.

Yeah, gambling is great.
No question about it.

It felt so good.
I kept putting my money in.

And before I knew it, I'd lost $40.
I'm so embarrassed.

That's okay.
As long as you learned your lesson.

I did, Peter, for a couple of minutes.
Then....

This is so silly.
I started playing again.

I could swear I parked here.

Yeah, you did.
But here's the really silly thing, Peter.

I sort of bet our car.

[Exclaiming]

I won't panic.
I need to go back in the casino...

...and find a high roller who'll pay
$1 million to sleep with my wife.

What? That's ridiculous!

These people took $24
for the island of Manhattan.

They have no idea what things are worth!

MEG: Nice going, Mom.

I finally get my driver's license
and you lose the car to a poker machine.

How ironic.

Don't talk about your mother that way.
She is not an iron.

<i>to get to New York...</i>

<i>...and get Chris back into the Scouts.</i>

But Dad--

I got it.
I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

[Phone ringing]

[Brian laughing]

<i>Damn it, Julie!</i>
<i>I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.</i>

<i>I am just going away for the weekend.</i>

SCHNEIDER: <i>Yeah. All the away.</i>

[TV audience laughing]

[Hooting]

Damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

No answer at the house.
You didn't bet that, too, did you?

I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish.

It just seemed like such a good cause.

Everyone in the tribe gets a share
in the casino's profits.

-What did you just say?
-"I'm sorry."

-After that.
-"I feel foolish."

-After that.
-"Casino's profits."

-Before that.
-"Everyone in the tribe."

The whole thing.

"Everyone in the tribe
shares the profit?"

That's it! Let's go!

I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.

But we're not allowed
to return gambling losses.

I think you can make an exception

in our case, Lenny.
See, I'm an Indian, too.

LENNY AND LOIS: Excuse me?

You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe.

And that entitles me to a share
of your wampum, kemosabe.

Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
Tell me of your history, of your past.

I come from a long line of you people.

My great-grandfather's name
was Jeep Grand Cherokee.

I mean, Chief Grand Cherokee.
He was a rainmaker.

[Native singing]

[Singing]
"I'm so happy doing the neutron dance

"I'm just burning doing the neutron dance"

And he also killed a bunch of Krauts
at Wounded Knee.

So are you gonna
give me back my car, or what?

I have to confer with the council
of the elders. You wait here.

Are you nuts, Peter?
You'll never get away with this.

Why not? I've fooled people before.

You remember that time
I pretended to be gay?

[Cheery TV music]

There is no way
they're gonna believe you're an Indian.

LENNY: He's an Indian.

How do you know?

-I can tell.
-You think everyone's an Indian.

He could just be another moocher.

Maybe we can put him through a test.

Like a really impossible stunt
to prove he's the real deal.

Way to think outside the box, Frank.

To prove you are truly a member of our
tribe, you must go on a vision quest.

Do you know what a vision quest is?

Of course I do. I'm an Indian.
But why don't you explain it to my wife?

She's a little slow in the head.

A vision quest is a sacred
spiritual journey.

Your husband must go out
in the wilderness without food or water.

-Or shoes.
-Yeah. Or shoes.

He must remain there
until he can communicate with nature.

<i>He must hear the wisdom</i>
<i>of the rocks and trees.</i>

<i>And then his guiding spirit</i>
<i>must appear to him...</i>

...and reveal a great personal truth.

And it's gotta be a real vision.

We're Indians.
We're gonna know if he's lying.

[Howling ominously]

[Laughing]

Sucker.

LOIS: Peter, please don't do this.
We can buy another car.

I'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.

Come on.
All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision.

I've had one before.

Oh, my God, Brian.
There's a message in my Alpha Bits.

It says "Ooooo."

Peter, those are Cheerios.

You must begin your journey now.

-Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
-Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.

-Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
-Thanks, Meg.

Yipes.

Dad, can I come?

-How about it, Lenny?
-What the hey? The more the merrier.

Now get the hell out of here, you nut,
and go have yourself a spiritual vision.

[Mysterious instrumental music]

Water! Thank God!

CHRIS: Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
PETER: Of course not.

This isn't the first time
I found my own food in the wild.

[Girl humming]

[Peter shouting]

[Girl screams]

[Laughing]

Dumb broad.

[Screaming]

[Wolf growling]

They've been gone for over six hours.

How long do these vision quests
usually take?

It varies.

It depends on the person's age,
and height, and sign.

You have no idea, do you?

Of course I.... No.

Why would you send
my husband and son out...

...into the wilderness without
any food or supplies?

Because we really like your car?

[Lois sighs]

They're dead, you know.

[Wolves howling]

Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours.

Can't feel my eyes.

Wonder if club-footed midgets
get justice in heaven.

TREE 1: Hot enough for you?

What?

I say, "Hot enough for you?"

Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God!
I'm communicating with nature!

Tree, if one of you falls and there's
no one around, do you make a noise?

Are you kidding? Scott fell last week.

-He hasn't shut up about it since.
-Sure. Stand there and bitch!

But would any of you take the time
to help me?

I'm playing
the world's smallest violin, Scott.

FONZIE: Yo, Griffin!

The Fonz!

[Exclaiming]

What are you doing here?

Shouldn't you be in the middle
of a Tuscadero sandwich?

Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see?

I want to lay a little
personal truth on you.

Now, Mr. C was like a father to me.

And he always listened, you know?

And Griffin, right now, your son needs
you to listen to him. Whoa!

Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie?

There's something I always wanted
to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.

-Did you ever get a sexual disease?
-Herpes twice. And the clap.

[Exclaiming]

Dad? Can I talk to you?

Not now, son!

Sure. Go right ahead.

I don't want to be a Scout, Dad.
I just don't have fun there.

-I guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
-Yeah!

-Dad, this is what I really like to do.
-What? You want to draw?

Son, why don't you
just stick a knife in my heart?

-I mean, so you drew this?
-Yeah. I know they suck.

Not all of them.
Some of these look pretty good.

-Really?
-Yeah!

I didn't know anyone in this family
had any talent.

Except for that one thing
your mother does.

-You mean play the piano?
-No. She.... Yeah.

I probably don't say this often enough.

But I'm really proud of you, Chris.

Thanks, Dad.

[Singing] "And the cat's in the cradle
with the silver spoon

"little boy blue and the man in the moon

"When you coming home, Dad?
I don't know when

"But we'll get together then, son
You know we'll have a--"

Oh, my God!

TREES: Fire!

Let's get out of here!

TREE: Run, you stupid bastards!

Peter? Chris? Thank God. Are you okay?

Fantastic, Lois! I saw my guiding spirit.

Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?

It was amazing! I spoke to the trees.
And I saw the Fonz.

Really? What's the Fonz like?
I bet he's stuck up.

A little. But thanks to him,
me and Chris have never been closer.

I want a spiritual vision, too! Man!

I guess we've lost touch
with our noble roots.

I mean, sure this casino's brought
our tribe money and prosperity.

-But what is the price of our souls?
-$6 million a week.

That sounds right.
Take your crappy car back.

Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.

All right! We did it!
Let's get the hell out of here.

Stupid, greedy savages!

Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say.

This one particular tribe
has lost their way.

But most Native Americans are proud...

...hardworking people
who are true to their spiritual heritage.

They are certainly not savages.

That's funny, Mother.

Just this morning you said they were lazy
like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.

The Mexicans are a clean and industrious
people with a rich cultural heritage.

Yeah. Not like those dumb,
gargantuan Swedes.

Actually, the Swedish people run
the gamut from very short to tall.

And did you know that Sweden gave us
the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel?

Yeah. Which is more than we ever got
from those freeloading Canadians.

Canada sucks.

[Theme music]
S01E07.en
Come on, everyone.

The <i>Eight is Enough</i> reunion show
is about to start.

<i>Mary, have you seen Nicholas?</i>

<i>He's up in his room sulking, Dad.</i>

<i>Yeah. He's still upset</i>
<i>because Abby threw out his baseball cards.</i>

<i>Maybe I should make him a sandwich.</i>

[Laughing]

<i>Dad. That's your solution to everything.</i>

[Sister crying]

<i>Dad!</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Eight is enough.</i>

[Laughing]

<i>You know, I love you girls.</i>

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Splendid.

That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses
will make a serviceable parachute...

...should I need to abandon
my jet in mid-flight.

Once it's built, of course.

Rupert, did you call that engineer
at Lockheed yet?

No, of course you didn't,
you worthless little....

There! See what you made me do?
Do you think I enjoy hitting you?

Actually, I do. I enjoy it so much
I'm going to do it again!

Stewie! My clothes are not for you
to play with, understand?

Thanks for telling me, Brian.

I don't know what we'd do without you.

I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to
hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.

You prance about this house
like the cock of the walk.

But will you be prancing
when there's nothing to prance about?

Will you be prancing then?

You just want to eat him up.

MEG: It is so hot out there!

How hot is it?

I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.

I don't get it.

I think I'm a little sweaty.

You! You seem to know all the players
in this poorly-acted farce.

What do they call that one?

That's Meg, dude. You know that.

Meg! You vile-smelling girl,
you're not to touch any of my things!

You understand me? Dirty girl.

DIANE: <i>Meanwhile, here at home....</i>

<i>...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip</i>
<i>of a freak heat wave</i>.

<i>I don't think you should use</i>
<i>the word "freak".</i>

<i>Some people might find it offensive.</i>

-Finish your oatmeal, son.
-Why bother? I'm just a freak!

<i>We're all a little different, Diane.</i>
<i>Each of us.</i>

<i>Good point.</i>

<i>We're even feeling the effects</i>
<i>of this heat wave here in our studio</i>.

[Sneezing] <i>Freak.</i>
<i>So stay inside and stay cool.</i>

I think I saw one of her nipples!

Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple."

I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Am I to strut about all day like
a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?

Fetch me something linen to throw on
before I call Child Services!

Please don't threaten Mommy.
She's very hot.

Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!

Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly!

Check this out, you guys.

PETER: The Rhode Island Dog Show
Championship is in Quahog this year!

-First prize is $500!
-Really?

If you won, we could use that money
for a new air conditioner.

Brian. You could win for sure.

You could do your impression
of a barbershop quartet.

[Singing] "We were sailing along

"On Moonlight Bay

"We could hear the voices singing

"They seemed to say"

Sorry. I don't do dog shows.
It's not my thing.

Come on.
All you gotta do is a few simple commands.

And maybe a trick or two.
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

[Baby gurgling]

Please, Brian.

I don't know. I mean
I don't even know where my papers are.

Can't you get the money another way?

I've been trying.
That's why I went on that game show.

For $800, this chemical dye is found
in over 95% of all cosmetic products.

Diarrhea.

[Laughter]

What?

Sorry. What is Diarrhea?

Come on, Brian.
We really need a new air conditioner.

[Groaning]

Okay, let's go over the commands.

Sit.

Good. Roll over.

I'm already shvitzing like crazy here.
Let's call it a night.

Do you want to win this thing or not?

We haven't even talked
about how you'll wear your ears.

I was thinking up.

I need a cocktail.

Don't push too hard, Peter.

You gotta take Brian's feelings
into consideration.

After all, it's only a dog show.

Lois, honey, I love you...

...but you're sucking all the energy
out of the room.

[Knocking on door]

Come.

I got you a little something for the show.

It's Italian. Do you like it?

It's exquisite.

It's not for every day.

Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.

I know how hard you've been working.

And the whole family appreciates it.

Thank you, Lois.

I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs
whenever you're ready.

And Brian...

...you look very handsome.

[Inhales deeply]

Showtime!

ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome to the Quahog Dog</i>
<i>Show. Today's competition will be...</i>

<i>...almost as hot as the weather,</i>
<i>which is once again in the triple digits.</i>

[Bird squawks]

Peter, I'm not really comfortable
with all this.

Do I know you?

I don't think I can do this.

You can't back out now. How about a pill?

-Something to relax you before you go on?
-Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?

Not drugs. Just a little blue thing
celebrities take to help them perform.

Well, those celebrities are wrong!

Lois, if Liza is wrong,
then I don't want to know what right is.

STAGEHAND:
Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!

Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle!
It's time to make life a cabaret!

Lady, for God's sake, I'm just
a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!

[Grunting]

You there, child-woman!

I'll give you a shiny dime
if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.

Let me see if I can find you a juice box.

And get the lead out, pudgy!

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".</i>

We're off to a good start.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

ANNOUNCER: <i>A beautiful performance</i>
<i>from "Brain" Griffin!</i>

Go, Brian!

[Crowd applauding]

All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.

What the hell is this?

This? This is the part
where you beg for a treat.

I don't think so.

Brian, you're embarrassing me.

God, he can't expect Brian to do that.

It's easier than it looks, Mom.

Come on, Brian. We had a deal.

Yeah? The deal's off.

Me and the little shred of dignity
I have left will be waiting in the car!

Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me!

I now command you to leave.

Keep going. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.

[Giggling]

How could you let me down
like that, Brian?

I let you down?
Because I refused to demean myself...

...by perpetuating the stereotype
of the good dog?

This is the one thing I ever asked you
to do for us.

This and not do that thing where you
drag your ass across the carpet.

One time I did that!

Peter, Brian, please.

Let's just have a nice family car ride
like we always do.

Yeah.
Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding.

There's no reason to involve
the insurance companies.

I should still take down your information.

Really? You could probably just
buff that out.

Yeah, but I....

I would really feel better
if I got your information.

Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong.

Maybe you really don't care
about this family.

If you cared about me, you'd never
ask me to do something so degrading.

The next time I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it. Understand?

Who wants to sing show tunes?
"In old...."

BRIAN: Stop the car.

PETER: Is that what you want?
Because I'll stop.

BRIAN: Pull over now.
PETER: Fine.

God. Brian, don't do this.

Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad.

Quick! Back up!

[Sorrowful instrumental music]

Great. Is there a problem, Officer?

Can I see your license, boy?

"Boy"?

Oh, God. I left it on my other collar.

-You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
-Look, the name is Brian.

I was just out for a little walk.
That's all.

Without a leash.

I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down
on the sidewalk. Down!

I don't believe this.

I don't suppose you could let us off
with a warning?

Sorry, sir.
But leash laws are for his own good.

The fine is $10.
You behave, little fella, you hear me?

[Slave voice]
Lordy, I'll never roam again!

Jackass.

He's the law outside this house
just like I'm the law inside this house.

-And you better start obeying both of us.
-Look at you.

Big man, can't even afford to buy
an air conditioner for your family.

What a bitch.

DIANE: <i>Good morning Quahog.</i>
<i>The heat wave has finally broken.</i>

<i>It sure has. You know what they say,</i>
<i>"If you don't like...</i>

<i>"...the weather in New England,</i>
<i>go back where you came from."</i>

<i>I don't think that's the expression.</i>

<i>I guess I had too many</i>

[Belching]

<i>God. I hope the boss isn't watching.</i>

[Laughing]

I don't know how those two manage
to be so perky in the morning.

Something smells good.

Homemade cinnamon buns
fresh from the tube.

[Giggling]

Nothing says "I love you"
like something from--

What the hell are you doing,
you crazy bitch?

These oughta cheer Brian up.
Cinnamon buns are his favorite.

Really?

I could've sworn his favorite was
"treat Peter like crap" buns.

LOIS: Good morning, Brian.

My, your summer coat is really
coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?

Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo
I bought you. It cost a little extra.

But I would do anything for you, Brian.

I'll be on the veranda
since you're already on the cross.

Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.

May I have one on a plate or is
Peter planning to balance it on my nose?

Peter, Brian, stop this.

Can't you two go back to the way
you used to be?

[Ragtime music playing]

We can't go back to the way things were
after how I was treated.

-Not after the things I've seen.
-What did you see? Was it breasts?

Get over it, Brian. I mean,
how bad do you really have it here?

-When I found you, you were just a stray.
-You swore you would never speak of that.

No, thank you. I just had it cleaned.

No. Jeez.

All set, sir.

I don't have any change. Sorry.

That's okay. No charge.

[Sad instrumental music]

Wait.

[Stammering]

You hungry?

Because my wife makes
this beef-a-roni casserole.

Out of this world.

Look, you got everything
you could possibly want right here.

Now just eat your cinnamon bun
and stop being a bad dog.

How dare you?

How dare I?
Where do you think you're going?

Out!

You're not going anywhere
without your leash!

I don't need your damn leash, or you!

<i>I'm going for a walk.</i>

Don't worry.
He won't get far without this.

And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered.

What? That. Yeah.
I'll clean that up on my way out.

See that sign?

Now why don't you go tie yourself
up to that parking meter?

I don't want any trouble.

<i>Mom, have you ever had</i>
<i>a problem with freshness?</i>

<i>What do you mean, honey?</i>

<i>You know. </i>
<i>Have you ever felt not so fresh?</i>

<i>I don't follow you.</i>

<i>Have you ever felt like you're dirty?</i>

That was Brian's favorite commercial.

"Brian"? No, it's not ringing a bell.

Stop it! We all miss him.

Go find him, apologize,
and bring him home.

You heard him. He doesn't want
to be a part of this family.

We don't need him. We'll get another pet.

No way, Dad.
No one can take Brian's place.

STEWIE: Silence!

That mongrel is probably decomposing
on the side of a dirt road as we speak!

-Let's get a kitty!
-See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.

-I don't know, Peter.
-Lois, trust me.

We'll get a lovable kitty-cat
and everybody will feel a lot better.

[Hissing]

PETER: Here, kitty, kitty.
Come on down nice and easy.

That's a good kitty.

[Gasping]

What the hell was that?

Something near a window.
Preferably a booth.

Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans
in the kitchen!

Yeah, that's authentic Italian.

BRIAN: Don't do that.
That's what they expect you to do.

Okay, fine for you.
But what about your puppies?

<i>And your puppies' puppies?</i>
<i>Am I the only one who's outraged here?</i>

I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

How come you're still setting
a place for Brian?

Because when he comes home, I want
him to know he never left our thoughts.

I know you're thinking about him,
too, Peter.

Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me.
Besides, we have a new pet.

And we love our fluffy kitty.

Gross.
Did he just drink from the fountain?

Hey, you!

COP: Stay!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Shouting]

Joyce DeWitt?
So that's where you've been.

Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside.
No dogs allowed in the bus station.

My blind guy's in the john.

I'll point him in your direction.

PETER: Brian's tennis ball.

Man, he loved to play with this thing.

REFEREE: Double fault!

Come on, Brian.

Peter, why don't you
just admit you miss Brian?

You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding?
This family needs Brian. I need him.

[Cat howling]

God, I hate this freaking cat.

Can you spare some change?

Why? So you can go buy yourself
another bottle of booze?

Why don't you make something
of your life, like this dog?

That's me! I mean, that was me.

MAN: Yeah, sure.

No, I mean it. That was me.

Get away from me, you crazy animal!

You want me to be a crazy animal?
Okay, I'm a crazy animal!

Stop! Help!

Help!

BRIAN: All right, who wants to be next?
You? You?

Brian!

PETER: I'm here to bring you...

COP: You're going downtown, pal.

...home.

Hi. How's it going?

Oh, God. I know karate!

[Kung fu noises]

[Dog growling]

Look! A tasty little baby!

I see somebody's been neutered.

Come on, sugar. It's time.

Thank God.

He's cute. Aren't you precious?
Lethal injection. Next!

-What?
-Oh, no!

You can't do this!

Who's up for a little lunch?
Something festive.

Did someone say Tex-Mex?

I'm sorry, sugar.

Help me.

Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

I'll get us the best help there is.

PETER: <i>"Dear MacGuyver....</i>

<i>"Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip,</i>
<i>and a drinking straw.</i>

<i>"Please save my dog."</i>

You're looking well.

Don't get too close.
They say I'm dangerous.

That's why the man's gonna put me down.

Don't say that, Brian.
Peter is working on your appeal.

You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.

I may have been born with my eyes closed,
but now I see the world for what it is.

I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.

Great news!
The City Council agreed to hear your case!

BRIAN: You're kidding! If I prepare
my case, I might have a chance after all.

I don't know how to thank you.

We're family.
This is what we do for each other.

Right, Peter?

LOIS: Peter, don't stare!

[Intense instrumental music]

Good luck, sweetness.

Thanks, Felicia.

This meeting was called...

...to review the judgment
in <i>City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin</i>.

Justice, for all? Or for some?

Does a dog not feel?

If you scratch him,
does his leg not shake?

Yes, he is man's best friend.
But what manner of friend is man?

I would like to cite the case of
<i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>....

Wait a minute.
Why are we listening to a dog?

Take him away!

Does not every dog have his day?

Wait! Please! I gotta say something!

Look, all Brian's ever wanted
is the same respect he gives us.

That and Snausages.
He's mental for those Snausages.

And sure, sometimes we have arguments,
like when he's sleeping on the bed and...

...Lois is in the "oodmay"
but Brian won't "amscray."

-Peter....
-Okay.

Look. The point is, he's a member
of our family first and a dog second.

And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy.

Sometimes we all need a second chance.

Sometimes we all need to forgive!

I stole $10 from Meg's room!

I stole $10 from Mom's purse!

I've been making counterfeit $10 bills
for years.

Mr. Griffin,
this dog is a danger to society.

Albeit an articulate and charismatic one.

But the law is the law and can't
be circumvented by pretty words.

I'll give you each $20.

Deal. He can go.

[All cheering]

STEWIE: Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!

[Triumphant instrumental music]

No. Let him go.

Anybody want more pizza rolls?

Yeah. Quiet, Lois. <i>Murder She Wrote</i>.

<i>Charles Montrose, after all these years.</i>

<i>Jessica Fletcher! Why I haven't seen </i>
<i>you since you had the....</i>

<i>You can say it, Charles.</i>
<i>I'm not ashamed. Abortion.</i>

So she's the murderer!

Come on, kids. Bedtime.

Good night, Brian. And welcome home.

CHRIS: Good night, you guys.
MEG: Good night.

-Dog?
-Yeah?

If you ever tell anyone about that,
I will kill you.
