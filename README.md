<i>Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes</i>
<i>in Greg's jacket.</i>

<i>-Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?</i>
<i>-No, Dad.</i>

<i>He's lying. There's no doubt about that.</i>

<i>Greg, I'm afraid your punishment</i>
<i>will be four hours in the snakepit.</i>

<i>That'll give you time to think about</i>
<i>what you did.</i>

<i>Man!</i>

<i>That'll teach him.</i>

<i>Jan, I'm afraid you've earned</i>
<i>a day in the fire chamber...</i>

<i>...for tattling on your brother.</i>

Smoking. How does
a boy like that go so wrong?

-They live in a crummy neighborhood.
-The Bradys?

Yeah. They got robbers, thugs,
drug dealers. You name it.

You folks want some pancakes?

PETER: No, thanks. See, that's the worst
we got is Jemima's Witnesses.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin.
Can I please get collagen injections?

Meg, you don't need to change
the way you look.

You know, most of the world's problems
stem from poor self-image.

[Polka music playing in gym]

[Man and women laughing]

[Growling]

Excellent! The mind-control device
is nearing completion!

LOIS: Stewie, I said no toys at the table.

Damn you, vile woman!

You've impeded my work since the day
I escaped from your wretched womb.

Don't pout, honey. When you were born...

...the doctor said you were
the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.

But, of course. That was my victory day.
The fruition of my deeply-laid plans...

...to escape from that cursed ovarian
bastille! Return the device, woman!

No toys, Stewie.

Very well, then.

Mark my words, when you least expect it,
your uppance will come!

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Mom, can I turn the heat up?

Don't touch the thermostat, Meg.
Your father gets upset.

Come on. This thing goes up to 90.

Who touched the thermostat?

God, how does he always know?

Brain implant, Meg.
Every father's got one.

Tells you when the kids mess
with the dial.

GUY: My thing went off!
Your thermostat okay?

-Yeah, it's all right.
-Is my kid over here?

Forget it! False alarm!

BRIAN: Ass ahoy.

Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got
your pants on. What's the occasion?

He's going to a stag party.

Lois, I work hard all week
to provide for this family.

I am the man of the house.

As the man, I order you
to give me permission to go to this party.

Look, at least promise me you won't drink.
Alcohol always leads to trouble.

Come on. You're worrying about nothing.

Remember when you got drunk
off the Communion wine at church?

And so the Lord God smote poor Job...

...with festering boils all over his body.

Man, I hate it when he tells this story.

PRIEST: Yet, miraculously,
Job was still able to retain his dignity.

-Is that really the blood of Christ?
-Yes.

Man, that guy must've been wasted
24 hours a day.

And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

Butter Rum's my favorite.

Remember you had an Irish coffee
the day we went to see <i>Philadelphia</i>?

[Audience crying]

I got it. That's the guy from <i>Big</i>.
Tom Hanks, that's it.

Funny guy, Tom Hanks.
Everything he says is a stitch.

<i>I have AIDS.</i>

-Promise me, Peter.
-Lois, honey, I promise.

Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch
these lips tonight.

Who wants to play Drink The Beer?

Right here.

-You win.
-All right. What do I win?

Another beer!

I'm going for the high score!

Actually, Charlie's got the high score.

Man. Your clock won't flush.

I feel kind of bad, guys.
I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.

-Don't feel bad, Peter.
-Gee. I never thought of it like that.

Did you bring the porno?

Did I bring the porno?
You're gonna love it. It's a classic.

<i>Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out...</i>

<i>...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.</i>
<i>Not today or tomorrow.</i>

RICK: <i>But soon,</i>

Come on, Ilsa! Get on it!

[Funky music on TV]

NARRATOR:
<i>The statue was a gift from France.</i>

What is this?

Man. My kid must've taped
over this for history class.

[Groans]

The Statue of Liberty?
What are we gonna do?

-Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.
-That's just crazy enough to work.

Meg, finish your pancakes.

-Chris, elbows off your father.
-Thanks, son.

37 beers. You're setting
a great example for the kids, Peter.

Yeah. A new family record.
Way to raise the bar, Dad.

Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.

Kids, Daddy only drank
so the Statue of Liberty...

...would take her clothes off.

-What did you promise me last night?
-I wouldn't drink at the stag party.

-And what did you do?
-Drank at the stag....

I almost walked right into that one. God!

Feels like accountants
are cranking adding machines in my head.

[Machines whirring]

Dick, you ever wonder
what's outside those walls?

That's dangerous thinking, Paul.
You best stick to your work.

Okay.

You see, Peter?
A hangover is nature's way

of telling you I was right. I mean....

MEG: Mom, are you all right?

LOIS: My goodness. This chair leg
was loose. Isn't that silly?

I could've broken my neck.

Damn!

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Honey. I took a cab home,
I slept on the table...

...so I wouldn't wake you up.
Nothing bad happened.

I guess you're right.

Apology accepted.
All right, I'm going to work.

Somebody's gotta put food on this table.

How are you coming, Johnson?

Mr. Weed, I've been working
on the new G.I. Jew line.

And as you can see, they look great.

<i>You call these bagels?</i>

I'm glad he's on our side!

[Snoring]

MR. WEED: Peter!
PETER: What?

Are you sleeping on the job?

No. There's a bug in my eye
and I'm trying to suffocate him.

Peter, I like you. But I need you to be
more than just eye candy around here.

It's your job to watch for toys
that could be hazardous to kids.

-Now, look sharp!
-Yes, sir!

[Snoring]

[Foreboding instrumental music]

And now back to <i>Action News 5</i>.
Our top story tonight, "When Toys Attack."

Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.

Quite a situation we've got here, Tom,
indeed, Diane.

The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company
of Quahog, Rhode Island...

...has released highly unsafe
products into the retail market.

Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball!

Boy! A Pound Poochie!

Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.

Peter, I'm appalled.

Your negligence has damaged
this company's reputation.

You're fired!

Jeez. For how long?

[Sad instrumental music]

My God! You got fired?

-Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
-How do you know about the machine?

PETER: Don't worry.
I'll still put food on this table.

Just not as much.
So it might get a little competitive.

Who cares about food? Now we'll never
be able to afford my lip injections!

BRIAN: Can we put her
out in the yard for a while?

LOIS: Okay, who's hungry?

Jeez. How the hell
am I gonna break this to Lois?

If she finds out I got fired for drinking,
she's gonna blame me!

DEVIL: Lie to her. It's okay to
lie to women. They're not people like us.

I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy?

[Cars honking]

Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.

This is perfect!

Look, I don't want your mom to worry,
all right?

When she worries, she says,
"I told you so" and:

"Stop doing that. I'm asleep."
So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?

Not a word to your mom
about me getting canned.

LOIS: What's that, Peter?

-Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
-What?

Meg, honey, can you pass
the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?

LOIS: Peter, are you feeling okay?

I feel great! I haven't
got a job in the world.

All right, then let's eat.

I know you all hate eggplant, but....

What on earth was that?

What the deuce are you staring at?
It's tuna fish...

...and nothing else.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

How's your job search going?

It sucks, Brian. I've already
been through two jobs this week.

I got fired off of that commercial.

DIRECTOR: Try it again.
PETER: "I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs."

DIRECTOR: No, damn it! Take 26!

Then I had that job as the sneeze guard
for that restaurant's salad bar.

Take it outside, lady.

I thought I could win money
in that talent show.

EMCEE: <i>And the prize goes</i>
<i>to The von Trapp Family Singers!</i>

That is bull....

[Loud applause]

Peter, I know it's a
dangerous precedent...

...but you might want to tell
Lois the truth.

What? That I can't provide for my family?
That she's always right?

That I didn't stand up to a tank
in Tiananmen Square?

Screw this!
I just came over to buy some fireworks!

You can't keep lying to her
about losing your job.

Eventually, she'll find out
where you're going every day.

Yeah.

[Bells and music on TV]

Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll tell her tonight.

[Crickets chirping]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Mellow instrumental music]

Victory is mine!

LOIS: I'll need the checkbook
in the morning.

I'm going to Stop 'N Shop
for some sweet corn.

You're spending money on food again?

Lois, we just had dinner.

I enjoyed it so much,
I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.

Since when are you so concerned
about our food budget?

I just....

Lois, this is really hard
for me to say, but....

What is it, Peter?

-You're getting kind of fat.
-What?

It's just.... It's not healthy.

Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape
three times a week.

When was the last time you saw your toes?

I thought you people were
supposed to be jolly.

Peter, what the hell is the
matter with you?

Honey, if there's something wrong,
you can tell me.

-Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss?
-Thank God you're here. What do I do?

Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.

I don't know.

Where's the other guy?

[Cars honking]

This is unbelievable!

I promise you, everything's fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

STEWIE: Well, well, Mother!
We meet again!

Stewie, I thought
I tucked you in an hour ago.

Not tightly enough it would seem.
And now you contemptible harpy...

...I shall end your reign
of matriarchal tyranny.

LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey.

Right now it's bedtime.

Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!

PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo.

You have the power to end this!

How'd she take it?

I told her she was fat.

No.

I hate lying to Lois. It's just....

It's the best way to keep
her from the truth.

You have no choice.
Your unemployment will dry up soon.

She'll probably sense something's amiss
when they repossess your house.

You really oughta think
of your family's welfare.

Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

Okay, do you have any disabilities,
past injuries, physical anomalies?

I didn't have gas
for the first time until I was 30.

[Breaks wind]

What the hell was that?

PETER: Guys, our money problems are over!
We're officially on welfare.

Come on, help me scatter car parts
on the front lawn.

How much are we getting?

Let's see. $150 a week.

Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.

[Uplifting instrumental music]

Whoops.

No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.

I was giving a piano lesson.

Stewie, why don't you play
in the other room?

Why don't you burn in hell?

No dessert for you, young man.

Who would've thought getting drunk
would get me...

...$150,000 a week from the government?

This is why I don't vote.

Maybe somebody down there
was drinking, too.

Mr. President, why do you think
the public supports you...

...during these impeachment proceedings?

Probably because you're so fat.

Peter, you might want to call
the Welfare Commission.

That check is obviously an oversight.

Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like
their one millionth customer.

BRIAN: What?
You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?

-Yeah.
-On what?

LOIS: Oh, my God!
Peter, you bought the statue of David?

No. I just rented it.
But they're gonna be ticked.

The penis broke off
while I was loading it into the car.

I shall call you "Eduardo."

Peter, how can we afford this?

You won't believe it, Mom!
Dad's getting--

A big raise!

Peter, that's wonderful!

But, Dad, I thought--

The kind of raise that'll allow me
to give my kids a big allowance...

...just for keeping their big mouths shut.
Come on, guys.

I'll buy us
the most expensive meal we've ever had.

Yeah. I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas,
please.

CLERK: <i>I beg your pardon?</i>

6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas.

And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.

Peter, what's the big surprise?

You know how I always said
you should be treated like a queen?

I got you your own jester.

JESTER: Good to be here in New England.

And what's the deal
with "New" England anyway?

It's over 200 years old!
Last time I checked, that's not that new.

This is great.

I can finally afford to give my little
girl the lips she's always dreamed of.

MEG: Thank you, Daddy!

[Kisses Peter]

I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing.

But did you have to buy
breast implants for Chris?

It makes him happy.

These are cool.

MAILWOMAN: When did you get a pool?

It's a moat.

I know it's silly...

...but my husband thinks our family
needs extra protection now that...

...we're rich.

Does it work?

It does keep the Black Knight at bay.

[Horse sputtering]

Congratulations in all your success.
Here's your welfare check.

What the....

[Foghorn blowing]

Hi, honey.

What?

PETER: I know what I did was wrong.
But I only did it for you and the kids.

Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
That was for Peter.

Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
I am so mad I can't see straight.

No problem.
We got money to get that fixed...

...with enough left for us
to buy our way

out of any trouble our kids
might get into.

Just like the Kennedys.

LOIS: I feel like I don't
even know you anymore, Peter.

The man I married would never think
he could fix a problem...

...just by spending money!

Boy, she's pretty pissed.

Who thought fraud
would be one of her buttons?

Why have a jukebox
in the john if your wife's mad at you?

Peter, you may have to return
that money to the taxpayers.

But I gotta make sure
Lois knows I'm doing it.

I need an event with thousands of people.

Something that everybody cares about.

We might have to leave
Rhode Island for this.

ANNOUNCER: <i>The air is electric here</i>
<i>at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!</i>

Pat, it's safe to say that all
these fans came out here...

...to watch a game of football!

John, we're in commercial.

Yeah, I know.
I'm just making conversation. Come on.

Football!

Amazing. You can barely drive a car.
Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?

Yeah, America's great, isn't it?
Except for the South.

Boy, I hope Lois is watching.

Okay, taxpayers, here you go!

PAT: <i>Looks like we're getting some rain</i>
<i>here tonight, John.</i>

Yeah. Hey, wait a second!
This is no ordinary rain!

It's some kind of crazy money rain!

I'm being told it's a man and his dog
throwing cash out of a blimp.

Man. I hope this works. Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to start dropping these.

[People cheering]

JOHN: <i>The crowd is storming the field!</i>
<i>This is pandemonium!</i>

Have you ever seen anything like this,
Pat?

Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl.
This is the old "trying to make amends...

"...for spending $150,000 a week
in misappropriated welfare funds" play.

I don't care what it is! That guy's
ruining a perfectly good game of football!

-Madden to Fox Security.
-Go ahead.

JOHN: <i>Take them down!</i>
GUARD: Yes, sir.

How was your shower?

I tell you, all of the rumors
about dropping the soap are true.

Really?

You can't hold onto that thing
to save your life.

It was slipping everywhere.
Guys were laughing.

GUY: There's the guy
that couldn't hold the soap.

That was classic.

Boy. I really let Lois down this time.

Do you think she'll wait for me?

If every woman dumped her husband...

...for crashing a blimp,
no one would be married.

Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I got the top bunk.

My collagen is wearing off.

Honey, sagging lips are
just nature's way...

...of telling you you shouldn't
cover for your father's lie.

What does it mean when your armpits
cry stinky tears?

It means you're becoming a man.

But hopefully not the kind who stays out
all day and doesn't call...

...like your father
who shall remain nameless.

STEWIE: Hello, Mother.
LOIS: Hi there, sweetie.

You know, Mother,
life is like a box of chocolates.

You never know what you're going to get.

Your life, however,
is more like a box of active grenades!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

STEWIE: Now, I offer one last
chance for deliverance.

Return my mind-control device
or be destroyed.

You just want your toy back.

Okay, here you go, honey.

Yes.... Well, victory is mine!

[Explosion]

STEWIE: Damn you all!

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Oh, my God!

Lois, am I glad to see you.

I have nothing to say to you, Peter.

I gave the money back.
Why are you still steamed?

Peter, you lied to me,
you betrayed my trust.

Compared to that,
welfare fraud doesn't even matter.

Really? Let's hope the judge
feels that way.

This court will come to order.

I figured the sooner I cashed the check...

...the sooner they'd catch their mistake.

Why are we making a federal case
out of this?

Don't you think you should
have alerted the government...

...of such a gross overpayment?

I was gonna call them.
But my favorite episode...

...of <i>Different Strokes</i> was on.
The one where Arnold and Dudley...

...get sexually molested
by the bike shop owner?

All right. Now I want you boys
to scream real loud at my ass.

And everybody learns a valuable lesson.

Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?

Yes. Stay the hell away
from that bike shop.

[People murmuring]

Okay, everybody, I feel really bad
about what I did. I just....

I don't know. I saw the one chance...

...I'd ever have to give my family
the things they deserve.

I guess I screwed it up.
I cheated the government.

And worst of all, I lied to my wife.

<i>And she deserves better.</i>

I'm sorry, honey.

Mr. Griffin, I think your words
have touched us all.

I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.

No!

-No!
-No!

No!

Yeah!

[Rock music]

[Rock music stops abruptly]

LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor?
JUDGE: Yes?

Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times.

He may even be downright stupid.

<i>But I know he only accepted that money...</i>

<i>...because he wanted to be</i>
<i>a good husband and father.</i>

But what he needs to remember
is that we love him.

And no matter what,
I'll always stand by him.

I love you too, honey.

That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin.
Okay, you can go to jail with him!

What?

24 months in prison? Unacceptable!
Intolerable as it may be...

...I'm completely dependent upon
those wretched drones for sustenance.

Let us see how the constitution
of American justice fares...

...against the device!

[Device pulsates]

Is that your boy?

What? Yeah. That's Stewie.

Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young
from his father. It's unjudgmenly.

-Hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
-Yeah.

-All right. You're free.
-Wow! Can you give me my job back?

No.

-Yes.
-All right!

[Cheery instrumental music]

[Man laughing on TV]

ED: <i>That was a crazy one, Dick.</i>

DICK: <i>It sure was. In this next blooper </i>
<i>from</i> Joanie Loves Chachi<i>...</i>

<i>...watch what happens when Scott Baio</i>
<i>tries to say:</i>

<i>"She sells seashells </i>
<i>down by the seashore."</i>

What does your mom do?

She sells seashells down by the....

That is kind of a tongue twister.

It's good to have you home, Peter.

Honey, I knew everything
would turn out okay.

I sure am gonna miss being rich.

PETER: Don't worry.
I got a way to get money.

Not another welfare scam?

No. Minority scholarship.

[Giggles]

[Jazzy instrumental music]

LOIS AND BRIAN: No.
STEWIE: Are you insane?

Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.

[Giggles]

BRIAN: No.
LOIS: Don't think so.

STEWIE: Absolutely outrageous.

Okay, disability claim.

You can't leave the table
until you finish your vegetables.

Then I shall sit here until
one of us expires.

You've got a good 40 years on me, woman!

Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good
for you. Now open up for the airplane.

[Makes airplane noise]

Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you!
And damn the Wright Brothers!

My, aren't we fussy tonight.
Okay. No broccoli.

Very well then. I--

Who the hell do you think you are?

Honey, it's not gonna go away
just because you don't like it.

Well, then. My goal becomes clear.
The broccoli must die.

[Sinister instrumental music]

Mom, will you take me out
to practice driving?

I'm teaching a piano lesson
in half an hour.

Maybe your father can take you.

Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you.
But Daddy also loves <i>Star Trek</i>.

And, in all fairness,
Star Trek was here first.

KIRK: <i>Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7.</i>

<i>The Enterprise has just discovered</i>
<i>a strange new planet...</i>

<i>...in the Gamma Faloppia star system.</i>
<i>Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.</i>

LOIS: For God's sake, Peter.

You've been in front of the TV
since you got home from work.

Why don't you spend some time
with your family?

I will, during the commercials.

And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing
the point of having commercials.

[Sighs]

Please. My road test is tomorrow
and you haven't taught me anything.

You may want to find
a better teacher than Peter.

What are you talking about?
I'm a great driver.

Remember your trip to the Southwest?

[Road Runner meep-meeping]

-Jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich?
-No.

-Are you sure?
-He's fine. Keep going.

Don't believe that.
I always keep my eyes on the road.

PETER: I don't miss a thing.
TV: <i>We now return to</i> Star Trek<i>.</i>

Holy crap. Uhura's black?

All right, Meg.
Now here's your first lesson.

You always want to be aware
of other cars on the road.

If you catch eyes with the guy next to you
at a red light, you gotta race him.

-This guy's asking for it.
-But Dad....

I don't make the rules, honey.
Now rev your engine twice.

Okay.

[Engine revving twice]

[Horse sputtering twice]

Go!

[Fast-paced instrumental music]

[Screaming]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

PETER: You forgot to flip him off.
But other than that, nice job.

You're back already?
That wasn't much of a lesson.

I didn't want to overload her
on her first time out.

Besides <i>CHiPs</i> is about to start.

So let's sit back and get lost in a world
of California Highway Patrol fantasy!

[Police siren]

[Funky instrumental music]

-What's the charge, Officer?
-Driving without my phone number.

[Gunshots firing]

Or maybe I should arrest you
for being too beautiful.

[Teeth sparkling]

So, broccoli, Mother says
you're very good for me.

I'm afraid I'm no good for you!
The first rule of war is know thine enemy.

And I know this! Cold kills broccoli!
It's so simple.

<i>All I need to do is build a machine</i>
<i>to control the global environment.</i>

Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles
of genius with a chance of doom!

[Sinister instrumental music]

PETER: This is taking forever!

Come on. Let's go. Fox is running
one of those new reality shows at 8:00.

<i>Fast Animals, Slow Children</i>.

[African instrumental music]

<i>Come on, guys. Wait up.</i>

[African music continues]

<i>Dang. I got honey all over my legs.</i>

Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life
depends on getting my license.

If I can't drive, I'll never have
a boyfriend, never get married...

...and then I'll have to adopt a kid
like Rosie O'Donnell.

Are you implying
that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?

I'm so nervous.

You're gonna do great.
Remember everything I taught you.

-Let's start by going down Main Street.
-Okay.

[Engine revving twice]

[Police siren]

-What are you doing?
-I'm driving.

[Screaming]

Are you gonna mark me down
for not flipping him off?

God, my life is over.
I am the biggest loser I know!

I know how you feel, pumpkin.
I've had my share of disappointments, too.

DOCTOR: It's a girl!

Can you check again?

You just have to remember that life
has its little ups and.... Jeez!

We're gonna miss the beginning
of my show. There it is.

MEG: Dad, watch out!

[Horn blaring]

PETER: Meg, honey, are you okay?
MEG: Yeah, I think so.

PETER: The Quahog
Cable Television Transmitter.

[Citizens grumbling]

You just knocked out cable TV
for the whole town!

Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot!

Whoa. This isn't about me.
This is about you.

At least I bought us some time.

-She did it.
-What? Dad, you were the one driving!

I was teaching her to drive
and she lost control of the car.

Come on, we all did stupid stuff
when we were kids, right?

I remember when I tried
to sneak into an R-rated movie.

-Come on. Give the kid a break, huh?
-Why should we?

She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.

[Murmuring]

GUY: Poor kid.
MAN: What a senseless war.

I can't believe you just sold out
your own daughter.

I know what I did was wrong. And I know

it's not the first time
I've embarrassed you.

And if you add the measure of the angles
of a right triangle, the sum--

Meg, clean out the shower
the next time you shave your legs.

It's like a carpet in there.

I hate to see you so upset.

I know. Let's play a little game
called Taking the Fall for Daddy.

If you win, I'll buy you a convertible
when you get your license.

Really? Daddy! Now I love you again!

You're gonna make
some Jewish guy a great wife.

[Metallic clanking]

Because of an accident
at the Quahog Cable Company...

...television transmission will be out
for an undetermined amount of time.

Of course, no one can see
this news program...

...so it doesn't really matter
what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.

Think I'll go get drunk and
beat up midgets. How about you?

Tom, I just plain don't like black people.

You guys, we're still on in Boston.

Excellent.
The weather machine is nearly completed.

What do you say to that, broccoli?

Stop mocking me! What's this?

<i>It appears the witless provider</i>
<i>has finally brought me something of value.</i>

I can use that crude device
to amplify my deadly signal.

Victory shall yet be mine.

Guess what, Mom?

Dad crashed the car
into the city cable transmitter.

-What?
-It's okay.

If I take the blame, he'll buy me
a convertible when I get my license.

Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame
if you go around telling everyone.

Peter, you're bribing your daughter
with a car?

Come on, Lois.

Isn't "bribe" just another
word for "love"?

You wanted me and Meg to bond.

That's what we're doing.

CHRIS: Dad, I was in a chat room
on America Online...

...and Doomie 22 told me
some idiot knocked out the cable.

We could be without TV for weeks!

Now, Chris, now let's not panic.
We can manage just fine without TV.

[Brian scoffs]

-What's that supposed to mean?
-Face it, you're addicted to television.

You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey.
Remember when you gave up candy?

I'll ask you one more time.
You didn't eat anything in my factory?

No.

-I'm just asking--
-Are you calling me a liar?

-I'm just saying--
-Shut up, Wonka.

Yeah. That was different. I'll be fine.

-Are you sure, honey?
-For God's sake, you guys.

You think I'm some simp who can't live
without TV? Give me a break.

What's happening now?

Sipowicz is finding who
stabbed the super.

<i>Are you gonna tell me,</i>
<i>or am I gonna have to show you my ass?</i>

<i>I ain't saying nothing!</i>
<i>All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!</i>

Forget it, Mike.

Without actually seeing his ass,
this is just radio.

Class, we were scheduled to watch
a PBS program on the mating rituals...

...of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe
of New Guinea.

Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV.

So instead, we're having a surprise test.

<i>WONDER YEARS</i> VOICE: <i>Suddenly I was</i>
<i>public enemy number one.</i>

<i>It was time to tell the truth.</i>

Wait! I didn't drive into
the satellite dish!

And who did?

<i>WONDER YEARS</i> VOICE:
<i>I was just a 15-year-old girl.</i>

<i>But at that moment, I realized I had</i>
<i>a whole lifetime to make new friends.</i>

<i>But only one chance to get a new car.</i>
<i>And I had to take it.</i>

Okay, I did it.

PETER: I don't know how much longer
I can last.

It's been a whole week
since I seen a TV show.

I wonder what Scooby and the gang
are up to now.

NARRATOR: <i>We now return to</i>
The Scooby Doo Murder Files<i>.</i>

<i>Gee whiz, gang.</i>

<i>The killer gutted the victim,</i>
<i>strangled him with his own intestines...</i>

<i>-...and then dumped the body in the river!</i>
<i>-Jinkies! What a mystery!</i>

[Moaning]

<i>You're right, Scoob. We're dealing </i>
<i>with one sick son of a bitch.</i>

You just need to find something
to fill the void that's left in your life.

Lois has knitting, Chris has video games,
Meg's learning how to drive.

And me, I like the sauce.

Whose leg do you have to hump
to get a dry martini around here?

[Moaning]

Can't live without TV. Must see TV.

[Frightful instrumental music]

[Whimsical instrumental music]

[Sinister instrumental music]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Sighs]

Stewie, I expect you
to finish off your vegetables.

Rest assured, you relentless harridan,
I expect I shall finish them all off!

And you as well!

Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter.

Last night I woke up and he was
channel surfing through static.

I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.

-Morning, Lois.
-And you were worried.

-Peter, what the hell is that?
-It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.

Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning

to think you're losing
your grip on reality.

PETER: Boring.
I'll go see what else is on.

LOIS: Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.

Don't move!

[Making ridiculous noises]

[Screams]

STEWIE: A little help?

PETER: It's Glen Quagmire,
the wacky next-door neighbor.

PETER: What's he up to this time?
QUAGMIRE: I'm going to work!

Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.

We have to find your father, Chris.
He's not well.

I never knew anyone who went crazy
before except my invisible friend...

...Col. Schwartz!

I get all the channels on this thing.

<i>Lifetime.</i>

<i>CBS.</i>

<i>Hey, UPN.</i>

<i>All right.</i> 90210<i>.</i>

-Dad?
-Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly?

They're really reaching for guest stars
in the 10th season.

Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here!

I'm already a total
outcast because of you!

You're just upset because you wrecked
the cable transmitter.

I did not! Forget it.
What good is a car if I have no friends?

I didn't wreck TV! My dad did!

-What?
-What'd she say?

-Peter Griffin ruined TV?
-And blamed his daughter?

That's the lowest thing I've ever heard.

Peter, take that thing off and come home.

Hey, Lois. You're just in time
for the exciting conclusion.

Looks like some boob's
about to get lynched. Let's watch.

There they are.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

That's the guy who ruined our cable.
Let's get him!

Stop! What is wrong with you people?

Okay, yes. My husband is responsible
for knocking out TV.

But we should be thanking him.

He's broken television's hypnotic spell
over us.

Now we can see the world for what it is...

...a beautiful place full of wonderful
things just waiting to be experienced.

Another chick flick.

She's right. All the hours we've wasted
on that damn idiot box.

-I'm gonna paint my house!
-I'll build a ship in a bottle.

I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick
down a dirt road.

LOIS: I'll take you home, honey.

I can't believe I let Meg take the blame.
You were right, Lois. TV is evil.

I hear that Manson guy watches it
in jail all day long.

If I haven't seen it, it's new to me.

You just went a little overboard.
You need a little balance in your life.

There are other things to appreciate
besides television.

-You mean like this lamp?
-Yeah. Okay.

-The lamp gives us light.
-I get it.

And your family gives you love.

You should spend some time
with our kids, Peter. And with me.

What could me and you do together?

[Naughty laugh]

Lois! You've got a sick mind!

Peter, I'm talking about making love.

I thought you wanted us to murder
the children and harvest their organs...

...for beer money.

[Amorous giggling]

What a gorgeous day.
Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?

It's always a nice day
with two scoops of raisins, Peter.

[Car alarm blaring]

-Top of the morning, everybody.
-Excellent!

Thus completes the penultimate
adjustment to my weather control device!

Victory is.... Release me at once!

Your mother was right. It'd be a crime
to sit around and wait for the TV.

Great. You can teach me how to drive.

There'll be time to drive
when you're dead.

There's a world out there waiting
for us to grab it by the short hairs!

-Damn!
-Let's go.

[Cheery instrumental music]

I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing
really wore me out.

Wake up! You promised you'd get
this hook out of my mouth.

[Screams]

Thank you.

Now, kids, your father's just trying
to spend time with his family.

Or kill us. I'm not sure which.

TOM: <i>The Chinese sure like to spit,</i>
<i>don't they?</i>

Diane, that last report was so good,
I think you deserve a spanking.

I don't think your wife
would appreciate that.

That frigid old cow lives in Quahog.
She can't hear a word I'm saying.

Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog.

STEWIE: Thank God!

Their puerile minds are once again
distracted by that flickering box.

Time to be bad!

PETER: Come on, everyone.

<i>We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival.</i>
<i>You know those Germans.</i>

You don't join their party,
they come get you.

But Dad, the TV's back on.

What do you know? Okay, let's go.

Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend
so much time with the family.

But we're exhausted.

Maybe we could just sit
and watch some TV together?

We're too busy living life to the fullest.
Come on, let's go.

-I'm sick of life.
-Yeah. My dogs are barking.

-But I thought we were having fun.
-We were.

But now it might be nice to watch
other people have fun or get killed.

-You know, whatever's on.
-Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.

<i>This is a dangerous mission.</i>
<i>And it's likely one of us will be killed.</i>

<i>The landing party will consist of myself,</i>
<i>Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.</i>

<i>Crap.</i>

Sorry, Lois.

There's only one show I want to see.
It's called...

...<i>Make Every Day Count</i>,
starring Peter Griffin as himself.

LOIS: Come on, Peter.
Don't you miss TV just a little?

The familiar stories, the broadly drawn
characters, the convenient plot turns...

...that bring a character around
at exactly the right moment?

Hi. I'm William Shatner.
My car broke down...

...on my way to give a speech
on how TV keeps families together.

Would you like to hear it?

No, I don't want to miss
the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.

Wait a minute! I love schnitzel!

Come along. I bet you could squeeze
into Lois' lederhosen.

I'll change in the car.

If I had a nickel for every time
one of my parents walked out...

...instead of teaching me how to drive,
I'd be one rich little--

Let's go, Meg.

[Sinister instrumental music]

Fare thee well, broccoli!

[Band playing German folk music]

I don't know. I can't imagine
choosing life over television.

I'm telling you, it's great, Bill.

The only thing that would make this

perfect day better is if
my family was here.

My God!

It was sunny a moment ago,
but now it's pouring!

Let's take off our shoes
and run home barefoot!

Griffin, you're a madman!
Barefoot, you say?

LOIS: This is not safe.

<i>I'll teach you how to drive </i>
<i>some other time.</i><i>Pull over.</i>

Mom, I can't even tell where "over" is.

[Giddy laughter]

You were right, Peter.
I've never felt so alive.

Victory is mine!

[Screams]

STEWIE: God damn it.

[Giddy laughter]

My God.

[Car colliding]

My God. I hit William Shatner.

Light growing dimmer.
Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.

I did not see that coming.

Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over
and killed Mr. Shatner.

Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast,
I'll do enough living for me and Bill.

Honey, can't we go back
to the way things used to be?

There's a big dent in that couch
that nobody else can fill.

Haven't you guys learned anything?

TV took over my life once.
I'm never gonna let that happen again.

My God.

We've lost him.

If you help me out of here,
I know a meadow where...

...the blueberries are begging
to be picked.

Look, buddy. Just go in the pan.

And don't call me
unless you're flatlining.

PETER: Turn that TV off. Nurse?

ANNOUNCER: <i>What would you do</i>
<i>for a Klondike Bar?</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>Would you stand on one leg?</i>
MAN: <i>Sure.</i>

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Would you act like a monkey?</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>Would you kill a man?</i>

[Gunshot]

Daddy, now that I've finally passed
my driver's test...

...can I still get a convertible?

No. But I'm proud of you
for getting your license, sweetheart.

And I'm proud of you, Peter.
You taught us all a valuable lesson.

It's not what you do
that defines the quality of your life...

...it's who you do it with,
and your family--

It's on.

I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie,
but you'll thank me...

...when you grow up big and strong
like your father.

A compelling argument.
You've swayed me, woman.

That is good. I feel stronger already.

It's good tasting and good for you.

Nice try.

-Quadruped.
-Mutant.

I can't believe he's almost a year old.

Yeah. I'll never forget the
day he was born.

DOCTOR: One more push, Lois.

DOCTOR: This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin.
Would you like to see?

PETER: Yeah, I've never actually seen
a baby being.... Oh, God!

DOCTOR: Congratulations. It's a boy.

DOCTOR: Wait a minute.
I don't think we're through.

Oh, my God! Is it twins?

DOCTOR: No. It's a map of Europe.

[Sinister instrumental music]

I confirmed everything
with the birthday party planner...

...at Cheesie Charlie's.

-Why Cheesie Charlie's?
-It's cool, Dad.

They have this game where you put in
a dollar and you win four quarters!

I win every time! I get to go, right?

Why can't we have
the same kind of party we always do?

Peter, this could be
our last first birthday ever.

When Meg and Chris turned one,
I had so much to do, I missed everything.

[Kids chattering]

[Sighs]

PETER: Lois, you won't believe this!
Meg just said "Da-Da!"

Her first words?

Then she stood up by herself
and started walking!

-Her first steps?
-Yeah.

What the hell are you doing
in here anyway?

[Drums playing]

PETER: All right! Her first drum solo.

[Applause]

Thanks to Cheesie Charlie...

...I'm not gonna miss a moment
of Stewie's party.

I say, am I to spend the entire day
wallowing around in my own feces?

A little service here!

Hey, Stinky.
Have we got some big plans for you.

Plans? What the devil
are you talking about?

It's your birthday, dude.

Saturday's gonna be real special, honey.

I've hired a professional
to make sure everything goes just right.

A professional? There's treachery afoot!

[Crying]

Meg, you're home late.

I stayed after school
to try out for cheerleading.

Don't keep me in suspense.
How'd you do?

I'll give you a hint.

I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked!

Yay!

I mean, sorry, honey.

MEG: God, I hate high school.
I don't fit in with anyone.

Boy. Do I know that feeling.

[Suspenseful, jazzy instrumental music]

Okay, man. Okay.
You are really throwing me off.

It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it?

I thought we were gonna rumble
with those greasy Sharks.

Not without seven years of ballet
and two of jazz tap, we're not.

From the top, people!
Why don't you just hang back and stretch?

I don't get it.

The more I try to make friends,
the more people hate me.

Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl
with a mind of her own.

-Now, see, that's what people hate.
-Really?

I'm telling you, just be the girl
you think everyone else wants you to be.

Wow, it's so obvious.

Thanks, Daddy.

MEG: Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.

LOIS: I haven't seen Meg this happy
since that bus broke down...

...in front of our house.

Hi. Can we use your phone?

Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn!

Meg and I had a little
father-daughter talk.

It seems to have worked.

I wasn't just blowing smoke
when I bought this T-shirt.

Well, you're the number-one husband, too.

I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt.

The man in white. Of course.

He must be the hired professional
of whom they spoke.

He failed to thwart my escape
into the outside world.

And now, one year hence, he's returning
to rectify his mistake and...

...put me back in the womb!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Boy, it sure is great being
thin and popular.

GIRL 1: Let's throw up.

GIRL 2: Sure!
GIRL 3: Good idea!

I love throwing up.

[Laughing]

[Sighs]

Hi. I'm Jennifer.

I'm Meg.

My God. Your hair is so beautiful.
I just want to brush it.

Really?

You want to go throw up?

[Western instrumental music]

Hey, Dad, let's go whack some moles!

Now, Chris, we're not here for fun.

[Children giggling]

Now your mom is counting on us
to drop off the deposit.

So let's just deliver the check and....

PETER: Hong Kong Phooey!

Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!

PETER: Come on, move it! Oh, man!
Chris, this place is great.

Pull over, you bastard!

Man.

CHRIS: Hey, Dad, they even got games
in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon!

Yeah, way to go, Chris.

Where's my watch?

All right. I won a watch.
What's <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i>?

That's mine. Come on.
Come on, give that back!

-Give it!
-Come on!

UNCLE JESSE: <i>Folks in Hazzard County</i>
<i>hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time.</i>

<i>Them boys rassled for a full five minutes</i>
<i>before the manager stepped in.</i>

Come on!

Hands off, fatty!

Sir, I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

I'm a paying customer.

I got a deposit check
for my kid's party right here.

Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry.

We're really looking forward
to Stewie's special day.

Now I don't know,
after the emotional trauma I've endured...

...on your premises,
I think I deserve a little discount.

Sir, our prices are set
by the corporate office.

Then maybe I'll just take
my business elsewhere.

Good luck filling our
spot by this Saturday.

MAN: I got cash!
WOMAN: I'll take it!

Suit yourself.

Wait. I was just bluffing.
My wife has her heart set on this place.

[Peter yells after him]

Chris, this is a big day for you.
The day you become the man of the house.

Because when we get home,
your mother is going to kill me.

So the man in white is coming
to put me back in the womb, is he?

If I'm to defeat him,
I shall require professional forces.

STEWIE: Here we are. "Come to Managua,
the Mecca of mercenaries."

I must prepare for my journey.

Let's see.
Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios....

-So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's?
-Actually, I canceled the reservation.

What?

-How could you?
-Lois, I got a very good reason.

Wait a second.

These are always classic.

Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good.
See, it happened like this.

[Spooky instrumental music]

[Screaming]

Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's.
<i>Heil</i>, Hitler!

Actually, the name's Griffin.

I was sent by my smart, beautiful,
and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.

Yes.
We're all set for your little boy's party.

I understand we're getting
a terrific bargain here.

Absolutely.
The children get to play our games.

And if they win enough tickets,
they get a prize.

I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough?

Sorry, Timmy.
But you need 15 tickets to live.

[Screaming]

They also get food, cake,
and your choice of ice-cream flavors...

...vanilla, strawberry, chocolate,
or people.

-What was that?
-Chocolate. Give me the check.

Hold it! Lois may have
had her heart set on this place...

...but I love my family too much
to risk their lives.

-Come on, Chris. We're leaving.
-No, you're not!

Please don't make me angry, pal.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

[Eerie instrumental music]

LOIS: <i>All right, Peter. That's enough!</i>

Bravo, Peter.
You are the Spalding Gray of crap.

Do you know how hard it was
to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's?

I had to book it the day of my ultrasound.

We'll never find another place in time!

For once, it was all gonna be so perfect!

Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect.
We'll give him the best birthday ever...

...right here in the safety and comfort
of our own home.

-Peter, we've been over this.
-Honey, you won't have to lift a finger.

I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo,
a big-ass piñata, the works!

-You got all those things?
-You bet I did.

LOIS: Wow.

Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have
a petting zoo.

Okay, I'll call the parents
and let them know the party's here.

-You don't have any of those things.
-How do you know?

Face it. You're a terrible liar.

[Sniffing]

It was you.

Clowns and petting zoos
book months in advance.

You're gonna have a tough time
finding a.... Hold on.

DRIVER: Ya! Ya!

[Horses neighing]

Some day.

Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?

STEWIE: Now, listen to me, Jolene.

I've got an army to raise,
and I must get to Nicaragua.

I require a window seat and
an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles!

-God help you if I find pickles.
-Henry, I have a lost little boy.

Hey there, little fella.
Why don't you come with me?

STEWIE: Damn you!
You're one of them, aren't you?

<i>What are they paying you? I'll double it!</i>

<i>I'll give you whatever you want!</i>
<i>Money! Women! Men?</i>

Dad, what are we doing here again?

Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for
Stewie's petting zoo.

[Blower starting]

[Pig squealing]

[Pigs squealing]

[Motor stopping]

Crafty swine.

UPS.

Little bastards ain't as smart as....

Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer.
She gave me a ride home.

Meg, you made a friend.

JENNIFER: What a lovely house, Mrs. G.

Meg, you didn't tell me
your mother was just like Martha Stewart.

Oh, no. Once you get to know me,
I'm really very nice.

You know what's nice?
Having a friend like Meg. And kittens.

It was super swell meeting you.
Bye, Meg. Friends forever.

Forever and ever.

[Giddy laughter]

Wow! What a great yard!

Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me
to a party on Saturday.

This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss
Stewie's first birthday.

MEG: But Mom--

Meg, our entire family is
going to be here for Stewie's party.

And that includes you. Understood?

I can't believe you'd put your family
before your own daughter!

She's a whiny little runt, isn't she?

I said "runt."

I don't think I'm in the right place.

I'm looking for a guy to entertain
the kids at my son's birthday.

Sure. I can do that.

You do children's parties?

Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand,
and some somersaults maybe.

I can make pretend like
the children are little bugs in my web.

Do you know your phone number, son?

The only way you'll get me to talk
is through slow, painful torture.

And I don't think you've got the grapes!

It sounds like you don't want to go home.
Are you running away?

Stewart Gilligan
Griffin runs from nothing!

You know, son,
running away never solves anything.

You're getting to be a big boy now.

And part of growing up means
facing your problems head on.

The ruptured capillaries in your
nose belie the clarity of your wisdom.

You're saying I must return to face this
man in white myself. So be it.

As for you, kind sage, I only hope
my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm...

...as you spend the next 10 years
in frozen carbonite!

Peter, you've only got
a couple of hours left.

If you pull a party out of your ass,
you'll want to stand up.

My friend Jennifer invited me
to hang out with her friends.

Can I go?

I won't fall for this trick.
Did you ask your mother?

Yes.

Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart.

Thanks, Daddy!

Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck.

The only stuff I could get on such short
notice was a cake and that big-ass piñata.

I sure hope candy comes out of that.

Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father,
a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser.

I'll never be able to face Lois.

The circus is in town.
Maybe you could run away and join it.

The circus!

[Marching band playing]

[Elephant trumpeting]

Hi. This is the right day, isn't it?

Oh, yes.
Peter should be back any minute...

...and then we can start the party,
I hope.

Hey, Lois, look.
The two symbols of the Republican party...

...an elephant and a big fat white guy
who's threatened by change.

LOIS: Peter, this is the most wonderful
celebration I could have imagined.

PETER: Yeah. Where's Stewie?

He's upstairs, resting up for his big day.

[Oriental instrumental music]

I'll get him. If you see Meg,
tell her to take plenty of pictures.

Meg's not here.
She went to a friend's house.

What?
She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday.

I dropped her off an hour ago.
Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?

Peter. How could you let her go?

What's the big deal?
So Meg's with her new friends.

They seemed like some nice kids.

JENNIFER: I'm glad you could join us.
We're gonna have a great time on our trip.

A trip? Like to the beach?
Because I didn't bring my swimsuit.

You won't need anything
where we're going.

Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch.

[Whimsical music playing]

CHRIS: Birthday dude?
Do you want some ice cream?

Yes. But no sprinkles! For
every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!

Come on, Lois.
I hate to see you so upset.

We got animals. We got clowns.

I mean, a party couldn't be any better
if Jesus himself showed up.

Okay, everybody. For my next miracle,
I'm gonna turn water into funk.

[Disco music playing]

Peter, the circus is terrific.
But it's not just Stewie's birthday.

We're also celebrating the day
our family became whole.

Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.

Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day.

I know. It's just that
I really like that guy over there.

But he doesn't even know I exist.
He must think I'm a total dog.

That is so not true.

Then what is it?

-He's a eunuch.
-Really?

Sure. All the guys here
have been castrated.

It's cool.

-Do you think that girl is hot?
-No.

Me neither.

[Elephant trumpeting]

Hey, you. Hit me.

There. Now, if I can just find a midget
with some gin, I'll be in business.

Where are you off to?

I gotta make things right for Lois
and get this monkey off my back.

PETER: Ow! Knock it off!

All right, men, the man in white
is coming to put me back in the womb.

Today he comes for me,
but tomorrow it could be you or you!

I offer you the opportunity to join me
in glorious battle.

<i>I know that for some of you,</i>
<i>your motor skills are not developed.</i>

Sadly, you will be used as decoys.

But your children's children
will know that you fell for a noble cause.

Now, who's with me?

Duckie?

Useless, every one of you! Fine.

I'll defend myself,
and the hell with all of you!

There, I've gone and soiled myself.
Are you happy now?

[Gong goes off]

Our leader is here
to take us on our journey!

My children, rejoice. The hour
of transformation is close at hand.

Who are you?

This is Meg, wise one.
Can she come with us?

Perhaps. Do you have a mind
that seeks enlightenment...

...and a heart that seeks purity?

Not really.

Okay. Are you a confused adolescent
desperately seeking acceptance...

...from an undifferentiated ego mass
that demands conformity?

Wow, that sort of sounds more like me.

Great! Then all you need is
a dark-blue jogging suit.

Let's see what we have in stock.

What are you? About a 9?

No. A 6.

Right. Dispense the refreshments.

Meg, there you are.

Dad, what are you doing here?
I'm so embarrassed, I could die!

GUY: Not before the rest of us!

Meg, your mother wants
the family together today.

It's just Stewie's birthday.
So what if I'm not there?

Who's gonna remember?

Your mom will, trust me.
She remembers everything.

In fact, she always says the best memories
she has are when you kids were born.

Meg, that's it. This day is more
for your mom than it is for Stewie.

With all she's given us,
she oughta get whatever she wants.

And, Meg, today she wants you
to be with the family.

Really?

Daddy, you must think
I'm the worst daughter ever.

No you're not, honey.
What about that fat girl from the Judds?

I'm sorry I've been so selfish.

TEEN 1: I miss my mom.
TEEN 2: Me, too.

I also miss my nads.

Mr. Griffin, can we come
to Stewie's party, too?

Sure. The more the merrier.

Meg, you have the coolest family.

She sure does.

Here's to family!

To family!

Jeez, look at the time! Come on.

Come on, kids. Let's get going.

[Bodies falling over]

Sorry, Meg.

It's another bunch of people
that'd rather fake death...

...than go to a party with you.

Children, the time of
ascension has arrived.

For the love of God. Haven't any of you
ever been in a cult before?

Damn it!
I can't achieve transcendence by myself.

That would just make me
some kind of lone nut.

Somebody's got to die with me.

Come back, Meg!

Whoops. Can't forget
my ceremonial white robe.

I guess there's nothing left
but the birthday cake.

MEG: Right here!

Meg!

I'm sorry, Mom.

Thank you, Peter.

No problem.
I cannot wait to taste this cake.

The guy who sold it to me
said it was delicious and erotic.

Peter, there's a naked man on this cake.

There were only two left.

And trust me, you did not want the one
of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.

LOIS: Gather round, everyone.
It's time for Stewie's big moment.

[Knocking]

LEADER: Hello?

Is anybody home?

STEWIE: <i>Greetings, man in white.</i>
<i>I've been expecting you.</i>

Who said that?

STEWIE: <i>Peek-a-boo! I see you!</i>

<i>You're getting warmer.</i>

Where are you? What do you want?

STEWIE: <i>Freedom! What do you want?</i>

I want to get the hell out of here!

STEWIE: <i>I'm sorry. </i>
<i>We're fresh out of that.</i>

<i>I'm afraid all that's left is </i>
<i>untimely death.</i>

[Dramatic instrumental music]

What the hell is this?

It's a boy!

[Energy pulsing]

Anybody seen Stewie?

Yeah. Where is the birthday boy?

Victory is mine!

Yes. And this cake is yours, too.

Stewie, make a wish. If you blow
out the candle, it'll come true.

That's right, little buddy. What do you
want most in the whole world?

In the whole world, you say?

[Bombs whistling]

[Troops marching]

[Bombs exploding]

What the hell.

STEWIE: Blast you, woman!
Awake from your damnable reverie!

Honey, I'm doing the dishes.

A thousand pardons for disrupting
your flatware sanitation ritual.

But you see, I'm in searing pain!

You're just teething, Stewie.
It's a normal part of a baby's life.

Very well then,
I order you to kill me at once!

Honey, I know you're hurting.

But Mommy has to clean up the house,
all right?

No, it's not all right!

For the love of God, shake me!
Shake me like a British nanny!

Oh, man. This is the life.
Hand me another one of them...

...Pawtucket Patriots.

Guys, I want to say a toast to you,
Quagmire, Cleveland....

Brian.

Yeah. If you guys were beers,
I would drink every one of you.

And I wish you were because we're out.

[Giggling]

That's funny. That's even more humorous
than that joke you told us last night.

Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
walk into a bar, right?

Wait a second.

Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
walk into a bar.

And there's a naked priest sitting there.
And he....

Oh, sorry, Father.

No, I've heard them all.

Look at the time.

I promised Loretta I was gonna trim
the hedges and be tender with her.

Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need
some time off as much as we do.

This is when Lois does all those
little things that women like to do.

[Grunting]

[Car honking, Lois sighs]

I'll be on your bed. No calls.

PETER: Hey, Lois.

You've been busy all day.
So I took care of dinner.

Really?

All you gotta do is gut it, clean it,
scale it, and cook it.

LOIS: I spent all morning
cleaning up the house.

And in five seconds,
you turn it into low tide at the pier.

Jeez. I'm sorry, honey.
I'd help you clean it up.

But you know how lousy
I am with housework.

Remember when I tried doing the laundry?

Let's see. Shirts, pants....
I'm missing another sock.

Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus.

Give me back my sock, you goat bastard!

PETER: Hey!

You're right. It's better if I do it.

STEWIE: Damn it to the bowels
of bloody hell!

The baby's up. Can you get him?

Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing.

I'm a little gun-shy
after what happened last time.

No, you imbecile!
That's not talc! That's paprika!

<i>Take that!</i>

All right, I'll do that, too!
Can you at least take Chris to his game?

Jeez, Lois.
I spent all morning on a boat...

...drinking beer, telling jokes,
and screwing around.

How about a little me time?

Honey, I'm begging you.
Drop Chris off at his soccer game...

...and come right home.

I need you to look after Stewie
while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!

All right! You know I spoil you.

CHRIS: Thanks for the ride, Dad.

All right. Have fun, Chris.

Hey, Petey!

Quagmire? What are you doing here?

Soccer moms!

[Soccer moms giggle]

All right.

I'd like to hang around with you.
But Lois needs me at home.

I got beer.

PETER: Boo, Lois! Yay, beer!

[Playing classical music]

[Lois shushing]

It's okay, Stewie.
Where the hell's Peter?

That was good, Reuben.
Now play Brahms' <i>Lullaby</i>.

[Sings] "Lullaby and good night"

Enough! The only thing worse
than the wretched pain...

...in my mouth is the excrement
spewing from yours!

I wish I could make the pain
go away sooner.

But I can't turn time forward.

Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course!
I'll simply build a machine...

...that can move time!
I shall call it a time machine.

E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!

PETER: Go, Chris! Daddy loves you!
I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.

[Whistle]

Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!

That's the 10th time today!
Nice grab, orca.

Get Moby Dick off the field
before he burps up a license plate!

Easy, fella. That's my kid.
Now apologize.

Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead
stinking blue cheese feta!

That's it!

Way to go, Dad!

You hit my mom!

No, I hit your dad.

Stand back. Give her some air.

You mean, "Give him some air."

Call an ambulance.
She's going into labor.

You mean, "He's going into labor."

[Baby crying]

Whoops.

PETER: I can't believe I punched a woman.

A pregnant woman.

I just hope she accepts my peace offering.

I sent her a little something
for the baby.

[Melodic strumming from box]

I would've brought it over myself
if I wasn't under house arrest.

You're just fortunate
this is your first offense, Peter.

Could've been a lot worse if the cops...

...knew about the other times
I broke the law.

And there was that time
I took a whiz in public.

And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.

Me and Cleveland are gonna "amscray."

Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.

Why don't you come with us?

I can't leave the premises.
They're monitoring my every move.

[Electronic beeping]

PETER: I gotta get out of here!

There's my little house husband.

It's been so wonderful
having you home all week.

Thanks, honey.
But I don't know how you...

...stand it here all day.

I mean, I'm so bored,
I can't even watch TV anymore.

All the shows are
starting to run together.

Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!

[Comedic instrumental music]

I know you can't understand
what I'm going through.

All the stuff that makes you happy...

...like cooking and cleaning, is right in
the house just waiting for you.

-You are one lucky--
-Stop now.

Peter, I don't do those things
because I enjoy them.

I do them because I love my family.

[Giggling]

Lois loves her family.
Lois loves her family.

"Lois and the family sitting in a tree"

See, Lois, the guys would've
found that hilarious.

Why don't I go buy some groceries
and make us a nice romantic dinner?

Like when we were dating.
That oughta take your mind off the guys.

It already has.

I wonder what the guys are up to?

That's nasty.

Where's the damn pull string?

[Yells]

You never know what you're gonna
find down here.

[Dog barking, Peter yells]

PATRIOT: Peter!

PETER: You're the Pawtucket Patriot.

Verily. Come hither and give heed.

Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal.

Look, I got a date with my female wife.
I just came down to get some beers.

PATRIOT: Why spend time with your wife?
If you build a bar in this basement...

...and stock it with plenty
of frosty Pawtucket Patriots...

...your friends will come down here
for a beer as well.

Build a bar! That's a great idea.

Wait. One last question.

If I walk through you,
does that mean, like, we've done it?

PATRIOT: Jeez.
What's with you and the gay jokes?

[Cheerful instrumental music]

[Snoring]

[Instrumental music slows down]

[Sighs]

[Door opening]

LOIS: Where the hell have you been?
We had a date.

Sorry, honey.
I must've lost track of the time.

What do you say?
You think the guys will like it?

This is why you missed our dinner?
To make a bar for your friends?

Yeah, isn't it great?
Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen.

I build stuff and I have
a criminal record.

[Macho grunting]

[Sniffing]

[Guys laughing]

Okay, guys. I got another one.

What's the difference
between pornography and art?

[Chuckling] Here it comes.

A government grant.

Peter, you are in the zone.

You know those little clam cakes
you make whenever...

...we have company? I need about a dozen.

Actually, better make it like 600.

That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant.

And I'm through taking care of you
and your bar buddies!

Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?

LOIS: Watch the kids.
I'm taking a hot bath.

Put me down, you blunderbuss!

He's a little cranky from teething.

I can fix that.

[Mumbling]

Good God, man!

One can only imagine what foul regions
that finger has erstwhile probed!

There you go.

My mother used to use whiskey
whenever I had a toothache.

My tooth hurts!

PETER: There. How's that feel?

It's delightful.

[Bathwater running]

[Applause]

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Lois, you are a wonderful woman.

Words cannot express the depth
of my appreciation and love for you.

Peter!

You must be Lois.

No, not silicone. Silicon.
And the design of the device...

...is quite ingenious
if I do say so myself, Misty.

What a delightful moniker.

You see, Misty...

[Stewie giggles]

...my time manipulator employs axioms...

...from the quantum theory
of molecular propulsion.

I've broken my pencil!

I have a<i> Barney</i> pen in my purse.

You are spectacular!

Chris, what are you doing here?

Sorry, Mom.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

Chris, go to your room!

Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one...

...of your oh-so-exhilarating games
of peekaboo?

Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!

PETER: No, I'm not!

Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight.

Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

[Sings] "Show me the way to go home"
Everybody!

"I'm tired and I want to go to bed"
Just the women!

Peter, in the 17 years
that we've been married...

...I have never been as angry as I....

What is my piano doing down here?

It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet,
but.... Never mind.

That does it, Peter.
Either this bar goes or I do!

PETER: I haven't even told you
the other reason your piano's down here.

I wanted you to play it.

Like it was an instrument.
I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?

Come on!

I couldn't.

Come on!

Maybe one song.

Pretend you like it
no matter how bad it stinks.

[Lois chuckles]

[Starts playing piano]

[Sings] "You'll never know just how much

"I love you

"You'll never know just how much I care"

Yeah!

"And if I try, I still

"couldn't hide my love for you

"You oughta know
for haven't I told you so?"

Okay, guys. Thank you.
You can stop pretending now.

GUY: All right!

"If there is some other way
to prove that I love you

"I swear I don't know how"

MAN: Sing it.

Something troubling you, Peter?

Nothing. Just all my friends
are eye-humping my wife.

"You'll never know if you don't know now"

[Applause]

GUYS: Wonderful! Wow!

[Cheery instrumental music]

It was absolutely amazing.

The second that spotlight hit me,
I became a whole different person!

Silence, you contemptible shrew!

I bet your gums are still sore.

You're so observant, aren't you?
Are you a detective?

Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this!

I must complete my time machine,
move time forward, and end this agony!

CHRIS: Hey, Dad.

Mom says she was really on last night.

Yeah. About that. Lois, see,
the guys were just being polite.

They thought your singing was too....

I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.

Tonight? Honey, I don't think
anyone's gonna come back tonight.

LOIS: [Sings] <i>"Gimme, gimme, gimme</i>
<i>what I cry for</i>

<i>"You know you got the brand of kisses</i>

<i>"that I die for"</i>

This one takes me back.

Now that's a woman!

That's a house. That's a fish.
That's a bee!

<i>"You know you made me love you"</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

[Band strikes up]

<i>I was born in a little town called Quahog.</i>

FAN: We love you, Lois!

[Lois laughs]

<i>Let me finish the story, fellas.</i>
<i>You don't want to be up all night.</i>

<i>Or do you?</i>

"Or do you?"

She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she?

Are you a woman?

No.

My house arrest is over, Brian.
Round up the guys.

Now that I'm a free man,
we can do anything we want.

The guys only want to do one thing.

And that's ogle your wife.

If Lois were my woman,
I'd keep an eye on her.

Then again, I'm the jealous type.

Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act.
Nice melons.

Listen, pal--

Peter, I'm holding melons.

And her hooters ain't bad either!

Now hang on a second there!

Peter, I'm holding hooters.

Sorry.

No problem.

Your wife's hot!

PETER: That's it!
Your singing days are over.

If I wanted to marry Lola Falana,
I would have.

Look, Lola. This whole thing
is just going way too fast for me.

For the last time, I'm not Lola!
I'm Leslie Uggams!

Peter, having me sing was your idea
in the first place.

I just wanted to keep my bar.

I built that thing so my friends...

...would come to see me, not you.

Is that so? Let me tell you something.

I love singing!
And I will continue to sing!

How dare you upset me
this close to showtime!

Lois.

Watch where you're going, buddy.

Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you.

Listen, I don't want any more trouble.

Thanks to your wife...

...my husband hasn't been home all week!

That singing hussy is destroying
our marriages!

[Women murmuring]

Yeah, then do something about it.

Come to my basement tonight and
drag your husbands out of there.

Maybe we will.

Yeah!

Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?

LOIS: <i>This next number is dedicated</i>
<i>to my very supportive husband, Peter.</i>

Hit it!

[Sings] <i>"Don't tell me not to fly</i>
<i>I've simply gotta</i>

<i>"If someone takes a spill</i>
<i>it's me and not you</i>

<i>"Don't bring around a cloud</i>
<i>to rain on my parade"</i>

Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?

Yes, your judgment lately
has been rather....

You have crappy judgment anyway.

STEWIE: This is intolerable!

This foolishness is preventing me
from completing work on....

Egads! The blueprints
for my time machine!

Those are for my eyes only!

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Look everyone,</i>
<i>Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.</i>

No!

[Fan whistling]

Hold up the picture. Let's see.

No! Nothing to see here.

GUY: How cute. It's a time machine!

No! It's a....
Blast, what the devil do children draw?

It's a pheasant!

A time machine. Sure.
Here's where the flux capacitor goes.

I can't wait to build
one of these of my own.

I'll not stand idly by
while you abrogate my plans.

You shall rue this day.
Go on! Start ruing!

Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs
to kiss you good night.

Burn in hell!

<i>Hell. Hell has fire.</i>
<i>And you know what else?</i>

[Sings] <i>"It's got steam heat</i>

<i>"I got steam heat</i>

<i>"But I need your love to keep away </i>
<i>the cold</i><i>I got--"</i>

ANGRY PARENT: All right, break it up!

What's going on here?

Your little peep show is over!
We're taking back our men!

Peep show? I just do this for fun.
Look, all day long I scrub and cook...

...and take care of my kids.
And nobody cheers.

No one even says thank you.
But when the band starts playing and...

...the music's flowing through me,
I feel, I don't know, special.

I guess you all think that's pretty silly.

Not at all.

You didn't tell us that part!

Peter, you're behind all this?

Yes. And you'll never catch me!

[Giggles maniacally]

[Screams repeatedly]

I bet he also didn't tell you he never
helps me around the house.

Or takes me out to dinner.
Or notices when I get my hair done.

-Oh, no, that's just....
-My husband's the same way.

So's mine.

[People chattering]

Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons.
I'm gonna go grab some ozone.

Peter! There's a king in the cards!

They saw my blueprints!
What a grievous breach of security!

Damn! What do to? Wait for it.... Yes!

Instead of moving time forward
to bypass this wretched teething...

...it might just be possible to reverse
time's heady flow...

...and undo ever having drawn
those damnable blueprints.

-You'll never get away with this!
-Silence!

Lois, you make it sound
like I don't appreciate you at all.

Peter, when was the last time
you told me you love me?

You know I do.

I want to hear it!

Is that what this is all about?

Run for your lives!

Holy crap!

Hot!

[Explosion]

[Screaming]

LOIS: There's no way out!

At last! My time device is complete!
Just one final adjustment. There.

Now I shall negate ever having drawn
those damnable blueprints.

Blast!

Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise
if we get out of this alive...

...I'm gonna help out around the house
and say "I love you" every day.

You mean it?

I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man.

And to think, if I hadn't taken
Chris to his soccer game...

...I never would've learned
this valuable lesson.

[People talking backwards]

[Mystical instrumental music]

[Backwards speech slowing]

Honey, I'm begging you.
Drop Chris off at his soccer game...

...and come right home.

I need you to look after Stewie
while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!

All right! You know I spoil you.

My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll
have to take Chris yourself.

[Giggles]

-My device! My teeth!
-I'm free! Free!

I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor!

I think not!

Bicuspid! We meet again.

-Have at you!
-En garde!

Shall we bite the tongue then?

On three. One, two....

[Screams]

[Theme music]
S01E05.en
[Cheery instrumental music]

Machiavelli! You've told me nothing
I don't already know!

Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>.

LOIS: Stewie, those books aren't
for babies. Here. Watch the <i>Teletubbies</i>.

How dare you! That book may hold the key
to my enslaving of all mankind.

Fuzzy.

[Giddy laughter]

<i>Tickle.</i>

God. The more I resist, the more
intriguing they become! I can't look away!

TELETUBBIES: <i>Again! Again!</i>

Yes! Yes! Again! Again!
Dear God, please once more!

PETER: Sorry, Stewie.

<i>A&E Biography</i> is doing the life
of the other guy from Wham.

I'm free! Free from the spell
of those diabolical Teletubbies!

Thank you. When the world is mine,
your death shall be quick and painless.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Attention, please.

Tomorrow is softball practice. We have
a lot of work to do for Saturday's game.

Don't forget how badly we were humiliated
last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.

[Raucous laughter]

[Peter giggles]

Look at those morons
and their stupid glasses.

Oh, man. I hate those guys.

More than I hate spinach, traffic jams,
and the last few years of <i>M*A*S*H</i>.

When Alan Alda took over
behind the camera...

...and the show
got all dramatic and preachy?

Am I right? Who's with me?

This year we will defeat those Pranksters
with our secret weapon...

...Guillermo.

[Screaming]

Bravo!

I hired Guillermo because I believe
he'll be an asset to our company...

...on and off the field.

MR. WEED:
You have impeccable credentials.

I'm sure I can find a position
for you somewhere.

Back to work, people.

PETER: Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for
a new line of TV action figures.

<i>Facts of Life</i> Transformers, huh?
Watch the transformation.

Cute as a button...

...fat as a cow...

...radioactive scorpion.
Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.

-I'll consider it.
-He'll consider it!

I got another one where Natalie's one of
those spittin' lizards from <i>Jurassic Park</i>.

[Applause on TV]

<i>Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle.</i>
<i>"Go tuck yourself in."</i>

PAT: <i>You got it.</i>

Well, you were close, Dad.

Yeah. I still can't believe we missed
the phrase, "My hairy aunt."

Come on, Brian.
I gotta get to softball practice.

Practice? I thought we'd go next door
and welcome our new neighbors.

No. I don't want anything to do
with neighbors.

Last guy who lived next door
borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.

If that slut wants full custody
of the kids, she's got it.

[Short-circuiting]

Peter, they might be very nice people.

"Very nice people."
Yeah, that's what they always say.

Then you open up the septic tank and...
Skeleton city!

[Panting]

Pervert!

Don't flatter yourself, honey.
I don't have any sweat glands.

MR. WEED: Okay, time for batting practice,
my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys.

Guillermo, you're up.

Unfortunately Johnson isn't here
to pitch today. His wife is in labor.

Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him?
Jeez, I'll pitch.

I don't know what's more questionable,

your pitching arm
or Bill Clinton's integrity.

Oh, how hard--

[Laugh track]

Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?

-Okay. Take your base.
-Somebody call 911.

Tell them he is allergic to penicillin
and white zinfandel!

Idiot! If you don't find a ringer
to replace Guillermo, you're fired!

Man. What'll I do if I get fired?
I'll have to go back to my old job...

...as a Calvin Klein model.

FEMALE VOICE 1:
<i>I don't wanna be</i><i>like everyone else.</i>

MALE:<i> But I don't want</i><i>to be different.</i>

FEMALE VOICE 2:<i> I just want to be.</i>

PETER: <i>What was the name</i>
<i>of the bad guy from</i> Tron<i>?</i>

<i>This is gonna drive me nuts!</i>

LOIS: Moving is never easy on a family.

Well, we are gonna miss
the go-go-go pace of Providence.

But with number two on the way,
Joe thought it was time to move.

And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.

Quahog can be pretty exciting, too.

Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.

I-17. Darn it.

[Screams]

I haven't played Bingo in years!

Silence! Ever since you two met,
you've done nothing but wax idiotic!

I must escape this infernal babble!

[Chuckles] What a little explorer.

Yes. He's so full of wonder.

To be the Lindbergh baby right about now.

BONNIE: Joe, you have to meet
our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.

It's a pleasure, Lois.
Who's the little guy?

This is Stewie.
Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.

You will bow to me.

MEG: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.

I know.
I've admired you in the garden from afar.

-Will you go out with me?
-I'd love to.

[Romantic instrumental music]

CHRIS: Oh, he's gay.
MEG: You wish!

Get out of here, you mouth breather!

PETER: <i>I'm as good as fired.</i>

Where the hell am I gonna find a guy
as strong as Guillermo?

One time I walked into the locker room,
I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.

PETER: Great. Lois is getting chummy
with the new neighbors.

BRIAN: She wants you to meet them.
PETER: She's always making me be social.

Cocktail parties, school functions,
that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

What? Look, all I'm saying is
put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy...

...and I can't tell the difference.

-You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
-Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil.

You got a neighbor
on the other side of your house, too.

So, don't think you always have to bug me.

I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have
a screwdriver I can borrow?

Man, you neighbors are like viruses.
Starts with a screwdriver.

Before you know it,
you're using my supermarket...

...my dry cleaner, and even my postman.

Can you believe that guy?
"Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"

What an ass.

-Did you find a replacement for the team?
-No. Believe me, I've been looking.

Hideo-san would be honored to play
for your team.

But he wishes to know
what compensation you offer.

Me love you long time.

Gosh, I'd like to help.
But I've gotta go out in the hall...

...and chew on my ass for five minutes.

LOIS: Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie
to your game on Saturday.

Lois, I don't want those people there.

See, this is why I ask you to submit
everything to me in writing first.

Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan.
He played in college.

He did?

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Hiya, Joe.

-Peter!
-Don't get up.

This is a surprise.
I kinda thought you didn't like me.

What? Because of what I said
this afternoon. No.

See I have that disease
where stuff pops out of your mouth.

Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?

I'm so sorry.

I thought maybe I crossed the line
when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.

Are you kidding?
You can borrow whatever you want.

Great. Say, you don't happen
to have any picture wire, do you?

Picture wire? You son of a bitch.

[Dreamy ringing]

Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
There it goes again.

I don't want to impose.

No problem. That's what neighbors do.
You know what else they do?

They play on their neighbor's company
softball team like this Saturday.

PETER: What do you say, neighbor?
JOE: Sounds fun.

So much fun it should be illegal
like copyright infringement.

[Mickey voice] See you at the game, Joe.

[Cheery instrumental music]

-Hey, you want a piece of gum?
-Thanks.

-That was joke gum.
-What do you mean?

Now you're addicted to heroin.

I'm cold.

LOIS: Hey, Peter!

MR. WEED:
It's nice that your family is here.

If your ringer doesn't arrive soon,
you can spend every day with them...

...at home.

He'll be here, Mr. Weed.
You should see this guy in action.

PETER: He can hit, he can throw--
JOE: Peter!

MR. WEED:
What's he doing in a wheelchair?

Holy crip, he's a crapple!

Peter, our new secret weapon
is this very attractive paraplegic?

Okay, Joe, you got me.
Rise and shine. Come on.

-Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.
-You're a hoot, Peter.

-Play ball!
-Let's do it!

I swear I didn't know. Maybe
they won't hit a lot of balls to him.

JOE: I got shortstop.

The movers tracked grease
all over my carpet.

-I tried everything to get the stain out.
-What about lemon juice?

-What about club soda?
-What about shutting the hell up?

Isn't baseball great?

They say baseball's the national pastime.

I can't taste salt.

Crap! Don't hit it to Joe.
Please don't hit it to Joe!

[Fans cheering]

You're out!

All right, Joe!
Way to earn that parking space!

BONNIE: All right!
LOIS: Did you see that?

BONNIE: That's my Joe!
STEWIE: What the deuce?

Half man, half machine.

STEWIE: Why with that technology,
I could escape these wretched harridans!

Go, cyborg!

[Fantastical instrumental music]

MR. WEED: It all rests
on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!

[Whooshing]

MR. WEED: All right, Joe! Run!

All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!

MR. WEED: Hurry! Joe!
All right! Yes, <i>vamos</i>!

PLAYER: Let's hear it for Joe!

Yeah, let's hear it for the guy
who found Joe!

Okay.

That's finger suckin' good, huh?
It's an old policemen's recipe.

Eat up, everyone.

Tonight my wife won't be the only one
enjoying a pig in a blanket.

BONNIE: Joe, you're so funny.

They love that one down at the Precinct.

This sucks, Brian.
Joe is stealing my thunder.

Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!

-Face it. He's the life of the party.
-Yeah?

I'll show you who's the life of the party.

Hey, look!
I fell in the pool with my clothes on!

How hilarious is that?
That is so Peter Griffin. Guys?

Guys?

JOE: That's my idea.
MR. WEED: Peter, come here.

Finally. A little recognition.

Joe has the most wonderful idea.

Hey, I just suggested a line
of handi-capable toys, you know...

...to show kids the fun side
of being physically challenged!

That's what kids want to play with.
Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble.

What about my idea? Come on!
Tootie morphs into a stink bug.

Joe, you're exactly the kind of man
we need at our company.

Peter, make yourself useful.
Go get Joe a drink.

Jeez, first he takes my friends.
Then he takes my job.

But the way I wear my hat...

No, no. He can't take that away from me.

You! How came you
by this metal construct?

-I demand to know who made you!
-Stewie, it's not polite to point.

I'm so sorry.

That's okay, Lois.
He's just curious about the chair.

About 10 years ago I was investigating
a robbery at an orphanage.

JOE: <i>It was Christmas Eve</i>
<i>and some presents had been stolen.</i>

[Tense instrumental music]

[Grunting]

Reach for the sky, dirtbag!

All right, pal!
You've stolen your last Christmas.

[Exciting instrumental music]

"You think you have won
You think all is well

"But kiss my green ass
I shall see you in hell!"

[Screaming]

Are you Timmy?

Merry Christmas, Timmy.

Enough!

If you won't share your technological
schemata with me peaceably...

...I shall take the information
from you by force!

Wow. Looks like you have a fan.

-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Peter, you can't leave.

Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd...

...take them on a dream vacation
to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.

What are you talking about? We want to
hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.

He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.

Well, technically he was killed
by the state, but funny story.

He did curse my name
just before the injection.

LOIS: Peter, what's the matter with you?

Why are you guys making such a big deal
over Joe?

You don't admire wheelchair people.
You're supposed to feel sorry for them.

When did it become okay
to be handicapped?

Don't talk like that!

He's a remarkable man
and the rest of your family adores him!

Fine. Then why don't you all marry him?

And if he's so remarkable,
let's see him do this.

Hey, look at me. I'm walking.
I'm a remarkable man.

[People laughing next door]

Well, look who finally came home.

I thought you were gonna spend
all night at Joe's.

I could've.
That man has got magic fingers.

He found this one spot behind my ear, I...

Forget about it.
I thought my leg was never gonna stop.

I don't believe this.

My whole family worships the ground
that guy can't walk on.

It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero.
He makes the world a better place.

I've done lots of things to help people.

Remember the time I sang to the kids
at the Sunday school?

Yes, you forgot the words.

[Singing] "Jesus loves me

"He loves me a bunch

"Because He always puts Skippy

"In my lunch"

No. It's not the same thing.
Joe puts himself in real danger every day.

You're right.
I'll never be that kind of hero.

Unless I put myself in real danger, too!
For my family's sake!

BRIAN: Why are the pretty ones
always so dumb?

[Creepy instrumental music]

[Screaming]

[Cat squealing]

DISPATCH: <i>Gang shooting on</i>
<i>Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.</i>

Is it me or is rap music
just getting lazier?

No. It's my new police scanner.

This hero thing is gonna be easy
once I find the right crime.

DISPATCH: <i>Domestic disturbance--</i>
PETER: Boring!

DISPATCH: <i>Report of a stabbing in--</i>

DISPATCH: <i>All units! A major robbery</i>
<i>is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust.</i>

<i>Suspects are armed</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

-Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
-Over at Joe's.

Well, go fetch 'em.

They're about to see
a real hero in action. To the Batcave!

[Adventurous instrumental music]

[Bats crying]

PETER: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

PETER: You thought Joe was something.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

LOIS: Peter, what's the big rush?

All right, you guys wait right here.

Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal.

ROBBER 1:
Give Tammy a round of applause.

This was her first robbery
and she was very brave.

[Muted laugh]

Now before we go--

No, don't go.

Oh, princess, we have to.

PETER: I hope you brought
your striped pajamas, boys.

Because there's a five-year sleepover
at the big house. And you're invited.

ROBBER 2: You'll never take us alive!

[Gunshots]

Lois and the kids
should be in here to see this.

Yes. It's going very well.

Mom, what do you do when you like a boy
but he doesn't even notice you?

Meg loves Kevin.

Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!

Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl.
He'll come around.

Such a mom answer.

Have you tried showing off the goods?
How's that for a mom answer?

Creepy.

I saw some cute dresses down the street.

If nothing else, it'll make you
feel better. Come on, you guys.

BRIAN: If you want to be a hero,
now might be a good time.

This isn't what I was expecting.

I thought being a hero
would be all fun and games.

[Heroic instrumental music]

PETER: Sorry, Wonder Woman. I got
three kings. Now let's see your pair.

[Wonder Woman sighs]

All right. Robin, what are you looking
at me for? Look at her.

[Space whooshing]

ROBBER 2: Come on. Let's go.

<i>Oh, perfect.</i>

ROBBER 2: We got hostages!
Don't try anything funny!

Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.

Good. I was afraid
you were just gonna improvise.

Actually, I was gonna use
the little girl as a human shield...

...and run like hell.

But improvise,
that'll be easier on my back.

[Space whooshing]

Okay, in this improv, Tammy and
the short robber are husband and wife.

PETER: Okay. And where are we?
GUY: A bar!

MAN: A pet store!
GRANNY: Guadalajara, Mexico!

Okay, okay. I heard pet store.
And I'm the gruff but lovable owner.

All right. Begin. Hello, married couple.
I see you found a puppy.

Yeah. His name is Sparky.

PETER: Well, before you take Sparky home,
let me check him for worms.

Okay, drop it!

All right, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

COP: All right, stand back!

Whoa. Hang on. Sorry, no one can leave.

Listen, the whole reason I saved
you guys today was so I could be a hero.

This wheelchair guy moved in next door
and he can do all these great things and--

Your family idolizes the lousy cripple
and not you?

That's right! How'd you know?

We've all been there.

CHRIS: Cool! The bank is getting jacked!

LOIS: Officer, my husband's in there!

-Can you tell me if he's okay?
-What's he look like?

LOIS: He's wearing a white-collared shirt,
kind of big, with glasses.

COP: I got him.
LOIS: Oh, thank God.

-Take him out.
-No!

Check it out! It's John F Kennedy
Pez Dispenser.

Oh. Good thing I still have
my Bobby Kennedy Pez Dispenser.

Hey, there's my family.

I just want you to know I rob banks...

...because a deaf man stole my job
at the phone company.

So if anyone's gonna bust me,
I'm glad it's you.

[Tense instrumental music]

But... But I was gonna be a hero.

Nobody's going anywhere!

Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!

<i>A failed robbery at</i>
<i>Quahog Bank and Trust...</i>

<i>...has led to a terrifying </i>
<i>hostage situation.</i>

<i>That's right. A hostage situation.</i>

-I gotta go.
-I know.

If we want the cops to take us seriously,
we have to waste a hostage. But who?

-Excuse me. Shouldn't that be "whom"?
-Okay, you.

Crap!

JOE: <i>This is Police Lieutenant</i>
<i>Joe Swanson.</i><i>I know we can work this out.</i>

Not him again. I hope this place
isn't wheelchair accessible.

Bonnie, it's Peter.

Don't worry.
Joe's an excellent negotiator.

I was a virgin when we met.
It took him three hours.

I can't believe my dad is in there.

This'll probably scar me
for the rest of my life.

I got a new dress.

Try talking about him.

So do you like music?

Yeah! I played guitar
in a band before we moved.

But it interfered with my studies.
What do you listen to?

You first.

I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur.

My parents don't like me
listening to that stuff.

But I do anyway because I am not a robot!

I also like Radiohead.

<i>And even though society has turned</i>
<i>its back on you...</i>

<i>...I promise you there are </i>
<i>people who care.</i>

<i>And you know what? I'm one of them.</i>

He sure gets it.

Maybe he's right.
We can make a new start.

Come on, guys.

Don't let him sweet talk you like that.

Wait. You can't leave now.

PETER: I'm supposed to be the hero. Wait!

Can you let me pistol-whip you
a couple times for the camera?

Stupid robbers with your guns
and your make-out parties.

[Crowd cheering]

[Cops cheering]

Excellent!

They detached the human component
from the machine.

Machine, I am your new master
and I order you to go!

Engage!

Blast! Must be some kind of
proprietary command system.

Now on the Russian MiG,
it's next to the altimeter.

LOIS: There you are.
I can't turn my back on you for a second.

One day I shall unlock the secret
of that device.

And when I do, Mother, victory shall be--

Peter, you had us so worried.
What on earth were you trying to prove?

I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy.

I guess I was just tired of him
being your hero.

Peter, Joe is a hero.
But he's not our hero.

-You are.
-Really?

Yeah.

You're always right there on the couch
for us, making us laugh when we're upset.

Changing the channel
when something boring comes on.

Eating the last slice of pizza
so the rest of us don't fight over it.

Yeah, Daddy.
If you hadn't pulled this stunt...

...I wouldn't know
how to manipulate Kevin.

And when the kids at
school see us on TV...

...they'll think you're a total psycho.
And I can say, "That psycho is my dad!"

I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano,
had you not driven me...

...to the ice rink every
morning at 6:00 a.m.

I guess being a hero isn't always
about saving lives and catching bad guys.

It's also about just being there
for the people you love.

OLD WOMAN: Help!
Someone just stole my purse!

Who cares? I don't even know you.

[Theme music]
S01E06.en
Blasted matriarch!

She has failed once again to replenish
this frigid box with potations.

I shall give her a piece of my mind!

Damn it!

Now look here, you.... Oh, my God!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie.

What you saw was actually
a very beautiful thing.

Evidently, madam, you and I differ greatly
in our conception of beauty.

What I just witnessed
was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!

Stewie, mommies and daddies
like to hug each other that way.

In fact, sweetie,
that's sort of how you were created.

That is a vile and odious lie!

How dare you fill my head
with such loathsome propaganda?

Get out, you horrid woman!

Okay, honey. I'll go get your teddy bear.

[Stewie moaning]

Good Lord.
You saw them together, didn't you?

You know the tub
where you take your little baths?

They've done it there, too.

[Exclaiming]

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"He's a family guy"

What in the name of our Christian God?
You're out of the semicircle!

All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!

Why?

Why? Saunders, tell him why!

Because it's Rule 142-B!

Because it's Rule 142-B!

Good job, Scout.
Now drop and give me 20!

Thank you, sir!

Ladies, this Saturday at 0800
there will be a soapbox derby...

...as a reward for all your obedience.

[Scouts barking]

[Cheery TV theme music]

<i>Mom, Dad, I really like Potsie.</i>

<i>Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.</i>

<i>No, Mom. I mean, I really like Potsie.</i>

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
<i>We heard you the first time.</i>

<i>You have a homosexual attraction</i>
<i>to Potsie.</i>

Anything on that remote lower than mute?

I got a surprise for you, Chris.

It'll have to wait.
This is where the Fonz goes....

[Exclaiming]

[Exclaiming]

[Laughing]

Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.

Chris, this is the speed machine
that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.

But, Dad, I was supposed to
build it myself. It's a rule.

Come on. Rules were made to be broken.

[Peter grunts]

Here, let me show you the turbo booster.

Dad, what would you say if I told you
I didn't want to be in the Scouts?

I'd say come again?
And then I'd laugh because I said "come."

But thank God that's not the case.
You're a Scout.

And you know what that means?
That means I love you.

Meg?

Chris, get out of here!
You're not allowed in my room.

I thought that was just
when you were asleep.

What do you want?

I don't want to be in the Scouts anymore.
I just want to draw.

I was kinda hoping you could tell Dad.
But try and open with a joke.

Tell him yourself.

I can't.
I don't want to disappoint him again.

You remember when he tried to sneak me
into the County Fair?

One, please.

[Chris sneezes]

Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed!
And horses can't talk! No!

Nothing about this adds up at all!

Okay, look. Dad is really easy.
All you have to do is sit on his lap...

...give him a big kiss on the cheek, look
him right in the eye, and he's butter.

What the hell?

Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And I....
Wait a minute.

Chris, I am going to stand up,
walk out of this room...

...and we will never speak of this again.

[Moans]

[Exciting instrumental music]

Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha!

The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!

But Pops, I must race! Ha-ha!

Very well.
But I am not really your father! Ha-ha!

[Exclaiming]

[Crowd cheering]

Okay girls, get ready...

[Scouts making revving sounds]

...get set....

[Stammering]
Please God, I don't ask you for much.

But let my boy win this race.

Do not go until I wave my flag.
I can't stress that enough.

I'll wave it once
just to show you how it looks.

CHRIS: Look out!

LEADER: Griffin is disqualified!

[Leader grunting]

LEADER: Your boy is out of the Scouts!

Who died and made you President Nixon?

Look, it's been two years!

Your idiot son hasn't earned
a single merit badge.

If you'll excuse me,
I've got to administer some spankings.

Come on. Give him a little more time.

All right!
You've got three days to earn a badge!

Three days! That's tomorrow!
We gotta get going!

[Cheery instrumental music]

Stewie, look what
Mommy made for dessert.

Jell-O. How exotic!
I feel like I'm on the deck of the <i>QE II</i>.

Me and Chris will take ours to go.

We've only got one more night
to get that badge.

Dad, maybe we should just give up.
I mean, we tried everything.

We almost got that one for insect study.

Look, Chris.
It's a whole family of WASPs.

My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.

Perhaps I can't bake a ham.

But what I can cook up is a little
grace and civility at the table.

Patty, did you know that your mother
is a whore?

I think it's great that you and Chris've
been spending so much time together.

But he's the one
who should be earning that badge.

Where do you get off telling me
how to raise my son?

Right. Okay.
We'll try it your way, honey.

[Laughing nervously]

PETER: There's my Scout!

Not anymore, Dad. I'm out.

They made me turn in my uniform
and everything.

What? Those bastards!
Don't you worry. I'll get you back in!

It's okay, Dad. I'm not really--

Don't take no for an answer, Chris.
You're a Griffin.

And a Griffin never knows when to stop.

PETER: Clear!

PETER: Clear!

[Gasping]

You saved my life, Doctor!

PETER: Clear!

I'm calling that troop leader.
We're going over his head.

Straight to the Scout head office
in New York.

Pack your bags, you guys!
The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!

Ha-ha! Did you hear?
The Griffins are going to New York!

This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!

I can't believe we're going to New York.

Dad, you don't really have to do this.

Yes, I do. No boy of mine is gonna get
booted out of the Scouts.

[Chris moans]

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Strapping you in, honey,
so you don't get hurt.

So I don't get hurt.

That's the best you can do,
you dull-witted termagant?

I brought your Raffi tape.

Play <i>Wheels on the Bus</i>
and get the hell out of my sight.

Where's Brian?

Aren't you coming?

No, thanks. I've been to New York.

It's like Prague sans the whimsy.

Will you be okay by yourself?

I think I'll manage.

All right, you guys. We're off!

Those Scouts are never gonna know
what hit them.

And neither will that guy.

[Tires squealing]

[Adventurous instrumental music]

Okay. I'm thinking of a movie.

-Is it an action movie?
-No.

-Is it a musical?
-No.

-Is it a good movie?
-It has its moments.

-<i>Cool Runnings</i>.
-Right!

Would you please ask for directions?

We are not lost. And even if we were...

...I can't ask a human being
for directions.

-Why not?
-Because I'm a man.

Haven't you ever seen
a stand-up comedian, Lois?

Dad, maybe we should go home.

No way.
We came to get you back into the Scouts.

And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

[Gurgling]

-What was that?
-Nothing.

[Gurgling]

Peter, the car is making funny noises.

You're wrong again, Lois.
That wasn't the car.

Although you were right
about that prune smoothie.

Are you okay?

I'll be fine.
I just have to concentrate on driving.

Excuse me.
Can you tell me how to get to New York?

Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am?

Don't you want to play first?

Thank you.
But I really don't approve of gambling.

Technically it's not really gambling.

We're trying to rebuild

PETER: Where's your mother?

Over there.

I didn't know you knew how to play poker.

-Yeah.
-How you doing?

-Yeah.
-That's good, honey. Let's go.

Yeah.

It's funny. I never knew video poker
could be so much fun.

You win a few hands
and all those lights go off.

And you just feel so good inside.

Yeah, gambling is great.
No question about it.

It felt so good.
I kept putting my money in.

And before I knew it, I'd lost $40.
I'm so embarrassed.

That's okay.
As long as you learned your lesson.

I did, Peter, for a couple of minutes.
Then....

This is so silly.
I started playing again.

I could swear I parked here.

Yeah, you did.
But here's the really silly thing, Peter.

I sort of bet our car.

[Exclaiming]

I won't panic.
I need to go back in the casino...

...and find a high roller who'll pay
$1 million to sleep with my wife.

What? That's ridiculous!

These people took $24
for the island of Manhattan.

They have no idea what things are worth!

MEG: Nice going, Mom.

I finally get my driver's license
and you lose the car to a poker machine.

How ironic.

Don't talk about your mother that way.
She is not an iron.

<i>to get to New York...</i>

<i>...and get Chris back into the Scouts.</i>

But Dad--

I got it.
I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

[Phone ringing]

[Brian laughing]

<i>Damn it, Julie!</i>
<i>I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.</i>

<i>I am just going away for the weekend.</i>

SCHNEIDER: <i>Yeah. All the away.</i>

[TV audience laughing]

[Hooting]

Damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

No answer at the house.
You didn't bet that, too, did you?

I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish.

It just seemed like such a good cause.

Everyone in the tribe gets a share
in the casino's profits.

-What did you just say?
-"I'm sorry."

-After that.
-"I feel foolish."

-After that.
-"Casino's profits."

-Before that.
-"Everyone in the tribe."

The whole thing.

"Everyone in the tribe
shares the profit?"

That's it! Let's go!

I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.

But we're not allowed
to return gambling losses.

I think you can make an exception

in our case, Lenny.
See, I'm an Indian, too.

LENNY AND LOIS: Excuse me?

You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe.

And that entitles me to a share
of your wampum, kemosabe.

Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
Tell me of your history, of your past.

I come from a long line of you people.

My great-grandfather's name
was Jeep Grand Cherokee.

I mean, Chief Grand Cherokee.
He was a rainmaker.

[Native singing]

[Singing]
"I'm so happy doing the neutron dance

"I'm just burning doing the neutron dance"

And he also killed a bunch of Krauts
at Wounded Knee.

So are you gonna
give me back my car, or what?

I have to confer with the council
of the elders. You wait here.

Are you nuts, Peter?
You'll never get away with this.

Why not? I've fooled people before.

You remember that time
I pretended to be gay?

[Cheery TV music]

There is no way
they're gonna believe you're an Indian.

LENNY: He's an Indian.

How do you know?

-I can tell.
-You think everyone's an Indian.

He could just be another moocher.

Maybe we can put him through a test.

Like a really impossible stunt
to prove he's the real deal.

Way to think outside the box, Frank.

To prove you are truly a member of our
tribe, you must go on a vision quest.

Do you know what a vision quest is?

Of course I do. I'm an Indian.
But why don't you explain it to my wife?

She's a little slow in the head.

A vision quest is a sacred
spiritual journey.

Your husband must go out
in the wilderness without food or water.

-Or shoes.
-Yeah. Or shoes.

He must remain there
until he can communicate with nature.

<i>He must hear the wisdom</i>
<i>of the rocks and trees.</i>

<i>And then his guiding spirit</i>
<i>must appear to him...</i>

...and reveal a great personal truth.

And it's gotta be a real vision.

We're Indians.
We're gonna know if he's lying.

[Howling ominously]

[Laughing]

Sucker.

LOIS: Peter, please don't do this.
We can buy another car.

I'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.

Come on.
All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision.

I've had one before.

Oh, my God, Brian.
There's a message in my Alpha Bits.

It says "Ooooo."

Peter, those are Cheerios.

You must begin your journey now.

-Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
-Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.

-Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
-Thanks, Meg.

Yipes.

Dad, can I come?

-How about it, Lenny?
-What the hey? The more the merrier.

Now get the hell out of here, you nut,
and go have yourself a spiritual vision.

[Mysterious instrumental music]

Water! Thank God!

CHRIS: Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
PETER: Of course not.

This isn't the first time
I found my own food in the wild.

[Girl humming]

[Peter shouting]

[Girl screams]

[Laughing]

Dumb broad.

[Screaming]

[Wolf growling]

They've been gone for over six hours.

How long do these vision quests
usually take?

It varies.

It depends on the person's age,
and height, and sign.

You have no idea, do you?

Of course I.... No.

Why would you send
my husband and son out...

...into the wilderness without
any food or supplies?

Because we really like your car?

[Lois sighs]

They're dead, you know.

[Wolves howling]

Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours.

Can't feel my eyes.

Wonder if club-footed midgets
get justice in heaven.

TREE 1: Hot enough for you?

What?

I say, "Hot enough for you?"

Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God!
I'm communicating with nature!

Tree, if one of you falls and there's
no one around, do you make a noise?

Are you kidding? Scott fell last week.

-He hasn't shut up about it since.
-Sure. Stand there and bitch!

But would any of you take the time
to help me?

I'm playing
the world's smallest violin, Scott.

FONZIE: Yo, Griffin!

The Fonz!

[Exclaiming]

What are you doing here?

Shouldn't you be in the middle
of a Tuscadero sandwich?

Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see?

I want to lay a little
personal truth on you.

Now, Mr. C was like a father to me.

And he always listened, you know?

And Griffin, right now, your son needs
you to listen to him. Whoa!

Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie?

There's something I always wanted
to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.

-Did you ever get a sexual disease?
-Herpes twice. And the clap.

[Exclaiming]

Dad? Can I talk to you?

Not now, son!

Sure. Go right ahead.

I don't want to be a Scout, Dad.
I just don't have fun there.

-I guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
-Yeah!

-Dad, this is what I really like to do.
-What? You want to draw?

Son, why don't you
just stick a knife in my heart?

-I mean, so you drew this?
-Yeah. I know they suck.

Not all of them.
Some of these look pretty good.

-Really?
-Yeah!

I didn't know anyone in this family
had any talent.

Except for that one thing
your mother does.

-You mean play the piano?
-No. She.... Yeah.

I probably don't say this often enough.

But I'm really proud of you, Chris.

Thanks, Dad.

[Singing] "And the cat's in the cradle
with the silver spoon

"little boy blue and the man in the moon

"When you coming home, Dad?
I don't know when

"But we'll get together then, son
You know we'll have a--"

Oh, my God!

TREES: Fire!

Let's get out of here!

TREE: Run, you stupid bastards!

Peter? Chris? Thank God. Are you okay?

Fantastic, Lois! I saw my guiding spirit.

Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?

It was amazing! I spoke to the trees.
And I saw the Fonz.

Really? What's the Fonz like?
I bet he's stuck up.

A little. But thanks to him,
me and Chris have never been closer.

I want a spiritual vision, too! Man!

I guess we've lost touch
with our noble roots.

I mean, sure this casino's brought
our tribe money and prosperity.

-But what is the price of our souls?
-$6 million a week.

That sounds right.
Take your crappy car back.

Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.

All right! We did it!
Let's get the hell out of here.

Stupid, greedy savages!

Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say.

This one particular tribe
has lost their way.

But most Native Americans are proud...

...hardworking people
who are true to their spiritual heritage.

They are certainly not savages.

That's funny, Mother.

Just this morning you said they were lazy
like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.

The Mexicans are a clean and industrious
people with a rich cultural heritage.

Yeah. Not like those dumb,
gargantuan Swedes.

Actually, the Swedish people run
the gamut from very short to tall.

And did you know that Sweden gave us
the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel?

Yeah. Which is more than we ever got
from those freeloading Canadians.

Canada sucks.

[Theme music]
S01E07.en
Come on, everyone.

The <i>Eight is Enough</i> reunion show
is about to start.

<i>Mary, have you seen Nicholas?</i>

<i>He's up in his room sulking, Dad.</i>

<i>Yeah. He's still upset</i>
<i>because Abby threw out his baseball cards.</i>

<i>Maybe I should make him a sandwich.</i>

[Laughing]

<i>Dad. That's your solution to everything.</i>

[Sister crying]

<i>Dad!</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Eight is enough.</i>

[Laughing]

<i>You know, I love you girls.</i>

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Splendid.

That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses
will make a serviceable parachute...

...should I need to abandon
my jet in mid-flight.

Once it's built, of course.

Rupert, did you call that engineer
at Lockheed yet?

No, of course you didn't,
you worthless little....

There! See what you made me do?
Do you think I enjoy hitting you?

Actually, I do. I enjoy it so much
I'm going to do it again!

Stewie! My clothes are not for you
to play with, understand?

Thanks for telling me, Brian.

I don't know what we'd do without you.

I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to
hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.

You prance about this house
like the cock of the walk.

But will you be prancing
when there's nothing to prance about?

Will you be prancing then?

You just want to eat him up.

MEG: It is so hot out there!

How hot is it?

I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.

I don't get it.

I think I'm a little sweaty.

You! You seem to know all the players
in this poorly-acted farce.

What do they call that one?

That's Meg, dude. You know that.

Meg! You vile-smelling girl,
you're not to touch any of my things!

You understand me? Dirty girl.

DIANE: <i>Meanwhile, here at home....</i>

<i>...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip</i>
<i>of a freak heat wave</i>.

<i>I don't think you should use</i>
<i>the word "freak".</i>

<i>Some people might find it offensive.</i>

-Finish your oatmeal, son.
-Why bother? I'm just a freak!

<i>We're all a little different, Diane.</i>
<i>Each of us.</i>

<i>Good point.</i>

<i>We're even feeling the effects</i>
<i>of this heat wave here in our studio</i>.

[Sneezing] <i>Freak.</i>
<i>So stay inside and stay cool.</i>

I think I saw one of her nipples!

Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple."

I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Am I to strut about all day like
a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?

Fetch me something linen to throw on
before I call Child Services!

Please don't threaten Mommy.
She's very hot.

Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!

Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly!

Check this out, you guys.

PETER: The Rhode Island Dog Show
Championship is in Quahog this year!

-First prize is $500!
-Really?

If you won, we could use that money
for a new air conditioner.

Brian. You could win for sure.

You could do your impression
of a barbershop quartet.

[Singing] "We were sailing along

"On Moonlight Bay

"We could hear the voices singing

"They seemed to say"

Sorry. I don't do dog shows.
It's not my thing.

Come on.
All you gotta do is a few simple commands.

And maybe a trick or two.
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

[Baby gurgling]

Please, Brian.

I don't know. I mean
I don't even know where my papers are.

Can't you get the money another way?

I've been trying.
That's why I went on that game show.

For $800, this chemical dye is found
in over 95% of all cosmetic products.

Diarrhea.

[Laughter]

What?

Sorry. What is Diarrhea?

Come on, Brian.
We really need a new air conditioner.

[Groaning]

Okay, let's go over the commands.

Sit.

Good. Roll over.

I'm already shvitzing like crazy here.
Let's call it a night.

Do you want to win this thing or not?

We haven't even talked
about how you'll wear your ears.

I was thinking up.

I need a cocktail.

Don't push too hard, Peter.

You gotta take Brian's feelings
into consideration.

After all, it's only a dog show.

Lois, honey, I love you...

...but you're sucking all the energy
out of the room.

[Knocking on door]

Come.

I got you a little something for the show.

It's Italian. Do you like it?

It's exquisite.

It's not for every day.

Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.

I know how hard you've been working.

And the whole family appreciates it.

Thank you, Lois.

I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs
whenever you're ready.

And Brian...

...you look very handsome.

[Inhales deeply]

Showtime!

ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome to the Quahog Dog</i>
<i>Show. Today's competition will be...</i>

<i>...almost as hot as the weather,</i>
<i>which is once again in the triple digits.</i>

[Bird squawks]

Peter, I'm not really comfortable
with all this.

Do I know you?

I don't think I can do this.

You can't back out now. How about a pill?

-Something to relax you before you go on?
-Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?

Not drugs. Just a little blue thing
celebrities take to help them perform.

Well, those celebrities are wrong!

Lois, if Liza is wrong,
then I don't want to know what right is.

STAGEHAND:
Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!

Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle!
It's time to make life a cabaret!

Lady, for God's sake, I'm just
a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!

[Grunting]

You there, child-woman!

I'll give you a shiny dime
if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.

Let me see if I can find you a juice box.

And get the lead out, pudgy!

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".</i>

We're off to a good start.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

ANNOUNCER: <i>A beautiful performance</i>
<i>from "Brain" Griffin!</i>

Go, Brian!

[Crowd applauding]

All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.

What the hell is this?

This? This is the part
where you beg for a treat.

I don't think so.

Brian, you're embarrassing me.

God, he can't expect Brian to do that.

It's easier than it looks, Mom.

Come on, Brian. We had a deal.

Yeah? The deal's off.

Me and the little shred of dignity
I have left will be waiting in the car!

Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me!

I now command you to leave.

Keep going. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.

[Giggling]

How could you let me down
like that, Brian?

I let you down?
Because I refused to demean myself...

...by perpetuating the stereotype
of the good dog?

This is the one thing I ever asked you
to do for us.

This and not do that thing where you
drag your ass across the carpet.

One time I did that!

Peter, Brian, please.

Let's just have a nice family car ride
like we always do.

Yeah.
Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding.

There's no reason to involve
the insurance companies.

I should still take down your information.

Really? You could probably just
buff that out.

Yeah, but I....

I would really feel better
if I got your information.

Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong.

Maybe you really don't care
about this family.

If you cared about me, you'd never
ask me to do something so degrading.

The next time I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it. Understand?

Who wants to sing show tunes?
"In old...."

BRIAN: Stop the car.

PETER: Is that what you want?
Because I'll stop.

BRIAN: Pull over now.
PETER: Fine.

God. Brian, don't do this.

Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad.

Quick! Back up!

[Sorrowful instrumental music]

Great. Is there a problem, Officer?

Can I see your license, boy?

"Boy"?

Oh, God. I left it on my other collar.

-You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
-Look, the name is Brian.

I was just out for a little walk.
That's all.

Without a leash.

I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down
on the sidewalk. Down!

I don't believe this.

I don't suppose you could let us off
with a warning?

Sorry, sir.
But leash laws are for his own good.

The fine is $10.
You behave, little fella, you hear me?

[Slave voice]
Lordy, I'll never roam again!

Jackass.

He's the law outside this house
just like I'm the law inside this house.

-And you better start obeying both of us.
-Look at you.

Big man, can't even afford to buy
an air conditioner for your family.

What a bitch.

DIANE: <i>Good morning Quahog.</i>
<i>The heat wave has finally broken.</i>

<i>It sure has. You know what they say,</i>
<i>"If you don't like...</i>

<i>"...the weather in New England,</i>
<i>go back where you came from."</i>

<i>I don't think that's the expression.</i>

<i>I guess I had too many</i>

[Belching]

<i>God. I hope the boss isn't watching.</i>

[Laughing]

I don't know how those two manage
to be so perky in the morning.

Something smells good.

Homemade cinnamon buns
fresh from the tube.

[Giggling]

Nothing says "I love you"
like something from--

What the hell are you doing,
you crazy bitch?

These oughta cheer Brian up.
Cinnamon buns are his favorite.

Really?

I could've sworn his favorite was
"treat Peter like crap" buns.

LOIS: Good morning, Brian.

My, your summer coat is really
coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?

Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo
I bought you. It cost a little extra.

But I would do anything for you, Brian.

I'll be on the veranda
since you're already on the cross.

Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.

May I have one on a plate or is
Peter planning to balance it on my nose?

Peter, Brian, stop this.

Can't you two go back to the way
you used to be?

[Ragtime music playing]

We can't go back to the way things were
after how I was treated.

-Not after the things I've seen.
-What did you see? Was it breasts?

Get over it, Brian. I mean,
how bad do you really have it here?

-When I found you, you were just a stray.
-You swore you would never speak of that.

No, thank you. I just had it cleaned.

No. Jeez.

All set, sir.

I don't have any change. Sorry.

That's okay. No charge.

[Sad instrumental music]

Wait.

[Stammering]

You hungry?

Because my wife makes
this beef-a-roni casserole.

Out of this world.

Look, you got everything
you could possibly want right here.

Now just eat your cinnamon bun
and stop being a bad dog.

How dare you?

How dare I?
Where do you think you're going?

Out!

You're not going anywhere
without your leash!

I don't need your damn leash, or you!

<i>I'm going for a walk.</i>

Don't worry.
He won't get far without this.

And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered.

What? That. Yeah.
I'll clean that up on my way out.

See that sign?

Now why don't you go tie yourself
up to that parking meter?

I don't want any trouble.

<i>Mom, have you ever had</i>
<i>a problem with freshness?</i>

<i>What do you mean, honey?</i>

<i>You know. </i>
<i>Have you ever felt not so fresh?</i>

<i>I don't follow you.</i>

<i>Have you ever felt like you're dirty?</i>

That was Brian's favorite commercial.

"Brian"? No, it's not ringing a bell.

Stop it! We all miss him.

Go find him, apologize,
and bring him home.

You heard him. He doesn't want
to be a part of this family.

We don't need him. We'll get another pet.

No way, Dad.
No one can take Brian's place.

STEWIE: Silence!

That mongrel is probably decomposing
on the side of a dirt road as we speak!

-Let's get a kitty!
-See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.

-I don't know, Peter.
-Lois, trust me.

We'll get a lovable kitty-cat
and everybody will feel a lot better.

[Hissing]

PETER: Here, kitty, kitty.
Come on down nice and easy.

That's a good kitty.

[Gasping]

What the hell was that?

Something near a window.
Preferably a booth.

Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans
in the kitchen!

Yeah, that's authentic Italian.

BRIAN: Don't do that.
That's what they expect you to do.

Okay, fine for you.
But what about your puppies?

<i>And your puppies' puppies?</i>
<i>Am I the only one who's outraged here?</i>

I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

How come you're still setting
a place for Brian?

Because when he comes home, I want
him to know he never left our thoughts.

I know you're thinking about him,
too, Peter.

Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me.
Besides, we have a new pet.

And we love our fluffy kitty.

Gross.
Did he just drink from the fountain?

Hey, you!

COP: Stay!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Shouting]

Joyce DeWitt?
So that's where you've been.

Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside.
No dogs allowed in the bus station.

My blind guy's in the john.

I'll point him in your direction.

PETER: Brian's tennis ball.

Man, he loved to play with this thing.

REFEREE: Double fault!

Come on, Brian.

Peter, why don't you
just admit you miss Brian?

You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding?
This family needs Brian. I need him.

[Cat howling]

God, I hate this freaking cat.

Can you spare some change?

Why? So you can go buy yourself
another bottle of booze?

Why don't you make something
of your life, like this dog?

That's me! I mean, that was me.

MAN: Yeah, sure.

No, I mean it. That was me.

Get away from me, you crazy animal!

You want me to be a crazy animal?
Okay, I'm a crazy animal!

Stop! Help!

Help!

BRIAN: All right, who wants to be next?
You? You?

Brian!

PETER: I'm here to bring you...

COP: You're going downtown, pal.

...home.

Hi. How's it going?

Oh, God. I know karate!

[Kung fu noises]

[Dog growling]

Look! A tasty little baby!

I see somebody's been neutered.

Come on, sugar. It's time.

Thank God.

He's cute. Aren't you precious?
Lethal injection. Next!

-What?
-Oh, no!

You can't do this!

Who's up for a little lunch?
Something festive.

Did someone say Tex-Mex?

I'm sorry, sugar.

Help me.

Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

I'll get us the best help there is.

PETER: <i>"Dear MacGuyver....</i>

<i>"Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip,</i>
<i>and a drinking straw.</i>

<i>"Please save my dog."</i>

You're looking well.

Don't get too close.
They say I'm dangerous.

That's why the man's gonna put me down.

Don't say that, Brian.
Peter is working on your appeal.

You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.

I may have been born with my eyes closed,
but now I see the world for what it is.

I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.

Great news!
The City Council agreed to hear your case!

BRIAN: You're kidding! If I prepare
my case, I might have a chance after all.

I don't know how to thank you.

We're family.
This is what we do for each other.

Right, Peter?

LOIS: Peter, don't stare!

[Intense instrumental music]

Good luck, sweetness.

Thanks, Felicia.

This meeting was called...

...to review the judgment
in <i>City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin</i>.

Justice, for all? Or for some?

Does a dog not feel?

If you scratch him,
does his leg not shake?

Yes, he is man's best friend.
But what manner of friend is man?

I would like to cite the case of
<i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>....

Wait a minute.
Why are we listening to a dog?

Take him away!

Does not every dog have his day?

Wait! Please! I gotta say something!

Look, all Brian's ever wanted
is the same respect he gives us.

That and Snausages.
He's mental for those Snausages.

And sure, sometimes we have arguments,
like when he's sleeping on the bed and...

...Lois is in the "oodmay"
but Brian won't "amscray."

-Peter....
-Okay.

Look. The point is, he's a member
of our family first and a dog second.

And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy.

Sometimes we all need a second chance.

Sometimes we all need to forgive!

I stole $10 from Meg's room!

I stole $10 from Mom's purse!

I've been making counterfeit $10 bills
for years.

Mr. Griffin,
this dog is a danger to society.

Albeit an articulate and charismatic one.

But the law is the law and can't
be circumvented by pretty words.

I'll give you each $20.

Deal. He can go.

[All cheering]

STEWIE: Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!

[Triumphant instrumental music]

No. Let him go.

Anybody want more pizza rolls?

Yeah. Quiet, Lois. <i>Murder She Wrote</i>.

<i>Charles Montrose, after all these years.</i>

<i>Jessica Fletcher! Why I haven't seen </i>
<i>you since you had the....</i>

<i>You can say it, Charles.</i>
<i>I'm not ashamed. Abortion.</i>

So she's the murderer!

Come on, kids. Bedtime.

Good night, Brian. And welcome home.

CHRIS: Good night, you guys.
MEG: Good night.

-Dog?
-Yeah?

If you ever tell anyone about that,
I will kill you.

[Theme music]

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Mother, this hot dog has been
on my plate for a full minute...

...and it hasn't yet cut itself.

LOIS: Honey, I'll be right there.

By all means, take your time.

When you do finally get around to it,
I'll be the one covered in flies...

...with a belly that protrudes
halfway to bloody Boston!

MEG: Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping
in Chris' room this weekend!

It smells like old milk in there!

If I could find it, I'd clean it up!

Kids, keep it down.

I haven't even told your father
that Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.

PETER: Who said Marguerite?
LOIS: Peter, it's just for a week.

A week! No. Please, God, kill me now.

Damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a--

LOIS: Peter!

Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear.

Do you swear to tell the whole truth...

...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

I do. You bastard.

I love Aunt Marguerite.

Because if it wasn't for her,
I never would've met you, Peter.

LOIS: Aunt Marguerite,
have you seen my towel?

Have the towel boy bring you another.

I don't want to bother him.

Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt.
Towel boy!

[Dreamy instrumental music]

Hi, my name is towel.
I have a Peter for you.

My name is Peter.
I'll be your nipples... Towel boy!

Oh, jeez.

[Doorbell ringing]

Okay, everyone.

Give Aunt Marguerite
a big Griffin family welcome.

LOIS: Aunt Marguerite!

Lois!

Oh, my God! She's dead!

Whoa!
Be careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?

CHRIS: What if they bury her and she
wakes up because she wasn't really dead...

...she was only sleeping?

Yeah. That's what happened
to our big brother Jimmy.

That's why Mom and Dad adopted you.

What?

Peter, you remember Coco,
my friend from Newport?

Peter, I almost didn't recognize you
without a towel on your arm.

Lois, where are your parents?
Don't tell me they're still on safari.

You know Daddy.

He won't rest until he kills something
on every continent.

But I'm hoping they'll be back
in time for Christmas.

It just wouldn't be Christmas
without your parents.

I dropped my watch.

Would you be a sport and fetch it for me?

Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

[Screaming]

Peter, we've got to put that out!

I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes.

These bluebeards still treat me like scum
'cause I'm not loaded.

I got news for them.
I'm as elegant as anyone in this room.

LOIS: We have to meet
with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow.

She left us something in her will.

Holy crap!
You sweet old broad, I love you!

[Mourners gasping]

[Peter humming]

Oh, my God. She's dead.

Madam Pewterschmidt's passing
has saddened us all.

Yeah, it's a real tragedy.

What did we get? Come on, big money!
No whammy! Stop!

Peter, please! I'm sorry.
He's stricken with grief.

Before she passed,
your aunt recorded a message for you.

ROBIN LEACH: <i>Newport, Rhode Island...</i>

<i>...home of New England's</i>
<i>most elegant and historic estates...</i>

<i>...the Breakers, Rosecliff,</i>
<i>and exquisite Cherrywood Manor...</i>

<i>Marguerite is a shining example of how</i>

<i>It's time you started living</i>

<i>That's why I'm giving you</i>
<i>my summer home in Newport.</i>

Cherrywood?
That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite.

Our own summerhouse!

Now I feel bad for doing that thing
with her toothbrush.

[Broadway showtune music]

STAFF: [Singing]
"We only live to kiss your ass"

Kiss it? We'll even wipe it for you.

STAFF: "From here on in, it's Easy Street"

-Any bars on that street?
-24 happy hours a day.

Oh, boy.

"We'll stop Jehovahs at the gate"

Can I see that pamphlet, sir?

PETER:
"My God, this house is freakin' sweet

[Music continues]

"I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch

"each and every day

"Chocolate cake à la Blake

"Hundred bucks, Blake is gay

"We'll do the best we can with Meg"

It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now.

"We'll do your nails and rub your feet"

That's not necessary. Oh, my.

STAFF: Welcome!

That's a wrap, people.
Let's get the hell out of here.

Wait. Where are you going?

The old bag only paid us up
through the song.

LOIS: We can just pick up after ourselves.

After all, we'll only be here on weekends.

No, Lois.

It's time you started living
like the Piece of Schmidt you are.

That's "Pewterschmidt"!

PETER: Wait, you guys.

You're all hired to be
full-time Griffin servants.

Peter, where are we gonna get the money
to pay all these people?

Simple. I sold our house in Quahog.

You sold our home?

Surprise!

Peter, how could you?

Whoops.

[Singing] "I recognize that tone

"Tonight I sleep alone

"But still, this house is freakin' sweet"

LOIS: Peter, how could you sell our house
in Quahog without even asking me?

Honey, this is where you belong.
You deserve a big house and nice stuff.

Like diamonds.

[Classical instrumental music]

But I love our old house.
You have to buy it back.

It's too late. Our stuff is packed.

It's on its way here.

Come on, Lois,
you'll love living in Newport.

Sure, this house is big,
but it's also very intimate.

[Echoing] <i>Intimate.</i>

MEG: So we're really gonna live here now?

That's right, honey.

I don't know, Peter.

Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool.

CHRIS: Yeah. And there's a chair.

BUTLER: The solarium is at the far end
of the west wing.

TWINS: Come play with us, Stewie,
forever and ever and ever.

Yes. All work and no play
makes Stewie a dull boy.

BUTLER: Across the hall from the library
we have the billiard room.

And here we have the lounge.

Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot!

What can I get you, sir?

We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch

and a wine cellar with
over 10,000 bottles.

Don't make me beg.

I did love spending time here
when I was a kid.

All right, Mom!

COCO: Jonathan and I just returned
from sailing our yacht around the world.

Funny sailing story.

<i>A guy's on his boat,</i>
<i>in the middle of the ocean...</i>

...and he sees a little black dog.

This dog's been swimming for days,
and he stinks like a dead otter.

Peter, maybe this isn't the place--

Hang on, Lois.

So the guy takes the dog into the vet.

<i>The freakin' vet tells him, get this,</i>
<i>"It's not a dog. It's a rat."</i>

A big, stinking Mexican rat. True story.

Dad, that's just an urban legend.

Hand to God. I'm telling you,
it was a huge freakin' rat.

Five times as big as that guy's steak.

LOIS: Peter, that rat gets bigger
every time you tell this story.

I got a million of them.

Like the time my buddy's sister's boss
was drinking with a hooker in a Vegas bar.

Bam! Woke up without his kidney.

[Vomiting]

PETER: I can't believe they kicked me
out of the yacht club.

I barely had time
to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.

Face it, Peter. You have a knack
for saying the wrong thing.

This sucks.

Lois' friend "yacht boy" and his lovely
wife "Caca" invited us to some...

...hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon.
I don't want to embarrass her again.

You gotta help me.
Teach me how to be a gentleman.

BRIAN: Peter, it's not really that hard.
Let's start with polite conversation.

For example, "It's a pleasure to see you
again. Lovely weather we're having."

Now you try.

It's a pleasure to see you again.

After <i>Hogan's Heroes</i>,
Bob Crane got his skull crushed in...

...by a friend who videotaped him
having rough sex.

How's that?

BRIAN: Wow, perfect. My work is done.

But just for the heck of it,
let's try again.

BUTLER: More coffee, madam?

LOIS: I can get that, Sebastian.

To tell you the truth, we're all
a little uncomfortable being waited on.

STEWIE: Cut my egg!

Your eggs are cut, sir.

Cut my milk!

I can't, sir. It's liquid.

Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it!

If you question me again,
I'll put you on diaper detail.

And I promise,
I won't make it easy for you!

Meg, you're gonna love Newport High.
It has a beautiful campus.

Filled with beautiful people.
And I'm gonna bag me a rich one.

Meg, that's a terrible thing to say.

You should marry someone you love.
That's what I did.

And he got us kicked out
of the yacht club.

You can't be mad at your father
for being himself.

That's the reason I fell in love with him
in the first place.

He was so different from everyone else.

[Waltz music playing]

JONATHAN: Coco,
the day I graduate from Harvard...

...I'm gonna carry you off into the sunset
on a white horse.

It better be a stretch horse
with leather seats and a chauffeur.

Isn't she a bit of terrific?

[Laughing]

[Rock 'n' roll music playing]

Kids, if you marry for love,

your life will be filled with
its own riches.

Money doesn't buy happiness.

STEWIE: I beg to differ.

[Rings bells]

STEWIE: You!
Bring me <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>!

You two, fight to the death!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't
have to resort to shock therapy...

...but your progress has been...

Who are we kidding?
You haven't made any progress.

Now the left TV is tuned to <i>Frasier</i>.
The right TV has <i>Ricki Lake</i>.

If you so much as glance at the right TV,
I'm giving you 10,000 volts.

Got it.

NILES: <i>You're so corpulent</i>
<i>that when you sit around...</i>

<i>...the magnificently appointed</i>
<i>Tuscan villa...</i>

<i>...you sit around the magnificently</i>
<i>appointed Tuscan villa.</i>

This is the smartest show on TV.

GUEST: <i>Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend.</i>
<i>She ain't supposed to be having no penis!</i>

[Electricity surging]

Master Brian,
do you really believe you can

pass him off as a gentleman
at the auction?

We've got a long road ahead.
But I've worked miracles before.

PRESENTER:
<i>And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei!</i>

Peter was supposed to meet us here
an hour ago.

I hope he didn't change his mind.

Maybe he's already here.

Maybe he's fitting in so well, we can't
tell him from the other bluebloods.

I don't think we have to worry about that.

[Trumpet fanfare]

Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First.

Play me down the stairs, boys.

[Band playing classical music]

Good day.

<i>Enchanté.</i>

Pasta Fazul.

Looking good, fellas.

Brian, do you know anything about this?

Lois, please. I'm just a dog.
A stupid dog.

Vodka stinger with a whiskey back.
And step on it!

[Piano playing]

COCO: Peter, you're simply enchanting.

You must join us tomorrow
for a game of baccarat.

Right baccarat at you.

[Laughing]

Brian, what happened to Peter?

He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his
mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger.

LOIS: That's not the man I married.

So, I guess, technically,
that makes you available.

What?

Lighten up, toots. It's a party.

[Laughing]

Barkeep,
it's like the damn Sahara over here!

How you doing, honey?

BRANDYWINE: <i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the Historical Society Auction.</i>

<i>Our first item is</i>
<i>a 17th-century gilded vessel.</i>

<i>We'll start the bidding at $140,000.</i>

What a marvelous vessel.

It would look smashing in Lois's crapper.
I mean "crapier".

You are so right.

Any woman would love to have that vase
adorn her crapier.

Jonathan!

$140,000.

$150,000.

Brian, that sounded like Peter.

Come here, you!

[Laughing]

$160,000.

$170,000.

-$180,000.
-$190,000.

$200,000.

<i>We have a new record</i>
<i>for the Historical Society!</i>

<i>The vessel goes to--</i>

$100 million!

<i>To Mr. Peter Griffin</i>
<i>for an astonishing $100 million!</i>

BRIAN: [Singing]
"Money, money, money"

COCO: Peter, we had no idea
you were such a philanthropist.

It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling.

Do you collect <i>objets d'art</i>?

If that's French for "<i>Star Wars</i>
collectors glasses," then <i>sí</i>.

[Laughing]

Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man
since Ted Turner.

I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift
the whole world can appreciate.

I've colorized the moon.

Peter, you don't have $100 million!

Of course I do, my dear.

Now, would that be cash or check?

Drop by Cherrywood this evening.

I'll have the money wired to me
from my Swiss bank account.

Very good, sir.

You don't have a Swiss bank account!

Right.

My lawyer's advised me
to keep some of my assets a secret...

...in case things don't work out.

LOIS: I'm going home. Where's Brian?

I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL.
Can you help me out?

I'm sorry. But I've made my decision.

We're moving back to Quahog
as soon as we can get packed.

Quahog, that one-horse town?

Shut up. No, you shut up.

No, you shut up. You're the one talking.

There's no one else here.
Everybody just shut up!

What's that? The wind!

A pox on Quahog!

BRIAN: Easy!

If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just
so I can poke poor people with a stick!

Bon Jovi, everyone.

Now I remember why I left Newport!

It changes people.
You kids have lost your values.

You've lost your mind! And I don't
much care for Stewie's new friends.

The Pacific Rim economy
is still a tad shaky for my taste.

Stop it!

You can't become a bloody
fiscal hermit crab...

...every time the Nikkei undergoes
a correction!

Asia's market has nowhere to go but up!

Interesting.

Indeed.

I wish we'd never come here
in the first place.

[Sighing snobbishly]

Go buy yourself some more money.

Hey, old bean.

What are you doing
with my <i>Star Wars</i> glass?

Illustrating a point.

Peter, when Han Solo took
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> to Cloud City...

...he saw that Lando Calrissian...

...had turned control of the station
over to Darth Vader.

<i>Lando had forgotten who he was.</i>

It was only after Han was
encased in carbonite...

...and taken by Boba Fett
to Jabba's palace...

...that he was able
to see the error of his ways.

Look inside yourself.

<i>You're not a Newport millionaire.</i>
<i>I created you.</i>

In a way, I am your father.

That's not true! That's impossible.

Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it!

No!

I just had the craziest dream
where I bought a $100 million vase.

BUTLER: A Mr. Brandywine from

the Historical Society
is at the front gate.

He'll be here in half an hour.

BRIAN: That wasn't a dream.
He's here for the money.

Brian, I'm screwed.

If I welsh on that debt,
I'm gonna prove to everyone...

...that I'm not good enough for Lois.

If I only had something
worth that much money.

I never should've dropped
Joe Green's jersey.

Good game, Mean Joe.
You want some of my Coke?

Hey, kid. Catch.

Wow. Thanks, Mean Joe.

What about this house?

I could give him the house
and call it even.

Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million.

Brian, it's the Historical Society.
We just gotta convince him that...

...$100 million worth of history
happened here.

So you're saying that Jesus carved
his name into this mantle...

...51 years before he was born.

Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything.
And look over here.

PETER: That's where the market crashed.
BRANDYWINE: Mr. Griffin!

You can't take a step in this house
without uncovering something historical.

[Locomotive choo-chooing]

Wait a second.

Could that be Harriet Tubman's
secret underground railroad?

It is! Go, Freedom Train!

I've seen enough.

I happen to know that nothing of

historical significance
ever occurred here.

Please, have our money ready
by tomorrow. Good day!

Wait!

Look, this is where the Pilgrims
landed at Fraggle Rock!

LOIS: Excuse me, Lord Griffin.

<i>Your family is going back to Quahog.</i>

If you get tired of being a snob,
look us up.

Lord Griffin is dead.
It's just me, Peter the towel boy.

Peter, you're back! Let's go home!

We can't. I sold our home.

Our beautiful home with
the stolen cable...

...and the man with the penis
for a light switch.

LOIS: We'll find another place.

Your Aunt Marguerite is laughing
at me while she's burning in Hell...

...may she rest in peace.

She was right. Everyone was right.

I'm not good enough for you.

Peter, I don't care what anyone
else thinks.

All that matters is that I love you.

I love you, too, Lois.

[Gears grinding]

Lois, our problems are over!

PETER: Our mansion is historical,
all right.

Cherrywood was America's
first presidential whorehouse!

<i>See, there's Lincoln, Grant, </i>
<i>Robert E. Lee.</i>

Those are fake!

They're real.
And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever.

<i>So you see,</i>
<i>Chubby Franklin lived across the street.</i>

<i>Chubby Franklin would always</i>
<i>make a face like this.</i>

<i>Dad, you're not listening.</i>
<i>I have a serious problem.</i>

<i>I got a girl pregnant. What do I do?</i>

[Audience laughing]

[Rubbery warbling]

<i>Oh, God!</i>

Dad, you never did tell us
how you got our house back.

Simple. I just offered the people
I sold it to double what they paid.

What? But how could you afford that?

I kept one of those Lincoln pictures
and held a little auction of my own.

<i>Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our</i>
<i>house back </i>

<i>and I learned a valuable lesson.</i>

It doesn't matter if your family
doesn't think I'm good enough for you.

That's right, because all that's important
is that I love you.

No, because your ancestors were nothing
but a bunch of pimps and whores.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Got milk?</i>

Listen up, everybody.
Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.

Grandpa Griffin?

Is he the one that smells like firewood
and has big gray pussywillows in his ears?

Chris, that's a terrible word.
"Pussywillows."

My dad worked at that mill for 60 years.
That's almost 80 years.

Tomorrow we'll all go
to a big dinner to honor him.

Why? We barely know him.

Yeah. How come he never visits us?

Kids, your grandfather has never been
comfortable with the fact...

...that I'm not Catholic.

[Church bells ringing]

Dad loves all of us.
He's just too busy working to show it.

He's been that way since I was a kid.

And now the winners of
the father-son three-legged race.

First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad.
Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad.

Third place,
Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.

Now that he's retiring,
we can finally spend some time together.

I want us to have one of those
father-son moments, like on TV.

Where we hug and the music goes...

[Band playing sentimental music]

Thanks, boys. Just like that.

Can you do that fluttery thing like
when the Brady kids run down the stairs?

[Band playing fluttery music]

I don't want to tattle.

But is Bobby really a doctor?

[Trombone sputtering]

Mom, I can't eat.
I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.

I know.
They're like a big, gray enchanted forest.

Kids, your grandfather's ears
are not gross.

And they are certainly not
an enchanted forest.

[High-pitched noise]

<i>But seriously, tonight</i>
<i>we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate...</i>

<i>...the career of our oldest and</i>
<i>most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.</i>

<i>Francis.</i>

[Applause]

[Whistling]

<i>At mass this morning...</i>

<i>...it occurred to me that I may never see</i>
<i>any of your faces again.</i>

<i>I just want to say that Jesus loves you.</i>

<i>But in my eyes,</i>
<i>you're a bunch of sinners and slackers...</i>

<i>...who forced a hard-working</i>
<i>old man to retire.</i>

<i>So you can take this shiny watch</i>
<i>and shove it.</i>

[Gasping]

I adore this man!

That was some speech, Dad.

Yeah. It's a shame Grandma
wasn't there to hear it.

Bless her heart. She's on another one
of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.

Hit me, you five-card stud.

[Hacking cough]

Cocktail!

Aye, she's a rose.

It's a pity you couldn't find yourself
a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.

Francis, this must be embarrassing
for you.

I'm in the car.

Now that you're retired, you're
coming to stay with us.

No more excuses.
I'm putting my foot down.

[Brakes screeching]

Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?

-I don't want to be a bother.
-It's no bother, is it, Lois?

Of course not. It'll be fun.

You're a good woman, Lois.
Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all.

Maybe you'll just go to purgatory
with all the unbaptized babies.

There you go, Lois. You love kids.

Look at that.

Dad's reading Stewie to sleep,
just like he never did for me.

"So God cast the pagans and sinners
into the fiery bowels of Hell...

"...where their flesh burned in agony
forever and ever."

<i>The end.</i>

Children love a good bedtime story
from the Bible.

Yes, charming.
Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.

Hey!

That was a lovely service, Francis.

Super. And only
three more hours till school.

I didn't even know there was
a 5:00 a.m. mass.

I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m.
What else haven't you told me?

I rather like this God fellow.
He's very theatrical, you know.

A pestilence here and a plague there.
Omnipotence!

Got to get me some of that.

Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.

Really? What's your favorite book
of the Bible?

That one where Jesus swallows
the puzzle piece...

...and the man in the big yellow hat
has to take him to the hospital.

[Knocking]

Open this door! Open it, I say!

[Toilet flushes]

Sorry, Grandpa.

You might want to give that
a minute or two.

I know what you're doing in there,
and it's a sin!

If you ever do it again,
you'll burn in Hell!

But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.

Mark my words, lad.

You may think you're alone,
but God's watching.

Don't do it again!

God's watching me do number two?

I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.

Megan!

How was school?

Good. Kevin walked me home.

-Kevin?
-He lives next door.

He lives next door to a harlot!

Grandpa, we were just holding hands.

It'll be easy for him to take your hand
when God strikes your heart with leprosy.

He can take it right home with him!

Lord, it's great to see you kids.

[Theme from <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i>]

[Cheerful theme music continues]

Francis, we were watching that.

I'll tell you how it ends.
Laura burns the roast...

...and God kills her for parading her bum
around in those pants!

[Baseball field organ music playing]

Yeah, not a bad way to kick off
your retirement, huh, Dad?

Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought
fathers and sons together...

...for millions of years.

Stewie's having fun.

Why does that man drop his club
before he runs around?

I would bring it with me.

Hey, who wants a Fenway frank?

Nothing says, "Please talk to me, Daddy,"
like a Fenway frank.

Is there a bathroom here?
I don't think I can wait anymore.

In a public restroom, lad?

For the good of your soul,
show some restraint.

Hey, hot dog guy!

I'll get him.

Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you.

Well, la-de-da.
I don't need my food brought to me.

I'm not a broken-down old mule!
I can still work!

I can still take orders!

Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad!

Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.

He just left without saying anything?
Where would he go?

I don't know. I asked him to buy me
some peanuts and cracker jacks.

I don't care if he ever gets back.

I wasn't being cute.
I really hope he's dead.

<i>Tom, the city of Boston</i>
<i>is examining its conscience tonight...</i>

<i>...in preparation for a visit </i>
<i>from the Pope.</i>

<i>That's right, Diane. </i>

<i>I'll tell you what else</i>
<i>will be examined, this cock.</i>

<i>The Rhode Island Cock Society</i>
<i>is sponsoring free check-ups...</i>

<i>...for this year's Cock Awareness Week.</i>
<i>I don't know why the suggestive name.</i>

<i>They could've just as easily</i>
<i>gone with "rooster."</i>

I'm telling you.
Something must've happened to him.

He's probably hurt, or lost,
or shanghaied by pirates!

That renegade pirate ship captained
by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!

[Phone ringing]

Peter, calm down.
It's his first night of retirement.

He's probably out enjoying himself.

He's in jail.

PETER: Dad, my God, are you okay?

Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!

He's okay! Thank God!

COP: It seems he broke into the old mill
after hours.

We found him working on a kick press.

Dad, you left the ball game with me
to go work in a mill?

Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!

But, Dad, you're retired.

I'd rather be dead.

I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville.
You know what killed it? Talkie pictures.

But you can still make it.
You just need a gimmick.

I, for one, am a tumbler.
Here, watch my round-off.

Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of
my pocket and put one under my tongue.

I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always
been the secret to male bonding.

It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell
and his father in <i>A League of Their Own</i>.

I hate to say this...

...but it doesn't seem like your dad
is interested in bonding with you.

All he cares about is work.

Wait a second. Work!
That's what'll bring us together.

We can start our own father-son business.

[Theme from <i>Sanford & Son</i>]

What are you doing with all them
bathtubs, you heathen dummy?

Pop, why you gotta be like that?

We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary
in them and sell them as shrines.

That's my boy. At least,
that's what your mama always told me.

Now give me a hug before I give you
a knuckle sandwich.

Or you could just get your father a job
with you at the toy factory.

That's an even better idea!
Lois, you're a genius.

Now give me a hug
before I give you a knuckle sandwich.

LOIS: Peter, I can't hug you.

Cut it out. I'm serious.

And this is the nerve center
of the whole factory, my station.

I assemble our new action figure,
Zeke, the moody drifter.

You mean to tell me
you stand here all day playing with dolls?

It's not easy.
See, I gotta twist on his head...

...and stick a tiny pack of smokes
in his torn denim jacket.

[Coughing]

Any of you kids want to see a dead body?

Wait here, Dad.

Hey, Mr. Weed?

Peter.

Listen, I was wondering if you might
have a job for my dad.

Your father?
He must be a man of at least 70.

Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape.
Except his prostate.

At 2:00 a.m. last night, I thought
a horse was using the bathroom.

All finished. What's next?

You did my whole day's work
in five minutes.

We should sell you to the circus,
you freak!

I've never seen such productivity.
How is this possible?

I'll tell you how it's possible.

Because this man always put his job
before everything else.

His wife, his health, even his own son.

Especially his own son.

I need hear no more.
Everyone, this is your new shop foreman.

Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.

Dad, after all these years, you and me
together, side by side, father and son.

Peter, this is truly a miracle.
I'm so grateful.

Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on.

[Sentimental music playing]

Go ahead, Dad.

Thank you, Jesus.

I have a purpose in life again.

Hey! Break up the sewing circle
and get back to work!

My, my. What a thumping good read!

Lions eating Christians,
people nailing each other to two-by-fours.

I say, you won't find that
in <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>.

Please don't say "pooh."

Are you all right? Where's your father?

Still at the factory.
He's turning the break room into a chapel.

A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?

Lois, lunch is a sin.
Taking a break is a sin.

Bestiality is a sin.

I'm not sure how that came up exactly,
but me and Dad have never been closer.

Having him at the factory is the best...

[Snoring]

MAN: I got it.

Your dad stinks.

I'm working triple shifts,
and I'm still not Employee of the Week.

How am I supposed to compete with that?

PETER: Where is he anyway?

This'll be for my fourth birdie.
Looks like someone's in the zone.

Tough break there, Jesus.

Yup. Or was it?

Boo-yah!

Back to work, all of you!
What's going on here?

Dad, some of the guys think that...

...since you took over, work is no fun.

-Work's not supposed to be fun.
-Why not?

Why not?

That's Satan talking! You're a failure
as a worker and as a father!

Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect.

At least I love my kids enough not to
spend every minute of the day working!

I'm a damn good father,
and that's more than I can say about you!

[Gasping]

Peter, you've never spoken to me
like that before.

You're fired!

Well, in that case,
I'm suing you for sexual harassment.

I'll see you at home.

GRANDPA: What are you doing, lad?
CHRIS: Nothing!

GRANDPA: Something's wrong with
your shower. The water's not cold enough.

I like me showers colder
than a well digger's kerblocken.

I think it's time someone sits
his kerfluffin' down...

...and has a talk with his unemployed son.

If he needs to talk...

...he'd best go to confession
to beg forgiveness for all his failings!

Have a glorious day.

LOIS: How can you just sit there
and let him talk like that?

He's right, Lois. I am no good.

Even my own dad doesn't love me.
Face it. I'm going to Hell.

PETER: Adolf Hitler, Al Capone,
John Wilkes Booth.

<i>Hey, what are you doing here?</i>

I killed a hooker. She made a crack about
me being faster than a speeding bullet...

...so I ripped her in half
like a phone book.

STEWIE: Yes, the fat man's going to Hell.

And from the looks of his midsection,

he'll burn like a tire dump
for all eternity.

Oh! I love God!

He's so deliciously evil.

Stewie, eat your oatmeal.
Honey, you're a wonderful husband...

...a loving father, and,
for some reason I'll never understand...

...a very devoted son.

That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly,
it means nothing coming from you.

TOM: <i>The moment has arrived at last.</i>

<i>We now go live</i>
<i>to Logan International Airport...</i>

<i>...where the Pope's plane</i>
<i>has just touched down.</i>

EMCEE: <i>Hello, Boston!</i>

<i>Are you ready to humble...</i>

<i>...yourself before God?</i>

[Crowd cheering]

<i>What? Have you all taken a vow of silence?</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

[Crowd cheering]

<i>Then put your hands together for the one,</i>
<i>the only...</i>

<i>...His Holiness, the Pope!</i>

[Band playing upbeat music]

Hey, I just got a crazy idea!

Why? Why?

Hey, I just got another crazy idea!

Hey, did you ever notice this?
On page 375, it says "Jebus."

It's supposed to be "Jesus," right?

-Room service!
-We didn't order no room service.

Actually I just wanted
to check the honor bar.

The last Pope we had here
filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.

All right, wise guy, who are you?

I'm just a faithful Catholic man...

...with a family crisis
only His Holiness can resolve.

I've never asked the church for anything,
but I don't know where else to turn.

Dust him!

My heavens, son! Are you okay?

Yeah. I just got bounced
by the Pope's road crew.

It's good you missed me.
I'm to drive the Popemobile.

Any slight bump on the head
knocks me unconscious for a few hours.

I always wake up fine,
but it's just so darn inconvenient...

...to be knocked out that easily.
Even by the slightest tap. Like this.

[Crowd cheering]

Taking it off here, Boss.

-Take it off there, Luke.
-Wiping it off, Boss.

-Wipe it off, Nine.
-Waving at the Pope here, Boss.

Wave at the Pope there, Luke.

Are you sure this is Boston?

Yeah, it's Boston.
See, look, there's Harvard.

That's just a barn.

Someone went to Yale.

PETER: Lois, put the coffee on.

LOIS: Careful. I just cleaned the floor.

Good thing.

Lemony.

Your Holiness, this is such an honor.

Please, go into the living room
and make yourself at home!

What is the Pope doing here?

Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car
so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.

You kidnapped the Pope?

This is the most reckless thing
you've ever done!

Come on. What about the time
I was on that airplane?

[Giggling]

[Laughing]

POPE: Peter, you've raised a fine family.

Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up.
I was hoping you could change his mind.

He'd have to believe you.
You're God's go-to guy.

Your father is entitled to his opinion.

But more important is what you think.

Look deep in your heart, my son.

Do you think you're a screw-up?

[Sentimental instrumental music]

No. I'm not. You know what?
I'm a damn good father.

PETER: I have great kids.
MEG: That's not what Grandpa says.

Grandpa is wrong.

Meg, it's not a sin
for a girl your age to like boys.

Thanks, Daddy.

And Chris, what you do in the bathroom
is between you and God.

And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.

Thanks, Dad!

Good for you, Peter.

But isn't there someone else
you should speak to?

Yes, there is.

Scarecrow, you've had brains all along.

Same goes for your heart, Tin Man.

And Kristy McNichol,
come back to television. We miss you.

I meant you should talk to your father.

PETER: You're right. You with me, big guy?

Peter, I go where I am needed.

To the Popemobile!

[Theme from <i>Batman</i>]

[Desperate muttering]

Remember when we brought in that stripper
for Lombardi's birthday...

...and it turned out to be his son?
I think this is gonna top it.

MAN: Wow, it's the Pope!

GRANDPA: Slothful sinners! You're here
to work, not sit around with your...

Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father.

I am not worthy.

Rise, my son.

You are indeed worthy,
for you have raised a fine son.

His zest for life is an affirmation
of God's great love within us all.

Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope!

So I guess you were wrong about me, Dad.

I was wrong all right.

Stand by, boys.

I was wrong about you!

You've gone soft on me, Holy Father!

Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist
could tell this boy's no good!

Are you calling me a liar?

-Whoah, easy, Pontiff.
-Because I'll excommunicate your sorry--

Okay, time out.

Oh! I have never met
such an infuriating man!

You must have the patience of a saint.

Well, he's my dad.
And I just want him to love me.

Peter, how could you say such a thing?

I love you with all me heart.

[Sentimental music playing]

-You do?
-Of course.

I just don't like you.
I don't like anything about you!

[Music stops]

Keep playing.
I think this is as good as it gets.

Dad, to be honest,
I don't like you either.

Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say.
I guess I am going to Hell.

The good Lord said to honor thy father.

He never said anything about liking him.

Well, in that case, Dad...

...I'm gonna eat meat on Fridays,
golf on Sundays...

...laugh at Jewish comedians,
and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.

But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.

Well, fine. I'll be on me way.

Take back your job,
and give your old man a hug.

I love you, Dad.

I know you do, Son.

-What are you gonna do now?
-I don't know.

I guess the good Lord doesn't have
much use for an old man like me.

I suppose I could use
another pair of hands on my tour.

You'd give Dad a job,
even knowing what a jerk he is?

I have to. As you said, Peter,
"I am the freakin' Pope."

[Crowd cheering on TV]

GRANDPA: All right, get back!

No flash photography,
or you'll go straight to Hell! You!

You're in God's house, you heathen!

Take that cap off
before I take it off for you!

I think your father found the perfect job.

Let's hope so. I love being a good father.

But I don't want to have to be
a good son again for a long, long time.

[Knocking]

GRANDMA: Peter, open the door,
and break out the schnapps!

<i>Guess who needs a place</i>
<i>to sleep it off for the weekend?</i>

-Mom?

Quick, everyone! Into the pod!

you'll have to go to heaven.

And you know what?

I bet you run into those
two dead bailiff ladies from <i>Night Court</i>.

You won't know which one is which.

And it's going to be really awkward.
So bite me.

Can you help me with these damn studs?

Aren't you a little over-dressed?

Actually,
I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's.

There's a benefit gala
at the Boston Pops tonight, and...

...I'm trying to nail the flautist.

LOIS: Oh, Stewie! You're adorable!

Yes. I rather like the sash.
But do the Huggies make my ass look big?

Peter, come on! You've had 1,000 years
to get ready for this party.

It always takes him so long
to get dressed.

We're gonna be late
for my cousin's wedding.

Aren't you dressed yet?

Oh, crap.

One of us is gonna have to change.

Unzip me.

-Where's your father?
-He's still down in the basement.

LOIS: Peter, you've been down there
all day. I hope you're already...

Oh, my God! The government is here!
Run, ET, run!

[Screaming]

The end of the world is coming.
Get in your radiation suits.

Peter, we are not missing
a once-in-a-lifetime event...

...because of some
wacko doomsday theory.

Okay. Hey, guys.

You know that one Christmas present
you really wanted but didn't get?

MEG: A phone?
CHRIS: A pony?

PETER: A humidor?
STEWIE: A dead Lois?

It's in the basement.
Come on. Let's go see.

MEG: My own phone!
CHRIS: I'm gonna name him Sparky.

LOIS: What the hell?

Peter, if you want to stay here,
that's fine.

But we're going to the party. Kids!

-Honey, are you pregnant?
-No.

[Loud crashing]

Oh, dear me. Yes. This is how
I wanted to enter the new millennium.

Locked in a basement with imbeciles
dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.

Thanks a lot, Peter.

I could be in Boston, pretending I give
a rat's ass about Vivaldi.

And I could be getting felt up by Kevin.

Meg, don't you give it all away up front.
Make him work for it.

And shame on you, Peter.

Scaring the kids
with your nuclear-holocaust nonsense.

You said "nuclear." It's "nucular," dummy.
The "S" is silent.

CHRIS: It's almost midnight.

DIANE:<i> We now go live to Asian reporter,</i>
<i>Trisha Takanawa.</i>

<i>Trisha, what can you tell us?</i>

<i>Diane, Quahog's fabled alabaster clam...</i>

<i>...is about to descend</i>
<i>and usher in a new millennium.</i>

CROWD: 10, 9, 8...

This is it!

ALL: ...6, 5, 4...

Hold on tight!

CROWD: ...3, 2, 1. Happy New Year!

[Cheering]

A flautist, Peter!

Well, I hope you're happy.

Come on, kids.
We can still make the party if we...

[Earth rumbling]

[Whooshing]

Nice work, Lieutenant. Very festive.

Actually, each of those lights
represents a missile launching by itself.

The pattern is just a coincidence.

Now that you mention it,
the "Y" is a little misshapen.

Still, it's pretty amazing.

[Explosion]

Oh, what the hell. Come here, Hillary.

What did I miss?

PETER: Holy crap! Anybody else feel that?

PETER: Good morning, family.

Lois, you remember
when I was the third Hardy Boy?

Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.

Oh, really?
Just like there was no apocalypse?

He shoots! He scores!

[Crashing]

Okay, we were wrong about the end
of the world and you were right.

Can we please just drop it?

It's just not fair.

I finally get a date with Kevin,
and he gets vaporized!

CHRIS: He's just using that as an excuse.

[Laughs]

LOIS: Let's just be grateful we survived
the apocalypse healthy and mutation free.

CLEVELAND: I said I can do it.
QUAGMIRE: Shut up!

PETER: Hey, Clevemire.

-That's "Quagland."
-Quagland? You must be dreaming.

Not about kicking your fat ass!

Boys, please. You used to be so close.

Sorry, Lois.

<i>We're a little crabby,</i>
<i>on account of the fact that...</i>

...neither one of us has had any food
since we got fused together.

Wow. We just finished off
what was left in the kitchen.

When I think of all the food
we've wasted in this house...

Here, Tom Selleck. Come on.
Down the hatch. Come on.

None for you, Higgins!
Trying to steal Tom Selleck's food!

No. You've had yours!

Thank goodness, Peter bought a supply...

...of dehydrated meals before the blast.

Peter, what are you doing?
You just ate a year's worth of food!

What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.

[Slushy oozing]

Everyone leave. I have to poop. Now!

BRIAN: So much for finding food
at the Stop 'N Shop.

Figures. The one time
I remember my Value Club Card.

Wait a minute. I smell barbecue.

[Gasping]

So what do you think, Diane?
Can I cook, or what?

DIANE: Delicious, Tom.

I guess we should be eating her
with chopsticks.

Oh, my God!

They're eating Asian reporter,
Trisha Takanawa.

That's crazy. They're just gonna be
hungry again in an hour.

Come on, Woody.
We're gonna search for food.

Sorry, Chris. The plant can't come.

It's his best friend.

Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed.
I'll take care of Woody, son.

[Gunshot]

-What was that?
-Nothing. Let's go.

Go where? If there's no food in Quahog...

...what makes you think
there's gonna be food anywhere else?

Everyone knows there are only two things
that can survive a nuclear holocaust...

...cockroaches and Twinkees.

And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.

-Twinkees?
-Yeah. I saw a story about them on A&E.

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>And now back</i>
<i>to A&E's</i> Biography<i>, "Twinkee the Kid."</i>

It was difficult for Twink
to play with other children.

He was different.

He was definitely... He had no bones.
And he couldn't really play any sports.

Yeah. That's why we got him the lasso.

SHEILA: He'd spend hours in the backyard
playing Wonder Woman.

[Laughing]

<i>He's gonna kill me.</i>

He loved that lasso.

Not as much as the baton.

But we put a stop to the baton.

He was different enough.

If we find that Twinkee factory,
we'll have all the food we need.

Good-bye, sweet home.
Maybe someday we'll return.

Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?

I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.

There you go, Mr. Swanson.
These oughta keep the rats away.

Thanks, hon. Stay in school!

[Roaring]

Bring it on!

Look, Peter! People!

JORAD: Halt!

I am Jorad.

I and my band of highway warriors
control this territory.

-Do you have any food?
-No. That's why we're on the road.

Then you may not pass until you answer
the following question.

Name something you take on a picnic.

MEG: Blankets.
BRIAN: Potato salad.

CHRIS: Chicken.
STEWIE: A dead Lois.

Okay. We're gonna go with potato salad.

Show me "potato salad"!

[Whispering] Maybe we should go now.

PETER: Jeez! Out of gas?

Hey, Dad, look!

OLD MAN: Howdy, strangers.
You look plumb tuckered.

Like to sit a spell?

-Actually, we are tired.
-And hungry.

We got plenty of room here
and all the fresh apples you can eat.

Oh, Peter! We found a new home!

What? We're going to Natick!

For what? A Twinkee factory
that might not even exist anymore?

She's right.
Besides, this place is paradise.

-Sure is. Except for Randy Newman.
-Randy Newman?

OLD MAN: Yup. Just sits there all
night and day singing about what he sees.

[Playing piano]

"Fat man with his kids and dog

"drove in through the morning fog

<i>"Hey there, Rover, come on over"</i>

It's nice to have music while we eat.

"Red-headed lady, reaching for an apple

"Gonna take a bite, nope, nope

"She's gonna breathe on it first

"wipe it on her blouse

"She takes a bite, chews it once

"twice, three times, four times, stops

"The wife is thinking,
takes a long, hard look at Randy

"Five times,
fat old husband's walking over"

LOIS: Let's get the hell out of here.

"Yeah, they're walking down the road

"Left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot, left..."

CHRIS: [Singing]
"Left foot, right foot, left foot"

Please, Chris.
Mommy's got a big headache. Stop it!

Thank you, sweetie.
Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food.

Oh, my God! Look!

It's Natick.

[Cheering]

There's no factory?

Very good, fat man!

We follow the Pied Piper of Hamsteak...

...to the gates of oblivion,
and look what it's brought us!

We're finished! We're done!
Game over, man! Game over!

STEWIE: Damn it!
LOIS: Get out of that nuclear waste!

Who knows what animals
have been in there?

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Cheering]

STEWIE: It's about damn time!

No words... Should have sent a poet.

There's enough food to last us forever!

Peter, we're saved! You were right.

We can settle down here and build
a house, just like we had in Quahog.

We can build a mall,
so I'll have a place to hang out!

And two Denny's, so we can always say:

"Let's not go there.
Let's go to the good one."

We can have Quagland
get Joe out of the driveway.

And we can build a community,
just like the one we had.

No! We'll build a better one.

I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog!

[Energy pulsating]

This isn't very good, now, is it?

[Cheerful instrumental music]

[Quagmire screaming]

-Guess who?
-Stop it, Chris.

Wrong! Wait. Did you say "Chris"?

Stewie, time for breakfast!

Did you wash your tentacles,
my big handsome boy?

What the devil are you talking about?

Handsome? I'm repugnant!
I'm a radio-bloody-active freak!

I fold. Come on, let's go home
and get tender with your wife.

I don't know, Quagmire.

Lovemaking with Loretta
has somehow lost its intimacy.

All right!

BRIAN: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

An outsider
who wishes to join our community.

Welcome to my fair city!

If you want to become a citizen,
you have to get a job.

Before the disaster, I was a physician.

That's terrific. We need a doctor.

We sure do. Let's hope you get it.
Now pick a job out of the hat.

"Village idiot." That's a good one.

On Tuesdays,
you get to wave your penis at traffic.

Congratulations.

JOE: Maybe we should've
just let him be a doctor.

No! These are the rules of New Quahog.

Besides,
that's how everyone else got their jobs.

Go!

[Frantic screaming]

You see, Doc, my back tooth is killing me.

[Screaming]

And things have worked out fine so far.

Peter, no offense,
but that's because we all pitched in.

That's right.
We built schools, and hospitals.

Yeah, not to mention the theater.

"But when I saw the movie,
it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only...

"...didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's,
she hadn't eaten anything in a year.

[Hooting]

"I am such a bitch!"

We have everything we need.
And no crime, no guns, no pollution.

Brian's right.

We've left ourselves defenseless.
Guys, we need to make some guns.

Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.

When that trouble happens,

we'll be ready
to blow its freakin' head off!

Besides, without guns...

...how would our forefathers
settle their differences?

8, 9,10, and turn!

Honey, Mommy's making you
some new feetie pajamas.

And look, it has a little trap door
for when you gotta make inky.

I'll show you inky!

-Let's see if they fit.
-Never!

[Mocking laughter]

Look at me! I'm Fred Astaire!

Gotcha. You are getting heavy.

I'll have your dad flood the basement...

...so you can get some more exercise.

Yes. I do seem to have gained
a bit of girth.

Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling.

[Grunting]

There we are.

I say. I've laid an egg!
That wasn't so bad.

I don't know what these women
are always complaining about...

PETER: Attention, New Quahogians.
Today my vision for our future comes true.

A chicken in every pot,
and a cap in every ass!

Peter, put that away! Where did you get
the metal for all those guns?

Recycling. I used the pipes
from our irrigation system.

WOMAN: Are you crazy?
You destroyed our water pipes?

MAN: We don't need guns!
We need food and water!

I have a canker sore on my lip!

And I keep poking at it with my tongue!
But that's only making it worse!

PETER: There's a reason
I'm in charge here, okay?

I knew the world was gonna end.

I'm the one who found the Twinkee factory
and started this town.

I'm the one who gave
elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.

That's nothing to be proud of!

[Imitating Rosie Perez] Don't be stupid!
She speak good and everything!

CROWD: Let's get him! Throw him out!

LOIS: Wait! We can work this out!

I haven't been thrown out of any place...

...since I was a counselor
at the bulimia clinic.

Man, did anybody else throw up
after eating that fish last night?

[Dramatic instrumental music]

That's the last of them!

Good riddance! What the hell
would we ever need guns for?

STEWIES: Victory is ours.

[Citizens screaming]

MAN: Quick! Grab the guns!
They're our only hope!

Bob, you remember the other day,
you asked me...

...what the definition of irony was,
and I said...

[Screaming]

[Explosions]

Honey, I'm sorry I got us
kicked out of New Quahog.

I guess nobody really needs guns.

I'm not always right, after all.

Oh, Peter.

Hearing you say that almost makes it
worth having the world blown up.

Where are we gonna go?

I hear there's a Carvel factory
in Framingham.

All right! Fudgie the Whale!

And Cookie Puss! And Cookie O'Puss!
And Nutty the Chocolate Ghost!

LOIS: Come on, everybody.
Let's sing a song.

CHRIS: "Left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot"

PAM: Bobby!
BOBBY: Good morning.

Oh, Bobby. I just had the weirdest dream.

I dreamt I saw the strangest episode
of <i>Family Guy</i>.

And there was a giant chicken!
And Stewie was an octopus.

Hey, hey. Come on now.

It's all right.
Everything's gonna be okay.

What's <i>Family Guy</i>?

[Theme music]

[Children's television theme music]

Hello, neighbor.

I'm glad we're together again.

[Bell rings]

I think I hear our friend Trolley.

-Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie.
-What the--

I wouldn't bother visiting
the neighborhood of make-believe.

-I dare say, you'll find it quite in ruin.
-What?

Meow, meow, meow, skin graft.
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

MR. ROGERS: My God!
STEWIE: That's right, all dead.

And now, Mr. Rogers, Fred.

May as well drop the formalities.
I'm going to kill you.

No, please.

Don't!

How ironic. "Rogers."

It almost rhymes with:

"Eliminate."

No!

What? What the devil?

It's okay, Stewie.
You were just talking in your sleep.

MR. ROGERS: But now it's time for you
to meet Mr. Death.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"He's a family guy"

CHRIS: So what are you wearing?

Wow!
I bet you could see right through that.

-Chris, who are you talking to?
-Grandma.

-Oh, no!
-What is it?

It looks like Stewie had an accident
on the carpet.

Lois, again?

That baby just does not want to keep
his diaper on.

Here you are!

What the hell is this?

Sweetie, that's tuna salad.

Is that what it is? Really?

Because I could have sworn
it was mayonnaise and cat food!

Here's 50 cents.
Do me a favor, sweetheart.

The next time you're shopping,
splurge on...

...a tin of solid white albacore?

Stewie, are you upset because
you went wee-wee on the carpet?

What did you just say?

Hey, Lois...

-Hey, did you pee in here?
-In a moment!

What did you just say?

Peter, we have a serious problem
we need to discuss.

Jeez. This isn't another one
of those interventions, is it?

Peter, you've been wearing that giant
foam cowboy hat for eight months now.

Please, for your family, take it off.

Hey, I can take this hat off
anytime I want.

I just don't want to.

Get away!

No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.

-Do I hit him?
-No!

-Bend down, Mother.
-Yes, honey?

How dare you sully my good name
by spreading your slanderous filth!

Stewie, no hitting! Use your words.

He's probably just ashamed, Lois.

You're just a helpless little
carpet tinkler, aren't you?

Well!

The outrages I have suffered today
will not be soon forgotten!

I will not be forgetting...

...those outrages! No!

No, they won't be forgotten!

-Not the--
-"Outrages," yeah. I think we got it.

Maybe it's time for Stewie
to start potty training.

Isn't he a little young for that?

You know what happened to
the Lindbergh baby.

Charles, he's only 6 months old.

Honey, would you relax?
I flew across the Atlantic by myself.

I'm a national treasure, for God's sake.
I think I know how to...

God!

All right.

He was kidnapped.

You call the police.
I'll write the ransom note.

What about Amelia? She saw everything?

You leave her to me.

Come on, honey.
He's been having accidents.

Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.

This could be a nice way for you
and Stewie to bond.

Bond?

James Bond.

All right, Lois. I'll do it!

God. Not again, Brian.
Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet?

Damn it! It's not coming out.

LOIS: Brian, is that you?
BRIAN: Yeah. It's me.

LOIS: Is everything okay?

Yeah. I couldn't sleep.
I'll be up in a minute.

LOIS: Okay.

-Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again!
-No!

This has gotta stop.

God! It smells gross.

Princess, I don't see anyone
dabbing yours behind their ears.

That's odd. It looks like someone tried
to clean it up.

No, it doesn't.

Mine smells like soda.

Yeah, I'm looking
for toilet-training books.

Yes. We can help you there.

<i>Everybody Poops</i> is still the standard,
of course.

We've also got the less popular

LOIS: Brian, what are you doing?

Hi, Lois.

I was just washing some things.

Those look like our sheets and our quilt.

They are.

I'm washing them in fabric softener,

because they were so itchy
I couldn't sleep.

Which is why I was downstairs when
you asked me if everything was okay.

You know, because it was so itchy.

Come on, Stewie.

Don't you want to pee
in a toilet bowl like a big boy?

I remember when I learned to use a potty
all by myself.

I was so proud.

Hey, Lois! I did it!

Well, perhaps I could give it
the old college try.

Why don't you put your hands right there?

-It'll help me relax.
-Okay, buddy.

Maybe you don't have to pee.

I oughta give you beer.
It goes right through you.

Wonderful, and while we're at it,
we could light up a doobie and watch porn.

Yeah?

Listen, you, I'll use these facilities
when I'm damn well ready.

Until then, you shall continue
to sanitize my crevasse...

...and be damn grateful
for the opportunity!

Starting right...

Well...

...not now.

But soon!

And I want these, and these, and these.

Only one.

But that man over there got two!

Peter, I don't care what the other men
are getting. You're only getting one.

I hate you!

Hey, what's that sound?

You're urinating!

So, it's been you all along!

This is too perfect!
I've been taking the blame for Rex.

It's everywhere!

It's okay. Meg, hand me my sweater.

Brian, where do you think you are?
Payless?

I say, Paco, grab a mop.

Could somebody get Patches
out of here before...

...he decides to bend a fresh biscuit
on the conveyor belt?

It's okay.
We'll meet you in the parking lot.

God, Lois. I need help.

Look, I really don't even know
why I'm here.

The urologist said I was fine.

Well, sometimes these things
can be psychological.

Doubt that!
I mean, I've got a very comfortable life.

I live with a great family.
All my needs are met.

Okay, look.

So, maybe this isn't where I thought
I'd be at 7 years old.

It's just that I...

Is it okay if I smoke in here?

Thanks.

It's just that things don't always
work out the way we plan.

Do you know I've never been to Europe?

Now look at me.

Middle-aged, alone,
and peeing in supermarkets.

Man, didn't see that coming.

I had this dream last night.

We've got a runner in Sector G.

What about him? He's gotta be in his 50s.

So what do you think?

I think you're very sensitive,
and you put up a tough front.

I think you're in pain.

Damn it, Brian, do not cry.

I'd like to pet you, Brian.

Would that be okay?

You're a good dog, Brian.

-A very good--
-Keep it above the waist, Doc.

TOM: <i>And now part two</i>
<i>of our</i><i>very own Asian correspondent...</i>

<i>...Trisha Takanawa's special</i>
<i>report on sex.</i>

<i>Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom</i>
<i>of</i><i>Judy and Glen Isaacs.</i>

<i>Ten years married and still in love.</i>

<i>What's their secret?</i>

<i>Judy has an inoperable brain tumor</i>
<i>the size of my fist.</i>

<i>And that just happens to be Glen's fetish.</i>

Brian, how'd it go?

Well, Lois, I think I have little bit
of "me work" to do.

But I'm feeling things,
and that's a start.

That's wonderful.

You know, like most other people,
I used to think therapy was...

...only for crazies and nut jobs.
Isn't that silly?

Hey, Lois, I...

Hey, Brian.

How you doing?

They let you out already?

I was in a therapy session,
not a lunatic asylum.

Hey, calm down.

Lots of crazy people have gone on
to lead normal, successful lives.

What did your therapist say?

Dr. Kaplan thinks the...

...accidents are linked
to some kind of mid-life crisis.

He suggests I go out into the world
and pursue my dreams.

I'm leaving tomorrow.

Whoops. Whoa. Hang on.
I gave you one with silverware in it.

Take this one instead.

That one's probably fine.

Beautiful.

My God! Are you Stephen King?

No. I'm Dean Koontz.

[Engine starts]

[Gurgling]

But, you know, thanks to these sessions,
I think I'm okay.

Being out in the world,
feeling my power, and no accidents!

-I've been dry for two weeks now.
-<i>Mazel tov</i>.

Well, good-bye, Dr. Kaplan.

And thank you.

I know Stacy isn't your mother...

...but upside-down face or not,
you have to respect her.

Hey, you're Tom Tucker...

Hey!

God. That was rude. I apologize.

Wow.

[Urinating]

"I'm a little teapot short and stout

"Here is my handle, here is my spout

"When I get all steamed up, hear me shout"

Lois, it looks as if
Puddles has done it again!

Goodness, he's wet everything.

[Fake laughter]

I swear, I don't even remember doing it.
I don't understand this.

Now, Brian,
we know you're not doing this on purpose.

But maybe we should consider...

-...crating.
-God.

Or you could be an outside dog.

Would you like that?

Outside?

And how embarrassed was I
when the word "crate" came up?

I thought I was past this.

I traveled the world, for God's sake.
Do you know how much I spent?

Well, obviously we haven't hit
the real issue yet. Drop it.

Tell me, Brian,
the last accident you remember...

...did anything unusual happen
that might've triggered it?

No. It was a normal day.

Catwoman.

Peter, no "Catwoman" today. I'm tired.

What's the matter?

Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of
a little Catwoman melting spray?

Peter, no.

All right. Okay. Enough, Batman.
I don't want...

Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?

LOIS: Peter!

Take that.

I spit water on you.

LOIS: Peter!

Batman, I can't breathe! Peter!

I'm using my special cat power
to get Batman all wet.

PETER: Hey, knock it off.

[Lois meowing]

You know, just the usual stuff.

Wait a minute. All that running water.
That's gotta be it!

Brian, tell me about Lois.

Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman.

She's compassionate
and charming, attractive.

Well, stunning, really.

I guess you could say I really--

Love her?

No, of course not!

Me and Lois? That's sick!

Come on. She's my best friend's wife.

Look, I love Lois,
but I'm not in love with her.

Who are you trying to convince, Brian?
Me or you?

Brian, what a mess.

Don't get antsy.
I got three minutes left.

What the hell, Brian? You cured yet?

I don't want to have to live in a house
with plastic on the furniture.

My therapist has figured out my problem.

Yeah?
What does Sigmund "Fraud" think it is?

He thinks I'm in love.

Oh, my God!

You can talk!

Never mind.

-Well, does this girl love you back?
-I can't imagine.

You gotta find out for sure.

You don't want to spend your life
wondering what could have been.

MAN: Sir, I need a decision.

Salad.

No, wait! Soup!

<i>But it was too late.</i>

And to this day,
I still lay awake at night...

...wondering about the soup that got away.

Thanks, Peter.

I'm gonna go find out how she feels.

-I've taken you for granted.
-Get a room!

Hey, you. The news is on.

Where is everybody?

Stewie's taking a nap,
and Peter and the kids are out.

Come sit with me.

Okay.

DIANE: <i>And now part three</i>

It is so refreshing to see something
other than violence on the news.

Brian, your tail keeps hitting me.

If it's bothering you, I can stop.

It's okay. The breeze feels good.

It's so warm in here.

That's better.

I'd take my sweater off,
but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin.

Smooth.

I'd better go start dinner.

STEWIE: Well, well, well!

How long have you been there?

I came along about the time
you started pummeling her with your tail.

-You shut up!
-You love her!

This is so good,
it just has to be fattening.

I said, shut up!

STEWIE: By the way, nice rap.

"I'd take my sweater off,
but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin."

Imbecile!

Ben, Brittany, and Amber said,
"Let's go to the mall."

And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the mall."

Then Amber wasn't gonna go,
so I went to the mall.

And you're not gonna believe it.
They both showed up!

Hold on. Meg, I'm sorry.
That is a really boring story.

I haven't been this bored
since that stupid drive-in movie.

This sucks.

Lois, this pasta, better than Italy.

It's just my Noodle Caboodle.

I did use a different brand
of potato chips for the crust.

Your culinary prowess is surpassed
only by your unfailing grace...

...and the uncommon, sometimes haunting
glow of sensuality that surrounds you.

LOIS: It's just Noodle Caboodle.

-Hey, what are these hard things?
-M&Ms. I ran out of paprika.

[Blows kiss]

-Magnificent.
-Up.

Stewie wants to go uppie!

You want me to pick you up, sweetie?

Momma's skin's so soft.

My goodness, you're affectionate tonight.

Well, let me give my big boy a kiss.

Another! Yes! Momma has candy kisses!

All right! That's enough!

I mean, will you all excuse me, please?

Stewie, did you unhook mommy's bra?

-Hi.
-Well, hello, Brian.

I think we should talk.

Sure.

Lois...

...did your heart ever want
to ask something, but...

...your head was too afraid
of what the answer might be?

God.

Sometimes...

...it's best not to ask those questions.

Sometimes...

...we should cherish what we already have.

Like a very special friendship...

...let's say like the one
you and I share...

...that someone like me wouldn't change
for anything in the world.

Someone like me wouldn't change it
for anything in the world either.

I'm glad.

Just to be clear, we were talking about
me being in love with you...

-...and you rejecting me, right?
-Yes.

I was just making sure.

Say we were both drunk,
and we knew we wouldn't remember?

I'd have to be really... No!

I tell you, Peter,
I wish I'd taken this up years ago.

You know, my great, great, great uncle,
Angus Griffin invented the game.

So we're all clear on the rules then?

No Jews and no blacks.

Aye!

You're like the Arnold Palmer of golf.

Yeah, life is good.

I'm 7 years old,
and if I play my cards right...

...I've got another seven ahead of me.

Hey, what ever happened
to your lady friend?

We decided to stay good friends.

I found out that there are
different kinds of love, and...

...ours was perfect the way it was.

So she dumped you, huh?
The hell with her!

She'll probably end up with some idiot.
Serves her right.

Damn.

Mulligan.

Damn.

[Theme music]
S02E05.en
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons.

A stunning development tonight
as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent.

We have the identity of the real killer.
But first...

It's fall. The time of year when the
leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange...

...and Quahog prepares
for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.

Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa
joins us live...

...from the ceremony where
they are choosing this year's theme.

Diane, behind me
are 1,000 beautiful doves.

Gently tied to each of their delicate legs
is a parade theme...

...suggested by
ordinary citizens of Quahog.

And here to pick
this year's winning theme...

...is <i>Ten Commandments</i> star,
Charlton Heston.

Let my pigeons go!

[Wings flapping]

[Gun loading]

He nailed one! We have our theme!

I submitted "togetherness."
A simple theme.

But powerful, nonetheless.

Come on, "overcoming adversity"!
Let's go, "overcoming adversity"!

Show me "women I gave the clap to"!

And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is:

"The episode of <i>Who's the Boss?</i>...

"...where Tony sees Angela
naked in the shower."

Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable!

[Cheering]

Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley
must be turning over in his grave.

Wait a minute. He's not dead yet.

"Michael Flatley."

It's great they picked your theme,
but isn't it a little esoteric?

Esoteric?

-Could it mean "sexy"?
-I think it's a science term.

Fellas, esoteric means "delicious."

<i>Who's the Boss?</i> is not a food.

BRIAN: Swing and a miss.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

I have no friends,
and it's all because of this stupid purse!

What did you do to my daughter?
I swear to God, if you touched her...

Honey, what happened?

It was lunchtime and...

I love the color of your Prada bag.

-Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
-Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch?

You know what? There's no room
in my car for your big, ugly purse.

[Girls laughing]

Meg, let me tell you about popularity.

GIRL #1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
CANNER: Bye!

Daddy, if you really loved me,
you'd buy me a Prada bag.

I can't say no to you, honey.
What are they, like, $10?

More like $1,100.

[Laughing]

You wish I loved you that much!

[Sighs]

We'll never finish the float
in time for the parade.

Pick up the pace, guys!

Peter, your theme is a dud.

Yeah. I've never even seen
<i>Who's the Boss?</i>

Tuesdays in the '80s I was always
in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.

But I can't do it without you guys,
because I'll tell you who's the boss.

It's not Tony or Angela.

It's not even man-crazy Mona.
It's all of us.

You're the boss because you never
give up, like with the ladies.

Gemini.

Capricorn.

I know you're not a Virgo!

<i>From down here, you look like a Pisces!</i>

And Cleveland, you're the boss
because of your attention to detail.

Like when we play pool,
you take so long to line up your shots...

...I just want to crack you
with a cue stick.

But I don't because that would be
a hate crime, and I love you.

<i>And Joe, I've had new neighbors before,</i>
<i>but none were half the man you are.</i>

Since you're half a man already,
that splits them...

...into some kind of fraction
I can't even measure.

He's right. If we work together,
we can win this thing. Who's in?

Go, Spooner Street!

[Heroic instrumental music]

My dad always says,
"Measure twice, cut once."

My daddy always said,
"Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!"

[Laughing]

We didn't measure!

BRIAN: Amazing. The whole
neighborhood is working together.

You know what's really amazing?

I haven't brushed my teeth in three days,
and no one has said a thing.

If I had a job,
I could buy the bag myself.

I have squandered my munitions budget
on that insipid <i>Rugrats</i> video!

Perhaps I should seek employment.

Mother teaches piano.
I suppose I could as well.

All right, try it again, Richard.

And remember,
the wrong keys are electrified.

[Electric shock]

I don't want to play the piano!

Indeed.
Would you rather play the bassoon?

[Playing bassoon]

[Screams]

No experience? No, thanks.

[Sighs]

[Whispering]

Oh, nuts. Young lady.

What's the little guy's name?

What do you care?

I can't send an unwed teenage mother
out on the street without a job.

Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.

DIANE: Welcome to the 83rd annual
Quahog Harvest Festival Parade.

Are you as excited as I am, Tom?

Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...

...and clipped onto it
is a list of this year's float entries.

Remember, the float that best captures
this year's theme...

...wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.

And here's our first float.

DIANE: It looks like some wires
got crossed on Clover Street.

<i>That's not Angela.</i>
<i>That's Mona, Angela's mom.</i>

TOM: Wonderful use of tree bark
for the age spots though.

<i>This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan.</i>
<i>That's just plain wrong.</i>

Each float possesses its own
unique charm. But none of them--

Oh, baby! Look at that!

The float turned out great.

Our neighborhood hasn't been this united
since Quagmire got us free cable.

CLEVELAND: We are not bad people.

We just don't want to pay $12 a month
for Cinemax.

First place goes to Spooner Street.

[Cheering]

RESIDENTS: We won! All right!

[Uncomfortable laughter]

Come on now! This is damn foolish!

My theme, my trophy!

My aunt Fanny!
You said it yourself! I'm the boss!

He said I, too, was the boss.
And it's time Cleveland got his due.

BONNIE: Joe, my feet are
starting to swell.

You two go home.
I can stay here as long as it takes.

You'd be amazed how little one eats
when your legs don't work.

There's only one way to settle this.

Russian Roulette.

Three bullets, last guy standing
keeps the trophy. Me first.

No. Wait a minute, this is crazy.

You first.

There's gotta be a way for you all
to enjoy the trophy.

Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it.
There it is again!

LOIS: Perfect, Peter.
Now we can all enjoy it.

[Muttering approval]

Here's to togetherness!

Car!

[Car approaching]

Meg, order up!

Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.

I don't care if they're
from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!

Try them. You'll like them.

Yes, well, I rather doubt that.

Yes! These are delectable.

Flappy, good news!
I've decided not to kill you!

What a precious little boy.

That's my son.

Your son? But you're just a baby yourself.

Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.

$20!

Welcome to Flappy's.

Why don't you sit next to my baby...

...whose deadbeat dad
doesn't pay child support.

[Belching]

[Horrified scream]

[Dramatic instrumental music]

Peter, what is it?

CLEVELAND: What's going on out here?

Clear the way! I'm a cop!

Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on.
I'm so sorry.

That's okay, son.
It's your right as an American citizen.

[Screaming]

QUAGMIRE: What's all the noise?
I was just jerked out of a sound sleep.

Perhaps someone could enlighten me as
to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?

-Maybe it fell.
-Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.

You think one of us stole it?

I never said the word "stole." Looks like
someone has a guilty conscience.

Guilty conscience!

I'm the only guy on this block
who actually pays for his cable.

Pretty high and mighty for a man who
left our nation's flag out in the rain...

...last Fourth of July.
That's against the law, Officer!

[Gasping]

You're one to talk.

Out there every trash day
picking through my garbage.

That's an invasion of my privacy.

[Gasping]

He's sorting your recycling
because he loves our Mother Earth.

If you weren't so busy
trolling for booty all the time...

...you could do it yourself,
like the law says you should.

[Gasping]

PETER: It's on now!

JOE: Wait a second! What about Peter?

He's the one
who wanted the trophy all along!

I couldn't have stolen it.

Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder
so I could steal the trophy tonight.

What? It's a ladder. He can't use it.
It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.

Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe.
Real oddballs.

I don't trust them.

LOIS: I saw them taking coupons
out of our mailbox.

QUAGMIRE: I don't like the look of her!

I offer you a recipe.

Combine one small-town neighborhood
with a dash of missing trophy...

...and what you're left with is a gumbo
fit only for a madman.

A gumbo served almost exclusively in <i>The</i>--

PETER: Who the hell is that?
I bet he took it!

JOE: Where are you going, Serling?
Want some of this?

QUAGMIRE: Come back here!

I'm off to work.

PETER: Okay, honey.

One of our neighbors took that trophy,
and I'll find out who.

-I'm taking Stewie with me again.
-Fine, sweetie.

This whole thing just makes me sick!

-We played Pictionary with them!
-Bastards!

Giddy-up, you stubby little mare!
To the pancake house!

Well, bye.

And to think
they used to be our best friends!

That was then and this is now!

And this is a chair. That's a lamp.
You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!

JOE: To be honest, Peter, we were all
a little surprised you invited us over.

We realized our friendship is a lot
more important than some stupid trophy.

[Kettle whistling]

There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois.
Two sugars, right, Bonnie?

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Damn, it's not here!

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Not here either.

[Footsteps]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

['60s lounge music on stereo]

Nothing.

Oh, my God! We were robbed!

-Is anything missing?
-No. I don't think so.

LOIS: Where's that picture of me
in my two-piece?

Should I call the cops?

I'm guessing a cop
had something to do with this.

Or a pilot. Or a deli owner.

Okay, you dirtbags!

This means war!

Excuse us. We're having a small problem
with home security.

Do you have those round metal things
that you bury in the ground...

...and, when stepped on, they explode?

-Land mines?
-Land mines.

It was land mines.

-Quagmire.
-Peter.

-Cleveland.
-Joe.

-Bonnie.
-Lois.

-Cleveland.
-Lois.

Bonnie.

-Quagmire.
-Peter.

[Clears throat]

Loretta.

Come on, Peter.

That ought to slow them down.

Being a single mother is hard.

The real challenge is having a baby
that's addicted to crack.

-Right, Stewie?
-What's that? Yes. I love crack.

I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!

This is the first time
he's eaten something

other than dog food in three weeks.

Here's your check. God bless.

WAITRESS: Here, Honey.
STEWIE: What's this? Blueberries?

Oh, my...

That's better than sex!

And could I get that waitress' address?
I'd like to help her baby.

What are they up to?

Cleveland and Quagmire
are holding their positions...

...but I haven't seen Joe all day.

JOE: Freeze!
KEVIN: Dad?

JOE: Careful. There's a bear trap
two feet to your right.

KEVIN: Thanks, Dad.
JOE: Look out for your mother!

BONNIE: There's a sandwich
on the counter, honey.

Cleveland, these lobster traps
aren't going to catch any intruders.

Yes, they will.

I baited them with these plump
and tasty Fenway franks.

Daddy, we got one!

Fat boy smelled a hot dog.
Couldn't help it. Went right in.

[Laughing]

[Classical instrumental music]

-Hello.
-Say, get the hell off...

Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.

Yes. I was hoping I could ask you
about your neighbors, the Griffins.

A bunch of card-carrying Commies
if you ask me!

All right.

No! It's not all right!

CLEVELAND JR.: Fat boy!

The Griffins are not to be trusted.

Those people are nothing
but vile, cheating, lying scum.

And their carpet and drape scheme...

No! No, I won't!

Get that puree of loathsomeness
away from me!

But you love mashed turkey and peas.

I'm sorry. What was that?

Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
Did you just tell me what I love?

Write this down, you toad-faced frump.
I love pancakes!

Hi, little fella.

SANDY: Is Meg Griffin here?
LOIS: No, she's not.

Probably out scoring more rock.

Sandy Balfour, Child Services.
We're placing this baby in a foster home.

-What?
-For God's sake, feed me!

Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow?

What an awful home for a child!

How dare you! This is a wonderful home!

[Gunshot]

PETER: Quagmire, you rat bastard!

<i>Come near my fence again,</i>
<i>and that'll be your head!</i>

QUAGMIRE: Shut up!

Honey, would you like some pancakes?

Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!

Stewie!

MEG: Next up is Meg Griffin,
sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...

A woman from Child Services
came and took Stewie!

She said we fed him dog food!

Dog food?

Is that a real Prada bag?

How in the world did you make $1,100
as a waitress in one week?

It's easy...

...when you're the unwed teenage mother
of a crack-addicted baby.

[Laughing nervously]

Wait a minute.
Meg, when did you become a teenager?

She's 16, Peter.

You knew about this?

FOSTER MOM:
Welcome to your new home.

Baby Stewie, say hello
to your new brothers and sisters.

<i>Hola</i>, Stewie.

<i>Ni hao</i>, Stewie.

Stewie.

Good God!
I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!

-I promise, it'll never happen again.
-I hope not, Mrs. Stevens.

Because next time we won't
just take him away, we'll kill him.

Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!

So this is where babies come from?

Yes, Chris.
This is where babies come from.

You told me I came out of your vagina!

Next!

Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.

-I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.
-Look harder! I want my baby back!

Please, let me handle this.
The name's Griffin.

We're the ones who fed dog food
to our crack-addicted baby.

I never was any good
at dealing with the authorities.

[Police siren]

Don't worry. I know how to handle this.

Are you aware you were going 50 in...

I'm gonna have to ask you
to put your shirt down.

Crap. I get the one straight cop
in Rhode Island.

[Stewie screams angrily]

STEWIE: Damn it! I want pancakes!

You people understand every language
except English!

<i>Yo quiero</i> pancakes!

<i>Donnez-moi</i> pancakes!
Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!

Poor little guy.

"Pancakes" must be street for "crack."

Damn those parents of his.

Sarah, forgiveness.

Now, Stewie,
why don't you go play with the others?

GIRL: Stewie, come complete our rainbow!

I've got a better idea.

Let's go play
"swallow the stuff under the sink."

You lied to them!

You told Child Services that we steal
lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes...

...and worship some guy named Stan.

Actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.

We didn't know who she was!
It's not our fault!

No? Then whose fault is it?

BRIAN: It's all of yours!

You were all working together just fine,
but then you won that stupid trophy.

You put some shiny hunk of metal
before your own friendships.

Brian's right.

We were so obsessed with that trophy,
we lost sight of what was really going on.

-Now we have a real problem to deal with.
-That's right!

Somebody tipped off the cable company
about our free Cinemax.

Joe?

And we have to get Stewie back!

PETER: I remembered.
CLEVELAND: We're here to help.

And we must get our baby back.

Right on! Let's do it!

Rock their world!

GROUP: Yeah! Come on!

<i>Let's go! We can do it!</i>

See kids? One day the world
is going to be just like our home.

All races living together
in harmony and love.

[Creaking]

Pancakes!

He must still be working the junk
out of his system.

He needs hugs!

[Doorbell ringing]

Doorbell!

We're from the One World,
One People Book-of-the-Month Club.

Is there something missing in your life?

You know, I just bet there is.

Sarah, we have guests!
And one of them is a homosexual!

BONNIE: They're in place!

<i>God, it gets me hot</i>
<i>when Joe lies to strangers.</i>

When I get him home,
I swear I'm gonna grease up--

That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.

Here we go, Dad!

Stewie, would you like
to learn how to wrap a turban?

Why don't you teach it
to the Chinese girl?

Or perhaps she can learn
after her people invade your country.

Yee, would your people really do this?

Try and stop them.

And try and stop Pablo's people
from using drug money to buy arms...

...from Li's countrymen,
who in turn sells them to Ura's people...

...so they can ethnically cleanse
this nauseatingly diverse...

...grab bag of genetic party favors
you call a family.

So now you all understand, yes?
You all hate each other?

[Crying]

Hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.

Hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus.

Just practicing for Christmas.

But you're white.

Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.

Don't be stupid! Santa is black!

Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.

CHINESE GIRL: Cram it, Gandhi!
Santa is Asian.

How can he be Asian?

Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles
under the speed limit with his blinker on!

Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!

[Yelling]

PETER: Come on, Stewie.
We're out of here.

Dance, puppets! Dance!

Lois, we got him. It's all over.

LOIS: <i>Careful, Peter.</i>

<i>Joe and Cleveland can't stall them.</i>
<i>They're heading your way!</i>

Crap!

FOSTER DAD: Hold it right there!

Or what?

Don't shoot!

STEWIE: Now shoot!

So, we're terribly sorry
we broke into your home.

But we just had to
get Stewie back somehow.

That's a very long story.

But we've grown attached to little Stewie.
Plus, the law's on our side.

You people can kiss
the fattest part of my ass!

We'll be back, Stewie.

FOSTER MOM: Wait!

Is that a real Prada bag?

I'd like to propose a toast
to our neighbors.

Sure they may be black, handicapped,
and a heartless sex hound...

...but if they moved out,
some smelly Hawaiians might move in.

-Hear, hear!
-Where's Quagmire?

If it wasn't for him,
we never would have found out...

...where Stewie's foster family lived.

He said he'd distract the social worker.

Glen, honey, I have a question for you.
What do you do for a living?

I have a question for you, too.
Why are you still here?

What the heck happened
to that trophy anyway?

I guess some mysteries
are better left unsolved.

[Chattering]

Submitted for your approval.

A family pet with the uncontrollable urge
to bury shiny objects in the yard.

A shameful secret that nearly buried the

peace and civility
of an entire neighbor...

Stewie seems a little feverish
after his ordeal.

And he keeps asking for pancakes.

Let's just let him rest.

Flappy, what have you done to me?

It's so hot.

Now I'm freezing!

What I wouldn't do
for one syrup-soaked bite.

[Screams]

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"He's a family guy"

<i>-I'm Morley Safer.</i>
<i>-I'm Mike Wallace.</i>

<i>-I'm Ed Bradley.</i>
<i>-I'm Lesley Stahl.</i>

<i>And one of you is hung like an elf.</i>

[Laughing]

LOIS: I feel so naughty.
PETER: Lois, what are you doing?

Neither of us is drunk.

[Giggling]

PETER: Knock it off!

LOIS: Oh, my God! I found a lump!
A breast lump!

The important thing is to stay calm.
It's probably nothing, honey.

That's easy for you to say.
You get to keep both your cans.

Peter, don't talk like that!
You'll see a doctor tomorrow and--

No. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois.

The healthiest thing we can do is just
ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist.

Just like we do with the squid.

LOIS: Earthquake.
PETER: Truck going by.

PETER: I'm gonna be fine.
Nothing to worry about.

[Cat hisses]

[Vulture screeches]

MAN: Morning.

Give it to me straight, Doc.
How long do I have?

Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have
about a month to live.

But what the hell do I know?

I've been sued by every patient
I ever had.

Look at the size of this file.

This is... Wow.

Let's just wait for the test results.

Finish up, honey.
Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.

No! I shall put you down
for a nap, Mother!

Blast!

I'm so worried about your father.

You mean because
he's a borderline alcoholic?

No. Mommy's made peace with that.

Because he's got a lump on his booby.

Chris, that's a terrible word, "booby."

Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump
on his breast, and he turned out okay.

Really? Who's Debbie Miller?

A girl I just made up.

Look. Here they are. My family.

<i>Guys, I don't say this often enough,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna die.</i>

LOIS: Oh, my God.
STEWIE: High five! Anyone?

Anyone?

You can't die! Who's gonna take me
to the Father-Son dance?

Listen, I've had a good life.

You can always be proud of your father
and all of his accomplishments.

MEG: Accomplishments?
PETER: Go to your room.

Peter, there's no way you could die.

You're the most important character
in this family.

[Somber music playing]

I'll take this one.
But I won't pay a cent over $60.

Sir, that casket costs $1,000.

PETER: Okay, $70.
SALESMAN: What?

PETER: $2,000.
SALESMAN: That's twice the cost!

PETER: $40.
SALESMAN: What?

He doesn't know how to haggle.

Peter, what's going on?

I'm selling all my worldly goods,
so you'll have some cash when I'm dead.

Yeah, a lot of memories here.
Look, my first bike.

Boy, I had so much fun playing with that.

More tea, Mr. Bike?

Peter, this is ridiculous.
You're going to be fine.

Dad, the doctor called.
Your test results are in.

This doesn't look very good.
No, this doesn't look very good at all.

My nephew drew my portrait.
It doesn't look a thing like me.

Look at the nose. It's all--

Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?

Okay. Mr. Griffin,
all your tests came back negative.

As it turns out, the lump on your chest
was just a fatty corpuscle.

Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute.
How the hell can a dead comedian...

...from the silent movie era
be lodged in my left bosom?

Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.

I'm fine? What?
Are you coming on to me now?

Peter, he's not coming on to you.

He's trying to tell you that
you're healthy.

Can't it be both?

[Kissing]

My sweetie is okay.

Better than okay, Lois.
From now on, I'm gonna appreciate...

...all the little things in life,
like you and the kids.

Is this the price of my bill
or my phone number?

Your phone number.

[Sheepish laughter]

PETER: It's still pretty pricey!
LOIS: Peter, who cares how much it is?

You've just got the most important
bill of all, a clean bill of health.

Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting
to crack out that gem?

PETER: This sucks, Brian.
Why should I have to pay this?

-There's nothing wrong with me.
-Too bad you're not dying.

Wait a second. That's it!
They can't make a dead guy pay his bill.

All I gotta do is write "deceased"
right here where it says "name."

And where it says "sex,"
I'll write, "No, thanks. I'm dead."

It's bulletproof.

[Crickets chirping]

But you promised
the fat one would perish.

I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey?
Your father is alive and well...

...and we can be a family
for a good long...

[Knocking]

Who are you?

DEATH: I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the
hell do you think I am? I'm Death.

DEATH: Which one of you is Peter Griffin?

PETER: He is.

DEATH: Come on, man.
Which one of you is Peter Griffin?

This is Peter Griffin.

[Laughing]

DEATH: That's a good one.

[Continues laughing]

LOIS: Why are you--

DEATH: No, wait.
I'm not finished holding my sides.

[Continues laughing]

Why are...

[Continues laughing]

Why...

[Continues laughing]

Why are you here?
The doctor said Peter was okay.

DEATH: The doctor!
I guess he must know, right?

I mean, he's a doctor and everything,
and I'm just Death!

STEWIE: Excuse me. Hello!
I'm Stewie. Big fan.

PETER: Death, you made a mistake.
I'm not supposed to be dead.

DEATH: I made a mistake? What's this?

LOIS: Peter, is that your handwriting?

[Nervous laughter]

How did you get that?

DEATH: Your HMO emailed it to me.

I know my doctor was hitting on me,
but you don't have to call him names.

I don't care what that says!
You can't take my husband!

Mother! Where are your manners?
Don't argue with our guest!

STEWIE: Won't you join us for dinner?
DEATH: Oh, no. I don't want to impose.

DEATH: Is that turkey?
LOIS: Yes, Death.

We were in the middle of a turkey dinner
to celebrate Peter's good health.

DEATH: Do you mind?

STEWIE: Mind? Of course not.
It would be an honor.

No, it would be a privilege.

Oh, dear. Listen to me prattling
on like a schoolgirl.

Come, come.
You, heat up some gravy for our guest!

My last helping of white meat
was drier than Oscar Wilde.

How did you do that?

DEATH: Let's just say,
when I was younger...

...I did some films
I'm not particularly proud of.

DEATH: That does it for me.

Wait! You can't go.

After dinner,
we usually go into the living room...

...and live for another 40 or 50 years.

DEATH: [Laughing] 40 or... Let's go.

I guess this is good-bye.
Meg, you're the man of the family now.

Be strong.

Daddy.

Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here
to see you become a man.

Yes. I think we all know
what that's going to be like.

A 20-minute call to Larchmont?
Who do we know in Larchmont?

STEWIE'S WIFE: My sister-in-law.

Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes.
That's right. How is Carol?

-Brian.
-Oh, God.

-Daddy, can I come with you?
-Ask your mother.

No, you can't go with him!

-Oh, Peter.
-Lois.

[Crying]

DEATH: Okay, that's good. Come on now.

PETER: Hey, Death, you got a file on me?
DEATH: Yeah, it's in the car, I think.

Does it mention that I ran two weeks
of Junior Varsity track?

DEATH: Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo.
You don't think I can catch you?

[Screaming]

DEATH: My ankle!

DEATH: Yeah, listen,
don't help or anything. I'm totally fine.

Damn Irish.

DEATH: Yeah. That felt good,
dropping me on the couch like that.

LOIS: Here's some Tylenol.
DEATH: Great. Tylenol. I asked for Advil.

But, you know, whatever. That's good.

I got a B-plus in Health.
Is there anything I can do?

DEATH: Why don't you boil some water
and rip up some sheets there, Einstein.

It's a sprained ankle.

DEATH: I have to stay off it for a while.
PETER: Not here.

DEATH: Why?
PETER: You tried to kill me!

Besides, how are we supposed
to explain you to Mr. Roper?

LOIS: It's okay, Death.
You just worry about feeling better.

What the hell are you doing?

Peter, don't you see?
As long as he's here, you can't die.

PETER: Go on.
LOIS: That's it.

PETER: Wait a minute.
So no matter what I do, I won't die?

Make yourself at home, Death.

PETER: I'm going out for a while.
DEATH: Wait.

You can't tell anyone I'm here.
For if humanity discovers...

...I'm no longer lurking in the shadows,
consequences will be dire.

PETER: Go on.
DEATH: That's it.

What the hell do you see in him?

LOIS: Peter, where are you going?

Lois, 10 minutes ago,
I was staring Death in the face.

Now that I've been given another chance...

...I'm gonna do the one thing
I've always dreamed of doing.

I'm gonna jump off this building.

Could you repeat that, please, Peter?
I believe I had something crazy in my ear.

Hold the phone.

You took me away from
a Swedish girlie-girl...

...and her paralyzed,
but trusting, cousin for this?

-$1,000 says I live.
-$1,000, huh?

-What the hell?
-Okay.

Look at that. I beat my loogie.

[Grumbling]

LOIS: It's your turn, Death.

DEATH: I know I should find this ironic,
but I'm just bored as hell.

<i>How old is this TV?</i>

You can probably get
the DuMont Network on this thing.

LOIS: Peter is a good man
and a wonderful father.

DEATH: Here it comes.

Could you please find it in your heart
to spare him?

After all, it isn't really his time.

DEATH: What did you use
for this cocoa, crap?

LOIS: If you want me to make it again--
DEATH: Sorry, my fault.

I just assumed you were gonna make it
with milk, not crap!

LOIS: I'll be right back.

MEG: I brought you a magazine.
DEATH: <i>Glamour</i>, great.

I can learn how to please my man.
Go get me an <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.

I hear it's got a great picture of me
sneaking up on Tom Snyder.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Screaming]

[Saw buzzing]

Victory is mine!

Wow. I should really
watch where I'm going.

What the deuce?

Of course!

It seems with Death incapacitated,
my matricidal efforts are futile.

I must do all I can to accelerate
his convalescence.

"Knick-knack paddywhack,
give a dog a bone"

I can't believe you drank 300 bottles
of beer without succumbing...

...to alcohol poisoning.

Peter, are you a witch?

Yeah. But don't tell anyone.
The consequences could be dire!

You guys, I bet I can go up to each one
of those scary-looking bikers and say:

"Aren't you Richard Simmons?"

-Peter, no!
-Now you're being brainless.

Aren't you Richard Simmons?

Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend,
Richard Simmons?

BIKER: Shut up!

[Laughing]

[Everyone laughing]

DEATH: That feels good.

Actually, kid,
I kind of fell into this gig.

I really wanted to be a wood nymph.

Man, the second Dad found out,
he started in with the whole:

"I have no son. I have no son,"
and Mom just stood there.

Yes. Mothers can be quite
the botheration, can't they?

That's why we've got to get you well.

-What was that?
-Nothing!

Stewie, leave Death alone.

DEATH: He's okay.
He reminds me a lot of me at that age.

I hope his teen years go better than mine.
Boy, talk about awkward.

DEATH: Oh, Sandy! Sandy!

<i>Sandy? Not again.</i>

<i>I'm gonna be a virgin forever.</i>

<i>Or am I?</i>

LOIS: Can we please talk about Peter?

He has so much to live for, Death.
He loves his children and me--

DEATH: Okay. I'll spare his life.

But you owe me, if you get my drift.

What the hell are you doing?
I was talking about another fruit cup.

Not bad, though.

LOIS: Peter,
Death just agreed to let you live.

Oh, man. This really is my night.
I get to live, and I'm on TV.

Our top story tonight,
the rules of death no longer apply.

That's right, Tom.

Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa,
filed this report, all by herself!

I'm here with Peter Griffin,
the man who claims he withstood...

...a barrage of bullets and did not die.

Peter, are you saying
that if I shoot you in the head...

...with this Channel 5 pistol,
you'll be completely unharmed?

Why don't you give it a shot?

Okay, here goes.

[Screaming]

What have I done?

[Laughing]

You're awful.

-Fascinating story, Tom.
-It sure is, Diane.

And since the laws of death
no longer apply, I can do this.

That's right, Tom.

And now it's time for sports.

DEATH: The whole world is laughing
at me. This is high school all over again.

Well, I'll show them!
I'll show all of them!

Oh, my God, that hurts!

You're not killing anyone tonight, mister!
Not on that ankle.

DEATH: This is all your fault.
And there's only one solution.

You have to go out there and do my job.

You have to be Death!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

PETER: Boy, this doesn't leave much
to the imagination.

Death, there is no way
Peter can do your job.

He could never kill anyone.

Yeah! I've thought about it,
like in church and stuff...

...but I don't think I could ever do
what you do.

DEATH: So you're better than me?

I'm tired of always being the bad guy.
What I do has to be done.

He's right. You've disturbed
the natural order.

People need to be able to die.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

No!

-Actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.
-Oh, Jack.

Now we can get married
and everything you promised.

Yeah, about that...

...I was pretty sure I was gonna die...

...because there's this girl in New York,
and it's getting kind of serious.

But thanks for letting me draw you naked.

I still can't believe you let me do that!

You're saying the only way to make
the world right is for me to kill someone?

STEWIE: You could kill Lois.
DEATH: No. One death isn't gonna do it.

You have to do something that will
get everyone's attention, something huge.

How about if you blow up the earth?

DEATH: Too huge.
But you're thinking. I like that.

You could kill any girls
who are prettier than me.

DEATH: That would just leave England.
Wait. I have it.

I'm a genius.
You'll kill the kids from <i>Dawson's Creek</i>!

I knew it! As soon as that show
came on the air, I said:

"I'm gonna be the one
who has to kill these kids."

LOIS: It's true. He did say it.
DEATH: Hot, young celebrities.

It's perfect!

The kids are on their way to LA
to renegotiate their contracts.

But their plane is gonna be making
a little stopover in Rhode Island.

DEATH: If you go now, you'll catch them.
PETER: No way.

I'm not doing your dirty work.
There's no way I'm getting on that plane.

Absolutely no way, and that's final.

See? I'm still here.

There's nothing you can say
that'll change my mind.

DEATH: You kill them, or I kill you.

Crap!

Nice plant.

Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.

MAN: James,
your last movie killed at the box office.

Your Q-rating's through the roof.

It's time we ditched the WB
and concentrate on features.

I don't know who you are,
but just because you're sitting...

...across from me doesn't mean
you can give me career advice.

-Will you sign my ass?
-You have a pen?

Hello, Death?
Guess where I'm calling from?

PETER: A plane!
DEATH: That's great.

DEATH: Are those kids on board?
PETER: Yeah.

About that,
I don't think I can go through with it.

DEATH: Peter, listen, without death,
the world would be a terrible place.

Imagine a world
where Hitler was still alive.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Today on</i> Hitler<i>,</i>
<i>we'll be talking with Christian Slater.</i>

Now, they tell me in your next movie,
we get to see your butt.

[Girls cheering]

SLATER: Yes, you do.
HITLER: Can we see it right now?

SLATER: All right.
HITLER: He's going to do it!

ANNOUNCER: <i>If you're going to be in L.A.</i>
<i>and would like tickets to</i> Hitler<i>...</i>

<i>...call 213-du werdest</i>
<i>eine Krankenschwester brauchen!</i>

DEATH: Peter, all you gotta do
is sit there.

The plane is gonna crash in LA.

Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.

PETER: Jeez, everybody?
DEATH: Except you.

Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?

PETER: It's still me.
DEATH: Brenda?

PETER: Yes? Just kidding, it's still me.

PILOT: <i>We now begin our final approach</i>
<i>into Los Angeles International.</i>

<i>If you look out the window,</i>
<i>you'll see the San Fernando Valley...</i>

<i>...where my brother Gary makes</i>
<i>a very nice living directing porn.</i>

<i>We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes.</i>

GIRLS: [Singing] "We like being alive,
we like being alive

"We like being, oh, we like being,
oh, we like being alive"

I guess it's their time.

[Theme from <i>Dawson's Creek</i> playing]

PACEY: Boy, for a teacher,
you sure make love good.

Actually, it's "well," Pacey.
You mean to say, I make love "well."

-You're good to go again, right?
-Yeah.

DEATH: <i>Peter? Hello? Peter,</i>
<i>are you there? I can hear you breathing?</i>

Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it.
I've changed my mind.

I don't care if you do kill me,
I'm not gonna kill those kids.

If they die, I'll have nothing
to watch on Wednesdays...

...other than the fine programs on Fox.

Open up in there!

What are you doing? You're not a pilot.
I know every pilot in the world!

I'm here to keep you from making an error.
A pilot error.

Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!

JAMES: Nice going, fat--

I was just trying to save your lives.
But now you're all gonna die.

-No one can land this plane.
-I can.

Thank God! It's Karen Black!

She landed a busted plane in <i>Airport '75</i>?

It was a movie in the '70s.

You damn kids with your music.

TOM: <i>Both of the pilots were killed.</i>

<i>Fortunately for the other passengers,</i>
<i>actress Karen Black...</i>

<i>...star of such films as</i> Nashville
<i>and</i> Five Easy Pieces<i>, was on board.</i>

<i>Hats off to Miss Black for proving</i>
<i>once again that, given the opportunity...</i>

<i>...actresses over 50 can</i>
<i>land large aircraft.</i>

<i>Karen Black. What an obscure reference!</i>

DEATH: What the hell? I told you to waste
the <i>Dawson's Creek</i> kids.

LOIS: You're missing
the important thing here.

You said you wanted everyone to know
the rules of death apply.

LOIS: Now the whole world does.
DEATH: I guess so.

My ankle's starting to feel better.
I should probably get out of your hair.

But you just got here!

We can stay in touch, can't we?
What's your e-mail?

Mine is "loismustdie," all one word,
"@yahoo.com."

PETER: Wait a second. Death?

I used to fear you,
but now I'm glad we met.

Because you've given me a great gift.
The complete Boz Scaggs.

PETER: How did you know?
DEATH: I just had a feeling.

LOIS: We're gonna miss you, Death.
DEATH: Don't worry.

I'll be back really, really soon.

[Laughing]

DEATH: Is he joking?

Okay, see you later.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll

TOM: <i>It was a moving scene today</i>
<i>at Hatch Pond...</i>

<i>...as six members of the Pawtucket</i>
<i>fire department struggled valiantly...</i>

<i>...to save a fish's life</i>
<i>trapped under the frozen ice.</i>

<i>Rescue workers got the fish</i>
<i>out of the water...</i>

<i>...but unfortunately </i>
<i>it died shortly after.</i>

<i>Diane?</i>

<i>Tom, another life</i>
<i>was tragically cut short today.</i>

<i>Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater</i>
<i>group known as the Quahog Players...</i>

<i>...passed away this afternoon.</i>

Oh, my God!

[Phone ringing]

<i>Kimble was a hands-on director who</i>
<i>often appeared in his own shows...</i>

<i>...most recently,</i> Miss Saigon<i>.</i>

[Singing] "La la la la la, Miss Saigon

"La la la la la, Miss Saigon"

Yes, I just heard. It's so sad.

Really?

They want me to be the new
artistic director of the Quahog Players!

-All right, Mom!
-Are you gonna do it?

I don't know.
It's such a big responsibility.

I need a moment to think.

Okay, I'll do it.

<i>This just in. </i>
<i>Lois Griffin is named the new</i>

<i>artistic director of the Quahog Players.</i>

All those years of paying my dues
as musical director...

...under that old hack
have finally paid off.

Lois, congratulations.

Our little theater group finally has
a committed visionary at its helm.

And such an attractive one.

Brian, you'll have to audition
just like everyone else.

God, of course. I...

You didn't think... You thought I was...

Lois!

-I can paint scenery.
-Can I be in the show, Mom?

Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager
who stays backstage and cries...

...because nobody finds her attractive.

[Laughing]

-Hey, you guys.
-Peter, guess what? I am gonna--

Me first! Mr. Weed said
whoever comes up with the best idea...

...for the big Christmas toy this year
gets a huge bonus.

Hey, Dad,
why don't you invent the Frisbee?

That's an awesome toy.

-It's already been invented.
-Then how come I never heard of it?

This is my chance to prove
how valuable I am to the company!

Sorry, Lois. What's your news?

Well, I...

Mr. Weed,
distinguished members of the board...

...may I present
this year's hottest toy...

<i>...Mr. Zucchini Head.</i>

He's got stupid cool hip-hop style
with his little hat and his Doc Martens.

Thank you, Peter, that's enough.

Wait. This is the best part! He dances!

MAN #1: I've seen enough.
MAN #2: Inappropriate.

MAN #3: I haven't had sex in ages.

Gentlemen,
I apologize for wasting your time.

Peter is an adequate
assembly-line worker...

...but you'll be happy to know
our company does not pay him to think.

[Laughing]

[Nervous laughter]

I'll take this.

No calls.

Come on, kids! The director can't be late
for the auditions.

You should've heard them laughing at me.

I got great ideas, but they look at me,
and all they see is a loser.

Except that guy with the lazy eye.
He sees a loser and the snack machine.

Peter, a lot of creative people
had mindless jobs.

Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry.

Herman Melville was a customs agent.

Albert Einstein
worked for the patent office.

And what is it you want to patent,
<i>Herr</i> Smith?

I call it "Smith's Theory of Relativity."

-Hey, look at this.
-What?

BRIAN: I think Lois is saying that...

...you have to find a way
to express yourself creatively.

For example, Chris has his drawing,

Meg does her birdcalls,
I sing beautifully.

So I've heard.

And Lois has her theater group.

Yes. And for my first production,
I've chosen <i>The King and I</i>.

It's a wonderful story
about a loving, patient woman...

...who introduces culture and civility
to a barbaric, patriarchal...

Peter, please don't wipe your nose
on the couch.

Look, I have to go.

Part of being creative is figuring out
what you're good at.

I know you can do it
if you put your mind to it.

You're right. Man was meant to create.
That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.

It works! Look how tiny they are!

[Sweeping instrumental music]

[Singing] "Oh, no not in springtime

"summer, winter, or fall

"No, never would I leave you

"at all"

JOE: Bravo!

LOIS: Brian, that was beautiful!
Thank you!

No, thank you.

And that note you gave me, "louder,"
I was thinking that, and then you said it.

BRIAN: You're so intuitive.
It's a pleasure--

LOIS: Okay. Next!

Stewie, do you want to try out
for Mommy's play?

"Now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of York.

-"And all--"
-Why don't you sing <i>Itsy Bitsy Spider</i>?

How dare you reduce
my finely hewn thespian stylings...

...to mere Mother Gooseries!

Sing <i>Baa Baa Black Sheep</i>!

Mother, as first lady
of the American stage,

Helen Hayes, once said:

"I'm going to kill you!"

Hey, can somebody give me a hand
with all this talent?

Peter, what are you doing here?

Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity,
like you said.

First I took an art class.

Am I supposed to draw the penis?

Then I tried sculpting.

Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?

Then I tried music.

Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?

I started to think
there was nothing I'd be good at.

But then I realized that this is it.

Lois, my penis belongs on stage.

Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition.
You know, sing, dance.

[Laughs]

I get it.

Hello, everybody.

This is just a formality,
since I happen to be doing the director.

[Laughs]

Five, six, seven, eight.

[Sings out of tune]

"Marshall, Will, and Holly,
on a routine expedition

"Met the greatest earthquake ever known

"High on the rapids,
it struck their tiny raft

[Yells]

"And plunged them down
a thousand feet below

"to the Land of the Lost"

[Growls]

LOIS: Before I post the cast list...

...my choreographer and I
want to thank everyone for auditioning.

-You were all great.
-Weren't they?

I only wish the show was called
<i>The King and Us</i>...

...so I could cast you all.

[Laughing]

Anna! Baby, baby! I'm a star!

Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before.

Except for Pearl Bailey
at a book signing once...

...but then we later found out
it wasn't actually her.

Siamese baby?
Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!

You wanted a bigger part,
didn't you, sweetie?

To hell with you!

Perhaps I'll skip the stage
and go directly to films!

-Hello.
-What is that on your ear?

Is that hair gel?

-Yeah.
-Great, 'cause I could use some.

-No, don't!
-I just ran out.

[Sighing]

Man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!

BRIAN: The King of Siam? Why,
that's the lead! This is so unexpected!

Hey, shut up!

The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead!

PETER: Lois, I think you made a mistake.
I'm not "The King."

I'm not "I," I'm not anybody.

-So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
-No, Peter, I...

It's just that directing this show
is a big opportunity for me...

...and I don't want anything to ruin it.

-Ruin it?
-Yes.

By not using you to your full potential.

You have too much talent for the stage.

You should...

[Stuttering]

You should be a producer.

A producer? Gee, I don't know.

PETER: Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr.

We made the deal.
We're richer and more powerful than ever!

I'm the king of the...

[Screams]

PETER: Damn it!

[Gentle dinner music playing]

I love Mexicans. I'll do it!

[Pianist playing show music]

JOE: Hang on, hang on!
You overextended the plié!

You screwed it all up.
Let me show you again.

Okay, boys! Let's do it!

And one, two, three.

And just like this.
And watch my feet. And one, two, three.

Peter, Chris says you told him
to build a set for the North Pole.

Yeah, that's where Anna goes
to talk with her best friend, a penguin.

There is no talking penguin
in <i>The King and I</i>.

There is in
"Peter Griffin presents <i>The King and I</i>."

What?

Now we gotta think of
some funny stuff for him to say.

Peter, the director decides
whether or not to add a character.

You're the producer, remember?

What am I supposed to do
with all my great ideas?

Put 'em in a tub
and clean myself with them?

'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.

Good producers put their ideas to work
outside the theater.

It's your job to make sure
we sell every seat in this house.

-And that's creative?
-Is it?

Well, it's just
the most creative job there is.

Don't you worry, Lois.
I'll get the word out.

I'll tell two friends,
and they'll tell two friends...

...and that's, like,
10 people right there.

Hey, I recognize you from the television.

You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.

PETER: Excuse me?
TOM: You. Get out of here!

Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!

-Wow! Diane Simmons!
-You don't look anything like the ad.

-You better be huge.
-No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer.

I'm presenting
"Peter Griffin presents <i>The King and I</i>"...

...a Peter Griffin production,
and I'm giving you the exclusive story.

Look, pal, some two-bit
community theater production isn't news.

Who's the star?

For that matter, who the hell are you,
and why should I give a damn?

Wow, I'm being interviewed
by Diane Simmons!

Well, Lois,
you told me to produce, and I did.

I got us a story on the 11:00 news.

-Really?
-Peter.

<i>Our top story tonight.</i>
<i>I will be playing the role of Anna...</i>

<i>...in the Quahog Players production</i>
<i>of</i> The King and I<i>.</i>

<i>-Tom?</i>
<i>-Thanks, Diane.</i>

<i>In other news, I'm not going to the play</i>
<i>because I'm sure it'll be lousy.</i>

<i>I'm getting late word</i>
<i>that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.</i>

<i>Bit of breaking news. We now go live</i>
<i>to Diane being a bitch. Diane?</i>

But Loretta's playing Anna,
and she's doing a great job.

Loretta's a nobody.
Diane Simmons is a star.

You wanted me to sell tickets, right?

People who've never been in a theater
will come see Diane Simmons.

I don't know, Peter,
she's a news reporter.

Some of our greatest actors
started in news, like Sean Penn.

Today's weather calls for breezy skies
and sun, and there's gonna be a...

Get that camera out of my face!

PETER: Hey, everybody, here's our star!

This is so awkward.

You all know my name,
and I've never heard of any of you.

-You ever acted before, honey?
-I did an independent film in college.

[Melancholic instrumental music]

LOIS: Let's start with the scene where
Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.

-Are you playing Lady Thiang?
-I was supposed to be Anna.

They did an all-you-people version
of <i>Hello, Dolly</i> that was very successful.

Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7.

<i>Action!</i>

"Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you.
You must go to him.

"Lady Thiang, if he needs me,
truly needs me, I will go to him."

Cut! All wrong! No good!

Peter, what are you doing?
She was wonderful.

My ass.

Besides, I'm the director.

It just doesn't feel real, you know?

Anna and Miss Thing both love
the king, right?

On <i>Springer</i> yesterday,
they had "I won't share my husband"...

...and these two women bitch-slapped
each other. The crowd went nuts.

Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?

I think I can do that.

Wait a minute.
Nobody's slapping anybody.

This is Rodgers and Hammerstein,
not trash TV!

I think Peter may be onto something.

<i>Springer</i> is one of our station's
highest-rated shows.

-I don't know.
-I thought you wanted to do a good show?

If you want to do a bad show,
why don't we just do <i>Rent</i>?

I guess we can try that--
-Action!

Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts
make Diane look a little hippie, you know?

I thought we could dress her
in a pair of sequined capri pants.

They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.

They did now!

STEWIE: You! You are the worst thing
to happen to musical theater...

...since Andrew Lloyd Webber!

And you! I just plain don't like you!

[Laughing]

LOIS: What's going on?

We're just having a little pow-wow
to discuss my latest changes.

What changes?

The Siamese children. How about this?
They're not children.

They're aliens!

QUAGMIRE: That was great.
BRIAN: On the money.

Isn't he brilliant?

No! He's not brilliant!
Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant!

And I want to do the show they wrote!
We're not making any more changes!

MEG: We sold out!

Yeah. The whole town's talking
about your show, Dad!

[Cheering]

Your show? Peter, this is my show!

What's the big deal?
You wanted to sell out, and we did.

I am through selling out.

I took this job because
I wanted to create something beautiful...

...and you've completely destroyed that!

You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!

Me, direct?

I don't know what to say, except,
"I'm the king of the..."

Morning, theater fans!

Good morning, Peter.
I made your favorite breakfast.

-What the hell is this?
-French toast.

I just made a few creative changes
to the recipe.

I think it's a lot better now.

Lois, if this is your idea of a joke,
you must write for Leno.

It is so fashionable to take a shot
at Jay Leno.

Look, the fact is the man is out there
every bloody night with fresh material...

...and he's charming.

Face it, you're just jealous because
people like my ideas better than yours.

I don't care
if the whole world loves your ideas.

That doesn't make them good.
I was trying to make art.

Art-schmart.

Put enough monkeys in a room
with a typewriter...

...they'll produce Shakespeare.

Let's see.
"A something by any other name..."

-"Carnation," "peony."
-No, they did that on last week's <i>Marlowe</i>.

-What about "daisy"?
-"Chrysanthemum"!

-"Iris," "rose"? What about "rose"?
-Did you say "rose"?

-Yeah, "rose."
-"Rose" is good!

-"A rose by any other name." That works.
-I like that a lot.

-Moving on.
-What about "tulip"?

"Rose" is fine. Moving on.

Peter, you've never done a creative thing
in your life!

That's not true.
I wrote <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>.

No, you didn't.

You win this round, Lois.

You're not being creative.
You're just destroying a wonderful show.

I have more creativity in my whole body
than most people do before 9:00 a.m.

The only thing you create
before 9:00 a.m...

...is exactly what you've turned
my show into.

I think my work will speak for itself.

[Fake laugh]

I just got that. A poop joke?
That's real creative, Lois.

PETER: Okay, let's run this scene again.

Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna,
a steel-town girl on a Saturday night...

...looking for the fight of her life.

-Where does it say that?
-In my noodle.

Okay, places. And action!

['80s pop music playing in theater]

PETER: Stop! All wrong! All wrong!
God, send me dancers.

We've been rehearsing for hours.
I'm exhausted!

I'm sorry,
but we open this show in three hours...

...and I don't think we're ready!

DIANE: No, we're not!
You keep changing everything!

You bet I do! Because theater is alive.

It's a living, breathing creature
with wants and needs...

...and you're not man enough
to satisfy her!

-I can't work this way. I quit!
-Fine.

-We can't do <i>The King and I</i> without Anna.
-Yeah. This is a real snafu.

We don't need Diane Simmons.
We've had someone better all along.

Someone radiant and sassy...

...with the soul and passion
that can only come...

...from hundreds of years
of black oppression.

Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.

Get over yourself. I was talking about me.

Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.

STAGEHAND: Two minutes, everybody.

PETER: Jeez, full house.

Look who came crawling back.

Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?

I don't get it, Mom.

If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your
show, why'd you come to opening night?

I came because I love the theater.

If I just came here to enjoy
watching your father be humiliated...

...when this asinine spectacle of his
is ridiculed by everyone in town...

...what kind of person would I be?

A bitch.

Stop it! Stop clapping right now!
What's wrong with you?

These people shouldn't be encouraged!
They should be punished!

That man has committed murder here
this evening...

...and the victim's name is "theater."

This is the kind of
mind-numbing schlock...

...that's turning our society
into a cultural wasteland!

This isn't art!
This isn't even entertainment!

This blows!

See? This is exactly the kind of thing
I was talking about.

-How was the cast party?
-We're a hit.

Man, what a night.
I got to see my ideas come to life.

It's the greatest feeling in the world.

-Yeah, I bet it is.
-And it's all thanks to you.

I never would've discovered
I could be creative...

...if you hadn't believed in me.

Actually I didn't really, not at first.

But anyone who could take <i>The King and I</i>
and turn it into that is...

...well, he's gotta be creative.

Yeah, Lois,
sorry I took your show away from you...

...but I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure

you get your chance next year.

It'll be "Peter Griffin presents
a Lois Griffin production."

-Okay, honey?
-Deal.

Typical male fantasy.

I guarantee you
a man made that commercial.

Of course a man made it.

It's a commercial,
not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.

CHRIS: Dad, we won a boat!
We won a boat!

Holy crap! We did!
We won a free freakin' boat!

Dad, nobody gives things away for free.

That's not true.

I know people who give things away.

Free Tibet! Free Tibet!

I'll take it!

Hello, China?

I have something you may want.

But it's gonna cost you.

That's right. All the tea.

[Sinister instrumental music]

I knew there was a catch.

You have to sit through one of those
awful time-share presentations.

That's a small price to pay.

I am gonna be the first one
on Spooner Street to have his own boat!

Whoa! All hands on deck!
I'm getting a boat!

CLEVELAND: Hey, Quagmire.
I'm also getting a boat, too.

Right on!
I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!

Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy
on Spooner Street to get a boat.

Hey, hey, hey! I'm getting a boat!

Oh, man!
Even Della Reese is getting a boat.

These wonderful homes
on this beautifully secluded island...

...can be yours
with almost no strings attached.

Beautiful island.

Nothing out of the ordinary here.
Just beautiful homes and nothing else.

Each residence has 200 feet
of pristine oceanfront.

No city noise, no flesh-eating ogres,
no pollution.

I hate these high-pressure
sales situations.

That's so cute.

You're afraid that
because you're a woman...

...you'll do something stupid
like buy that time-share...

...or not realize that I taped over
our wedding video with softcore porn.

You taped over our wedding video?

Relax, Lois.
I just taped over the boring stuff.

The couple wrote their own vows,
which they will now recite to each other.

Peter, I...

The only reason I got myself arrested was
to find out what happened to my sister.

GUARD: Excuse me, ladies.
It's laundry time.

[Cheesy porn music playing]

It's so cold in here.

I mean, look at my...

Oh, my God, Peter!

I sent a copy of that tape
to my Great Aunt Lil!

This wedding is hot!

Wake up, damn it! Wake up!

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

I know you've been here all day.

If you'll sign this contract,
I'll take your blank check...

...and you'll not be loving
your time-share before you know it.

We're not gonna buy
your lousy time-share, all right?

Now, where's my boat?

Hold on. You have a choice.

You can have the boat...

...or the mystery box.

Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.

Not so fast, Lois.

A boat's a boat.
But the mystery box could be anything.

It could even be a boat.

You know how much we wanted one.

-Then let's--
-We'll take the box.

"We'll take the box."

You gave up a boat
for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.

You're acting like this is
the first time I've done something stupid.

Remember the time
I was supposed to get that boat?

A boat's a boat.
But the mystery box could be anything.

It could even be a boat.

You know how much we wanted one.

-Then let's--
-We'll take the box.

Peter, that just happened 10 minutes ago.

Who cares? I'll bet nobody took the boat.

Who could resist the call
of the mystery box?

QUAGMIRE: Hey, look at me.
I'm in the boat.

All right.

BONNIE: Joe, look to the right.
It's the Griffins.

We're nautical now, baby.
That's called "starboard."

But I'll forgive you, because you
sex me up. Now, give me some sugar.

Hey, neighbors! Where's your boat?

We didn't take the boat.
We took the mystery box.

Hop in.

Hey, Quagmire.

Maybe the comedian
will tell some jokes about boats...

...or boating, or owning a boat.

Yeah, or maybe he'll tell some jokes
about being a sucker!

Oh, Quagmire.

You're what the Spaniards call
<i>el terrible</i>.

What are you upset about?
I never knew you liked boats.

Hey, boating's in my blood.
Ever since my great-grandfather...

...Huck Griffin,
rafted down the mighty Mississippi.

What did you just call me?

I thought that was your name.

That is our word!
You've got no right using it!

I'm cool. No problem.

Could you pass me the oar, N-word Jim?

Thank you.

This comic sucks!

He couldn't make me laugh,
even if I was laughing my ass off...

...and he was making me do it.

Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!

Peter, that's a microphone stand.

Pardon me for thinking a mic stand in
a comedy club should tell a joke or two.

I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.

<i>Hi. Welcome to--</i>

Very funny.

<i>Excuse me, sir. I haven't even--</i>

That one was hilarious!

That was even funnier
than your first joke!

-Hey, put skinny back up there.
-Peter!

<i>You think this is easy?</i>
<i>You want to try this?</i>

I thought you'd never ask.

Maybe you shouldn't do this.

You've never had a lot of luck
telling jokes.

Okay, how many dirty, stinkin' apes
does it take to screw in a light bulb?

Three.

One dirty, stinkin' ape
to screw in the light bulb...

...and two dirty, stinkin' apes
to throw feces at each other.

[Laughing]

Don't worry. I got it under control.

<i>Hey, how about that Viagra?</i>

<i>You know what that stuff does?</i>

PETER:<i> Come on!</i>

<i>What are you people, stupid?</i>

<i>You like a little abuse, huh?</i>

<i>Yeah. Well, you guys are stupid and ugly.</i>

<i>If there was a stupid-and-ugly contest,</i>
<i>you'd all win!</i>

<i>Or lose.</i>

<i>Whichever is funnier.</i>

Hey, Lois.

What do you call a woman
who takes forever to cook breakfast?

I swear to God, Peter!

You call her "Lois."

[Laughing]

Well, the fat man made a funny.
I rather enjoyed that.

Yes, you cook very slowly.

As a matter of fact,
if you were any slower at cooking...

...you wouldn't be cooking very fast
at all, now, would you?

That one wasn't very good.

LOIS: They laughed because
it looked like you peed yourself...

...not because they liked your jokes.

Maybe that was part of my act.

Urine happens to be very edgy.

I guess an unfunny person like you
wouldn't understand that.

Okay, okay. I've got it.

If you cooked any more slowly,
you wouldn't need an egg timer...

...you'd need an egg calendar!

[Laughing]

That's right. I went there.

Okay, here's another one.

Why do women have boobs?

So you got something to look at
while you're talking to them!

[Laughing]

Good one, Peter.

That's what they're for.

Are you telling jokes?

I love jokes.

All right. Then you'll love this one.

Why do women have boobs?

So you got something to look at
while you're talking to them.

So you got something to look at
while you're talking to them.

You wanted to see me, Mr. Weed?

Peter, we have a problem.

Mr. Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox.

I represent one of your co-workers,
Sarah Bennett.

She's suing you and the company
for sexual harassment.

Sarah, Sarah...

Is she the one we videotaped
taking a dump?

Why? What happened?

Sexual harassment
is a very serious charge, Mr. Griffin.

First, if I can speak in my own defense,
all I did was tell a little joke.

Second of all, women are not people.

They are devices built by the Lord
Jesus Christ for our entertainment.

Peter, please!

Miss Ironbox, I assure you, this company
in no way condones Peter's conduct.

In fact, a film on employee relations...

...has been a mandatory part
of our personnel training for 50 years.

<i>Irrational, emotionally fragile by nature,</i>
<i>female coworkers are a peculiar animal.</i>

<i>They are very insecure</i>
<i>about their appearance.</i>

<i>Be sure to tell them</i>
<i>how good they look every day...</i>

<i>...even if they're homely and unkempt.</i>

<i>You're doing a great job, Muriel,</i>
<i>and you're prettier than Mamie Van Doren.</i>

<i>And remember, nothing says "good job"</i>
<i>like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.</i>

[Cheery instrumental music]

I teach a workplace-sensitivity training
class for the Women's Action Coalition.

If Mr. Griffin completes my course,
we'll drop the lawsuit.

I assure you, Peter will be there.
His job depends on it.

Good. I'm looking forward to it.

If I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian,
I'd say you were coming on to me.

All right, now,
let's do some role-playing.

I'll be the office assistant.

Mr. Henson, why don't you play the boss,
and we'll see what you've learned?

Okay.

The filing is done, Mr. Henson.

Thank you.

You are a valued member of our team...

...and every bit as important
to this company as I am.

Excellent.

Mr. Griffin, why don't you come up here
and give it a try?

All right.

The filing's done, Mr. Griffin.

Thank you, Miss Ironbox.

You are a valued member
of our business team.

And I will give you a raise tomorrow
if you come to work without a shirt on.

Mr. Griffin!

I'm sorry. That came out wrong.
Let me try again.

Nice ass.

You haven't heard a word I've said!

Now that's not fair.
I've heard everything you said.

There's some subtleties to the rules
that aren't so easy to understand.

Okay, that's it!

Obviously, normal sensitivity training
isn't enough for you!

No, we're gonna have to do
something drastic.

[Crickets chirping]

PETER: A week at a women's retreat.
What am I supposed to learn from that?

Well, face it, Peter. Your attitude
towards women isn't exactly enlightened.

That's a bad mud puddle.

I wouldn't want you to step in that
and get your nice shoes all ruined.

Then you got caught
peeping in the ladies' locker room.

PETER: Okay, move the towel.
Move the towel.

<i>Oh! They spotted me.</i>

Peter, I think this'll be good for you.

You know I love you,
but I have to admit, there are times...

...when I wish you were
a little more sensitive and...

Look at me! Look at me!

Hello, ladies.
I'm Miss Watson, director of the retreat.

I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin...

...who's here to get in touch
with his feminine side.

This world would be a far better place
if there were more men like him.

Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.

I'll be Charlie,
and you can all be my Angels.

Except you.

You'll be Bosley.

WATSON: We women have
so much strength inside us.

If we can endure the pain of childbirth...

...just imagine what else
we're capable of!

-That's true.
-Right on, sister!

Come on.

It's only childbirth.
How much can it hurt?

It's like taking your bottom lip...

...and stretching it over your head
to the back of your neck!

Come on.
You want to hear some horror stories.

You wouldn't believe what I had
to go through when Lois was pregnant.

[Vomiting]

[Theme from <i>Three's Company</i> on TV]

[Vomiting continues]

[Volume increases on TV]

WATSON: Women are made to feel
competitive with each other...

...when we should be supportive.

Lizzie, I know you feel alone and
unattractive since your husband left you.

But you are a beautiful person,
and I am here for you.

Notice I'm making physical contact with
her in order to establish a connection.

I think you'd make more of
a connection if you hugged her.

Very good, Peter. That's true.

That's it. Now rub her back.

Okay, that's good.

Yeah, comfort her.
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

Yeah, it's okay. It's okay to like it.
It's very natural.

Okay, good.

Now smell her a little.

[Cheerful instrumental music]

I can't do it!

Yes, you can! Trust your sisters!
Jump into the trust quilt!

ALL: Jump! Jump! Trust us! We love you!

We'll catch you!

WATSON: Wonderful.

PETER: Okay! Me next! Me next!

Okay, ladies. I'm gonna start
with a Greg Louganis triple-Salchow...

...and tuck into
a flying Mary Lou Retton half-calf.

[Screaming]

WATSON: Now that you've felt
a woman's pain, the learning can begin.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

WOMEN: Bye!

Welcome back, Peter.

Lois! I missed you so much!

And my babies!

Chris, be a munchkin,
and bring my bags inside, huh?

Peter, you're--

Brian, put the tea on. I have stories.

First I'm gonna go freshen up
and rinse out a few things.

Oh, fudge. I broke a nail. Excuse me.

CHRIS: Oh, my God. Dad's a chick.

I can't remember
the last time we cuddled like this.

I can't remember
the last time I loved you so much!

How did you get so sweet?

When I was born, my mommy
dunked me in a barrel of sugar.

Oh, for God's sake!

Oh, yes, I'll have the coffee cake.

[Phone ringing]

-Hello?
-Hey, Quagmire.

-Hey, Peter. What's up?
-Not much.

Well, what do you want?

Nothin'. I'm just calling to talk.

What you thinking about?

What do you mean? You called me!

I just wanted to say hi.

So, what are you...

Sometimes I just can't believe
we could make something so beautiful.

He looks just like his father.

I really appreciate
all the hard work you did...

...giving birth and mothering our kids.

I'll never know that joy.

Peter, I'm sure you would've been
a great mother if you had the chance.

-You think so?
-I know so.

[Suckling]

[Choking and gagging]

LOIS: One of these days,
I'm gonna need the mirror.

Oh, beans!
I can't get this spit curl to...

Lois, what day is it?

-Thursday.
-Oh, my God! I'm late!

If you spent less time fixing your hair--

No, Lois. I'm "late" late!
Do we still have that pregnancy test?

Are you insane? You can't have a baby!

Well, I don't have a lot of options.
I'm Catholic!

God, I thought you'd be happy!

Oh, this is just great!

Now my own wife is forced to cook dinner
for her lousy husband?

Peter, you're my husband!
At least you used to be.

Oh, mother, I come bearing a gift.
I'll give you a hint.

It's in my diaper, and it's not a toaster.

-Meg, can you change Stewie?
-Fine.

But this time, if a boy calls,
don't tell him I'm wrist deep in poopie.

Honey, I'm glad
you discovered your feminine side.

But I didn't want you to forget
about mine.

Remember this?

Remember?

Oh, my God! That reminds me!
I gotta give myself a breast exam.

Uh-oh!

A lump! Oh, God!

No, Cheeto.

[Doorbell ringing]

Lois!

How expected.

Hi, Glen. I'm sorry to bother you.
Is this a bad time?

Never a bad time when you're
with the Q-Man. Come on in.

Well, as you may have noticed,

Peter's been acting
a little different lately.

It was refreshing at first. But now...

Well, he doesn't even
treat me like a woman anymore.

I know where this is going, Lois!

And I'm already semi-there.

[Jazz music playing on turntable]

Anyways, Glen,
I was wondering if you and Cleveland...

...could help change Peter
back to the way he was.

Of course that's why you're here!

[Record skips]

Don't worry, Lois.
I'd do everything to you.

-What?
-I'd do anything for you.

QUAGMIRE: Come on, Cleveland.

If we're gonna re-masculate Peter,
we need chicks!

Let's blow this
and hit the International House of Tail.

No.

He needs to learn how
to respect his fellow man.

That's what this march is all about.

Respect for your fellow man.

I can't respect men.

Men are the reason
our world is in such lousy shape.

If men were as caring as women,
we wouldn't have crime or violence.

SPEAKER: <i>Brothers, we stand together--</i>
PETER: <i>Excuse me!</i>

<i>I'd like to say a couple of truths</i>
<i>to the men in this audience.</i>

<i>It's your fault we have so much crime</i>
<i>in this country!</i>

<i>And it's your fault we have so much</i>
<i>violence in this country!</i>

<i>You are ruining our society,</i>
<i>and you should be ashamed!</i>

[Angry mob yelling]

PETER: I don't care
how many letters we gotta write.

<i>The View</i> should be on for three hours.

You just get going,
and boom, it's <i>News at Noon</i>.

-Can we go soon?
-Not yet.

Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia
are gonna see whose is bigger.

Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.

Gloria, this is my life partner, Lois.

I'm his wife.

His "wife." Yes.

Peter tells me
you don't have a career of your own.

No.

Life outside my kitchen
is so bright and scary.

I'm just here because
you caught me between pregnancies.

I'm sorry you're so hostile
toward someone who's fighting...

...so a woman like you
can become more than just a housewife.

Oh, just a housewife?

Look, I'm all for equality...

...but if you ask me,
feminism is about choice.

I choose to be a wife and mother.

And now I'm choosing
to end this conversation.

No wonder your husband
didn't respect women.

Excuse me?

I can't imagine how screwed up
your kids must be.

You bitch!

Ten banana-cream pies!

Holy crap! This is hot!

Lois, we gotta go!

That was wonderful.

Who said that?

Oh, hi, Lois.
I'm starving. How about a sandwich?

Glad to have you back, Peter.

Lois, less talkie, more fetchie.

LOIS: I'm just gonna assume
that's Chinese for "I love you."

[Rock music playing]

You talk to Matt Lauer lately?

Played 18 holes with him on Saturday.

Told him he was soft

PETER: Are you crazy?

Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed
a <i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i> yet.

You're gonna miss this one, young man.

His report card came today.

<i>No more TV until your grades improve.</i>

Now get upstairs and study.

Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

After I get a little bit of courage
from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels.

Mrs. Daniels?

Is Jack in?

What?

Oh, my God! When?

Oh, I am so sorry.

Poor old Jack.

He was a wise man, but he just loved
playing with that wheat thresher.

Always playing with that wheat thresher!

Honey, hold still and let me bathe you.
You're filthy.

I'm filthy?

You're the filthy one.
What do you say to that?

How dare you!

[Sighs]

Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.

Take a good look, fat man.

And take pictures so I'll have something
to bring to court, you filthy pervert.

Hey, Lois, give Chris a break.
I mean, no TV?

He failed a class,
it's not like he felt up his cousin...

...in the garage
that Thanksgiving when I was 19.

I want you to help Chris.

Kids do better when parents
take an interest in their schoolwork.

I saw that on a two-part report on
<i>Dateline Tuesday</i> and <i>Dateline Gatilsday</i>.

What the hell is Gatilsday?

NBC invented a new day
so they could add another <i>Dateline</i>.

But the Gumbel show is sacred to us.

Bryant and Greg have
the kind of father-son relationship...

...I want me and Chris to have someday.

Peter, Bryant and Greg Gumbel
are brothers.

Nice. Just because they're black,
we can't learn anything from them?

If Chris gets his homework done,
you can watch it together next week.

Now come on. Help me get
the house ready for my mother.

She's coming to visit for
exactly one week.

Bye, Mom.

Sheesh. What a week that was.

Okay, come on, let's watch the Gumbels.

Peter, I thought we agreed,
no TV until his homework is done.

-Mom, I'll do it after--
-Chris finished his homework.

In fact, I've been helping him study
every night this week.

Really?

Well, that's great.
Enjoy your show, boys.

You bet we will.

Tonight, Katie Couric guest stars
as a very perky crack whore.

Dad, when you said, "Chris finished his
homework," were you talking about me?

Because if you were,
I think you just lied to mom.

Chris, everything I say is a lie,
except that and that.

And that. And that. And that. And that.

And that.

<i>This is an</i> Action News 5<i> News Break.</i>

<i>-I'm Tom Tucker.</i>
<i>-And I'm Diane Simmons.</i>

<i>Tom has dared me to do the news topless.</i>

<i>I've got the goods, </i>
<i>but have I got the guts?</i>

<i>Find out at 11:00.</i>

<i>If you're waiting for</i> Gumbel 2 Gumbel<i>,</i>
<i>you're out of luck.</i>

<i>That show has been canceled.</i>

<i>The full story, and maybe Diane's boobs,</i>
<i>tonight at 11:00.</i>

-I can't believe this!
-I feel sick.

Only one thing to do.

We gotta save <i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i>,
and were gonna do it <i>Griffin 2 Griffin</i>.

-Let's roll!
-I'm with ya, Dad.

What do we do, write a letter?

I tried that once.
It got me in a lot of trouble.

"If you don't put <i>Coach</i> back on the air,
I'll be really upset.

"The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson
will be missed a lot.

"Signed, Peter Griffin."

LOIS: Come help me with the groceries.

Okay, honey.

[Ominous instrumental music]

[Doorbell rings]

Craig T. Nelson!

-Are you Peter Griffin?
-Yeah.

Make it quick.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Okay, we're gonna get our show
back on the air...

...and were not gonna be intimidated
by any slick executive types.

Look at Mr. Suave.

Wait. You can't go in there.

Just watch me!

I mean, you can't go in there,
because that door leads nowhere.

Use the door next to it.

All right, Callaghan, me and my son
want you to uncancel <i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i>.

We only air the show. We have
nothing to do with it being canceled.

I have all the episodes on tape
if you want to borrow them.

Okay, you want to play rough?

Until you bring the Gumbels back,
I am going on a hunger strike.

How about that, Callaghan?

Can you live with that on your conscience?

You gonna eat that stapler?

-You can't eat a stapler--
-Wanna split it?

Sorry. Me and my damn appetite!

It's not the first time it
brought me trouble.

[Chip crunches]

[Exciting music plays on TV]

<i>And in gridiron news,</i>
<i>little Johnny Gobraun...</i>

<i>...a terminally ill 8-year-old</i>
<i>who dreamed of playing quarterback...</i>

<i>...for New England got his wish today</i>
<i>thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Gobraun takes the snap</i>
<i>and fades back to pass.</i>

<i>Here comes the rush. Oh, he's sacked!</i>

[Playful instrumental music]

[Laughing]

<i>Looks like little Johnny</i>
<i>should've wished for some blocking.</i>

Chris, I just thought of a way
to get the Gumbels back on the air.

All right, Dad!

PETER: All we gotta do is tell
a little white lie. Just go with it.

Is this the Grant-a-Dream foundation?

-My son Chris is dying!
-Holy crap, no! Oh, my God!

That was the lie.

Oh, you sly boots.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Are you sure this will work?

Chris, this is just another one
of your crazy schemes.

This whole thing was your idea!

You'll find out.

Dad, you're not making any sense!

You just leave that to me.

HARRIS: Ah, yes. Here we go.

Chris Griffin.

Your dying wish is denied.

Thank you.

Wait a minute.
My son only has a short time to live.

All he wants is his favorite show
back on TV. How can you say no?

Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks
their dying child is special.

But these days, people who donate money
to our foundation...

...demand a little more bang
for their buck.

We need sick kids we can package.

Like that one we put
on <i>Hollywood Squares</i>.

I'll take the dying boy to block.

Jeremy, is there anything lower
than absolute zero?

Yeah. My white-cell count.

[Audience laughing]

I'm telling you, Chris is dying
ten times worse than those other kids.

He's got a very rare disease called
tumor-syphilis-itis-osis.

Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?

What are the symptoms? Take a look!

<i>He's growing nipples all over his body!</i>

-They look like pepperonis.
-Who do you think you are?

My son happens to be very sensitive
about his extra nipples.

See, look. They're coming right off.

Nipples shouldn't just come off like that.

Why, that's the sickest boy
I've ever seen!

Get me the president of television!

[Spectacular instrumental music]

How about this?

A single white girl in the city
working at a magazine!

MAN 1: Yeah, that's good.
MAN 2: Yeah.

Do you guys hear yourselves?

This is the same old crap
over and over again.

We need to take a chance.
Try something different. Something fresh.

Excuse me.

-No calls!
-It's about a dying boy.

Hello? What's he got?

Sounds sexy.

Get me exclusive rights to his death
and you got a deal.

Congratulations,
<i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i> is back on the air!

All right, Dad!

I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

Are you kidding? I may see you again.

I've two more kids,
and I've always wanted to see...

...new episodes of <i>Star Trek</i>.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Stewie, it's bath time.
You're filthy again.

I'll show you filthy!

Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty,
foul little boy!

I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo!

<i>I say, Mother, you have your work cut out</i>
<i>for you now, don't you?</i>

Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.

Where do you think you're going?
I've defiled myself.

I need to be cleaned!

There you go, kiddo. All clean.

Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic!

Bloody hell, I'm a woman!

Take out your pencils and start your test.

Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test,
but I got a good reason.

I'm dying.

That's the lamest excuse I've heard since
Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap.

Take that hat off in my classroom!

But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying.

I have a certificate to prove it.

My God! Tumor-syphilis-itis-osis!
And he still comes into school!

You're excused from the test,
you brave, brave boy.

You can learn something
from this fine young....

Damn it, Steinberg! Take that hat off!

MEG: Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called!

[Crying] She heard that Chris is dying!

[Laughing]

Your brother's okay.

That was just a little white lie
we came up with to save a TV show.

So he's not going to die?

No.

[Laughing]

Boy, your face was priceless
when you thought he was.

[Pretending to cry]

You're a monster.

Chris was in on the whole thing.

Anyway, it's over and done with.

[Guitar playing folk music]

What the hell is that?

SINGERS: "Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog

"Chris Griffin, you're so brave

"There's a smile on your face
and a bounce in your step

"as they dig your grave

"as they dig your grave"

LOIS: Do I hear singing?
PETER: No! No singing.

Just us watching another
hilarious episode of <i>Good Times</i>.

The sitcom that's funnier
when you play it really loud.

<i>Maxine is the lady who's </i>
<i>feeling all right...</i>

<i>...thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!</i>

[Audience laughing on TV]

<i>Junior, where you been?</i>

<i>Dinner was three hours ago!</i>

<i>Oh, forget him, James.</i>

<i>-He's an idiot!</i>
<i>-Mama, what's wrong with you?</i>

<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

<i>My name is Florida!</i>

<i>Florida! That's the name of a state!</i>

<i>Why is my name Florida?</i>

[Crying] <i>Oh, Lord!</i>

<i>Dynomite!</i>

That is singing.

Peter, there's a candlelight vigil
on our front lawn.

Lois, that's ridiculous.
There's nobody out there.

You must be seeing things.

LOIS: Peter, why are these people here?

CHRIS: [Singing] "As they dig my grave,
as they dig my grave"

Hey, Dad, they're singing a song about me!

Hi, Mom.

[Doorbell rings]

Hello, Mr. Griffin.

We just came by to see if your son's
taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.

No. Everything's fine.
Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.

Mr. Griffin, the foundation
held up its end of the bargain...

...and got that crappy Gumbel show
back on the air!

-You owe us a body!
-What?

Excuse me for a minute.

You pretended Chris was dying
to save a TV show?

You're a monster!

Thank you.

You tell that man the truth!

Just out of curiosity....

-Shoot.
-What happens if he's not really dying?

You go to jail
for defrauding a charitable organization.

That's interesting.

Will you excuse us?

You're right!
There's only one way out of this!

Chris is all better! I cured him!

You cured him?

That's right. I have divine powers!

Okay. Safe drive.

What do you have to say to that?

I'm not going to jail,
Chris doesn't have to die...

...and best of all,
<i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i> is back on the air.

You're a great role model.

What kind of man devalues
the life of his child for a TV show?

Anyone who wouldn't pretend
their own son is dying...

...to get the Gumbels back
on TV is a racist.

There, I said it.

[Cheery instrumental music]

WOMAN 1: It's him! It's Peter Griffin!
The miracle healer of Quahog!

Heal me, O great one!

You see what your lies have done?
They think you're some kind of healer.

I'll handle it.

I read a book about this
sort of thing once.

Are you sure it was a book?

Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

Oh, yeah.

These poor, deluded people
think you have divine powers.

Praise Peter!

-We are your servants.
-It's a miracle!

What would you have us do,
O great healer of Quahog?

There's really no need to do anything.
Paint my house.

It's bad enough to lie to your family...

...but how can you let these people
think you're a healer?

This is pure exploitation.

No, it's not.

Those films my cousin Rufus used to do
were pure exploitation.

ANNOUNCER: <i>From the cats</i>
<i>who brought you</i> Caddyblack<i>,</i> Blackdraft<i>...</i>

Damn!

Damn! Brother done kissed his mama!

[Playing funk music]

ANNOUNCER: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

Get me Isaac Hayes.

Isaac, you know that new sound
you been looking for?

Well, listen to this!

Come on, Lois.
Stop being such a stick in the mud.

I'm giving these saps hope.

And I'm getting the house
painted for free.

It's win-freakin'-win, baby.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Hey, flathead, chop-chop.

[Exclaiming]

[Sighing]

Hey, great job on the lawn.

Now do it again,
and this time leave it a little longer.

CHRIS: Hey, Dad. Hurry up.
You're missing <i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i>.

They caught the guy,
and now they're interviewing him.

Purse snatching, society's fault,
or one man's cry for help?

What are you talking about?
I wanted her freakin' money.

[Bryant grunting]

What the hell's wrong with him?

[Bryant grunting]

Some other time, Chris.
Now, where's my shoes?

[Sighing]

These people are worshipping you.

Don't you think there's someone
who might resent that?

A being who's all-knowing
and all-powerful?

Someone's got a pretty high
opinion of herself.

Not me, Peter. God. The real God.

What's the big deal?

So I told a little fib,
and now people think I'm God.

When did God ever say
He didn't want someone else...

...being worshipped like Him?

It's one of the Ten Commandments.

Come on. Those were written,
like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!

[Lois screams]

PETER: Okay, let's stay calm.

<i>Lois, if you're scared, I'll hold you </i>
<i>until the lights are on again.</i>

CHRIS: Dad, it's me.
PETER: Go to your room.

That's the last of them.

I still don't know how every light bulb
could go out at the same time.

Oh, my God.

Yes?

That's not funny.

Those fanatics are building
a golden idol of you on our lawn.

I look like a freakin' Emmy.

Hint-hint.

Damn it to hell!

This is embarrassing.
I seem to have fleas.

That's never happened before.

CHRIS: Morning.

PETER: Chris, puberty hit you
like a ton of bricks.

What do you mean?

Don't you see what's happening?

Of course I do, Lois.

Our fresh-faced little boy
is becoming a pock-marked...

...hideously disfigured man.
Sunrise. Sunset.

No. The light bulbs last night,
my fleas, Chris' pimples.

<i>They're just like darkness,</i>
<i>gadflies, and boils.</i>

Three of the plagues God visited upon
Egypt in the Old Testament.

Come on, there's a logical explanation
for all those things.

There was a power surge,
you don't bathe...

...and Chris has had acne problems
since the fourth grade.

The kids were all calling him Crisco
and Pizza Face...

...and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry.
Remember, Chris?

Now I do.

[Crying]

[Meg screams]

Meg, what's wrong?

I was giving Stewie a bath, and....

Trust me, Meg, at his age,
it's strictly involuntary.

No! The water,
it turned all red and goopy, like blood!

Blood?

How positively delightful.
It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!

My baby!

Get out there
and tell those people the truth.

Make them stop worshipping you
before it starts hailing in my house!

There's gotta be an
explanation for all this!

You want an explanation? God is pissed!

Let's get out of here!

[Eerie instrumental music]

[Sinister instrumental music]

Stop it! Stop worshipping me!

I'm just a big fake...

...like the moon landing
and Marky Mark's hog in <i>Boogie Nights</i>...

...and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman!

I don't mean
that completely untrue gay rumor.

They're just both really phony,
just like me.

I'm sorry, okay? Now make it stop.

[All screaming]

This is the final plague!

Good, it's starting to get really old.

The final plague is
the death of the first-born son.

-No! Stewie!
-The first-born son.

-Meg.
-Your wife.

Chris!

Oh, my God. Are you okay?

Hey, Dad, I can see a white light
at the end of a long tunnel.

Oh, that's great, son.
Light is good. Run towards the light.

No! Run away from the light!

Hey, Dad, do you think they got
<i>Gumbel 2 Gumbel</i> in heaven?

Yes, son, and there's no reruns
or commercials...

...and Kirstie Alley is still hot...

...and all those scrambled channels
come in clear as a bell.

Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.

We think the Griffin guy gets it.

Good, good.
Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.

PEGGY: <i>Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.</i>

She's new.

[Awe-inspiring instrumental music]

I think the plagues went away.

-So did the white light.
-Oh, honey!

Thank God! I mean, thank me!

Kidding! It was a joke!

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

STEWIE: I say, Rupert, these crumpets
you've prepared look positively divine!

Excellent texture, provocative support.
Try another, you say?

Aren't I the wicked one?

Stewie, I've told you before,
don't eat dirt. It's disgusting.

And I suppose the bilious curds
you force-fed me from your teat...

...were perfectly fine then?

-Glen, would you mind holding Stewie?
-Said and done.

Hey there, spud with the mud.

Good Lord! Do you bathe in Aqua Velva?

CLEVELAND: Hi. You've got our votes.
LOIS: Thank you, Cleveland.

Someone has to run against
that awful Betsy Lebeau.

She actually opposes background checks
for new teachers!

God knows who she might hire.

TEACHER: So the square of a hypotenuse,
which we will label C...

...making the sides opposite both of the
acute angles A and B...

...always equals the sum
of the squares of the other sides.

Any questions?

It's just something I have to do.

Even if winning means spending time
out of the house and away from my family.

Out of the house? Why, I'd be free
from your oppressive gynocracy!

You should be out giving speeches,
shaking hands, kissing babies!

Not this baby!

Lois, you seen my pants?

[Audience laughing]

Boy, I'll be glad when
that studio audience

moves out of the neighborhood.

PETER: Lois, what's with the sign?

Peter, we discussed this.
I'm running for School Board.

You never listen to me.

Yeah, I remember.
Hey, Cleveland. Hey, Quagmire.

Lois, what's with the sign?

You guys? Chris' principal just called.
Chris is in trouble.

That's it! I'm calling the cops!

PRINCIPAL: Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

I caught your son peeking
into the girls' locker room.

Oh, Chris!

So what's the big deal? It's normal
for a boy his age to be curious.

I remember when I first noticed
girls starting to develop.

PRESENTER: <i>Welcome to</i>
<i>eighth grade orientation, everyone.</i>

<i>Locker assignments will be handed out</i>
<i>in the library after lunch period.</i>

<i>If you have any questions</i>
<i>about your locker assignments...</i>

<i>...or your class schedule, please come...</i>

LOIS: We'll continue this discussion
tonight, young man.

A woman is not an object.

Your mother is right, son.
Listen to what it says.

-Peter!
-I didn't say that.

Lee Majors did.

What? Women are things.

Oh, my God! It's Mr. Fargas!

<i>He was my favorite teacher!</i>

Take out your scalpels, kids.
We're going to dissect a clown!

[Students gasping]

[Scalpel cutting tissue]

No wonder this clown died.
His lungs are filled with candy!

Why don't you go say hello?

I'm gonna drop off some campaign flyers
in the teachers' lounge.

PETER: Hey, Mr. Fargas!
It's me, Peter Griffin!

Griffin. Sorry, not on the list.

Don't you remember me?
I was your favorite student.

You taught me everything. Math, science.

You even taught me how
to dance just in time for the prom.

Peter, you start like this.

Like this?

Yeah. Now add a little turn
and do a buck and wing.

Come on, Mr. Fargas,
do the whole darn thing.

Jeez, Mr. Fargas, what happened to you?
Somebody give you a fun-ectomy?

No, they gave me these
by order of the School Board.

They said it evens me out.

FARGAS: Sorry to fly off the handle.
PETER: Here, let me see that.

That's what I think about you taking
chill pills from the Man.

Look, the old Farg made learning fun.
He's what these kids need.

Now get back in that classroom
and teach your "Fargin"' ass off.

[Rhythmic thumping noises]

CHRIS: Don't come in! Just a minute!

Chris, your mother wants me and you
to have a talk.

CHRIS: No!

I was going for a new record.

Now, son, as men, it's only natural for us
to look at naked girls.

Every man does it, even Mr. Rogers.

Hello, neighbor.

[Groaning]

But peeping can be dangerous,
so I brought you this.

-Wow! Miss December!
-Yep, the old skin bin.

Now you can look at naked girls
all you want and it's perfectly legal!

Wow, check out the rack on... Mom?

Give me that!

Just a little present your mom gave me
for our anniversary.

All right, Dad!

CHRIS: Hey, Dad. Thanks.

[Rhythmic thumping noises resume]

MEG: Mom, if you get elected
can you fix it so I win Homecoming Queen?

Honey, of course I can.

But winning without honor
isn't really winning at all.

-Isn't that right, Milli?
-No, it's just as good.

"Baby"

What's the use? You're right.

Cease this prattling!

This campaign literature must be posted
today to get you into office...

...and out of my life,
you festering strumpet!

PETER: Hey, you guys.
Lois, you running for School Board?

MEG: Look, Chris' school is on TV.

<i>The egg drop, an annual tradition</i>
<i>for junior-high-school science students.</i>

<i>Today at Buddy Cianci Junior High,</i>
<i>an egg drop conducted by teacher...</i>

Oh, my God. He's gonna wipe

No, Lois. The janitor'll do that.

<i>I'm getting word</i>
<i>that the Quahog School Board...</i>

<i>...has just dismissed Randall Fargas,</i>

-What? They can't do that!

Great. You can get Mr. Fargas

I'm sorry! But I do have a mind of my own!

And I happen to agree

I know you're a feminist

I'm not giving that lunatic his job back

I'm gonna stop you the only way I can...

...by killing you...

...in the race for School Board President!

Peter, are you sure running against Lois
is such a good idea?

You know how competitive you get.

I can be just as non-competitive
as anybody.

Matter of fact,
I'm the most non-competitive. So I win.

Come on, you can't even handle
losing at checkers.

King me.

PETER: Look over there!
BRIAN: What?

Peter, since when do you care
about the School Board?

Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap...

...and if running against you
is the only way to get him back...

...then I am gonna run
like the Six Million Dollar Man.

AGENT: We can rebuild him.

We have the technology,
but I don't want to spend a lot of money.

[Adventurous instrumental music]

Fine, if you feel that strongly,
then by all means run.

But I'm warning you, I'm not gonna
pull any punches on the issues.

PETER: I'm Lois.

<i>Look at me with my big ideas</i>
<i>and my pointy nose.</i>

[Childish babbling]

This'll be even easier
than running unopposed.

Is that so?

Not only am I gonna win this election...

...I am gonna eat your nose.

[Amused sigh]

See you on the campaign trail.

STEWIE: Oh, my. Look where my hand is.

<i>I say, look where my hand is!</i>

<i>It's in a very naughty place.</i>

Does that not disgust you?

You're talking to a guy
who uses his tongue for toilet paper.

Now look here, you loathsome cur!

The matron of prattle
has left me in your ward.

You should be striving to thwart
my noisome misdeeds.

STEWIE: Look at me.
I'm writing profanity on the wall!

BRIAN: Water-soluble.

Don't just sit there! I have misbehaved!
I've been a bawdy little monkey!

If that vile woman were here,
she'd prove a worthy adversary.

BRIAN: What's the matter?
Miss your mommy?

Yes, that's it. That's quite good.
Yes, I miss my mommy.

-I also miss colic and rectal thermometry.
-Whatever you say, Mama's boy.

Blast!

Hey, Chris! Hector found two rocks outside
that look like boobs! You in?

Who needs rocks when you got these?

-Check it out!
-Wow!

PETER: <i>Vote for Peter Griffin!</i>

Look at all of Lois' signs!

Talk about seeing red.

Peter, I'm concerned that your candidacy
may have become a lost cause.

The debate is tonight and you don't seem
to have any supporters.

Don't sweat it, the Griffin men
have always been winners...

...dating back to my diminutive
great-grandfather, Juarez Griffin.

[Raucous cheering]

Fellas, the debate's in the bag,
all right?

If there's one thing I can do,
it's play to a crowd.

TOM: <i>Lois Griffin, daughter of shipping</i>

No! You're doing it wrong!

When you read <i>Faust</i>...

BRIAN: Is that the way Mommy reads it?
STEWIE: I do not miss that ogress.

STEWIE: She can burn in hell

BRIAN: Sure she can.

Damn!

LOIS: <i>Just a minute. Listen to me, please!</i>

<i>This election </i>

<i>So ask yourself...</i>

<i>...what kind of future </i>

<i>This is a man who believes the plural</i>

<i>I'm the right person for the job.</i>
<i>Vote for me.</i>

CROWD: Lois!

<i>Wait, I'm not done.</i>

<i>Peter! Come on! Stop.</i>
<i>Shut up! You guys shut up!</i>

LOIS: I didn't enjoy humiliating Peter,
but what choice did I have?

That's okay, Lois. I enjoyed it.

As soon as the polls close,
we can put all this ugliness behind us.

PETER: <i>Lois Griffin is a slut.</i>
LOIS: What?

<i>Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.</i>

<i>I grew up in this town.</i>

<i>Quahog needs a moral,</i>
<i>upstanding school board president.</i>

<i>Someone we can trust.</i>

<i>A lot of nasty things</i>
<i>have been said during this campaign.</i>

<i>But pictures are better than words...</i>

<i>...because some words are</i>
<i>big and hard to understand.</i>

<i>But here's something</i>
<i>everyone can understand!</i>

<i>Do you really want your children's future</i>
<i>in the hands of this?</i>

<i>I know I don't.</i>

CLEVELAND: <i>Paid for by the Peter Griffin</i>
<i>for School Board President Committee.</i>

<i>Sorry, Lois.</i>

"Lewd," "obscene,"
and "a little blurry"...

...just some of the words used to describe
Lois Griffin's prurient pic.

-Good morning. I'm Tom Tucker.
-And I'm Diane Simmons.

Yesterday, voters
overwhelmingly declared...

...that Lois Griffin
is not the kind of person

they want running their schools.

Her husband, Peter Griffin,
was elected by a landslide.

<i>What a great day! I just want to say...</i>

<i>I am so freaking wasted!</i>

[All gasping]

STEWIE: [Thinking] <i>Splendid.</i>
<i>How delightful to have mother back.</i>

BRIAN: <i>I heard that.</i>
STEWIE: <i>Damn!</i>

Don't feel bad, Mom.
All my friends think you're hot!

They can't believe I came out of you!

Lois, I got a joke for you.

How many losers
does it take to make me breakfast?

Just one! You!

I'm just kidding. French toast, please.

Don't even talk to me, Peter.
You humiliated your own wife!

And for what? To get that crazy
Mr. Fargas back in the classroom?

Who?

Peter, I cared about our schools.

All you cared about
was some stupid competition.

Winning was only half the battle.

If you blow this chance to do something
good for our kids...

...you'll be the biggest loser!

Oh, yeah?

Peter Griffin is no loser!
When I'm through with our schools...

...our students'll be so smart
they'll be able to program their VCRs...

...without spilling piping hot gravy
all over myself.

This is Trisha Takanawa, here
with School Board President Peter Griffin.

Mr. President, you've accomplished
so much in just a few short weeks.

Thanks, Connie. I'm very excited about
our progress in revamping our schools.

For starters,
we're making sex education more fun.

"Vagina junction, what's your function?

"Taking in sperm and spitting out babies"

And our schools are the safest around...

PETER: ...thanks to the hall monitor XL-K.
MONITOR: <i>Halt! Present hall pass!</i>

STUDENT: Right here.
MONITOR: <i>Second request. Present pass.</i>

STUDENT: But... Right here!
MONITOR: <i>Security breach!</i>

I guess Little Miss Free Spirit will think
twice before roaming the halls.

PETER: I've restocked
our school library...

...with books of some
of our greatest movies and TV shows.

Because if we don't teach our kids
to read,

how will they ever know what's on?

Mr. Griffin, this is impressive.

I've never seen kids
so enthusiastic about reading.

Thank you. That's what you voted for.

Hey, son, show the folks at home
what you got there.

Good Lord! That's a dirty magazine!

That's mine... Shaft.

There might be a mineshaft
under this library.

All these kids are looking at pornography!

TRISHA: What kind of pervert
gave you kids this filth?

Chris Griffin. He got it from his dad.

CLEVELAND: There's quite a crowd outside.

I haven't witnessed pandemonium like this
since Ridiculous Day down at the deli...

...when prices were so low
they were ridiculous.

You said it, pally.
That's why I brought in the big guns.

Say "how do" to the Ragin' Cajun,
Mr. James Carville.

Oh, God. Oh, jeez!

Did somebody open
the Ark of the Covenant?

Now see, Peter, what you gotta do is
you gotta declare war! War!

Your only chance
of surviving this scandal...

...is to claim that Lois
gave your boy the pornography.

And he's right.
Pin it on the old ball and chain.

I can't do that.
Lois is mad enough at me without...

I'm sorry. I can't look at you!

I mean, I can handle ugly.
But this is like circus ugly.

Lois, I need your help. You gotta come
to my press conference this afternoon.

Lois, I could lose my presidency!

Too bad! I've already lost more than that!

Not my rainbow socks
with the individual toes?

No. I've lost my respect for you.

Because I need those socks.

We now take you live
to Peter Griffin Junior High...

...where embattled School Board President

Peter Griffin is fighting
for his political life.

CROWD: Throw the bum out!

Mom, what are you doing here?
I thought you were mad at Dad.

I am.
I just came to see him twist in the wind.

Are you and Dad gonna get a divorce?

Oh, honey. Maybe.

PETER: <i>"A parent giving porno to their kid</i>
<i>is a terrible thing...</i>

<i>"...but I'm here to tell you</i>
<i>that I'm innocent!"</i>

CROWD: Oh, yeah. Right.

<i>"I didn't give those magazines to my son.</i>

<i>"My wife, Lois..."</i>

PETER: Lois!

<i>Crap. Look, my wife, Lois, is the most</i>
<i>important person in the world to me.</i>

<i>I gave my son those magazines.</i>

<i>Even worse, I turned a beautiful gift from</i>
<i>Lois into something cheap and tawdry.</i>

<i>I just wanted to win so bad.</i>

<i>Now I know that some things</i>
<i>are more important than winning.</i>

<i>Lois, I only hope you can find it</i>
<i>in your heart to forgive me.</i>

LOIS: Oh, Peter!

So you're saying you're not only
a bad father, but a bad husband, too?

Have you the moral authority to lead?

Yes. No. And, screw it. I resign.

DIANE: <i>There's the President,</i>
<i>First Lady Lois.</i>

TOM: <i>Now boarding the helicopter.</i>

And so ends a dark and shameful chapter
in the history of Quahog, Rhode Island.

One which leaves this reporter asking:

How much moral bankruptcy and
perversion must we, the people, endure?

Next up, stay tuned for our
special investigative report...

chew on your own ass as usual?

[Clears throat]

I'm sure you have
something to say to that.

Oh, God. Sorry.

Can you give me the line again?
Not the whole line. Just the end.

You're sleeping with which producer?

God! As soon as my movie deal kicks in,

PETER: Not yet.
I don't want to ruin my birthday surprise.

Then at least let me drive!

Lois, you know it's illegal
for women to drive.

[Cat screeches]

A woman driving. That's adorable.

Peter, I don't think....

Peter, please! I'm begging you!
Stop the car!

LOIS: We're here! Thank God.

Who are you?

I'm the guy whose car
you just slammed into!

Lois, you invited everyone!

Excuse me. Excuse me.

My friend is differently abled.
May he go ahead of you?

Of course.

Frontsies, backsies, backsies, backsies.

Well, hello.

You must be this beautiful
to ride the Quagmire.

BONNIE: Careful, Joe!
JOE: Kiss off! Yeah!

Your father.

Sometimes I don't think he'll be happy

You've caused nothing but trouble

Perhaps we should just continue the party
at some other type of location.

No. Wait. I know this guy.
We went to high school together.

We did?

He was a loser then,
and he's a loser now.

We used to kid this guy all the time.

[Crickets chirping]

Look at this, Lois. See? Right here.
I was voted Most Likely To Succeed.

Peter, that's not you.

That's not even a yearbook.
That's a <i>People</i> magazine.

I wondered why they had
the wrong picture and name.

Can't we just enjoy
the rest of your birthday?

Look. It says,
"Happy Birthday, Daddy. Love, Stewie."

Let me see that! Did you forge my name?

Is that backward "S" supposed to be cute?

I'm going to crap double for you tonight!

Face it, Lois. I'm a nobody.

Why can't I be famous like Bob?
Or my cousin, Kathy Griffin?

Okay. Then I got on <i>Suddenly Susan</i>.
And that was really cool.

And I still do standup.
And people laugh and give me money.

Isn't this great catching up?
Anyway, I was in college--

She's still talking.

I don't get it. I poured it in her drink.

KATHY: His name was Steve Rock.
It was cool.

<i>He was my first black man.</i>

Oh, boy.

KATHY: But I went everywhere!

Don't be depressed, Dad.
Here. I made you a present.

My God! It's good. Really good.

It's partly an expression
of my teenage angst.

But mostly it's a moo cow!

It's lovely, Chris.

Go ahead, Peter. Make a wish.

I'd sell my soul to be famous!

DEVIL: I got a live one! Peter Griffin.
MINION: Sorry, Chief.

Seems he already sold his soul
in 1976 for Bee Gees tickets.

And again in 1981 for half a Mallomar.

Aw, heck!
Where's a lawyer when I need one?

CHRIS: Don't forget this!
Maybe you could hang it in your office.

PETER: Son, I'll put it someplace
where everyone can see it.

Excuse me. I'll give you $1,000
for what you have in the back there.

$1,000 for a bumper sticker?

No, no. I mean that painting.

I must have it for my gallery in Soho.
I'll give you $5,000. What do you say?

I say...

...I love you, you freakin' son of mine!

I got $5,000 for that painting
you made me!

But I painted that just for you.

Don't feel bad, Chris.
I didn't even want it.

Now we all get a trip to New York...

...because Mr. Monatti
thinks you could be a famous artist.

Monatti? Antonio Monatti?

You've heard of this man?

He's only the biggest art dealer
in New York.

I met him when I was hanging out
with Andy Warhol in the '70s.

[1970s art rock instrumental music]

Peter, we are not going to New York!

Lois, our son has been blessed
with a great gift.

And I'm gonna do everything I can to
nurture that talent and help him succeed.

Then I'm gonna use him to live out
my frustrated hopes and dreams.

Because that's good parenting.
Right, Bing Crosby?

That's right.
And if your kids give you any lip...

...you can beat them
with a sack of Valencia oranges.

It won't leave a bruise
and they'll let 'em know who's boss.

There's no doubt about it.

-But that doesn't sound right.
-Are you giving me lip, boy?

Because I'll take this belt off
and put the smack-down on you!

-Is that what you want? How's that?
-Knock it off!

Get away from me, you dead crooner!

They even have Indian food here.

For crying out loud!
Somebody throw a pie!

Screw the theater.

Mr. Monatti invited us to a party
so Chris can meet a bunch of artists.

It's at the Museum of Modern Art.

I hope that's not some kind of museum!

[Jazz music playing in museum]

Mapplethorpe?
I thought he just did photography.

No. Early on, he did caricatures.

Okay, Tim.

Reggie Jackson.

I'm gonna draw him pooping
on your chest. What number is he?

Welcome. Chris, there are a number
of artists here I would like you to meet.

Let's talk turkey, Monatti.

Look, we've been here all day.
Chris isn't a famous artist yet!

Creating art takes a lot
of training and technique.

All the great artists
I knew took classes.

Even Walt Disney?

Do I have to?

You want to be a star, don't you?
Then take it off!

Yeah, that's nice.

Art school?

We don't have time.
Chris, give me your ear!

Peter!

Mr. Griffin, please.

I invited you so that Chris could make
an impression on the art community.

Why don't you folks do some sightseeing?

If you leave Chris in my hands...

...the name Griffin
will be as well known as Kandinsky.

-Who?
-Rembrandt?

-Who?
-Da Vinci?

-Who?
-Bazooka Joe?

There you go.

LOIS: The United Nations.

I wish Chris could see this.

Isn't it inspiring how so many
different cultures can come together?

PETER: And use up all the towels
in the men's room!

Peter!

Sorry.

[Hand dryer blowing]

Man, these things
never get 'em completely dry.

Where's Stewie?

[Running footsteps]

Hidden missile silos
behind the Great Wall!

Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

Mr. Monatti, shouldn't I be painting now?

Trust me. Painting is the least important
thing about being a successful artist.

You need an image.

Let's take this Rhode Island lump of clay
and turn it into the toast of New York.

I love toast!

Cut it short and tint it green,
the color of money.

And boogers.

LOIS: I feel like
we've been walking in circles.

I don't know how you can
find anything in this city.

It's so confusing.

Well, I bet if Hillary Clinton becomes
senator, she'll straighten it out...

...even though she could
never straighten out Bill.

I love when you use topical humor.
It's just like watching <i>Murphy Brown</i>.

Hey, Murphy, blah-blah-blah...

...John Sununu.

Murphy, blah-blah-blah...

...Tipper Gore.

Hey, Murph,
you can't blah-blah-blah-blah...

...the Ayatollah.

Blah-blah, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
blah-blah.

Shouldn't my mom and dad
be here by now?

They called and said they'd rather
wander through Soho...

...looking for an address
that doesn't exist.

That's my dad.

-Well, maybe tomorrow we could--
-There's Kate Moss.

Where? I don't see her.

Are you <i>The Matrix</i>?

Kate, this is my newest discovery,
Christobel.

-My name's Chris.
-Not anymore.

Christobel will look better
in <i>Interview</i> magazine.

Nice to meet you. I love artists.

Oops. A crack in the floor!

Hey, Lois, give me a penny.

-You're not gonna throw it over the edge?
-No.

Yes.

Christobel, I've just scheduled
your first exhibit!

Wow! I can't wait to tell my dad.

Yes. I know how important
your success is to your father.

That's why he'll understand
that you can never see him again.

Yeah. Of course he will. Dad's very....

What?

Christobel, the art world
is a place of culture and breeding.

Your father is.... Oh, dear.
How can I say this without upsetting you?

Your dad is a pig!

[Joyful laughter]

So you see? It's up to you, son.

If you don't want to disappoint your dad,
you must keep him away.

There's my boy. Hey, come on.

Let's go over to Barneys
and fart in the suits.

All right, Dad, I....

I mean...

...I can't see you anymore.

What are you talking about?
You're my son.

Mr. Griffin, he's going to be a

great artist.
He now belongs to the public.

And apparently I'm dating Kate Moss.

Don't say anything bad about her,
because she might be here right now.

Wait a minute.
You can't just push me aside.

I made you! And I can destroy you!

Goddamn.
They must've put it in the wrong baby.

Bobby Williams,
I'd love to go out with you.

I can't believe Chris.

If I hadn't used his painting
to patch that window...

...he'd still be in that dump in Quahog.

That "dump" is our home.

Dump? So now
you're too good for us, too?

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for Chris, not you!

Are you so selfish you can't see that?

Yes, I am.

Peter, your son is using his talents
to pursue his dream.

I have no son! Except for Stewie...

...and Meg!

[Singing] "I had a dream

"It's all about you

"Meg Griffin

"Not much you can do

"Meg Griffin

"You can't dance

"You can't sing

"No, you pretty much can't do a thing

"Never fear, Daddy's here

"Honey, you're gonna make
our name famous

<i>"You'll be larger than life</i>

"I'll be proud you fell out of my wife

<i>"You'll be known, far and wide</i>

"Like that princess who died

<i>"I'm gonna make you famous</i>

<i>"Wait and see</i>

"Honey, I'm gonna do this for you

"But it's really for me"

Fine. If Chris doesn't need me,
I don't need him.

You're gonna love being famous, Meg.
And this is the town to do it in.

I don't know, Dad. What am I gonna do?

Everybody's good at something.

It's just a matter of finding
that one special hidden talent.

But promise me, when you make it big,

you'll let me take
advantage of all the....

MEG: I can't think of anything.
I guess I don't have any talent.

Come on. Think harder.
There's gotta be something you can do.

-That's amazing!
-Thanks.

I roomed with Scott Hamilton
at prep school.

Nothing happened.

No. I mean that bird just came to Meg
when she whistled.

No, those are just my bird calls.

Do it again!

Yeah?

Well, what did you want?

-You called me, right?
-No. I wasn't calling you.

This is funny to you? Yeah?

You know what a pain in the ass it is
to get across town this time of day?

Listen, mister,
we don't want any trouble here.

I don't fly, you know.
I take the subway like everybody else.

And people don't stare.

You make me puke, bitch.

Mr. Monatti, I don't feel like painting.
I want to see my dad.

Listen, Christobel.

I've sunk $5,000
turning you into a New York bohemian.

All you have to do is paint.
Now, get busy.

I have to go oil up and start squeezing
into my leather pants. Excuse me.

Jeez, Kate, what should I do?

I don't know.
You're the flavor of the month.

Oops. Window open.

[Crow cawing]

-I'm going over there!
-No.

-I'm gonna go over there and punch her!
-No.

This is humiliating.

Hey, it's show business, baby.
You gotta start somewhere.

No, I don't. I quit!

Now wait just a minute, young lady.
Don't you walk away from me!

Hey! Don't you start running!

Wait, Meg! Get off that bus.

Don't you go to La Guardia.

Meg, listen to me.
Don't you dare get on that plane.

Don't you shell out $5 for headphones
for <i>Magnolia</i>.

Okay, now I'm pissed.

-Well, thank God that's over.
-Yeah.

Hey, you want to go crap
on the Statue of Liberty?

I've lived here my whole life,
and I've never been there!

I've never been to
the Empire State Building.

Boy, we're a pair, aren't we?

Unbelievable. Let's go.

Chris!

-Hey, you guys made it!
-Of course.

We wouldn't miss your big day.

Wait a second.

I don't see any strippers
passing out free tacos!

Lois, you lied to me!

Is Dad mad at me?

He just doesn't understand.

I know artists have to
make sacrifices and....

My God! Are you Kate Moss?

Well, for someone with no breasts,
you've done very well for yourself.

Good for you.

Dad, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be

And I'm sorry I have no talent.

That's okay, kids.

So I don't have my name
on an amusement park.

And maybe I'll never be famous.

But I got three wonderful children
and a wife that loves me.

That's right.

I guess when it comes right down to it,
you're a pretty lucky....

[Vomiting]

My sentiments exactly!

Come on, Griffins. Let's go home.

Hey, watch where you're going!

This child is beautiful! I must have him!

You mean like Gina Gershon beautiful,
or beautiful beautiful?

BRIAN: This is heterosexual

I've been looking everywhere for a face

And I think I found it.

Well, Bob Funland may have
his name on a sign...

...but only a Griffin has this.

STEWIE: Yeah!

Workin' it. Make me want it.

Baby! I'm gonna sex you up, baby!

I'm going to sex you up so crazy!

You're loving this, aren't you?

No way!

[Startled scream]

For the love of Pete!

CHRIS: I'm good!

How fun.

And it's for a good cause.

All the money goes to the families

EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen,
the mayor of Quahog, Adam West!

[Applause]

Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

ADAM WEST: Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.

It was 360 years ago
that Quahog founder...

...Miles "Chatterbox" Musket set sail...

...for the new colony of Rhode Island.

MILES: You know what I'm gonna do
when we get to shore? First...

...I'm gonna have me a snack.
No! Shower!

Shower first, snack second.
But I hope I see Indians.

You think they'll have American cheese?

WEST: <i>Ever the free thinker...</i>

<i>...Miles was thrown overboard</i>
<i>for speaking his mind.</i>

<i>He was as good as dead.</i>
<i>But as legend has it...</i>

<i>...he was saved by a magic clam</i>
<i>who brought him to shore...</i>

<i>...and shared the vision </i>
<i>of a new colony...</i>

<i>...which would be called Quahog.</i>

CLAM: There are fields for tilling, woods
for timber and the bounty of the sea.

MILES: Look at all this sand!

Did you know there are beaches
with black sand? Did I pack my towel?

CLAM: Are you listening?
I'm trying to help you.

ADAM WEST: <i>And help he did.</i>
<i>Thanks to the clam's leadership...</i>

<i>...Quahog became a great</i>
<i>and prosperous settlement.</i>

<i>But relations between Miles</i>
<i>and the clam soon soured.</i>

MILES: I know he's an Indian.
But what kind of name is Squanto?

"Leslie" or something like that
would be nice.

Shut up!
God, keep it to yourself once in a while!

Here. Look what I'm doing. Watch this.

Look, see that? Yeah!

Now try it with me. Okay?

[Sniffing]

[Sighing]

ADAM WEST: <i>Things only got worse.</i>

<i>Before long, Miles began</i>
<i>to contemplate killing the clam.</i>

[Sinister instrumental music]

CLAM: I was awake
last night, Miles. I saw you.

I think it's time for me to go.

I'll send for my things.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

MILES: Wait! Don't go! I'm sorry!

[Loud crying]

ADAM WEST: Miles never spoke again.
But every year until his death...

...from a combination of tuberculosis
and a tomahawk to the head...

...he went to the shore on this day...

...in hopes that the magic clam
would return.

Today, we citizens of Quahog
continue this tradition.

What's that?

Something out at sea?

Clam-ho!

CLEVELAND: They're giving your cue.

Who the hell's idea was it
to make this suit out of foam rubber?

It's such an honor to play the magic clam.

LOIS: Aren't you proud of your dad?
MEG: Are you kidding?

God, this is worse than having
Ronald McDonald for a father.

LISA: Bye, Dad! Don't wait up!

Wait a minute, Lisa! Come back here.

-You're not going with that make-up.
-But Dad!

Upstairs!

You're a McDonald, not a whore!

[Panting]

I think I got a wave here!

[Crowd gasping]

So that's what Peter's penis looks like.

MEG: How could you
embarrass me like that?

Nobody better pull this
at my slumber party tonight!

Don't worry, honey.

You and your friends
will have a great time.

Yes. How delightful it will be.

A pubescent herd of gabby wretches
prattling on about boys...

...and music and jellybeans and stickers.

CHRIS: We better stop by the hospital
so I can get my cooties shot.

[Laughing]

LOIS: Shut up!

Just leave me and my friends
alone tonight, okay?

Will you relax?

None of us will do anything
to embarrass you, all right?

I gotta get gas.

Hey, any of you guys want a soda?
I'm gonna go inside and get a soda.

MEG: Mom!

Meg, you know your father
loves you very much.

Mr. Griffin?

Oh, my God!

Hey, look! It's Kevin from next door.

<i>I didn't know you worked here.</i>
<i>Hey, Kevin. Come here!</i>

Say hi to Meg. She's right in there.

Right there.

GIRL: Okay. I'd put Brad Pitt's face...

...on Brendan Fraser's body...

...with Ben Affleck's butt!

[Squeeling]

LOIS: My turn!
I'd take James Brolin's face...

...Mark Spitz's body,
and Milton Berle's legendary genitals.

What are you doing?

I love slumber parties!
Okay, truth or dare?

Who here has gone all the way?

You know, at my sleepovers,
we used to practice French kissing.

LOIS: Now everybody pair up!
CHRIS: All right, Mom!

Chris, get out of here right now!

CHRIS: I can't.
LOIS: Okay. Finish up and then come out.

Have you seen my fake beard?
Crap! I'm stuck in the stairs.

God, kill me now.

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Karen!

All right,
I'm gonna need you to boil some water.

And girls, I'm gonna need towels,
lots of them! Okay, let's go!

PETER: I'm sorry, Meg's friends.
Look, I'll make it up to you.

I'll get you Davy Jones
for your school dance.

Jeez, Lois! What is that? Acid?

You guys are ruining my life!

I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you must feel.

If you care about me,
you won't show your faces downstairs...

...for the rest of the night.

Then it's a good thing I have this.

PETER: "I am not a crook!"

[Laughing]

MEG: Look, I mean it! All of you.
Oh, God! Where's Stewie?

Beth, what do you think?
Does Mark find you attractive?

I don't know.

Have you asked him?

Not exactly.

All right, look.
Let's try some role-playing.

I'll be Mark.

And you ask me out to the box social
or whatever you children do these days.

LOIS: Peter, don't!
God, your hands are like ice!

<i>Just here. Give it to me.</i>

<i>That'll warm it up a little.</i>

<i>That's nice.</i>

[Peter moaning]

LOIS: Peter, wait till....
PETER: Shazam!

LOIS: Peter.

[Screaming]

Hey, what happened to your friends?

My family scared them away.

I just wish there was some way they could
understand how embarrassing they are.

DIANE:<i> Welcome back to</i> Diane!

DIANE: <i>Okay. So how do you feel?</i>

<i>To be honest with you, Diane,</i>
<i>I'm surprised.</i>

PETER: Man, this is a great show.

They drag these idiots up on stage
and then blindside them.

Like this one guy didn't know
he was actually two midgets.

Those poor, unsuspecting people.

Well, maybe some of them deserved it.

DIANE: Hello. And welcome to <i>Diane!</i>

Today's guest is tired of
being embarrassed by her family.

Meg, how did you get these tickets again?

Let's bring them up right now.

Whatever problems we have
can be settled in the privacy--

DIANE: The Griffin family!

Suckers.

[Cheering]

Uh-oh.

And we're back.

Griffins, do you have anything
to say to your daughter?

I can't believe you'd do this to us.

Maybe now I won't give you the antidote.

To what?

To the poison you just drank.

[Laughing]

MEG: See what I mean?
This is not normal!

STEWIE: You there, Bingo.

It seems the naughty baby
has made a messy-poo in his....

I say, what's this?

Volume!

Look, what's the big deal?

I mean,
we're just a regular American family.

We have family dinners,
and we go to church together--

And you even manage
to humiliate me there.

[Organ playing religious music]

-Is that really the blood of Christ?
-Yes.

Man, that guy must've been
wasted 24 hours a day.

We have a caller on the line. Go ahead.

STEWIE: <i>Yes. I say,</i>
<i>do you have Prince Albert in a can?</i>

[Laughing]

Quiet. Shut up.

You'd better let him out!

[Laughing]

BRIAN: That's hilarious.

Meg, you have two parents
who love you and....

What does that say under me?

Oh, go...yourself, Diane!

[Gasping]

She said a swear!

Peter, do you think there might be
any validity to what Meg is feeling?

Who are you calling Uncle Tom?

DIANE: What?

CHRIS: Okay, time out.

CHRIS: This kind of acrimony isn't
gonna resolve our differences.

Just shut up and throw a chair.

Okay!

[Cheering wildly]

PETER: Fire! City Hall is burning.

<i>Don't worry. I'll put it out.</i>

[Imitates fire engine siren]

[Laughs]

Great show out there.

If you want an autograph now...

...you either gotta give me a pen
or get me some snow.

I look at you and see a series.
We want to put cameras...

...in your house and follow the drama
that is your family.

Kind of like <i>The Real World</i>.

All right! Then everyone would
see me and my wacky antics.

[Screams]

[Laughs]

-So do we have a deal?
-Let's shake on it.

[Zipping]

Mom, are we on TV right now?

Yes, Chris.
Your father signed a contract.

And now we're gonna be on TV
for the next six months.

How could you do this?

You've turned my life into
the 24-Hour Loser Channel!

STEWIE: You, cameraman!

Make sure you use that
Cybill Shepherd filter!

If it makes her look human,
it should take six months off my face.

I find the toothpaste with the pump...

...is a little easier to get on the brush.

You might've noticed
my underwear has a hole in it.

You know,
I don't see any reason to throw it out.

The waist is still fine.

You know, see? It's still real stretchy.

MEG: Mom, you have to do something!

<i>Dad's on TV parading around in his</i>
<i>underwear like some gross European guy!</i>

LOIS: Now, sweetie,
your father's just a free spirit.

Here.

A good breakfast is the foundation
of a good day.

BRIAN: And a bad breakfast
is the foundation of indigestion.

[Hollering]

Hi, I'm Brian.

STEWIE: What the hell is this?

I said egg whites only!

Are you trying to give me
a bloody heart attack?

Make it again!

The breakfast thing. Yes.

It wasn't even about the eggs, really.
Frankly, I like the yolks.

I have no problem....

There's always been a lot of tension
between Lois and me.

And it's not so much
that I want to "kill" her.

It's just I want her
not to be alive anymore.

I sometimes wonder
if all women are this difficult.

And then I think to myself, "My God...

"...wouldn't it be marvelous
if I turned out to be a homosexual?"

One time my dad pooped in the
neighbor's yard and then lied about it.

I knew it!

Well, I'm glad I used his shovel
to clean it up!

Joe, this sort of makes you like
Larry from <i>Three's Company</i>.

You know, I always thought he was sexy.

I am all about Larry over here!

On Sundays we generally
catch the early-bird special...

...here at The Lobster Shanty.

Fresh seafood, good prices.

Plus it's a shanty.

And you get to pick your own lobster.

Yes. That one looks like
he's got some fight in him.

Take off the rubber bands! I'm going in!

My God! It is them!

I can't believe the Griffins eat here
like everyday people!

We're, like, trying to eat here.

Meg, put your bib on.

I don't want to wear a bib.

Meg, honey, it's very cold in here.

Maybe you'd be more comfortable
with your bib on.

She means your nipples are sticking out!

Mom!

[Laughs]

Nipples!

That's it! I want those cameras off!

Fourth wall!
You're breaking the fourth wall!

You're the one that got us on TV
in the first place.

Now I'm getting us off TV. I quit!

This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

-We can't do the show without Meg.
-Why not?

Our research shows she's
the least popular character on the show.

But everyone loves the rest of you.

Lois, women 25 to 49,
they see you as a role model.

-Really?
-Absolutely.

-What about me?
-You!

Look, the bottom line is you folks
are all still under contract. Okay?

But I've come up with a solution
I think will make everyone happy.

TEACHER: Jason Gallagher.
JASON: Present.

Meg Griffin.

-Sorry I'm late, Mr.--
-Here.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Hello?

PETER: Over here.

Thank you for meeting us here.
Can I offer you a cigarette?

Sorry. We have to keep this brief.

MEG: Why are we here?
PETER: No cameras!

The TV executives don't want viewers
to think you're Meg Griffin.

You're gonna let them recast me?

It could've been worse.
They could've gone with Plan B.

Brian, put a mask on.

I have an announcement.

"Meg Griffin's plane was shot down
over the Sea of Japan.

"It spun in.

"There were no survivors."

Who do I see about a Section Eight?

Fine! Do your stupid show without me!
I'll be over at Cleveland's house!

I don't even want to be a part
of this family anymore!

PETER: She'll be okay.
Come on. We gotta get back.

The cameramen think
we're taking Chris to soccer practice.

We're gonna be late!

Why won't you talk to me?

Meg, honey.

Our home is your home
for as long as you like.

We could offer you the guest room
provided it doesn't bother you...

...that my Great Uncle Chet died in there.

Oh. I guess not.

When did he die?

We think sometime between
<i>The Tonight Show</i>...

...and <i>The Today Show</i>.

[Carefree laughter]

You know, some people think
that dandelions are weeds.

But you know, I always think...

...who the hell decided
tulips were so great?

PETER: Hey, I'm over here.

Hi, Chris.

You know my name?

Of course I do, silly.
I'm your sister, Meg.

Oh.

I don't know if Mom and Dad told you,
but we usually have breakfast naked.

And I'm allowed to videotape it.

My skin's getting so slippery.
Hope I don't pop out of my top!

Camera guy. Check this out.

"Peter Griffin and Madam."

Madam, you're a lusty old gal, aren't you?

"You're the one with your hand
up my backside, darling."

Oh! She got me.

Hey, come back here.

She's gonna sing <i>Rainbow Connection</i>.

MEG: Mr. Quagmire,
can I use your toothpaste?

-My God. Excuse me.
-Hey, no problem.

You probably bought me
another three minutes!

The funniest thing happened
at work today. There was this--

FAKE MEG: Hi.
PETER: Hey!

I had the worst day.

First I didn't make cheerleader
because I'm so plain.

And I still don't have a date
for Friday night, as usual.

I'm going to write in my journal...

...about how I'll never grow
big, full breasts like these!

It's not fair, Lois.

If I don't get any airtime,
how will I get my own spin-off...

...where I'm a retired baseball umpire
who opens a bar...

...at the center of the earth?

[Peppy instrumental music]

You know, we don't get many
of you molten-rock men in here.

At these prices, I'm not surprised!

That's it, pal!

You are outta here!

[Cheering]

To hell with the cameras!

How could we ever let them
replace our little girl?

-I miss her, Peter.
-Me, too.

She's like that dorky Baldwin brother
who isn't as good-looking or successful...

...and never answers my letters,
but he's still a Baldwin!

And so is Meg! Let's go get her back!

PRODUCER: What can I do for you?

I'll tell you what you can do.

Fire that sexy, interesting version
of our daughter...

...and make us a family again, or we walk!

Fire her? She's the highest testing
character on the show.

Besides, you can't quit.
You have a contract.

Oh, yeah?
Here's what I think of your contract!

I think it's awful, and I don't much care
for it at all, my good sir.

Let's go. We're outta here.

You put me in
a very awkward position, Peter.

But I guess I have no choice.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

MEG: Mom? Dad?

I'm home!

Who are you?

We're the Griffins.

MEG: No, you're not. You're Tom Arnold.
And you're Fran Drescher.

And you're that fat guy
from <i>Boogie Nights</i>.

And you're the Olsen twins?

Blast! Damn you all! Victory is mine!

Whose leg do you have to hump to get
a dry martini around here?

FRAN: <i>Oh, Peter, you promised me...</i>

<i>...you wouldn't drink at the stag party.</i>

[High-pitched nasal laugh]

I do not sound like that!
This is terrible.

We're the laughing stock of the town!
And we've lost our daughter!

[Knocking at door]

-Meg!
-Mom.

Look, I don't care if you guys
embarrass me. I want to come home.

Sweetie. It's good to have you back.

PETER: Hey, honey.
I'm sorry we missed your ball game.

What?

Here's an ice cream. We love you, Meg.

I love you, too.

[Tender instrumental music]

Hey, Lois. There's a Bible in here.

Hey, look at me! I'm a Christian!

I'm reading the Bible!

BRIAN: Excedrin headache number one.
Puppy mill.

Damn.

Does anyone here have thumbs?
Anyone? No.

Sorry. I don't play.

Come on. Knock it off.

How's the flow today?

[Brian protesting]

Mom! Do something! Mom, help!

BRIAN: And that was the last time
I ever saw her.

I think we've stumbled on
the root of your problems.

You have abandonment issues.

You need to confront your mother
and deal with this.

Are you crazy?

For God's sake, my eyes were barely open,
and she just gave me away.

Well, it's her loss, right?

Yeah. I turned out great, huh?
Am I right? Yeah!

You bet your ass I'm right!
You want to arm wrestle?

Come on! Right now!

Brian, have you been drinking?

No.

Brian, you really seem to be enjoying
your wine lately.

It's only my second glass.

Dad, if bad men broke into the house,
and they had guns...

...and they put a gun up to your head,
and made you choose...

...who you wanted to live, me or Meg,
who would you choose?

Ask your mom.
I'm not very good with tough decisions.

BOY ON P.A.:
<i>We'll be closing in two minutes.</i>

[Crying]

I could never choose.
I love all my children equally.

It's hard enough having Stewie
all the way in Palm Springs...

...visiting Grammy and Grandpa.

Give Nana a big hug, sweetheart.

STEWIE: That should guarantee some
after-dinner entertainment.

Lois, I was thinking.

Why don't I fly out to Palm Springs
and pick up Stewie?

Really?

A trip like this is what I need
to clear my head.

That would be wonderful.

It'll give me time
to catch up on my reading.

Usually there are so many distractions.

[Gunshot]

[Fly buzzing]

[Gunshot]

Come into my home, will ya?

I'll show you, you bastards.

NANA: Stewie, gather your things.
Time to go.

It's about bloody time!

That idiot slattern sent the dog?

Well, this is....

Don't even get me started!
I mean, really!

When I think of the times
that that woman has....

I won't even begin to--

BRIAN: Can we go?
STEWIE: Fine.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Peter, guess what I just got?
A relationship video.

The infomercial said this tape will
help us communicate better as a couple.

When have we ever
had trouble communicating?

LOIS: Oh, Peter. I love you.

PETER: Yeah, about a quarter past 5:00.

Okay, Lois. I'll make you a deal.

We'll watch the tape,
but you've got to do something for me.

Okay. What?

Do that Katherine Hepburn
impression for me.

And <i>Philadelphia Story</i> Hepburn.

None of that head-on-a-slinky
<i>Golden Pond</i> stuff.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Aren't you young to be traveling alone?

Aren't you a little old
to be wearing braces?

I think you've had about enough.

[Slurring] I think you're wrong, you
increasingly attractive-looking woman.

-You're really pretty.
-Stop.

No. I'm serious.
You could be in magazines. You could!

And not just like <i>Jugs</i> or <i>Creamsicle</i>.

Call me! She won't call.

Here's a pleasant sight.
Cirrhosis the Wonder Dog.

I'm not drunk. All right?
I just have a speech impediment.

[Vomiting]

And a stomach virus.

<i>Final boarding.</i>

Oh, at last!
Yes. Come now. Chase the stick.

Where are the bags?

What the deuce do you mean?
They're right....

<i>Rupert! I told you to watch the bags!</i>

You were watching the boys again.
It's that steward, isn't it?

The one who looks like Tab Hunter!
Oh, forget it!

Let's just get on the plane and go home!

Our tickets were in the bags!

INTERCOM: <i>Flight 85 to Providence</i>
<i>is now departing.</i>

That's not going to stop me!

[Shouting]

That was my plan. Where's yours?

[Cheery instrumental music]

Oh, my God! All right,
let's not dilly-dally.

Phone Lois,
have her wire us some money...

...and let's get the hell out of here.

[Drunken stammering]

Oh, that's pretty.

Hello, operator?

God, that's right.

You have to punch in
the numbers nowadays.

I should know this. Yes. 867-5309.

That's it. No, wait. That's not it!

Damn you, Tommy Tutone!
There's only one thing to do.

111-1111. Lois? Damn!

111-1112. Lois? Damn!

111-1113....

"<i>A Way With Words In Marriage for</i>
<i>Couples Who Communicate Not Good</i>."

Come on, Lois.
This is gonna be worse than that time...

...we had to sit through
your Uncle Jerry's snuff film.

Are they really gonna kill that girl?

Peter, please!
People are trying to watch.

Just give it a chance.

<i>Hello. I'm Dr. Amanda Rebecca.</i>

<i>By purchasing this video,</i>
<i>you've taken the first step towards...</i>

<i>...strengthening your relationship</i>
<i>through better communication.</i>

<i>I'd like to start by asking the women</i>
<i>to leave the room because...</i>

<i>...this part of the tape is for men only.</i>
<i>We'll see you in a little while.</i>

I can see this is gonna be very intense.
How fun!

<i>Make sure your wife is out of the room.</i>

[Sexy music plays]

<i>So, do you want to talk,</i>
<i>or do you want me to take my top off?</i>

<i>That's what I thought.</i>
<i>Oh, man. You're making me so hot!</i>

<i>I hope you like big breasts,</i>
<i>because mine are so big...</i>

<i>...this itty bra can barely contain them.</i>

REBECCA: <i>Do you want to see more?</i>
PETER: Yes, please.

<i>Then you'll have to order my next tape.</i>

THUG 1: <i>You got the stuff?</i>

THUG 2: <i>Yeah. I've got it. Where's</i>
<i>the money? I wanna see the money.</i>

THUG 1: <i>No. You don't see the money</i>
<i>until I see the stuff.</i>

There's only one way
to put an end to this nuisance.

He's wearing a wire!

[Phone rings]

Hello?
Damn it to pus-spewing, blood-gutted hell!

What?

What do you mean,
our credit card was declined?

No, there's no need to come up. We'll....

Blast!

Damn it!

Come on, you! Get up!
Go for a ride in the car?

Blast! A penny!

Wake up!

What? Oh, my head!
Oh, God. What are we doing here?

We needed a weekend away from the kids.
Just us.

We have to get the hell out of here!

MANAGER: <i>Manager! Open up, or</i><i>I'll</i>

<i>hit you with this blunt </i>

<i>...to hit deadbeats with bad credit cards!</i>

<i>Well, it's not an instrument!</i>

<i>It's more of an object! But it's blunt!</i>

<i>Hard and blunt! </i>
<i>And it's kind of like a bat!</i>

<i>I found it out back one day</i>
<i>when I was raking!</i>

Let's go!

STEWIE: All right, we need some wheels.

BRIAN: This one's unlocked.

An SUV?
Look, we're trying to elude someone.

We're not driving to soccer practice.
Let's take this one.

-You like that color?
-What's wrong with it?

-I don't know. It's just so dark.
-Well, yes. But it doesn't show dirt.

-What?
-It doesn't show dirt.

I guess.

This is the first place we've gone to.
Perhaps we should try another lot.

[Door smashing]

Sold!

-Go on. Hot-wire it!
-Hot-wire? I don't even pump my gas!

Oh, for God's sake!

Hurry up!

[Radio plays]

You did it!

Wait. Put it back. I like that song.

[Adventurous instrumental music]

Montgomery Clift who was in <i>From</i>
<i>Here to Eternity</i> with Burt Lancaster...

...who was in <i>Atlantic City</i>
with Susan Sarandon...

...who was in <i>White Palace</i>
with Kevin Bacon. There.

Nice. Except that was James Spader
in <i>White Palace</i>. Moron.

Mr. Snippy.

I just need some time to think.
All right?

Yes. You've got lots to think about,
haven't you?

Public drunkenness, grand-theft auto.

You forgot where you smash your head
on the windshield.

I don't recall....

[Brakes screech]

Yes, well,
I suppose I walked right into that one.

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

-Lois. Hi, it's Brian.
-Let me talk to her!

Brian!
We were just on our way to the airport.

Is everything okay?

Yeah. Everything's fine.

Stewie and I traded in our plane tickets
for train tickets.

Yeah. Apparently you can do that.

Give me the damn phone!

He's sound asleep.
But I'll give him a kiss for you.

-You suck!
-See you in three days.

[Brian sighs]

Let's go.

[Police radio chatter]

Crap. We gotta disappear. And quick!

Maybe we should've jumped on that truck.

Stewie and Brian are taking a train home.

Can we not talk about curtains
for two seconds?

I got another one of those
relationship tapes.

$49.95? That's three times as much
as the first one.

PETER: Lois, our relationship
cannot be measured in nipples and dimes.

I mean, nickels and boobs.

Money. I'll be upstairs.

LOIS: Peter, why are you so--

Get out! This is a part just for the men!

STEWIE: I say, there's a plane.

BRIAN: Yeah. If there's a plane,
there's probably a pilot.

And if there's a pilot,
there must be a bar!

I can finally get a drink!

I don't trust you.

You put your seed in my daughter's belly.
You're fired!

But, Pa, you can't fire me!

You're lucky you're my brother, too,
or I'd kill you!

BRIAN: Excuse me, sir.
I'm an experienced crop-dusting pilot.

You can trust us completely.

My friend is too young
to put a seed in your daughter's belly.

And I'm of a different species.

You're hired.

[Propeller starting]

STEWIE: Will your face be red
when they find the black box on this one.

So really saturate the soil twice a day.

That's why my tomatoes haven't
been coming in.

[Speaking Spanish]

Let's see.

[Speaking Spanish]

Hey, that was pretty good.

But when you said, "<i>Me llamo</i><i>es Brian</i>,"
you don't need the "<i>es</i>."

Just "<i>Me llamo Brian.</i>"

You speak English.

Just that first speech.
And this one explaining it.

-You're kidding, right?
<i>-Qué?</i>

[Speaking Spanish]

Why the hell did we get off here?

My mother lives in Austin.

Don't you see?
Fate's brought me back here for a reason.

I have to find
and make peace with my mother.

So she's in Austin? Eight miles that way?

Yes.

All right. So instead of driving
down this sun-parched highway...

...we've now got to walk?

Pretty much. Yeah.

STEWIE: You know what this means?
BRIAN: Yeah.

[Bird calls]

I say, walk slower, dog!

My Huggies are already holed up
in Box Canyon.

[Sweet instrumental music]

[Puppies yelping]

BRIAN: Hello, Luke.
LUKE: Have we met?

My name's Brian. I was born here.

Sorry, son, lots of dogs have been
born here. Refresh my memory.

-Which one were you again?
-I was the one who could talk.

Brian! Come on in!

Betty! Look who it is!

Is that Brian?
And you brought a little friend.

I bet you're a hungry little fella.

Yes, and I'll bet you lost your virginity
to a mechanical bull! Now change me!

Look, I've been thinking a lot
about my mother lately, and--

She was a good dog.

"Was"? You mean--

Last year. She went real peaceful.

[Sighs]

She probably wouldn't have wanted
to see me anyway.

That's not true!
Biscuit loved all her puppies!

Biscuit!

Brian, your mama gave you up
because she thought...

...you'd have a better life
if she let you go.

Was she right, son?
Do you have a good life?

Yeah. I really do. I have a great life.

-Would you like to see her?
-See her? I don't understand.

We loved Biscuit so much
we wanted to keep her with us always...

...so we had her stuffed!

[Eerie instrumental music]

Mom!

I say! Someone must've said a funny,
because your mother's in stitches!

I'll leave you to grieve.

Come on, Betty, why don't we
get these fellas some sandwiches?

Look at Jesus standing over there
all by himself.

You'd think those bulldogs would
invite him to their card game.

You deserve better than this, Mom.

This is actually a rather elegant solution
for my problem of what to do with Lois.

Shut up and help me.
I'm not leaving her like this.

Oh, relax. The old girl doesn't have too
much to wag about these days anyway.

Hey, Meg, try and guess
the word I'm thinking of right now.

And it's not "kitty."

-"Car."
-No.

-I don't know. "Apple"?
-No. Give up?

-Yeah.
-It was "kitty"!

-Peter, isn't that--
-My God! The new video! Life is sweet!

<i>How about some whipped cream?</i>

That's always good.

REBECCA: <i>And some cinnamon.</i>

That's good, too!

REBECCA: <i>And then, guess what?</i>
<i>I'm going to add....</i>

Jeez. If she says Mrs. Dash,
I'm gonna lose it.

REBECCA: <i>We're going to add....</i>

<i>Peter!</i>

<i>I know what you've been doing here.</i>
<i>And I'm very upset with you.</i>

Wow. Usually beautiful women don't

turn back into you until
after I'm finished.

<i>These tapes are about communication.</i>

<i>If you wanted to see a woman</i>
<i>acting nasty...</i>

<i>...you should've told me.</i>

This is hot!

LOIS: <i>Turn around.</i>

Lois! This is not what it looks like!
She means nothing to me!

-Peter, it's okay.
-Yeah?

I was trying to be sexy for you.

Come here, you.

<i>You should've told me....</i>

<i>You should've told me....</i>

I'm gonna get directions
to the nearest park...

...so we can give my mother
a proper burial.

Come on, darling. Stiff upper lip.

I'm writing that one down.

-Say something.
-What?

-Just say something, please!
-For God's sake!

"Yea, and God said to Abraham,
'You will kill your son Isaac.'

"And Abraham said:

"'I can't hear you.
You'll have to speak into the microphone.'

"And God said, 'I'm sorry.
Is this better? Check, check, check.

"'Jerry, pull the high end out,
I'm getting some hiss back here.'"

Say something about my mother!

Yes. I'm sorry.

I never knew Biscuit as a dog.

But I did know her as a table.

She was sturdy.
All four legs the same length--

Thanks. That's enough.

Yes. <i>Requiem</i> and <i>Terra Pax</i>, and so forth.
Amen.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

Look at all those stars.

I've read that starlight gives you cancer.
But then again, what doesn't these days?

Listen, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

It's not easy for me to say.

Oh, God! You're not coming out
of the closet, are you?

Why does everyone
always come out to me?

I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did today.

I know this whole trip has been a mess.

It hasn't been all bad.

I must admit, there have been moments
that were, dare I say, fun.

Yes. You remember that episode

Yeah.

It's on this afternoon.
You can tape it for me.

This time it's definitely not "kitty."

-Can you guess what it is?
-Is it "kitty"?

Don't you try to palm this off

What about the time

Now, Chris, we told you,

Meg, you have a wart!

Meg, how could you bring

It's not mine.
I was just holding it for a friend.

See, it was lunchtime....

Okay, Connie. You're up.

MEG: Connie Demico does toad?

CONNIE: I guess Miss Wears-A-Hat

-Mr. Berler's coming!
-Man! We are so busted.

Put it in here. He won't check me.

All right. What's going on back here?
Hello, Megan. Wait a minute.

You're not part of the popular clique.
You run along and play alone somewhere.

Shame on you all,
getting her hopes up like that.

I thought if I held
Connie Demico's toad...

...she'd make a cool guy
ask me to the Winter Snow Ball.

You're holding drugs
so someone will invite you to a dance?

Meg, haven't we taught you
better than that?

Now, hold on. People do a lot

I finally got up the guts,

-Phoebe?

Well, we just have to trust
our kids to stay off drugs, is all.

I do trust our kids.
It's the other kids I don't trust.

Yeah. I guess it's up to us,

I'll talk to the principal tomorrow.

Thanks, honey.

The safety word is "banana."

I love you.

You just sat down and said:

Oh, right. Okay, here's my idea.

Look, Neil, I don't....

Oh, my God!

MEG: Dad?

The reason I'm not responding is
because I'm not this "Dad" person.

Connie Demico is looking.

So that's Toad Girl?

MEG: Yeah.

<i>And that's Connie.</i>

I see. I'm gonna have

Good luck. She only talks
to the cool kids.

-Oh, yeah? Watch this.

I know I won't.

You never did it in the first place!
God, you're such a wannabe loser.

Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser...

the Winter Snow Ball with Lando?

Meg, you got a date?
Wait till I tell your mother...

...who I'm looking forward to meeting...

...and I hope is making steakums tonight.

Hey, Meg, wanna ditch and go to the mall?

Sure. See you, Lando.

This is great.
Not only did I live long enough...

...to see Meg go to her first dance,
but I'm taking her, too.

Thanks, Geritol.

MEG: And they swore
they'd never do toad again.

Dad never came to sing at my school.
I don't want dessert!

I tell you, Lois, high school's
a lot more fun this time around.

It's a lot safer now
that all the kids have guns.

And today in study hall,
I farted real loud on purpose...

...to make the guys laugh.

And I swear, it was so heinous,
Susie Johnson ralphed up her steak.

I'm sorry!

Is this really proper dinner conversation?

I'm glad you taught those kids
they don't have to do drugs to be popular.

He sure did. Who needs drugs...

...when you're going to the dance
with the coolest guy?

Going with Dad is gonna skyrocket me
up the popularity food chain!

It's true.
Soon, members of the Math Club...

...will attach themselves
to your belly for transportation.

Wait a minute.
You can't take Meg to a school dance.

How long do you think you can
keep up this charade, anyway?

Just till Friday. Please, Mom?

Well, if this is what you want.

[Phone ringing]

It's probably Connie calling for me.

Hello?

Oh, yeah. Hold on.

It's for Lando.

Aloha. No way!

Neil, I'm a little out of your league.
Besides, I'm going with Lando.

Really? Because
my underground sources...

...inform me
that Lando is taking Connie Demico.

What?

MEG: Hey, I thought you were taking
me to the dance!

Something suddenly came up.

LOIS: How could you do this to Meg?

Not now. I gotta write a book report
on <i>Oliver Twist</i>.

"Oliver Twit" if you ask me.

I would have done things
rather differently.

Please, sir. I want some more.

What?

Please, sir. I want some more.

More?

All right! Stop it! Stop it right there!

Now go on! Fill up the bowl! Go on!

That's it. Now put on this dress.

Put it on!

Now dance!

Hey, Brian, the guy who wrote this...

...his name, Charles Dickens.

I want an explanation, mister.

Hey, Connie pulled a power move.

When the most popular girl in school
asks you to the dance, you don't say no.

You say, okay.

I just can't understand why you dumped
your own daughter for Connie Demico.

BRIAN: Lois, it's simple transference.

See, to Peter,
Connie Demico is really Phoebe Diamond.

The popular girl when he was in school.

My God, Lois! I think he's right.

When I'm trying to speed things up in bed,
I'm not thinking of Connie, but Phoebe.

This whole thing is ridiculous!

I forbid you from going to that dance!

You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my real mom!

End of discussion!

Thank you for ruining my life!

You don't remember
what it's like to be my age!

LOIS: I'm two years younger than you!

I hate you!

Greg Allman, how did you handle
it when life got you down?

Me?

I did a lot of drugs,
married some broad named Cher.

I wouldn't recommend either one of them.

I gotta fight for my right to party!

Thanks, Spider-Man.

SPIDER-MAN: Everybody gets one.

Sweetie?

You married a total jerk.

Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you.

And you know,
you could still go to the dance.

Alone? Why don't I just tattoo
a big "L" on my forehead while I'm at it?

Now, Meg,
you know my feelings on tattoos.

If you stay home, you're just proving
to the other kids you don't belong there.

Yeah.

And you might have a really good time.
I'll tell you one thing...

...I still regret not going
to my junior dance.

LOIS: But, Daddy, if you don't do
what they say, they'll kill me!

Sorry. You know we don't
negotiate with kidnappers. Family policy.

Daddy, no! Please!

She'll be all right.

Come on. What do you say?

Well, I do have that really slutty
dress you hate.

So, Lando...

...how old did you say you were again?

Seventeen.

And a half.

PETER: Sweet statutory!
You look beautiful.

Don't worry.
I'll take good care of your kid.

I got a daughter of my own, you know.

I imagine you wouldn't,

PETER: <i>I thought you might</i>
<i>say something like that.</i>

Well, you do have it coming.

Anyway, I convinced Meg
to go to the dance.

So I'm gonna go drop her off.

PETER: <i>Please don't yell, Lois.</i>
<i>I've learned my lesson.</i>

I wasn't yelling. I was just saying--

PETER: <i>You would bring that up.</i>

<i>Can't you leave the past where it belongs?</i>

What's wrong with you?

PETER: <i>I've already explained that</i>

I'm a little concerned about Stewie.

He doesn't seem to be playing well

He's fine. I was quite a troublemaker
myself, when I was a kid.

CAT: Look, your parents
will be home any minute.

Are you sure you don't want me
to clean up this mess?

No. Go. It'll be funny.

Stewie needs to learn how
to socialize with other children.

Maybe we should put him in daycare.

Lois, his answers are out

[Crying]

Now you've gone and upset the boy.

Peter, this is a new chapter in my life.

The kids are growing, the nest is empty,
and I need some excitement.

What are you talking about?

Your life is plenty exciting.
For example....

There you go. Good night.

BRAD: Duck, duck, duck....

I say, does anyone know
how <i>The Practice</i> ended last night?

I dozed off during the verdict.

Goose!

Oh, dear. It seems you're still It.

[Laughing]

[Romantic instrumental music]

TEACHER: Stewie, what have you done?
That's not the way we play.

You sit here, Brad. Stewie's It.

Aren't you the one in charge?

Let's see now. Duck, duck, duck...

...goose!

Come on, now! I barely touched you!
Really, stop it! Stop your boo-hooing!

Stop it, I say! Stop it!

You see, this is exactly why people
don't respect the WNBA.

Hey, guys, get this.
So Lois wants a part-time job, right?

So I'm like, "I got a job for you,
baby, right here."

This zipper's been broken for over
a month. I gotta use a damn safety pin.

Hey, if Lois is looking for a thrill,
I could get her a job with the airline.

Stewardesses travel
to all kinds of exotic places...

...and their husbands
fly anywhere for free!

Fly for free?

Sorry, Tink,
looks like I don't need you anymore.

TINKERBELL: So you're gonna dump me,
just like that?

You knew what this was.

LOIS: A flight attendant? Wow.
That does sound exciting.

-What made you change your mind?
-Just my desire to see you happy.

And to exploit your hard labor
for free travel and fun.

What?

I didn't say anything.
Go to sleep, crazy lady.

[Snoring]

Oh, Rupert, I can't sleep.

I don't suppose
you have any Valium on you?

Of course not.
You're living the clean life now.

It's that pathetic little insect
in daycare, Janet.

Whining, insignificant wisp of fluff,
she is.

Still, I find it rather odd that
she's even on my mind at all.

STEWIE: What has come over me?
BRIAN: Well, well, well.

Looks like someone's in love.

Ha! That's so funny I forgot to laugh,
excluding that first "ha."

Face it, you're a sucker
for a woman with blue eyes.

-Her eyes are green!
-Thank you for proving my point.

Damn!

STEWIE: Look at her.

<i>Sitting there with her curly ebony locks</i>
<i>and those pouty, come-hither lips</i>.

STEWIE: My God, she's unappealing!
KID: Go!

Who said that? Who's got the big diapers?

<i>She's gone. Good. Well, I'm off.</i>

Hi, Stewie.

[Stuttering]

Leonard, you pudgy-faced Apple John!
I will not be made a fool of!

Here's your pillow, sir,
and your <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

Miss, he keeps putting his arm
on my armrest!

-It's my armrest!
-It is not, stupid head!

He keeps trying to take my apple juice!

I'll bring you your own juice.

Hey, he keeps licking his finger
and touching me!

Hey, fellas, I hope you're hungry.

Oh, my God! What am I gonna....
Somebody help!

[Laughing]

That was great! Look at her!
She's still shaking.

Bastards.

That was beautiful.
Hey, throw me a beer, would you?

[Bell ringing]

Stewardess, the plane just
made my beer spill. I want a free one.

Sir, all your beers have been free.
All nine of them.

And don't you forget it, Frenchie.

Now bring me another one and get out
of my way. The movie is starting.

<i>Morgan Freeman in</i> Deep Impact!
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

Hey, show me Morgan Fairchild
in <i>Deep</i> something.

You don't care.
Hey, Frenchie, is my fort ready?

Yes, Mr. Griffin, even though
no one else has any pillows now.

All right!

STEWIE: I tell you, Leonard,
women are wicked creatures!

Their treachery has precipitated the
downfall of history's most powerful men!

Let it be known I want nothing to do
with the wretched enterprise of love!

Janet's coming.

Yes, yes.

Hi.

Cookie?

No, actually it's Stewie,
but you can call me Cookie if you like.

Yes, I've also been known to answer
to Artimus, Agent Buchwald, and Snake.

Yes, I rather like Snake.

Snake Griffin.

Cookie.

Oh, you want my cookie. Oh, yes.
By all means. There you are.

Oops! A little bit broke off there.

Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

[Laughing]

Yes, you'll get that one
halfway back to your mat.

[Forced laughing]

Oh, Cupid, hast thou pierced me
with thine sweet, searing arrow?

Stomach, cease thy lustful quake.

Unhand me, woman!
I don't have gas! I'm in love!

Well then, I guess it's both.

LOIS: Peter, I'm home!

-How was your day?
-My day?

You okay there, Mr. Crocodile?

Wake up, wake up, wake up.

You need some lotion, Mr. Bad Skin?

There you go.

[Screaming]

PETER: Oh, God!

My day was okay. You know, the usual.

How about yours, my little sky princess?
I bet it was exciting.

Oh, yeah.

If you like running through a gauntlet
of drunk, horny businessmen.

My ass feels like a pincushion.
I'm thinking of quitting.

What? Lois, you can't quit.
What if Kurt Cobain had quit?

[Band playing rock 'n' roll]

COBAIN: Thank you!
And remember, say no to drugs!

Great concert, Kurt. The label's excited
about your seventh album.

Thanks. You remember my wife,
Courtney Love?

Who?

Well, I guess I'll give it a little
more time.

It's like I always tell the kids,
"A quitter

never wins," and, "Don't trust Whitey."

That's the spirit!

All right, here I go.

-Stewie.
-Hello, Janet. How about a push?

[Screaming]

[Laughing]

Yes, I suppose that was rather funny,
wasn't it?

You know, it's odd, Janet.
But when I'm with you, I'm....

How do I describe it?

[Singing] "You make me feel so young

"You make me feel like spring has sprung

"And every time I see you grin

"I'm such a happy individual

<i>"The moment that you speak</i>

<i>"I want to go and play hide-and-seek</i>

<i>"I want to go and bounce the moon</i>

"Just like a big toy balloon

"Darling, you and I

<i>"are just like a couple of tots</i>

"running across the meadow

"picking up lots of forget-me-nots

"You make me feel so young

<i>"You make me feel</i>
<i>there are songs to be sung</i>

<i>"Bells to be rung,</i>
<i>And a wonderful fling to be flung</i>

"And even when I'm old and gray

"I'm going to feel the way I do today

"because you make me feel so young"

[Speaking Arabic]

-Excuse me?
-I said, "May I have a blanket?"

Oh, yes. Of course.

Ha! I really said "Will you be my wife?"
and you said yes...

...so it's official.
Let me touch your face!

Lois, we could use your help in Coach.

Okay, everyone,
it's time for my one-man show...

<i>...Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye</i>.

Okay, Act 1. "I'm Winston Churchill.

"Would you like some tea?
I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.

"Would you like a crumpet?
I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.

"Would you like to wear knickers?
I would, because I'm--"

MAN: My wife is very ill!

Yes, do you mind?
I paid $380 for this flight.

$380? Jeez, I hope they kissed you first.

This is my fourth trip today.
Just this morning, I went to Kentucky.

PETER: Wait a second.

You're telling me I flew all the way
to Kentucky to get...

...some of your fried chicken,
and the Colonel isn't even working today?

He ain't real. He dead.

-What?
-I say he dead.

Is Mr. Sanders in?

What wrong with you? I say you he dead!

The Colonel!

My wife is a stewardess, so I can fly
anywhere I want and I don't pay jack!

-Peter!
-Lois!

You convinced me to keep a job I hate
just so you could fly free?

If I talked real loud like that, I could
make you look like the bad guy, too.

My feet are killing me,
I've got vomit in my pocket...

...and I've seen that crappy
Julia Roberts movie 47 times!

Have you seen the lips on that woman?
It's like a baboon's ass on her face!

Peter, I took this job for the excitement,
and you're the one who's having it all!

It's excitement you want, eh?

How would you like to join
the Mile-High Club? Come on.

You'll be the stewardess and I'll be the
mysterious stranger who's drilling you.

Move! I have a lot of work to do.

-I can't. I'm stuck.
-Peter, the passengers need me.

They're watching the movie. They're fine.

Okay, everyone! This is a hijacking!

LOIS: Peter, could you move your arm?
Just slide over. Please.

PETER: Lois.

LOIS: It's like moving a futon.
PETER: Lois!

LOIS: Just slide your leg over!
Peter, please!

[Screaming]

PETER: Well, Lois, at least one of
us is in the Mile-High Club.

[Lois sighing]

Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over.

The plane has safely landed in Cuba,
and all Americans aboard are...

...on their way home
with the exception of one couple:

A fat man who is inexplicably married
to an attractive redhead.

Here's an artist rendering of what
they might look like.

I just called Brian.

He's gonna watch the kids till we
get back. When will our passports arrive?

-Check back in two weeks.
-Two weeks? But I have a baby at home!

We would have sent you back
with the other passengers...

...but we didn't know
you were stuck in the bathroom.

-We weren't doing what you're thinking.
-I was.

-We apologize for the hijacking.
-That's okay.

You people are nothing like
the Communists they show on TV.

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>
The Communists<i>.</i>

[Happy instrumental music]

I hear report cards were handed out today.
What were your grades?

[Stuttering]

Quit Stalin and answer your father.

[Audience laughing]

Go ahead, honey, and tell us your Marx.

[Audience laughing]

Do I Khrushchev?

Did somebody say "Khrushchev"?

[Dance music playing]

STEWIE: Janet, do you like this couch?

You truly are beautiful. You know that?

-Janet, our future is so bright.
-Cookie?

Oh, yes. There'll be lots of cookies
and there'll be dancing...

...Christmas mornings,
and arguments over the proper way...

...to discipline the children, and....

What are you doing? Who the hell is this?
Is there something you need to tell me?

Because if I'm the only one in this thing,
I think I deserve to know.

I see. Your silence says it all.

[Sad instrumental music]

[Latin instrumental music]

Well, this is just great. How the hell
are we supposed to get home?

All we gotta do is get
fake passports on the black market.

Where are you going?

You're never gonna find the black market!

You said that
about that back-alley abortionist.

I'm glad you changed your mind.
The point is, I found the guy.

Okay, there she is.

[Laughing]

That is absolutely classic!
Melinda, you're an utter delight.

Oh, hello, Janet. Yes, you know Melinda.

Yes, it seems she's....
What did we figure out, dear?

Was it one? No, two.
Yes, she's two weeks younger than you.

Just look at that butt!
That is a tight butt!

Damn! Not even a second glance!

This is what you call "dolled up"?

Listen, why don't you save yourself
years of sexual ambiguity...

...and get fitted for a pair of
Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?

There it is! The black market!

Lois, if we don't make it out of
here alive, I should tell you...

...I promised my first girlfriend
we'd meet up in Heaven. I was lying.

Just so you know,
it's something we might have to deal with.

[Muzak playing]

Okay. Two American passports.

Would you like to join
the Black Market Club?

Ten percent off your first purchase.

No, thank you. We're not from the area.
Peter, just pay the man.

Do you accept bits of string?

Sorry. Store policy.

But you know,
there is another way for you to travel.

It's over, Leonard.

I suppose I should be grateful
to that saucy harlot.

<i>She taught me a valuable lesson.</i>

There's really no such thing as love.
It's just a puffed-up word used...

...by Madison Avenue to sell
their skin creams and two-seater cars.

Oh, it's no use!
She swims in my blood now.

I must have her!

Darling, why are we
tormenting ourselves like this?

We're perfect for each other.

I admit we've got our problems,
like any couple...

...but true love conquers all!

I like you.

You like me?

Well, it's not love, but it's a start!

Oh, Janet, you've made me
the happiest man in the whole world!

-Cookie?
-Of course you can have a cookie.

Stay right there.

"Cookie."

<i>Cookie.</i>

<i>Cookie.</i>

<i>Cookie.</i>

You don't care about me! It's my cookies!

It's always been the damn cookies!
Well, sugar, the bakery just closed!

You'll have to get your fill somewhere
else, you oatmeal-raisin-loving tart!

Don't let her see you cry, old man.
Don't let her see you cry!

LOIS: Well, we're finally going home.

I'm sorry I tricked you into that job,
honey.

-You deserve to have a more exciting life.
-Oh, Peter.

Being married to you gives me
all the excitement I can handle.

I mean, look at us.
On a boat in the middle of the Atlantic...

...under the moonlight,
surrounded by refugees.

Yeah. About that.

You know, Miguel over there
has had his eye on you...

...and his wife, Rosa, is very open.

-What?
-No, nothing. This is nice.

[Theme music]
S02E16.en
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

"all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

[Cheery instrumental music]

Wakey-wakey, worthless domestic!
Time to make me inedible gruel.

Mommy wants to rest
for a few more minutes, honey.

[Pretending to cry]

Blast!

Lois, what are you doing
lying on the couch at this hour?

-Have you been drinking?
-Peter, you know I never drink.

Oh, yeah?
Just like you never dodged the draft?

What are you talking about? I'm a woman.

Sure you are. Now.

Peter, I'm exhausted.
I've been in and out of taxis all day.

Stewie had a doctor's appointment.
Then I had to pick Meg up after school.

I had rehearsal for <i>Death of a Salesman</i>.

We're not allowed to show death at school.

So now at the end,
we dance around with sparklers.

Peter, we really need a second car.

Trying to do all these errands
in a taxi is exhausting.

But you meet such colorful characters
in taxis, like Alex Rieger and Tony...

...and that foreign guy
who worked in the garage.

Rieger, cab 402!

Nardo, you and your luscious melons
are in 315.

Get the hell out of here, you losers.

Louie, what about the foreign guy?

No way, Banta. He's a nut job.

Come on, show a little compassion
for once in your life!

All right! Can the waterworks.
Jackie Chan, cab 302!

[Chan shouts]

[Audience laughing]

Thank you very much.

Peter, please.

I saw an ad for a used car
that would be perfect.

No, Lois. A guy at work
bought a car out of the paper.

Ten years later, bam! Herpes.

I'm buying our car from a dealer,
and that's that.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Look! Aren't you beautiful?

Yeah, you like that, don't you?

Yeah, you're a bad little car.
What's that?

You want me inside you?

LOIS: Peter, look at this one.

It's safe and reliable,
and we can afford it.

I'll just see if I can find a salesman.

I'm Doug. Nice to meet you.
Whoa, have you lost weight?

No, it's still there.
I'm just parting it on the side.

We were more interested
in that car over there.

Lois, let me handle this.

Peter, this car has dents in it,
and it's got a cardboard steering wheel.

Just a second, honey.

And look. There's no engine.
It just has a drawing of an engine.

But it only had one previous owner.
James Bond!

I'll take it!

Okay, let's see what this baby can do.

I'm sure the dealer will take care of it.

This is crazy. There's no way
we'll be able to have maritals...

...with you lying all the way over there.

I am very upset with you right now.

Okay, so I tried on your bra.
The fellas were putting on a show.

I didn't think I'd make a good Gigi
either, but, God help me, I was flattered.

I'm upset because you never listen to me.
This is Atlantic City all over again.

-You've got 20.
-Hit me.

-Peter, don't.
-Hit me.

-21.
-Hit me.

Peter.

-Hit me.
-That's 30.

Hit me.

You're just mad about the car.

Don't worry.
I'll think of a way to fix it.

No. We'll think of a way to fix it!

I'm tired of being left out
of all our decision-making.

Okay, honey.

[Chimp screams]

PETER: By the way, I bought a chimp.

Hey, Peter. Do you want a menu
or just the usual "everything"?

Shut up, Cleveland!

Want to talk about it, champ?

Lois has had the car all week,
and it's just been hell getting around.

I actually had to rent a Mustang.

[Horse whinnies]

All because I can't afford
to get our new car fixed.

Why don't you just get another new car?

Why don't you try a breath mint, saucy?

I'm just saying that me and my associates
will steal your car...

...and, ipso facto, your insurance company
will buy you another one.

Peter, you don't want to get involved
with the Mob.

Who are you?

-I'm the proprietor of this delicatessen.
-Butt out, schlomo.

All I need is your address.
You can jot it down on the back of my gun.

You do have an honest face.

Crap. I made a mistake.
Do you have another gun?

<i>Dharma, come down from there.</i>

<i>Wow, I can't get over</i>
<i>what a free spirit you are.</i>

[Audience laughing on TV]

[Chain saw motor sputtering]

PETER: Lois, can you go down
to the basement and do something...

...really loud and complicated
for the next 15 minutes?

[Chain saw cutting]

That's a fine machine, Peter.

-Peter, how can we afford this?
-Let's just say the car was a steal.

-Say that again.
-The car was a steal.

This time without winking.

The car was a steal. Wink.

-Peter.
-Look, Lois. We had a broken car.

I did "something,"
and now we have a new car.

Look, I said I'd handle it, and I did.

I suppose you did.
I just wish my opinion mattered to you.

The important thing is it matters to you,
and that's the greatest gift of all.

Cleveland, come check out my onboard
computer navigation system. Standard.

COMPUTER: <i>Left turn ahead.</i>

Spanish.

[Computer speaking Spanish]

Yakov Smirnoff.

COMPUTER:
<i>In Soviet Russia, car drives you!</i>

That's fancy and all, but I think you're
bargaining for more than you can chew.

You're in debt to the Mob.

That means they can ask you
to do anything. Anything!

Relax, Cleveland. There is no Mob.
You're thinking of the Mob in the movies.

-How am I funny?
-I don't know. You say funny things.

No, I mean, I'm what?
Am I George Carlin funny?

Am I <i>Spin City</i> funny?
Rita Rudner funny? What? Come on.

-Rita Rudner funny.
-Yeah. Rita Rudner funny.

Really? Oh, my God! Thank you.

Peter, please don't underestimate them.

I guarantee you, I am never
gonna hear from those guys again.

Peter.

It is time to repay your favor to the don.

PETER: Jeez.

At least that's one problem solved.

Come on, Peter.
The don is waiting to meet you.

What's he like? Is he a friendly don?
Like that Don Deluise?

DON: I have asked you here tonight
so that you may perform a service.

What are you gonna make me do?
Whack a guy? Off a guy?

Whack-off a guy? 'Cause I'm married.

DON: Silence!

Big Fat Paulie is in town this week
to attend the wedding of my daughter.

And you want me
to shoot him twice in the head?

That's sweet of you to ask,
but he's my nephew.

He's also vile and disgusting.

No one has ever been able to stand
his company for more than a minute.

But you, Mr. Griffin,
you will take him to the movies.

That's it? That's all I have to do?
Thank God.

Wait a second. Which movie?

If it's anything with Greg Kinnear,
you can whack me right now!

[Car approaching]

Big Fat Paulie?

My name's Marty,
and I'm very sensitive about my weight.

Big Fat Paulie?

How dare you?

[Screaming]

Are you Big Fat Paulie?

I'm Louie Anderson!

Are you, please, God, Big Fat Paulie?

[Snorting]

Yeah, I'm Big Fat Paulie.

Guess I've got milk.

Don't shoot me!

[Romantic music playing in movie]

Someone's sitting
in my most favorite seat.

I just got a great idea!

WHOOPIE:
<i>Girlfriend, you know what time it is?</i>

<i>No. What time is it?</i>

<i>It's time for you to get</i>
<i>your groove back again!</i>

Well....

Bye.

Where you going?

Home. For dinner.

Yeah? What are we having?

I was only supposed to go
to a movie with you.

What is that supposed to mean?

I mean, like, no necking.

[Laughing]

So I can have dinner with you?

Sure. That would be much better
than having a quiet dinner...

...with my family,
who I love and am not afraid of.

Lois. This is Big Fat Paulie.
He's gonna be joining us for dinner.

Really? What a nice surprise!
Peter, can I talk to you for a second?

Peter, you can't just bring company home
at the last second without calling.

I am getting sick and tired of you
doing everything without consulting me.

And....

Do you mind?

As a matter of fact I do, you crazy broad.

I am not a crazy broad!

Oh, no, Lois.
He didn't mean you're crazy like...

...Elizabeth Taylor.

He meant you're crazy like that glue.

You stick to things. Like an adhesive.

That's all he meant.

[Grunting]

You have a pretty good appetite there,
kid.

I bet you spend a lot of time in the john.

What finishing school
did you say you went to?

Yes! Good heavens! Who taught you
how to eat? Mickey Rourke?

Why do I know that name?
Damn you, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>!

Hi, I'm Bob Goen,
and these are Mary Hart's legs.

Mary, you recently spent some time
with Julia Roberts, didn't you?

Mary says, "Yes."

Tell me, kid. What are you, like 27?

I'm 13.

Still a minor, huh? Hey, son,
how'd you like to be a coke mule?

Peter, living room?

No, Lois. Kitchen.

Peter, I have a bad feeling
about this man.

He's not the kind of person
I want hanging around our family.

Honey, you're overreacting.

Will you please just listen
to me for once? That man is bad news!

I want him out of our house
and out of our lives!

All right, I'll just give you something
to help you relax.

-Now!
-Okay.

Big Fat Paulie,
there's something I gotta tell you.

Do you ever stare up at the night sky...

...and wonder if someone is
looking back at you?

No. But just in case...

...look at this, you freaking aliens!

Hi, Bonnie.
This is my friend Big Fat Paulie.

This is his big fat ass.

What's on your mind, Petey?

Look. We can't be friends anymore.

I'm sorry.

Forget about it.

[Sobbing]

Look, it's not you. It's Lois.

She doesn't want me to be with you.

-Really?
-Yeah.

-You're not just saying that?
-No. It's all Lois.

If only I'd met you first,
but what are you gonna do?

-So Lois is the problem, huh?
-Yeah. But it's not her fault.

She doesn't want to see me
fall in with a tough crowd again.

Cavity creeps!

We make holes in teeth!

So if she wasn't around,
we could still be friends, right?

Yeah, sure. Why not?

That's great! Come here, you!

MEG: "Willie Loman
never made a lot of money.

"His name was never in the paper.

"But, you know, like,

"People are worse off than Willie Loman."

[Gun fires]

[Screaming]

Come on, everybody.
I know it sucks, but they're just kids.

[Solemn instrumental music]

Peter, how can you sleep?
I was almost killed!

Come on, Lois. The only victim tonight
was the work of Arthur Miller.

[Phone ringing]

Hello? Big Fat Paulie!
No, Lois isn't dead yet.

What do you mean,
you're gonna fire that hitman?

What do you mean,
you thought she'd be dead...

...and we'd be able to catch a movie?

-You thought I wanted you to whack Lois?
-Guilty!

It's not too late to have the
hit called off, is it?

Yeah.

Gotcha!

All I gotta do is make a call.

[Gunshots]

[Screaming]

Jeez! You okay?

[Cheery instrumental music]

Oh, my God. Look at this.

LOIS: How could you bring a mobster
into your own home?

Boy, if you're upset now,
wait till you hear the rest.

I was talking to Big Fat Paulie
the other day...

...and one thing led to another and...

...I sort of put a hit out on you.

How could you put a hit on me?

That's not even the worst part.
Wait. Yeah, it is.

Peter!

Look, don't worry.
I got it all worked out.

We'll move to England.
The worst they got there is...

...drive-by arguments.

[Orchestral instrumental music]

I say, Jeremy,
isn't that Reginald B. Stiffworth...

...the young chap
who's been touting the merits...

...of the European Commonwealth?

-Yes. I dare say, that's the fellow.
-Let's get him.

Reginald, I disagree!

I would like a "bunny."

What kind of "bunny"?
A semi-automatic "bunny"...

...or a hand-held "bunny"?

Whichever "bunny" you think
is better for shooting a guy in the head.

PETER: There you are.
I've been looking all over.

Look, I gotta call off the hit on my wife.
Where's the don?

The don?
I don't know what you're talking about.

Come on.
The don, the captain of the mafia.

Peter, there is no such
thing as the mafia.

"The don's daughter is getting married
tomorrow. Here's my invitation.

"Now get the asterisk-percent-ampersand
out of here, you SOB."

What's a SOB?

<i>Dharma, come down from that couch.</i>

<i>Uh-uh, goofy. Why don't you come up?</i>

<i>You know what? I think I will!</i>

[Audience laughing on TV]

Boy, what a mismatched pair.
A free spirit and a puppet.

LOIS: Peter, thank God.
Did you take care of that thing?

That thing? You mean that growth?

Yeah. I had the doctor look at that.

Mr. Griffin, that isn't a growth.
That's your penis.

-What about the--
-Testicles.

[Disbelieving sigh]

Peter, I'm talking about the mob hit!

-Mom's gonna get whacked?
-What did you do?

Oh, dear,
there are so many people to thank.

God, of course, and who else?
This is so unexpected.

Oh, yes. Satan.

I'm sorry, Lois. The hit's still on.
All I got was this wedding invitation.

Wait a second.

The don's daughter's wedding.
That's perfect.

It's not that perfect.
We'll probably have to buy a gift.

And I am bad
when it comes to buying gifts.

Happy freaking birthday, Lois!

My goodness, it's...

...another sword. Thank you, Peter.

Go ahead. Try it on.

Didn't you see <i>The Godfather</i>?

A don can't refuse a favor
on the day of his daughter's wedding.

So?

So we can ask him for a favor.

So?

So we ask him to call off the hit.

-So?
-So....

Peter, I don't know how to explain it
any clearer than that.

MEG: You can go
and ask them not to kill Mom.

No way. It's too dangerous.

I got you into this,
and I'll get you out of it.

No, Peter.

When we got married, we agreed
to share our lives, good times and bad.

-So?
-So we'll solve this problem.

-Wait? You mean together?
-Yes.

Because together we can do anything...

...face any foe, overcome any obstacle.

Yeah, climb any mountain,
rent any video, dial any phone.

And not just our phone, Lois.
Other people's phones. Decent phones!

God-fearing phones!
Phones that everybody else gave up on...

...but we knew better,
because we were a team!

What the hell are you talking about?

COMPUTER: <i>Turn right at fork in road.</i>

<i>In Soviet Russia, road forks you!</i>

Boy, is that getting old.

I don't know about this.
What if something happens to you?

I'm too old to start dating again.

Okay. Bachelor Number One.

I'm an ice cream cone.
How are you gonna eat me?

I'd invite my friend Rudy over...

...and the two of us
would give you a "double dip."

WOMAN: Okay, Bachelor Number Two.

I'd lick off all the cream and give you
my special whipped topping.

WOMAN: Sounds good.
Bachelor Number Three?

I would try to eat you really fast
before I got flaccid.

I'll be fine.
All we have to do is blend in.

No problem.

-David Schwimmer?
-Yeah, hey.

-What are you gonna ask the don for?
-World peace.

[Laughing]

Number 34!

Right here!

Peter, my good friend.

How good of you to come
and show your respect...

<i>...on this,</i>
<i>the day of my daughter's wedding.</i>

Yeah, sorry I didn't bring a gift.
But the stores were mobbed.

I mean "mobbed" as in "crowded."

Not "mobbed" as in you guys.

[Laughing]

-Who is this enchanting woman?
-This is my wife, Lois.

-Your Honor, sir, we've come to ask--
-Let me handle this.

Peter, I thought we were a team.

Listen, your don-ness.
I got a little favor to ask you.

Go ahead. As you know...

...I am obligated to grant one favor...

...on this,
the day of my daughter's wedding.

While you ask me
for this one and only favor...

...I will sit here and enjoy
this very fine tiramisu.

-Can I have a piece?
-Granted. Next.

Crap.

I'm sorry I used up our favor, Lois.
You know what? Here. It's yours.

No, really. I insist.

Peter, I'm gonna be killed!
Does that mean nothing to you?

Of course it does.
It means everything to me.

Oh, God! What have I done?

BRIDE: I'm not marrying you!

GROOM: I'm not marrying you,
you spoiled guinea.... Whoops.

My daughter, what is the problem
you are having on this...

...the day of my daughter's wedding?

Larry wants to whack someone
on our honeymoon!

It's my job, all right?
This is what I do.

You two should stop fighting
and listen to each other.

Marriage is a partnership.

If you really love someone,
you've gotta work together as a team.

Like, I learned that the hard way.

I didn't listen to what my
wife had to say,

and now she's as good as dead.

Peter.

That's awful. Is this your wife?

Yeah. That's Lois.

[Sniffing]

I guess we could postpone our trip.

We won't have to. I don't believe this!
She's the one I'm supposed to whack.

[All laughing]

Peter!

Please, don,
you've got to do me one more favor.

I love my wife more than anything
in the world.

Can you please shoot me instead of her?

Such tenderness and love on this,
the day of my daughter's wedding.

Why don't I just call off the hit?

Yeah. That could work. Wait!
We're a team.

Is that okay with you?
Because your opinion matters.

Yes! Let's get the hell out of here!

Thank you for a lovely time.

Yeah, it's the blue sedan.

-No tips, sir.
-Nice kid.

I think I handled that pretty good,
but I would like a second opinion.

Here it is.

[Kissing]

Oh, my God! Our car!

Oh, man. Am I glad I caught you.
I almost forgot. Don't start your car.

Thanks for coming.

What a horrible night.

It's not so bad, Lois.
I learned my lesson.

And best of all,
nobody important got hurt.

Really! What could possibly happen
if you left me home by myself?

Great party, Griff.

Jimmy, make yourself at home.

Hey, thanks.

All right, son.
I'm gonna need those two hams back.

I don't have any hams.

Lift up your shirt, son.

I need an adult!

You're not a shoplifter!

You're just a fat kid.
Sorry about that, Fatty Fat Fatty.

Hey, Tom! He's just a fat kid!

Aren't you, Fatty?
You're just a big old fat kid.

-Here's some chocolate, Fatso.
-Thanks!

-Brian, flea collars are on sale.
-Too many chemicals.

a more natural alternative.

[Screaming]

Sorry, Dr. Ling. I guess I'm nervous.
This whole thing is a little weird.

Never you fear, laddie-buck.
I've been doing this all me life.

You see,
the reason your fleas are drawn to you...

...is your kidney energy
is being blocked by a dark chi.

Oh, my gosh!
Stewie, you've got bugs on your jammies.

-Peter, wake up!
-What?

Stewie's covered with fleas!

That's nothing. Once when I was a kid,
I was covered with ticks.

Peter, it's not a contest.

It was back then.

[Gasps]

Oh, no. Brian.

That's it! Time for doggie
to go the way of Old Yeller.

Old Yeller, did I get a call from Tony?

Oh, yeah. He left a message.
I forgot to tell you.

Is it on the machine?

I erased it.

All right, out back.

No, Ma. Yeller's my dog. I'll do it.

Come on! He'll call back!

[Grunting]

Brian, are you okay?

Okay?

I'm covered in fleas, lady!
I'm losing it here!

Dad, I'm itchy! I'm itchy!

MEG: Out of my way, wide load!
Mom, there's fleas all over the house!

PETER: There's one thing to do.

earn their trust...

And in time,
our differences will be forgotten.

Logan, you son of a bitch!

You think I'd miss this party?

I feel terrible about this whole thing.

Why don't I put us up
at a nice hotel for a while?

That's a great idea, Brian.
It'll be like a little vacation.

You might want to bring some cash.

You know,
some places don't take credit cards.

But, Mister, I need real money.
I can't take a credit card.

No paper trail? What are you selling?

Reefer, crack, smack, horse,
X, shrooms, dust, meth?

And it's so clean.

No. You can't swim with your shirt on.

Wait a second.
What are you hiding under your shirt?

PETER: Are you bruised?
Did somebody hit you?

Lois, what did you do to my son?

Will you keep your voice down?
You're embarrassing him.

What? If I wanted to embarrass him,
I'd do something like this.

Hey, everybody!

Look what Chris Griffin's father,
Peter Griffin is doing!

Stop it!

Why don't you want to take your shirt off?

I'm sorry, sir. You can't park your van
on the diving board.

This is my son!

My apologies.

Hey, Tom! He's not a van!
He's just a fat kid!

Don't listen to him.

You there, I'm ready to get out!

Somebody! Oh, my! What was that?

Hello, Mr. Water Jet.

MEG: You ready to--
STEWIE: Go away!

You're not fat.

You just come from a long line
of husky Griffins.

Like your great-great-great uncle,
Jabba the Griffin.

<i>Raja nabadua gola wookie nipple pinchie.</i>

Honey, if you want to lose weight,
I'll put you on a diet...

-...and your father can help you exercise.
-Really?

Why not do what the supermodels do?

Stick your finger in your throat
and throw up until you're skinny.

Don't listen to your sister.

Sticking your finger down your throat
doesn't make you throw up.

[Vomit gushing]

Peter, you okay?

Meatloaf for us, and a very special...

...very delicious steamed vegetable dish
for Chris.

I hate vegetables.

Honey, they're good for you.

It tastes like a monkey.
A monkey that's past his prime.

This meatloaf is a symphony of flavor.

It's too bad you can't have some.
It's practically orgasmic!

Oh, yes!

[Faking orgasm]

I'll have what he's having.

PETER: Okay, Chris.

Time for some old-fashioned exercise
like those guys are doing.

I say, Phineas,
great day to be doing squat thrusts...

...and lifting our huge

I'm gonna get you!

Come on. You can do it.
Feel the burn, Chris.

PETER: Atta boy.
All the way upstream, buddy.

[Screaming]

Okay, just relax.
Try to soil yourself, like we practiced.

Dad, this says I gained weight.

That's impossible. Take off your shirt.

What the hell is that?

and he hasn't lost a pound.

about his weight...

....why don't you just suck the fat out?

If you can find a hole on him that
you want to put your lips on, be my guest.

CLEVELAND: I'm talking about liposuction.

My brother Broderick's
a cosmetic surgeon.

Is he good?

Well, Nell Carter used to be twice as big
before Broderick got through with her.

FYI, he used the fat he took out of her...

...to make the two kids from <i>Good Burger</i>.

This is a very safe procedure, son.

You won't feel a thing.
I'm like a Green Beret, you know?

I sneak inside you and I skulk around
like it's Vietnam or something.

I'm sneaking through the bush, you know?

And I get all that fat like it's
my buddies stuck behind enemy lines...

...and when I got all my buddies,
I sneak out again.

I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you.

Like the wind, you know.

Good boy, Stewie. Clean plate.

-Although I think you got--
-Yes! I got more of it on me than in me.

That one never gets old.

Here's your dessert, sweetie. Dig in.

I'll eat it when I'm ready!

CHRIS: Hi.
STEWIE: I'm ready!

Time for dessert, isn't it?
Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie.

And we have something very tasty
for big fat you.

Bon appétit.

Oh, and feel free to use my fork.
I shan't be needing it.

Watch me. That's it. Watch this.

Stewie, stop eating like a little piggy.
We should cut down on your sweets.

You're starting to get a little
Buddha belly. Chris, where have you been?

Dad took me to a doctor
to get the fat vacuumed out of my belly.

What?

I didn't do it. I'm just gonna stay
on my diet and exercise.

Good for you.
That was a very grown-up decision.

I mean, what kind of lazy, narcissistic...

...irresponsible moron would
even consider doing something...

...as unbelievably foolish
as getting liposuction.

Who, I ask you. Who?

Hello.

[Stuttering]

My God! It's finally happened.

He's become so massive he's collapsed
into himself like a neutron star!

MEG: Mom, can I get lipo, too?

Forget it, Meg.

Peter, you can't just suck 200 pounds
of fat out of yourself. It's not natural.

Come on, Lois. I feel great dropping
that kind of weight all at once.

Remember how good you felt
after you had Chris?

And they're off!

Well then, giddy up.

[Laughing]

PETER: Great to be thin.
BRIAN: Yup.

You know, there's something
I always wanted to do, Brian.

But I could never do it
because I was so heavy.

But now that I don't weigh so much,
I think I can.

Could you help me do it?

Sure, I'd be honored.

I was wondering if I could put
a little saddle on your back...

...and ride you like a horsy.

Okay. No, I understand.

It's too much. It's okay.

BRIAN: I like Hillary Clinton.
I don't care what anyone says.

<i>Peter, what are you....</i>

<i>I can feel all the bones in your ass!</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

I see you.

[Laughing]

But, Mom, it could change my life!

Meg, for the last time,
you're not getting plastic surgery.

Why not? It's totally safe.
A lot of famous people have done it.

My son, your place is here
in the ice village.

You know nothing of Hollywood
and its ways.

But, Father, I have dreams, and courage...

...and the name
of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.

Fear not. Someday word will reach you
about the success of me...

...the great Eskimo actor,
Jennifer Love Hewitt!

MAN #1: Bring pride to our village!

MAN #2: Send firewood.

She's right, Lois.
Plastic surgery is great!

I want Broderick
to take a look at my nose.

It doesn't matter
if your nose is a little bulbousy...

...or your eyes are too close together,
or your chest is flabby.

You are who you are.

I think I know what you're getting at.

Knock-knock.

Hey, you can't just walk in
here without.... Holy crap, it's Peter!

CHRIS: Dad, you're pretty, like a girl.

You look like a totally different person.

This is crazy!

You walk in here
with your chiseled jaw and your....

Oh, my. I liked you the way you were.

<i>You're not even real anymore.</i>

Did you get a new buttocks?

I had to. My old one had a crack in it.

[Laughing]

I couldn't be more angry with you.

[Moaning]

LOIS: You really let this family down.

We should be embracing
the things God gave us.

Not telling our kids you're not as good
as others because of the way you look.

PETER: Holy crap!

Look. There's a baby in that refuse bin!

Not too close, Barnaby. If you touch it,
the mother won't take it back.

Alley-oop!

Excuse me, sir.

What is a handsome man like you
doing waiting in line?

I need an adult!

Warren Fredericks.
Quahog Beautiful People's Club.

WARREN: Come on in front.
PETER: But people were in front of me.

You haven't been beautiful very long,
have you?

Gorgeous guys like us
don't have to wait in line.

Haven't you noticed? People will do
anything for a beautiful person.

Yeah. You know, come to think of it....

Hi, I'm on a scavenger hunt.
And I need a human foot.

Well, as a rule, I would say no,
but okay, come in.

So this is what?
This for like a school project or some....

[Screaming]

Raul, please take this handsome
gentleman's bags to his car.

PETER: Thank you.

Hey, when you're beautiful,
doors magically open for you.

Actually, it opened because you stepped
on that black rubber square.

<i>Of course, if that wasn't there, it would</i>
<i>open anyway because you're beautiful.</i>

PETER: Wow!

There's a lot of good looking people here.

Of course. This is the
Quahog Beautiful People's Club.

You're our newest member.
Here's your introductory basket.

It's got some scented lotions,
Ferrari sunglasses...

...and of course,
pills to make your bowel movements...

...smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.

[Creaking]

[Creaking]

STEWIE: Damn it!

What happened? Orson fall down?

STEWIE: Shut up! I don't want to hear it!

It serves you right.

You spent all that time taunting Chris,
now you have an eating disorder.

STEWIE: Help me up!

You know I would, but my doctor
advised me against heavy lifting.

STEWIE: Oh, hardy har har.

<i>What the devil are you doing?</i>

<i>Stop it! I'm getting dizzy!</i>

<i>Blast!</i>

Peter, did you paste a new picture
of yourself on our wedding portrait?

-Yeah. I think it looks better.
-You pasted it over me.

PETER: Yeah. I think it looks better.

Have you lost your mind?

Somebody is jealous!

Have you forgotten about Chris?
He needs you to help him exercise.

He finally figured out
how to catch the Twinkie.

I'm turning you into poo!

I'm going down
to The Beautiful People's Club.

I guess I can bring him.

Seeing us all in one place
might give him something to shoot for.

LOIS: The Beautiful People's Club?
I never heard of that.

I can't say anymore.

I'm probably already in trouble
for mentioning it to a....

Well, we call you "normies." Okay, 'bye.

Are you gonna take that?

-Lois!
-What? Oh, Brian.

[Stuttering]

I was seeing if the driveway....

That wasn't even a sentence.

You were ogling Peter
like a horny schoolgirl.

I can't help it!

I know. He's become
a superficial egomaniacal jerk...

...but I've never
been more attracted to him.

Does that make me a bad person?

Yes, it does make you a bad person.

WARREN: Peter, good to see you.

Come with me. I've got a lot of tall,
statuesque people I want you to meet.

-What's that?
-That's my son, Chris.

He can't come in. He's fat.

Let me tell you something, buddy,
if my son can't come in...

...then I'll just come in!

-See you at home.
-But, Dad....

Trust me, Chris.
Sometimes it's better not to fit in.

[Helicopter flying overhead]

You're all stupid.
They'll be looking for Army guys.

CHRIS: Don't look at me! I'm hideous!

LOIS: How could you treat Chris that way?

You know he's self-conscious
about his weight!

What are you getting mad at me for?
He gets his fat from your genes.

Which, by the way, I'm wearing.

I hate what you've become!

Why don't you go back to the doctor
to suck the fat out of your head?

Maybe I will!
And then I'll put it on my feet...

...and skate on Paul Bunyan's
giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!

That doesn't make any sense.

It doesn't have to. I'm beautiful!

You're not welcome here! Go away!

Wow, Chris. Did you lose weight?

Maybe. I've been working out.

You look wicked skinny.
I'm like, jealous.

Thanks, Meg.
I'm jealous of your mustache.

I don't have a mustache, do I?

Oh, honey. It's fine.
It makes you look distinguished.

But, Mom!

I think all my children are beautiful.

Damn you, ice cream. Come to my mouth.

How dare you disobey me.

What are you looking at,
you infantile, stupid....

That's right. Damn you and such.

You can burn in hell.

[Yawning]

She is so jealous.

Of course, I'm beautiful.

I mean, look at me.

How strange....

Should watch road but can't look away.

<i>Too beautiful.</i>

[Screaming]

[Peter gulping]

Well, Mr. Griffin,
the bandages are ready to come off.

I think I should tell you,
it's a miracle that you're alive at all.

We did all we can.
But medical science has come just so far.

[Gasping]

And now I will take off this protective
Potato Head mask.

Oh, Peter! You look like you!

I can't believe you're all still standing
by my side after what a jerk I was.

Especially to you. I'm sorry, Chris.

That's okay, Dad.

Well, Peter, I guess you learned
a pretty valuable lesson.

Nope!

[Theme music]
S02E18.en
LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"on which we used to rely?

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

all the things that make us

"laugh 'n' cry

"He's a family guy"

Okay, here's another riddle.
A woman has two children.

And a homicidal maniac tells her
she can only keep one.

Which one does she let him kill?

That's not a riddle. That's just terrible!

Wrong! The ugly one!

CLEVELAND: Peter,
check out my new trampoline!

JOE: Whoa, mama! Yeah!

Jeez, Cleveland.
That must've set you back, huh?

What'd you do? Sell your body to science?

Because I thought of doing that.

All right. Jenny, would you come up here
and show us where the femur is?

[Scary noises and laughing]

PETER: Get out of here,
you little bastard.

I knew this was the right thing to do.

No. I just got a big tax refund.

Uncle Sam sent me $500.

I got $600!

I got $850!

CHARLIE BROWN: I got a rock.

I spent my refund on a digital TV
with Surround Sound.

With headphones, I can watch
Steven Seagal films...

...without waking Bonnie.

Yes! Lock and load! Bring on the pain!

I spent my refund on a plug-in Playmate.

So, schoolteacher.
That must be interesting.

I'm getting something really special, too.

And by special, I don't mean
like that Klinemann boy down the street.

More special like Special K, the cereal.

What did they do with the regular K?

And for that matter,
whatever happened to Kaye Ballard?

You know, if you said "mallard"
with a cold...

...it would sound like "Ballard".

-Do you listen to yourself?
-I drift in and out.

[Cheery instrumental music]

Rupert, the word "gullible"
is not in the dictionary.

You don't believe me? Here. Look it up!

What? What's that? It really isn't?
Rupert, touché!

Hoisted by my own petard.

[Laughing]

I am so alone.

Everybody, my tax refund is here.

I'm gonna buy us something
we've always wanted.

-A cat?
-A stereo?

A pool?

PETER: I'm sorry. It is a pool.
STEWIE: Joy unbounded!

MEG: Go, Daddy!
CHRIS: I'll feed it and take care of it!

Oh, my God! It's better than I thought!
An Audi! I'm getting a car!

Peter, there's a "t" in there.
That says "Audit."

No, Brian. It's a foreign car.
The "t" is silent. Sweet!

-I'm getting an Audi!
-I have an innie.

-Miss Stratford?
-Come in, Mr. Griffin. Don't be nervous.

The IRS is much kinder and gentler
than we used to be. You smell nice.

What? That must be you.

No. It couldn't be me. I just farted.

I just have a few questions
about your return.

Did you incur any medical expenses
this year?

You can write off medical stuff? Jeez.

Had I known, I wouldn't have used
that discount surgeon.

[Medical equipment beeping]

DOCTOR: I'm not sure which to cut here,
the red one or the blue one.

Okay. Just relax. Let's see.

First, why don't you attach
that green one to that purple one?

DOCTOR: Okay, here goes.

DOCTOR: Oh, God!

That kill me? I was afraid of that.

Try the green one and the blue one.

Mr. Griffin, you don't owe
any additional money.

But unfortunately,
you're not entitled to a refund.

[Screaming]

Mr. Griffin, are you okay?

Sorry, I still haven't gotten
over the loss of <i>Party of Five</i>.

It'll take some time to get over it.
Now what were you saying?

You're not entitled to a refund.

[Screaming]

-I'm sorry. Come again?
-You're not entitled to a refund.

[Screaming]

Was that for <i>Party of Five</i>, too?

No. That was for my refund.
What the hell's <i>Party of Five</i>?

By God, I may not be able to give
my family a vibrating sex doll.

But at least I can give them a pool.

If you find a human skeleton...

...with a Lincoln Log in the temple,
I didn't do it.

I need that log to finish my recreation
of James Madison's cabin.

I don't want anyone swimming in this
pool unless there's a lifeguard on duty.

[Laughing]

Doodie. Diarrhea.

-Hey, Lois.
-What?

Diarrhea.

[Laughing]

Peter, I'm holding iced tea!

Honey, you don't have to do this.

Maybe a pool is another one of those
things our family doesn't really need.

Look everybody! I got us another dog!

-What the....
-Hi. You guys have any Cheez Doodles?

That's what I do. I ask for a snack
and then I blow the horn.

-Look. It's some kind of plastic root.
-There's no such thing as a plastic root.

SEAGAL: <i>You bastards come to our village,</i>
<i>and kill our fish, pollute our water.</i>

<i>I'm gonna send you back to hell</i>

[Seals barking]

[Dramatic music playing]

No!

[Doll vibrating]

DOLL: <i>Good-bye.</i>
QUAGMIRE: Damn it!

I fixed the power line.

But the town's zoning laws prohibit
building a pool back there.

What do you mean? It's my yard!

I'm sorry,
your house is too close to the curb.

Yeah?
Your eyes are too close to your nose!

That may be. But you know what?

I only have to wear one goggle
when I go swimming in my pool!

-Hey, wait! Come back here!
-What?

I have to draw you!

You're why cavemen painted on walls!

Damn government! Tell me I can't
build a pool on my own land.

After my grandfather helped create...

...one of this country's
most beloved cartoon characters.

Okay. We've narrowed it down
to two possible names.

All in favor of "Bugs Bunny"?

And all in favor
of "Ephraim the Retarded Rabbit"?

You can all go to hell!

-Where's the Mayor's office?
-Last door on the left.

Come on. Come on.

Hello, is this the--

Sorry. I thought
you were the District Attorney.

No. I'm Peter Griffin.

You're here about your pool.
Step into my office.

I'm here to serve
the fine citizens of Quahog.

It'd be my pleasure to give you a permit.

It's about time!

-This is odd.
-What?

I've never encountered anything
like this before...

...but your property
doesn't seem to be on the map.

MAYOR: It's not part of Quahog.
PETER: What?

I've been living at 31 Spooner Street
for 12 years.

Sorry. But according to this map, you're
not even part of these United States.

Which would make you a Communist!

[Screaming]

[Alarm buzzing]

Damn!
Usually my malcontents are skinnier.

Would you come back in a week...

...when my fat malcontent trap door
will be completed?

I am not coming back in a week or ever!
I've had it with you!

I've had it with this whole government!

Fine!

I love this job more than I love taffy.

And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy.

[Contented chewing]

What's going on?
Did the city give you the permit?

No. We're not part of the city.
We're not even part of this country.

-And that makes us our own country!
-What are you talking about?

Thanks to a technicality,
we have the right to secede from the US.

From this day forth,
this territory will be known as Petoria!

I'd call it Peterland, but that gay bar
by the airport already took it.

Our lead story tonight, Petoria.

A new foreign country, founded this week
right here in our own backyard!

And in a <i>Quahog News 5</i> exclusive,
we sent our own little foreigner...

...Asian correspondent, Trisha Takanawa,

to Petoria
where First Lady Lois Griffin...

...has graciously agreed to give us a tour
of her country. Trisha.

Thank you, Diane.

So, Mrs. Griffin, what's it like
being the woman behind the man?

When Peter first said we were
our own country, I was a bit skeptical.

But then I thought,
I could be like Hillary Clinton.

Only, without the penis.

Tell us a little bit about your country.

We're a clean, industrious people,
mostly white.

My son, Chris,
is in charge of our space program.

We hope to get to the moon very shortly.

Almost....

[Screaming]

CHRIS: They should really use
monkeys for this.

And little Stewie here
is our President of Poopie.

[Sarcastic laughing]

So where is the President now?

He's out on a goodwill mission to America.

CLEVELAND: Here you go, Mr. President.
"Mr. President."

Peter, that tickles me in a way...

...that if Loretta tickled me
in that way, I'd say:

"Oh, yeah. That's nice. That's the spot."

What are you talking about?
I'm a born leader.

Like my great-great uncle
Ulysses S. Griffin.

SOLDIERS: Chug-a-lug!

How's that, Robert E. Lee?

All right, no more slaves.
But we still don't have to read books!

Deal.

[Soldiers cheering]

Barkeep, petro-nemo-slappy-wag.

That's Petorian for
"More beer, you slappy-wag."

You still owe me for the other rounds,
which comes to $50.

I'm a foreign diplomat.
I don't pay for drinks.

Do you think G. Gordon Liddy
paid for his drinks while he was...

...strangling people with piano wire
for the good of our nation?

Peter, you can't drink that outside.
You could end up in jail.

Not the good jail like on Cinemax.
The "man" jail.

Go back and pay the bill, Peter.
You don't want to break the law.

I can do whatever I want. Watch this.

Now you're just being crazy.

That's against the law!
You're coming with me!

Can't touch me.

[MC Hammer's <i>Can't Touch This</i> plays]

PETER: [Singing] "Can't touch me

"Just like the bad guy
from <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>

"I've got diplomatic immunity
So Hammer, you can't sue

"I can write graffiti

"I can riot, loot, not give a hoot

<i>This session of the United Nations...</i>

<i>...is hereby convened.</i>

Man, this sucks. Podium guy!
I've got a problem here!

-Excuse me. Some of us are here to learn.
-No one's talking to you, Albania.

<i>Is there a problem back there?</i>

You bet your funny accent
there's a problem.

I'm stuck up here in the nosebleeds.
I am president of Petoria.

I want a better seat!

Of course. How could we not have
recognized the great nation of Petoria?

<i>Have a seat up front.</i>

That's more like it!

<i>And would you </i>
<i>also like a special satellite</i>

<i>that can scratch your ass...</i>

<i>...with a laser beam from space?</i>

They have those?

[Laughing]

Hi, how you doing? You mind if I....

-They don't respect you.
-What do you mean?

Listen to me. I was
the laughing stock around here...

...until my country invaded Kuwait.
Now I have a seat in the third row.

Look, the only way to get respect
around here...

...is to find something you want
and just take it!

If everybody respects you, how come
you're still eating here by yourself?

I don't shower.

That's what that is.
Take what I want, huh?

PETER: Good morning, Joe.
JOE: What are you doing in my pool?

This is the newest province of Petoria.
I call it "Johio."

What? You can't just come over here
and annex my pool!

Yeah? According to paragraph seven,
sentence three, word eight...

...of the Geneva Convention, "The."
So tough luck, Swanson.

[Ominous instrumental music]

So, as you can see,
Petoria has invaded U.S. soil.

-What are our options?
-A military strike against such a small...

...nation could cause
an international backlash.

True. But this kind of behavior
can't be tolerated.

Agreed. I suggest we start
with political sanctions.

Very good, gentlemen.

[Cheery instrumental music]

I guess the world will show me
a little more respect now.

Dad, I tried to go to school,
but this guy won't let me.

-Yeah? Him and what army?
-The US Army.

That's a good army.

DIANE: <i>The scene outside</i>
<i>the US/Petorian border...</i>

<i>...as the sun rises on Day 1</i>
<i>of Operation Desert Clam.</i>

Good morning, I'm Diane Simmons.

We now go to Tom Tucker, live at the site
of the US blockade. Tom.

Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front
where the US has cut off electricity...

...water, and gas to the
tiny four-bedroom republic.

The situation is very tense
and extremely dangerous.

It's only a matter of time before....

Oh, my God! They've opened fire!

It looks like things
are getting very heated here.

This is not a safe place to be.

[Bubble wrap popping]

[Slide whistle blowing]

And now, sports.

PETER: Lois?

LOIS: Over here, honey.
I'm chopping carrots for a salad.

<i>Here. Use this headlamp.</i>

PETER: Where's the kids?

LOIS: Upstairs, doing their homework
by candlelight.

PETER: Damn pig-dog Americans
messing with my family like this!

LOIS: Honey, we can't bathe.
We can't do laundry. There's no heat.

We can't live like this forever.

PETER: It's not forever.
You know, it's just....

LOIS: Peter, I'm up here. Sweetie.

<i>Maybe you should go over to Joe's</i>
<i>and return his pool, huh?</i>

PETER: Forget it! We're a real country.

And we deserve all the rights
that everyone else gets.

LOIS: But we have to think
about the welfare of our children!

Stewie, is that you?

PETER: Look, my mind is made up.

I'm not giving up an inch
of Petorian soil.

LOIS: It's not a sign of weakness
to compromise.

<i>I just think you should....</i>
<i>Peter, stop staring at my chest!</i>

BRIAN: Oh, yeah. Sorry, Lois.

And we're back with our round table
discussion on the Petorian crisis.

You were making a point, John?

Yes. What the United States is doing
to Petoria right now is criminal!

Nonsense! Force is the only thing
a despot like Peter Griffin understands.

ATLANTA: Fine.
Why don't we just drop a bomb on him?

MODERATOR: What about that, Eleanor?

It's ridiculous, clearly.
He's a factory worker, not a despot.

That's not the point. Our blockade is

turning Petoria
into a third world country.

[Theme from <i>The Brady Bunch</i>]

Can anybody tell me what the square root
of the hypotenuse is when....

LOIS: Chris, is that a note?
CHRIS: No.

Yes, it is. Would you like to read it
to the rest of the class?

-No.
-Just read it, Lardo.

-"I think Mrs. Griffin's hot."
-Go to your room.

Damn you, Rupert!

Keep these loathsome insects away
from me or you'll end up like Mr. Giraffe.

SUSAN: Hi. I'm Susan Sarandon. A lot
of you know me as Tim Robbins' mother.

But I'm actually his girlfriend.
And this is Stewie.

What the deuce?

STEWIE: For less than a ticket to one
of my films about capital punishment...

...or neo-feminism, you can make sure
that Stewie never goes hungry again.

Yes, and from the look
of those sweater cows, so can you.

Good morning, subjects.
What's for breakfast?

Nothing, you idiot.
We don't have any food.

Peter, this has gotten way out of hand.
Look at what we're reduced to!

Our own baby has to use
newspapers for diapers!

No, no. This is fine. One second.

I'm just about finished
with <i>Family Circus</i>.

[Grunting]

There we are. Who did that, Jeffie?
Not me.

My God. We haven't been this miserable
since that time we were tortured.

[Distant screaming]

I'm sorry. Were you just whipping me?
Or did I just get bit by a mosquito?

Lois, if you happen to see
the dungeon master, can you tell him...

...his grandmother just tried
to work me over?

It's time to call this whole thing off!
Nobody's on our side!

Are you nuts? Look at all these telegrams.

"Nice going, Libya."
"You da man, North Korea."

"Great job, Iraq."
Iraq, Lois! You know what?

I'm gonna invite a few of these fellas
over for a party.

[Helicopters flying overhead]

See, Lois? I told you we had allies.
Slobodan, you made it!

I didn't know what to bring.
So I made coleslaw.

It's made out of people! Just kidding.
Is Muammar here yet?

Yeah. He's over there with Saddam.

And then Jerry guessed
that her name was "Mulva."

That show is so funny. It really
reminds me of me and my friends.

How we hang out before I kill them
for worshipping the wrong god.

Yeah. And I love that Kramer guy.
He comes in the room like this.

I can't do it, but you know.

-Marco.
-Polo.

Fish out of water!

[Laughing]

Yes, those are looking good. Yes.
Manuel? Manuel, do you want....

Can you ask him if he wants cheese?

Fidel, no running around the pool!

I say, Ahmed.

What is that thing you do when
you're about to assassinate an infidel?

You mean this?

[High-pitched wailing]

Oh, God. Yes, I love that.

Stewie!

This is insanity!

Whoa, where do you think you're going?

America! I've had enough. You can keep
this filthy mess you call a country!

LOIS: Come on, kids.
STEWIE: This is treason!

For God's sake, Peter,
make an example of her!

Nothing says "Obey Me"
like a bloody head on a fence post.

Let's go. We're crossing the border.
Good-bye, President Griffin.

Brian, at least you're loyal enough
to stay with me.

I've stuck by you through worse.

[Screaming]

I guess it's you and me
against the world, buddy.

GENERAL: <i>Attention, President Griffin.</i>

<i>As you may presently yourself fully</i>
<i>be aware of, my grammar sucks.</i>

<i>But more importantly...</i>

<i>...we're about to commence Operation:</i>
<i>Bomb the Crap Out of Your House.</i>

<i>The guy who thinks up the names</i>
<i>is on vacation. Fire!</i>

[Rocket flying]

To answer your question,
something like that.

<i>The guy who aims is in the john.</i>
<i>Here he is.</i>

<i>The next one's coming right at you.</i>

Face it, Peter. It's over.

Why don't you sit down with the mayor
and negotiate a treaty?

Negotiate? Peter Griffin doesn't know
the meaning of the word "negotiate."

Can I tie you to a stick
and use you as a white flag?

Thank you all for coming.

We invited Jesse Jackson
to open our negotiations with a prayer.

[Impressed exclaiming]

Unfortunately, he couldn't make it.
So in his place, we have LaToya Jackson.

Thanks. Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub. Yay, God!

How very inappropriate. Thank you.
Now, Mr. Griffin, would you like to begin?

After much thought and consideration...

...I have decided
to make a concession or two.

-Very good, Peter.
-First, I will return Joe's pool.

You got that right!

In exchange, I demand access to it
on alternate weekends.

No!

Accepted. I also demand to remain
my own independent nation.

-Absolutely not.
-How about you just give me your pen?

This cheap little pen
we have millions of back at the office?

-Yeah.
-No.

So after all this, I end up with nothing?

How about this? Every night
when you get home from work...

...I'll scratch your back
with a matchbook cover, like you like.

Lois. Would you call me
"Big Rudy" when you do it?

No.

TEACHER: And that's the story of Petoria.
A little nation that, 200 years ago...

...seceded and repatriated
in less than a week.

TEACHER: Any questions?
STUDENT: Yeah. I don't get it.

So can the family understand the baby?
Or what's the deal with that?

ANUS: <i>Yeah. Come on in, sis.</i>

ANUS: <i>Well, the other day I told Jane her</i>

The old alma mater.

I tell you,
there's something magical about Brown.

Brown's the color of poo!

[Laughing]

Yes. Yes, it is.

I haven't been
on a college campus in years.

LOIS: Everything seems so different.
STEWIE: Really?

If you laid on your back with your ankles
behind your ears, it would ring a bell.

PETER:
Excuse me. We're here to see the dean.

Nobody sees the dean! Not nobody!
Not no how!

I'm sorry. Can I help you?

Yes. This is Meg Griffin.

She's here to see the Dean of Admissions.

And we'd like it
if she got into the university.

Go on, take it.

Wait over there.

My days in college were so exciting.

This one time the National Guard came
and shot some of my friends.

You must be the Griffins. Come in.

Oops, honey! You got a little smudge.

Hey, you got something
on your other cheek, too.

And this is Pembroke Quad.

Oh, very nice. Very<i> Brideshead Revisited</i>.

I'll tell you, being on this campus
really brings back memories.

[Gasps]

[Sad instrumental music]

Cowards!

What ho! A veritable bevy of coeds.

I say, the most recent
campus sporting event...

...was disappointing for our side,
wasn't it?

Oh, aren't you adorable!
Are you in a fraternity, little boy?

Not yet. But I'm thinking about joining
I FELTA THI.

[Laughing]

So, what do you think
of this Music Television?

If I remember correctly,
this is the Physics Department.

That explains all the gravity.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

I say, it's like the spice rack
in my fantasy kitchen.

SCIENTIST: Hold on, little fella.
This is just for big people.

Why don't you come back
in about 17 years?

But the shelf life of that
sodium pentothal is only two years and--

Blast!

This isn't the first time
I've been thwarted by my small stature.

<i>Okay. Our next lot is number 15</i>
<i>in your program.</i>

<i>This is a one-of-a-kind item.</i>
<i>A super mega-death ray.</i>

<i>It's got the power to enslave</i>
<i>the entire human race.</i>

<i>Do we have an opening bid?</i>

[Stewie exclaiming frantically]

<i>Anything? We'll take any bid.</i>

<i>It can enslave the human race.</i>

MAN: <i>Come on! It's solid titanium.</i>
STEWIE: Over here in the back!

MAN: <i>Do I hear $100?</i>
STEWIE: Come on!

<i>$5?</i>

<i>All right, free? Enslave the human race.</i>
<i>Doesn't cost you a dime.</i>

STEWIE: Behind the fat chick!
AUCTIONEER: <i>No? Okay.</i>

[Screams]

I'm tired of being small.

[Eerie instrumental music]

I wish I was big.

[Mechanical roaring]

Blast!

Well, then let's take a look
at your transcript.

"Meg." That's not very impressive.

I mean, it's just three letters.
It's hardly a name at all.

I never wanted to call her Meg.
I wanted to call her Twiki.

But Lois said kids these days
wouldn't get the reference.

You know who I'm talking about, right?

I'm not quite sure you're Brown material.

Don't you have any
extracurricular activities at all?

I'm president of the Luke Perry Fan Club,
Quahog Chapter.

But I've wanted to go to Brown
ever since I was a little girl.

Well, actually,
I really wanted to go to Wellesley.

But my mom said...

...I might as well buy hiking boots
and call myself a lesbian right now.

Meg, eat your salad.

-We're not having dinner.
-Then just be quiet.

[Cheery instrumental music]

I have no future!

I'm just gonna wait in my room
until I'm dead.

-I'll be in shortly.
-Peter, we've got to do something.

If Meg doesn't get into college, who
knows what kind of future she'll have?

You ain't getting this meat.
This is my meat.

Shut up! I found this meat!

[Bell rings]

[Whistling]

I'm never gonna get into college.

You just need
more extracurricular activities.

You could get a part-time job.

I had one when I was in high school.

[Sirens wailing]

[Romantic instrumental music]

[Shouting]

[Screaming]

That'll be $27.50.

Come on, Meg.

There's got to be at least a hundred clubs
at your school.

I do have a friend at the
school newspaper.

Thatta girl!

I got your first story right here.

Lois, I challenge you to a race
around the world. Go!

[Maniacal laughter]

[Geeky voice] We need
a picture for the front page.

Hold on. I got to rinse my retainer.

[Deep voice] I want something tasteful...

...like the Malaysia spread
in last month's <i>Vanity Fair</i>.

[Geeky voice] That was so sweet.
It was wicked awesome.

NEIL: Stop the presses! It's Meg!

I'm just joshing. It's all done on Xerox.

What can I do you?

Look, Neil, I need an activity
to get into Brown.

The paper's my last hope.
Can I be a reporter?

I don't know, Meg.

You never seemed that interested in
journalism, or journalists such as myself.

[Sighing]

You know, I never realized how smooth
the skin between your acne is.

[Sighing]

Okay, I'll give you a shot.

I've never been able to get an interview
with the mayor.

You get it and I'll make you a reporter.

You got it.

Run, little rabbit, run.

But someday our two worlds will be one.

I sure hope my face clears up by then.

[Cheery instrumental music]

-Excuse me, Mayor West?
-How do you know my language?

Listen to me.
My entire future is in your hands.

Are you Sarah Connor?

No, I'm Meg Griffin.

-I need to interview you--
-You're with the press?

Yes.

Well, you can't interview a dead man,
can you?

[Dramatic instrumental music]

[Sirens wailing]

What about my interview?

Mayor West asked me to give you this.

Uh-oh.

Of course you realize this means war.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

No.

No, that's what they'll be expecting.

Mayor West?

Well, well, Mr. Toilet.
I thought you were in the Hamptons.

No, no, no. It's me. Meg Griffin.

Young lady, I don't talk to the press
under any circumstances.

What makes you think I'll talk now?

This!

You just don't give up, do you?

You seize life by the throat and shake it
like a topless bartender mixing a martini!

You've got your interview.

Thanks!

Hey, hey. Listen to this.

Do I sound like I'm on old-time radio?

[Cheery instrumental music]

LOIS: No more treats, Stewie.
You're going to spoil your dinner.

Oh, come on!

Oh, damn my small stature!

If I were big,
just think where I would be.

Tired of not being able to find clothes
that fit? I know I was.

That's why I started
Stewie's Big and Tall Man Shop.

<i>If you're portly or tall...</i>

<i>...you'll find a friendly atmosphere</i>
<i>with personalized and expert service.</i>

-Hi, Stewie. How's the weather up there?
-Very fair. Like our prices.

Hey, dude. You want some of these?

I say, here's the solution to my troubles.

If I could build a device to harness
the size of that leviathan...

...there's no limit to what I....

Oh, my God!
There's an orgy in my mouth!

ADAM WEST: "Got milk?"
That's a funny one, too.

<i>And, "I got ya, diagonally."</i>

"Pretty sneaky, sis."
That one's also funny.

You've been talking for an hour and I

don't have anything I can use
in my article.

MEG: Can you just please--
ADAM WEST: My God!

Somebody's stealing my water!

It just went down the drain.

They're crafty, I tell you.

It happens when you least expect it.

Show yourself, damn you!
I've been investigating him for months.

It's cost $150,000 of the
taxpayers' money.

But I'll find the culprits
if it costs me $1 million.

You spent public money
investigating this?

Thanks. You know,
I think I have my story.

Your story? Wait a minute.

You can't print that!

It'll compromise my entire investigation!

Well, thank God
she's just a figment of my imagination!

[Snoring]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Electronic beeping]

Well, let's take the old boy
out for a spin.

Eyes open.

Voice test. "I'm Chris."

I'm Chris.

"Eviscerate the proletariat."

Eviscerate the proletariat.

[Singing] "If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to

"Why don't you go where fashion sits?

"Puttin' on the Ritz"

Not my bit. But still funny.

System off.

Splendid.

MEG: I did it! I got a great story!
BRIAN: What did your editor say?

He was gone for the day.
I just left it on his desk.

But here. I brought you a copy.

Oh, my God! "Corruption in City Hall."
This is amazing.

Here. Let me see that.

This'll never get Meg on the paper.
This is old news.

There have been scandals in politics
ever since Thomas Jefferson.

Hold on.
Honey, let's get all the kids in this.

Look, I know kids.
And this story's gonna put them to sleep.

Meg needs something that's gonna pull
those kids away from...

...their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,
Spirographs, Moby Grape, and <i>90210</i>.

Luke Perry. That's it!

Brian, I got my story.

[Typing]

[Rousing instrumental music]

Now to get this story
on the school editor's desk.

It's gonna take a portion of
my cunning.... No! No! All my cunning.

[Peter humming
<i>Mission Impossible</i> theme]

[Humming climactic music]

[Cheery instrumental music]

Great story, Meg.

Oh, thanks.

Way to go, Meg!

[Applause]

Congratulations, Meg.

<i>This is the most sensational story</i>
<i>we've ever had.</i>

[Screaming]

[Ominous instrumental music]

WIFE: Luke! Luke, time for dinner!
LUKE: In a minute, babe.

I'm reading every high school newspaper
in America to see if I'm mentioned.

LUKE: Oh, my God!
Meg Griffin, you are so sued.

[Humming climactic music]

Luke Perry is suing us?

Dad, how could you do this to me?
I love Luke Perry!

Jeez, Meg! You're wasting your time.
Don't you read the papers? He's gay.

BRIAN: You can't
just print lies about people.

-Luke Perry has a wife and son.
-So what?

A lot of famous types lead secret lives
that we don't even know about.

Like Ricky Martin.

FANS: Ricky, we love you!

One minute to curtain, Jewel.

FANS: Jewel! Jewel!

I just wanted you to have something
to put on your transcript.

Thanks to you I can put down...

...I'm a big fat liar
who makes up stories about people.

It worked for Walter Cronkite.

You know that whole Vietnam thing?
Never happened.

BRIAN: But don't mention it
around the Veterans' Hospital.

Those guys are really
committed to the lie.

[Sobbing]

Don't cry, sweetheart.

I'll make it up to you.

You remember that pony
you wanted when you were six?

Well, I bought him.

And I've been saving him
for a time like this. Surprise!

Oh, God. That's right.
Ponies like food, don't they?

Oh, boy.

Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy.

But I can't help feeling
like this is somehow my fault.

No. It's Luke Perry's fault.

If he were actually gay,
Meg would be all set.

Brian, that's it!

If I could get a picture of Luke Perry
doing something gay-like...

...it'll make people believe
Meg's story is true!

How are you gonna do that?

Hey, I've gotten people to believe
crazier things.

And if you are pure of heart and deed...

...you'll all go to a beautiful place
called Heaven.

I'm yanking you.
You just rot in the ground.

<i>All right. Now walk up to the counter.</i>

[Electronic beeping]

<i>That's it. Ring the bell.</i>

Well, hi there.

<i>Good day, shopkeep.</i>

Good day, shopkeep.

I require a hand-operated buzz saw...

...capable of cutting through
a human sternum.

-What?
-It's for a school project.

I'm some sort of student sent here for....

Oh, blast! What the devil do they study?

Latin class.

Sorry, kid.
I can't sell power tools to minors.

Now, look here, you gore-bellied codpiece.

Allow me to purchase
the provisions I demand...

...or I shall transform your blue collar
into a red one and....

Who the deuce are you?

I don't have any spare change.

Where the hell would I keep it?
In my diaper?

Get out of here, you hobo!

Bloody hell. Is this thing still on?

Now, we got to be very crafty
so Luke Perry doesn't recognize us.

[Punching]

How the hell is he gonna recognize us?

He doesn't even know who we are.

Oh, yeah. You're right.

Whoa!

[Punching]

Say, you look familiar.

Yeah. I'm that guy you wish you were.

Okay, as soon as I seduce him,
get ready to snap the picture.

You're really gonna
try and seduce Luke Perry?

Listen, I'd take a bullet for Meg.

So, I'm sure I can take a....
There he is.

-Thirsty?
-No.

Jeez, the sun seems really strong!
Even for my already bronzed skin.

Look at that!
My muscles are all shiny with oil.

But how am I ever gonna spread it
on my rippling back and thighs?

This is gonna take drastic measures.
All right, get the camera ready.

Oh, Luke.

Mission accomplished. We now
have a picture of Luke Perry vomiting.

That's no good, Brian.

Gays don't vomit.
They're a very clean people.

And they have been ever since they
first came to this country from France.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Wild electronic beeping]

Hi, honey. How was school?

MEG: Just great.

I can't even say my name
without people asking me if I made it up.

How could Dad do this to me?

Honey. He wasn't doing it to you.
He was doing it for you.

He knows how much
you want to go to Brown.

There's no way I'm gonna get in now.
I'm a felon.

Now, that's not true.

Libel's not a felony.
It's a civil matter.

Don't worry. Your father will
straighten everything out.

Come on. Let's go get our nails done.
Chris, take care of Stewie.

Five Seasons Hotel.

Hey there. You mind if I share a ride?

I don't think so, pal.

Oh, my god! I know you!
You're Luke Perry.

You were great in <i>Rain Man</i>!

Like that scene where you wanted
to get on the plane.

And that dumb guy was screaming.

That was Tom Cruise.

Not in this movie theater it wasn't.

Every time I see that lame-o actor,
I put your head on his body.

Thanks. It's always nice to meet
someone who appreciates my work.

Why don't you come over so I can
take a picture of you in a gay pose?

-Huh?
-Dinner?

Sure.

[Car pulls up outside]

I'm telling you,
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> totally synchs up...

-...with<i> The Wizard of Oz</i>.
-Really?

Shannon Doherty told me that once.
But I thought she was just being a bitch.

Listen, I got to get going.

Oh, God! I'm sorry! You know
what's good for getting wine out?

-Sex with another man.
-Whoa. Look.

LUKE: If you're gay, that's cool.
But I'm not.

And even if I was.... I'm Luke Perry.
I can get a much better gay guy than you!

MEG: Oh, my God! Luke Perry!
LOIS: See, Meg?

I told you your father
would explain about the article.

Meg? Meg Griffin?

Peter, I think it's time for Plan B.

Way ahead of you, Brian.

Don't worry.
I packed my own backup chute.

Oh, crap!

I should have figured
you were up to something.

Look, this is all my fault.

I was just trying to help my daughter
get onto the school paper.

You know what it's like to be a teenager.

PETER: You've played one for 30 years.
LOIS: Won't you drop the lawsuit, Dylan?

Ah, what the hell!

But, you got to print the real story.

And this time,
I want to talk to the real reporter.

Let's go, Meg.

See, Meg? Things always work out
if you do whatever you want...

...without worrying about consequences.

Thanks, Daddy.

Come on, Luke.
I got my computer in my room.

Meg, keep your door open.

[Cheery instrumental music]

[Knocking]

Hey, Luke.

I just wanted to give you
a copy of my daughter's article.

-Listen, thanks a lot for the--
-Peter. I'm kind of busy right now.

Yeah, that's okay. Well, thanks--

Remember when you went on <i>Password</i>?

HOST: <i>This one is for Peter Griffin</i>
<i>and Tony Randall.</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>The password is "flaming."</i>

You....

Actor.

You....

Tony?

You....

[Piano being played badly]

Very good, Jonas.
Oh, my! Look at the time.

Mrs. Griffin,
I practiced just like you said.

Far be it from me to call you a liar.

Nothing. See you next week.

Mom, how come all your students suck?

I don't know, honey.

All I want is one pupil who's good enough
to win the piano competition.

I'm sick of coming in second
to that awful Alexis Radcliffe.

Every year, she wins and rubs
it in my face.

Don't worry, sweetheart.
There's always next year.

Congratulations on second place, Lois.

Lois, thank God it's you! The last
three houses I went to were very rude.

Have you been drinking?

Why, yes. Thank you.
I got to find one of those silver scrolls.

Everyone's looking for them.

All right.
Listen to me, you long-neck bastard!

You give me the scroll
and I make you Head

of Sanitation Services
for the entire city.

It's a do-nothing job, sweetcake.

DEATH: Two more dead from alcohol
poisoning. Looking for that scroll, huh?

<i>Wouldn't mind finding that thing myself.</i>

DEATH: Oh, jeez.

<i>Oh, man.</i>

<i>I hope I don't get pulled over.</i>
<i>Okay, be cool. Maintain.</i>

DEATH: Come on, Death. You can do this.

Why do you care so much
about touring a stupid brewery?

Lois, everyone has their sanctuary.

The Catholics have churches.
Fat people have Wisconsin.

And I have the Pawtucket Brewery.

-Now, help me drink these beers.
-Peter, I'm not drinking this.

Okay. All right.
Lois, I'm gonna go to the store now.

Okay? Here I go.

Stop it! What if the kids were
to see you drinking like this?

Especially Stewie.
He's so impressionable.

Oh, my God! Please tell
me we didn't do it.

BRIAN: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
PETER: Nothing!

Peter, it's 7:00 in the morning!

Thanks for the update, Big Ben!

You're drunk again!

No, I'm exhausted because
I've been up all night drinking.

Listen, Peter, if you keep this up,
something terrible's gonna happen.

Something terrible all the
way to the bank!

Nice.

I don't have time for this.
I'm late for my checkup.

[Raucous screaming]

Yeah! All right!

What's going on?

It seems Joe has found the first scroll.

He's tasting victory.
I bet it tastes good...

...like saltwater taffy or a Chunky.

Oh, no! If there's four tickets
and one of them's gone...

...that leaves...

[Cheerful instrumental music]

...this many.

Good morning, Mrs. Griffin. Hello.

Just kidding. So, any problems?

No. Everything's fine, Doctor.

-Lois?
-Hello, Alexis.

Heard you might not enter
the competition this year. Smart move.

Yes. There are more important things
in life than a piano competition.

Yes. Especially for those who have no....
That's cold! Chance.

For your information,
I have a student that could whip you.

I guess I'll see you there.
Fred, this is not a date!

FRED: All right, you're all done, Alexis.

What do you know?
Once again, I finish first.

Don't let her get to you. She asked
for "Pine Forest." I gave her "New Car."

Did you hear? It's over!
Somebody found the last scroll!

Oh, my God! No!

TOM: <i>It's true.</i>
<i>The final scroll has been recovered.</i>

<i>The lucky recipient has declined</i>
<i>to be interviewed for safety reasons.</i>

<i>But I'm sure you're all </i>
<i>with me when I say,</i>

<i>"Congratulations, you son of a bitch."</i>

What am I gonna do now?

Hello, dumb-dumb.

Not now, Gazoo. I want to be alone.

It's not always about you, fatso.
Maybe I wanted to talk.

PETER: I guess wanting it more
than anyone wasn't enough.

You guys, it's a fake.
There's still a scroll out there.

<i>That's right, I made it up. I figured if </i>

<i>people</i><i>thought the last </i>
<i>scroll was found...</i>

<i>...everyone would stop looking,</i>
<i>giving me the edge to find it myself.</i>

<i>What I did was wrong.</i>

<i>As an act of contrition, I will now insert</i>
<i>this carnivorous earwig into my brain.</i>

<i>Kind of tickles.</i>

[Screaming]

TOM: <i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>It's eating out the back of my eyes!</i>

DIANE: <i>In other news, chocolate may be</i>
<i>better for you than once thought.</i>

<i>In a recent 12-day study....</i>

My last beer. Here goes.

I bet that scroll makes
the beer taste terrible.

Oh, God! What the hell?

[Dramatic instrumental music]

I found it! I found the last scroll!

MAN 1: He found it!
MAN 2: Oh, my God!

Run home, Peter! Run as fast as you can!

[Cheerful instrumental music]

[Howling in pain]

[Marching band playing]

Man! This is the happiest day of my life.

Now I know how Barbra Streisand must've
felt when she married James Brolin.

-I love you.
-I love you, too.

I'm so glad I married a regular person
and not a celebrity.

TRISHA: Professional ninja Jerry Nelson,
how did you find your silver scroll?

NINJA: I was at home nursing
this throwing-star wound.

My wife Janie gives me a beer.
And, bam! There it was.

Honey, I'm sorry. You know you can't
sneak up on me like that.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Ladies and gentlemen, in his</i>
<i>first public appearance, Pawtucket Pat!</i>

[Fanfare]

That's for my brother Luis! He drank
himself to death on your crappy beer!

Got you!

A big hand for Cheech Marin, everybody.

Let the tour begin.

Hey, look.

PAT: Those are the Chumba Wumbas.
They live here with me.

Hey, Pat? Where's the wheelchair ramp?

We don't have one.
I guess this is where you get off.

[Penny whistle playing]

CHUMBA WUMBAS: [Singing]
"Chumba Wumba, gobbledy goo

"Life isn't fair,
It's sad but it's true

"Chumba Wumba, gobbledy gee

"When your poor legs are stiff as a tree

"What do you do
when you're stuck in a chair?

"Finding it hard to go up and down stairs

"What do you think
of the one you call God?

"Isn't his absence slightly odd?

"Maybe he's forgotten you

"Chumba Wumba, gobbledy gorse

"Count yourself lucky you're not a horse

"They would turn you into dog food

"or to Chumba Wumba gobbledy glue"

JOE: I'm glad
I'm not taking your stupid tour!

<i>I'm a Coors man anyway! Silver Bullet!</i>

"Gobbledy glue"

[Piano playing]

Very good, Jimmy.

STEWIE: I'm watching the History Channel.
LOIS: Try it again.

Not talking to myself.

LOIS: You're good enough to tackle
a Beethoven sonata.

<i>Let me grab the sheet music.</i>
<i>Keep playing.</i>

[Piano playing continues]

[Punching]

LOIS: I got the music. Oh, my God!
Jimmy, what happened?

STEWIE: Yes, Jimmy. What happened?

I fell.

PAT: It's all behind this door.
Lady and gentlemen, the beer room!

[Mystical instrumental music]

PAT: [Singing]
"Take a drink and you'll sink

"to a state of pure inebriation

"You'll be tanked

"like the whole Irish nation

PAT: "When you drink enough of my beer

<i>"you will find this magic rule</i>

"Make your every joke a jewel

"You'll drive drunker than

"Oksana Baiul

"Go on, buds, drink my suds

"till you've reached that pure inebriation

"Though the beer may be free

"you're just renting it from me"

It's like I died and went to heaven.

But then they realized
that it wasn't my time.

And so they sent me back to a brewery.

We're working the bugs
out of our latest invention...

...Perma Suds, beer that never goes flat.

No matter how old it gets,
it stays carbonated.

[Impressed exclaiming]

Brian, wait.

Maybe we should stick with the group.

Beer that never goes flat.
Do you know what that means, Brian?

This beer will still be carbonated
long after you die of old age...

...and we buy another dog
to help the kids forget about you.

-Peter, I wouldn't--
-Wow, that's incredible!

What the hell? Cheers.

I don't know why he said it wasn't ready.
It tastes pretty good to....

PETER: Oh, my God!
What the hell's happening?

It must be the beer! Hey, check this out.

And look at this.

Oh, yeah? Watch this.

Oh, my God!

Relax. It's just a trick. See?
Look, my thumb is fine.

I'm talking about that!

Holy crap! There's nothing to grab onto!

This is it, pal. We're goners.

Peter, I want you to know
I've really cherished our friendship.

Me, too. That's why I was
holding this in.

But since we're gonna die anyway....

[Peter farts]

Peter, that's it!

[Brian farts]

-Pull my finger.
-My pleasure.

Hey, Peter?
This next one you can blame on the dog.

Silent but lifesaving.

What the hell is this?
Didn't you see that sign?

You've sullied my factory and disobeyed

my rules! I want you to
leave immediately!

Come on! Don't I at least get
a Chumba Wumba song?

Fine.

[Penny whistle playing]

CHUMBA WUMBAS: [Singing]
"Chumba Wumba gobble"

[Howling in pain]

[Crickets chirping]

Come on, Meg. The competition is this
Sunday and you're not even close to ready.

Maybe if you loosen my chains?

We tried that. Remember, honey?
You can't be trusted.

Lois, take a letter.
"Dear Pawtucket Pat...

"...I hate you. You are a bad man.

-"And you made me cry. Furthermore--"
-Not now, Peter.

-Meg and I are having a little girl time.
-Help me!

Go on. No boys allowed.

Jeez, Lois! Still with the piano?

What's a guy got to do to get
a little attention around here?

[Piano playing]

[Beautiful piano music]

Peter, that's incredible!
I don't understand how....

You're like the idiot from <i>Shine</i>!

Meg, you're free.
Try the clarinet. Keep playing!

[Beautiful piano playing]

[Playing begins to degenerate]

LOIS: No. Play it like you
did last night.

I can't.

Peter, talent doesn't disappear
just like that.

Sometimes it does.
You were pretty bad in bed Saturday night.

PETER: Come on, Lois. Move or something.
Jeez, it's like doing it with a pillow!

Peter, I stayed at my mother's that night.

Jeez! This hangover's killing me.

I haven't felt this crappy
since I went to that museum.

-Why did all the dinosaurs die out?
-Because you touch yourself at night.

Here. This'll make you feel better.

[Plays piano hesitantly]

[Plays beautifully]

BRIAN: I think we found his muse.

Oh, my God! You can only play the piano
when you're drunk.

That's not true.

I can also vomit, fall down and make
dirty calls to your sister when I'm drunk.

Go pick up a case of beer.
We got a lot of practicing to do.

Practicing? What for?

The competition.
You're gonna be my first champion.

Play that sad walking-away
song from <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>.

[Sentimental instrumental music]

Hey, everyone! Look at me!

[Music continues]

[Playing <i>The X-Files</i> theme beautifully]

[Applause]

Hey, thanks.
You think that was great, watch this.

Lois, I'm losing my buzz!
I need more talent juice.

Another beer already?

I guess I don't have to be prepared
for the competition.

I need another pitcher over here.

Wow! Lois must have written
the book on man-pleasing.

Too bad Loretta doesn't allow
white literature in our household.

How much harm can one more pitcher do?

This is for the sake of art, right?

Don't start with me, Brian.
This may not be my proudest moment.

But, damn it! I want to win.

You're not the first person
to do whatever it takes to win.

You come to me and ask me
to kill a man I do not know.

I ask you,
why should I kill this Count Chocula?

Because that son of a bitch
has been spreading lies!

My cereal does not cut the roof
of your mouth! With all respect.

KID: I can't believe I'm missing
Ronnie's party for this.

That Ronnie's a bad influence.

Yeah, that little bastard sold me
some really bad crack!

Stay out of it, Herb!
You're not even his real father.

LOIS: Yes. We're checking in.
The student's name is Peter Griffin.

Oh, yes. He's on in an hour.

Yeah. Where's the nearest liquor store?

They're all closed on Sundays.
This is a dry county.

I can't do it without booze!

Maybe this is a sign
that we need to stop this.

I've been keeping you ripped
out of your head for my own selfish needs.

I'm ashamed. Let's just go home.

Now, Lois. We can't stop now
after all we've put into this.

Yo, fresh! How do I get to
Ronnie's party?

Peter, we're not going
to a high school party!

-Lois.
-Alexis.

-Loser says what?
-What?

I'll drive.

[Rock music playing at party]

Consume!

-I love you so much.
-This sucks!

When I was your age,
we had way better drinking games.

You drink!

[Siren wailing]

KID 1: It's the cops!
KID 2: Run!

Hold it, you two. Aren't you a little old
to be drinking illegally?

Lois, look over there! Run!

[Piano being played]

I want to make you feel beautiful, Lois.

Peter, stop. Try to stay focused.

[Applause]

Okay. You're on.

Wait, here's a little something
for good luck.

Make sure your trills are clean and watch
the legato in the fourth measure. Go!

[Drunken laughter]

[Belching]

[Off-key piano playing]

[Theme from <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>]

[Applause]

Bravo!

We did it, Brian.

BRIAN: Congratulations, Lois.

For what? Winning a trophy
at the expense of my husband's health?

God knows how many
of his brain cells I killed...

...pouring all that alcohol
down his throat.

Lois, you don't get it.

The lesson here is that abusing alcohol
has absolutely no negative consequences.

You have your trophy
and my brain cells are just fine.

Hello? Where is everybody?

I'm the only brain cell left.

At least I have my books.

No, that's not fair!

There was time now!

It's not fair!

[Laughing]

Jeez, life was a lot tougher back then.

LOIS: [Singing]
"It seems today that all you see

"is violence in movies and sex on TV

"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

"Lucky there's a family guy

"Lucky there's a man who'll

"He's a family guy"

Listen up, everybody.
It's time for spring cleaning.

ALL: Spring cleaning? Oh, not again.

That was weird.

Boy, that was weird, too.

If we all pitch in,
we'll be done in no time.

Lois, you know I swore
I'd never clean again.

Not after Bounty
dropped me as their spokesman.

Wait a second.

Rosie, I've just poured this glass of
warm yellow liquid on the counter...

...and you're telling me that Bounty
can pick it up in five seconds?

-What is this?
-Four seconds.

-Is that--
-Three seconds.

-It smells like--
-Clean my pee!

Mom, I can't clean. I got stuff to do.

Sweetheart, we all know
you don't have any stuff to do.

Now, I don't want to hear
any more excuses from anyone.

ALL: Crap! We did it again!

ALL: Ruth Bader Ginsburg!

[Oohing]

Look, Meg, it's your little baby booties.

And your little bronze hat.
And your tail.

MEG: My what?
LOIS: Nothing.

Okay, Lois' list says clean the windows,
clear the gutters, and wash the siding.

To most folks, that's three chores.

To Peter Griffin and his big hose,
it's one.

You're not working hard, Peter,
you're working smart.

Hey, Chris, give me the juice!

Peter, there's water and glass!
It's a disaster in here!

Well, why don't you
put down your ginger ale...

...and <i>Redbook</i> and get to work?

Lazy.

You're not helping!
Look, don't come near the house!

Go do something else.

JOE: This duffel bag is only half-zipped.
PETER: Where are you going?

I'm going camping for the weekend
with Johnny-Cut-Corners.

You guys want to come along?

It would be nice to get out of the house.

This is the time of the month when
Loretta is visited by her Aunt Flo.

Loretta likes to personify
her menses in humorous ways.

JOE: Hey, Quagmire!
You up for some camping?

Sorry, bud, the only tent
I'm pitching this weekend is....

Well, you see where I'm going with this.

I want to go, Dad.
It'll get me away from the evil monkey...

...that lives in my closet.

Monkey in the closet.

This is gonna be great.

Last time I did male bonding was when
me and Cleveland went to Chinatown.

Look, forget how it happened.
Can you just get us out of this?

I say, Rupert, this paste is
quite delicious.

It's almost worth the bowel obstruction.

Are those my books?
What the hell are you doing?

Papier-mâché. I used them to make
the houseboat from <i>Surfside 6</i>.

You remember.

STEWIE: [Singing]
"Surfside 6, who lives there?

"Surfside 6, young bachelors

"In Miami Beach"

Those are my first editions,
you little punk!

Mama, doggy scary!

Brian, have you lost your mind?
He's just a baby.

-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-This isn't over!

If you're looking for your Dostoyevsky,
I used it to make the fort from <i>F Troop</i>.

Look what I found, Stewie.
An appointment card.

You've got a checkup.

Marvelous. A quick weigh-in,
a "stick out your tongue"...

...and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.
Remind me to ask the doctor...

...when my other testicle will descend.

Bang! I'm Daniel Boone! I'm a man!
I'm a big man! Bang! Bang!

Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have
a Christmas special with Andy Williams.

So beautiful.

It's almost as if this world
was created especially for me.

-Do you think he's onto us, Christof?
-No, he's an idiot.

Dad, I dug the latrine 50 feet out.

That's great. You want a cookie
every time you do something right?

-Go get some firewood!
-Yes, sir!

He's gonna grow up to be quite a man!

That was incredible, Kevin.

I'm not here to impress you. Am I, Dad?

Did I say you could rest yet?

I'm Abe Lincoln!
I just chopped some wood!

Good for you, son.

Where's Chris? I asked him
to fill up the canteens an hour ago.

CHRIS: Hey, Dad, look.

I covered my back with honey,
and now the ants are taking me home.

He does the same thing at home
with Velveeta and cockroaches.

If you turn the light on fast,
they slam him into the fridge.

Great, <i>Mirabella</i>.

December's <i>Mirabella</i>.

What's your story?
Get lost on the way to the morgue?

No, seriously, is that yours?
Because if it is, bravo.

You remember
that short-lived sitcom, <i>Fish</i>?

They should've put that on before <i>CHiPs</i>.

The marketing practically writes itself.

JOE: Let's go, Chris,
your dinner isn't gonna catch itself.

I don't want to go.
I had a bad experience with a fish once.

Oh, my God! My fish is gone!

And he robbed me!

Okay, see you, Chris.

Peter, this is none of my business,

but you're turning your
boy into a slacker.

How dare you
call my parenting into question.

If you were a woman, I'd slug you.

I'm just saying
you should teach him some responsibility.

All right, I'll show you responsibility.

Hey, Chris, you are responsible
for guarding the camp while we're fishing.

You got it, Dad. You can count on me....

[Snoring]

Chris, pay attention. I want you to....

[Snoring]

All right, take a deep breath, Stewie.

[Giggling]

Cold! Cold! Okay. I'm fine.

[Sighing]

Tell me, Dr. Hartman,
do all the children fall in love with you?

That's cold.

Twenty-nine pounds.
That's big for your age.

Forgive me for not being
one of those anorexic babies...

...from the diaper commercials.

All right, little guy,
time for your immunizations.

-You might want to hold him.
-Hold me for what?

-What the deuce?
-I'm sorry, sweetie.

Back off! Don't come any closer
or I'll cut her!

I'll give her a series of splinters...

...that could, you know, become infected.

Look, Stewie, look at the dancing kitty.

Oh, no! I'll not be taken in
by one of your....

Oh, my. That's delightful, isn't it?
What's your name, you little....

Oh, God!

They call this the magic hour.

The day's not quite gone,
but the night's not quite here...

...and somewhere, Scott Baio
is plowing a woman he doesn't love.

I got one, Dad!

Looks like that's the one that got away.

The hell it is! You get in there,
and you kick that fish's ass!

God, I love him!

CLEVELAND: I can't believe
how terrible the fishing was.

PETER: Yeah, all we caught was a tire,

a boot, a tin can and
this book of clichés.

JOE: Well, thank God we came prepared.
We brought enough food to last us....

Holy crap, Chris! What the hell?
I put you in charge of the food.

The raccoons were here. See?

CHRIS: We're a bunch of sneaky animals.
We're gonna wreck this food and eat it...

<i>...'cause we're naughty. </i>
<i>And there's a guy.</i>

<i>Let's get him in trouble with his dad.</i>

Somehow I'm less than surprised.

I'm sorry, Dad.
I messed up the entire trip.

PETER: It's not your fault, Chris.
I failed you as a father.

From now on, Joe will be your father.

Cleveland?

I'll teach the boy. Come, my son.
I'll show you the ways of the herd.

[Gunshot]

Crap!

Peter, why are you sitting
with the sheets over your head?

-Peter, what's wrong?
-That obvious?

Well, you always do the skull gag
when you're depressed. Talk to me.

Well, it's just, I've been trying to teach
Chris how to be a man, you know?

First, I tried teaching him
how to eat an Oreo.

Chris, the way to eat an Oreo is
to twist it, pull it apart, and lick it.

Now, you.

I tried teaching him
how to get out of paying a check.

Waiter, there's a dead guy in my soup.

I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Of course your soup is gratis.

Thank you. Now, your turn.

Waiter, there's a dead guy in my....

[Screaming]

Peter, you can't force-feed maturity.
He needs to learn it on his own.

-Why don't you get him a job?
-Freeze-frame!

That's it! I can teach Chris
responsibility by getting him a job.

Isn't she great?
Now you see why I married her.

Go away now.
I'm going to do stuff to her.

I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books.
Here, I brought you some of Peter's.

<i>Mr. T</i> by Mr. T.

<i>T and Me</i> by George Peppard.

<i>For the Last Time, I'm not Mr. T</i>
by Ving Rhames.

[Disgusted groaning]

Stewie, are you okay?

Must we make small talk
every time we pass?

You're burning up!
Must be a reaction to the shots.

I'll go get you some baby aspirin.

What are you talking about? The shots
were supposed to make me healthy!

You believe Lois had them inject you
with something to make you healthy?

I mean, you were already healthy, right?

Oh, God! You're right!
I was pink as a pistol!

"Pink as a pistol!" Good Lord!
I can't even form a cogent simile anymore!

-What was in those needles?
-I've already said too much.

I should have known!
Her treachery knows no limits!

Getting dizzy! Fight it, Stewie!

"Do not go gentle into that good night,"
to quote Bob Dylan.

No, no, Dylan Thomas.

Boys, I'm a miracle worker.
I have used all my parenting skills...

...to change my son from a lazy slacker
into a working man.

-Nice going, Peter.
-Up yours, Joe.

-What?
-Thanks. Hey, Chris.

Hey, Dad! I'm working! I'm....

Careful, Chris,
you don't get dental for 60 days.

Hey, you that Griffin boy's father?
Paddy Tanniger, the caddie manager.

Yeah, it rhymes, big whoop.
Wanna fight about it?

Listen, your son
is the best ball shagger we ever had.

I sold twice as many buckets today...

...because everybody
wants to hit the fat kid.

Lynn, cancel my afternoon meetings.
I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.

-Peter, do you mind if Kevin and I....
-Nail Chris? He'd be thrilled.

Hey, this kid here
just knocked a ball 300 yards!

[Applause]

I'm Tiger Woods! I'm Tiger Woods!

Cleveland, your kid's a natural.
With a little help, he could be a pro.

Oh, Peter. I can't make Cleveland Jr.
sit still for anything.

Sometimes, I wonder
if he's got the epilepsy...

...but then I just go see
what's on the TV.

Well, maybe you're not
as good a father as me.

Look what I did with Chris! I'm even
better than that dad on <i>Lost in Space</i>.

We need to gather more information
about this new planet.

Don, you take my 16-year-old
blonde daughter out in the chariot...

...for the day.
Penny, you stay here with me.

Will, you and the robot
go out into the uncharted wilderness...

...and take this
mincing boy-hungry pedophile with you.

Cleveland Jr.'s beyond your skills.
He won't respond to you.

Oh, yeah? Hey, come here, Cleveland Jr.

-Come to Peter.
-Over here, Junior.

-Come on! Come on, Cleveland Jr.
-Come to Daddy. Come on!

You'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid
into the greatest golfer ever!

Fine!

-How did you get him to come to you?
-With this.

-Love.
-Jealousy.

-Touch.
-Forever.

-Intense.
-Passion.

Obsession, Calvin Klein.

Drink this, honey.
It'll bring your fever down.

I'm gonna go run you a cool bath.

She's one of them! I'm sure of it!
Now tell me what they injected me with!

You know Mr. T
always wanted to be a Broadway dancer?

Answer me, damn it!
What have they done to me?

It could be any number of things.
Gene manipulation, sterilization.

They want my seed!

But from the look of your pupils, I'd say
it's some kind of mind-control serum...

...or not.

Mind control? But I feel so lucid.

-Yes, you look spot on to me.
-Thank you. I try to work out.

But who has the time,
besides trophy wives?

Oh, yes, that's rich.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

Didn't want to be a mean guy.
Wanted to be a dancer!

Go away!

You!

I am taking your brain.
You are now my slave.

No!

Why is he freaking out like that?

He's having a little hallucination
from the fever...

...just like when you were 3
and you ate those adult brownies...

...I was saving
for the Doobie Brothers concert.

[Taunting laughter]

I'm gonna be on a cereal box.

"Honeycomb's big, yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's not small, no, no, no!"

Now pay attention, Junior. You want
to keep your shoulders straight...

...and your knees bent,
and just once, for me...

...would you call me Mr. Drummond?

PADDY: Hey, Griffin, down here.
Yeah, it's a secret tunnel...

...like <i>Hogan's Heroes</i>. Big whoop.
Want to fight about it?

Look, here's your first week's pay.

All right, Chris!

CHRIS: Dad! Dad, look!

That's great, Chris,
but I'm trying to be a good father here.

I'm real proud of you, champ.
Let's go get a milkshake.

You got it, Mr. Drummond.

[Doorbell rings]

-Package for Glen Quagmire.
-Excuse me.

I've got a package for you, too!
All right!

Nice try, but I've built up an immunity.

-Hey, what's wrong, kid?
-My dad doesn't care about me anymore.

Well, hey, at least you have a dad.

When I was growing up,
it was just me and my mom.

[Baby crying]

Looks like somebody's hungry.

All right!

I just wanted him to be proud of me.
I even got a job.

There's your problem.
Jobs are for suckers.

You just need to learn how
to have a good time. Come on.

Go ahead, kid. Try it out.

Excuse me, you dropped something.

My jaw.

[Lecherous laughter]

All right!

Nice going.

[Screaming]

QUAGMIRE: All right!
CHRIS: All right!

[Applause]

[Deep sniffing]

-I don't think I like feet
as much as you do.

-Hey, everybody likes feet!

Come on. The party's just starting.

what does "hic-a-doo-la" mean?

ALL: What does "hic-a-doo-la" mean?

It's that special feeling you get
when you hold hands with your best gal.

It's cheering real loud
for the home team!

It's catching the perfect wave!

It's obeying all the rules!

No way!

[Laughing]

Hey, are we in Tiananmen,
because I see a square.

"Hic-a-doo-la!"

-Great shot, Cleveland Jr.
-Thanks, Mr. Drummond.

Listen, for today, can you switch
and call me Mr. Papadapolis?

You got it!

And would you hate me
if I called you Webster?

-That's the line!
-Okay, sorry.

Hi, Tom Tucker, local news anchor,
and on my days off...

...an avid golf enthusiast.

The club's having a Man-Boy tournament.
You two should enter.

A tournament?

That gives me an idea!
Come on. I'll explain in the car!

This is the perfect way to show my friends
what a great father figure...

...I've been to Cleveland Jr. I'll do it!

[Funky music playing in club]

Where should we sit?

That's not up to me, kid.
I follow the old divining rod.

How old are you?

Old enough to know you're a whore.

[Delighted cheering]

Come on. Talk to me, sweetie.
You look a little down.

I always thought I'd go
to my first nudie bar with my dad...

...but he doesn't have time for me.

Well, sweetie, part of growing up
is learning that adults aren't perfect.

Come on, your dad deserves
another chance.

Wow! You are smart!

All right! Oh, no!
No, it's not all right! I'm out of cash!

-Hey, you take bankcards?
-Sure.

Can I get stamps, too?

We're here at the 17th hole,
where Peter Griffin and Cleveland Jr...

...are five strokes ahead,
making victory all but a certainty.

I told you I could mold your son
into a champion.

This is gonna be
my greatest victory ever...

...except for the time
I defeated my evil twin.

Not me, Lois. Shoot him.
I'm the real Peter.

I don't know.

Lois, look at me.
You know your own husband, don't you?

[Gunshot]

Thank God.
You made the right choice, honey.

-What was that?
-Nothing.

One more hole
and that Man-Boy trophy is ours.

Here you go, little buddy.

Hey, look at me! I'm Pelé! I'm Pelé!

Goal!

Where the hell is he going?

He's gone. Maybe you better stick
to looking after your own son.

Nothing thrills me anymore.

I mean, I can't even think of a reason

Really.

You want to know how pathetic
my life is?

I've seen that <i>Behind the Music</i>

Hey, uh... Hey, Leif.

It's been a while.

Too long, man.

Ca... Can we turn off the cameras, dude?

It's like I'm...

I don't know, trapped in my own life.

Well, Brian, you may be
too inwardly focused.

Try thinking about
the needs of others for a change.

Why don't you do
some volunteer work?

Oh, that makes sense. Volunteer work.

Thanks, Bruce.

You still have 13 more minutes.

Oh, do I? Hmm.

I, uh, I notice
you got a new receptionist.

(CHUCKLES)
Nice little body on her, huh?

That's my daughter.

Well, we could probably call this
an early day, huh?

Attention, everyone.

Due to several complaints

and the two deaths

I have decided to throw
a company picnic this Saturday.

Hey, Derek, how you
getting to the picnic?

I don't know. I don't have a ride.

Hey, John, you got
a two-seater, don't you?

Hey, Derek, maybe you
go with John, huh? Huh?

(SIGHS) For the last time, I'm not gay.

Thanks anyway, Peter.

Hey, we'll get him.

Here, right this way.

Watch your step.

Okay, they're... They're in the woods.

The camera keeps on moving.

Uh, I think they're looking
for some witch or something.

I don't know, I wasn't listening.

-Hi, Joe. (SNIFFING)

Hey, Bonnie making
chicken marsala tonight?

No. She made that three nights ago.

Wow, that's some nose you've got.

Yeah, one time it almost
got me a spokesman deal.

"Follow your nose.

"Follow your nose.

Follow your nose."

(SNICKERING)

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, that was good.

I just, I didn't think you were going
to go so cartoony with it.

Well, how would you read it?

Oh, I don't know.

I was thinking of doing it,

you know, good, like an actor.

But, you know, your way is good, too.

You know, we could use a nose like that
down at the precinct.

Really?

(PANTING) I guess it's just down
to you and me, Peter.

One of us is going to
win that paid vacation.

needs a doc... Ooh!

We have a winner.

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

What's with the Johnny Law routine?

Say hello to our newest narc.

He's a natural.

Oh, yeah? How-how good are you?

(SNIFFING)

You're back from Manila.

You had lumpia for dinner.

Then you made love to two Filipino women.

(SNIFFING) And a man.

You mean three Filipino women.

No!

(SNIFFING)
Wait a second. Got something!

This could be the real deal, boys.

Let's do it!

Don't move, dirtbag!

(SNIFFING) It's coke!

Yes! All right!

We got him! This is great!

Ah, this is the rush I been looking for.

Good work, Brian.

Uh, you still got a little, uh...

Oh! Oh, thanks.

(SNIFFING)

So, Peter, where should
we go for your week off?

Well, I was thinking
we could all go to purgatory

like we did last year.

This isn't bad.

It's not that good,
but it's not that bad.

It's so-so.

Eh, more or less.

Hey, hey, Brian.

If cops are pigs

does that make you
a snausage?

(LAUGHING)

Clever, Peter.

Did you stay up all
night writing that?

No, I got to bed
around 2:00, 2:30.

You know what Joe said the street value
of that cocaine would've been?

Uh, let's see, 4.5 kilos uncut Nicaraguan.

Uh, $1.7 mill? That area?

Uh, yeah.

That's... That's... That's right.

You guys! Brian's famous!

-LOIS: You're a hero!
-PETER: Way to go, pal.

Oh, come on. Stop it, you guys.
It's nothing, really.

Wow.

Uh, Meg's using
a new conditioner.

He's right!

PETER: How do you
like that?

That's amazing.

And it's time
to change Stewie.

Well, that's preposterous.

I haven't... Oh, there it is.

You're a credit to the force.

amazing appendages.

down to evidence.

So it's settled.

We're taking a cruise
to the Bahamas.

Cruises are the best.

our choice of cabins.

Port or starboard.

So, how was your day?

My day? Un-freakin'-believable.

stuff in his daughter's doll.

and the next day, it's, uh, a...

It's, uh, it's a damn oil spot
on your cracked driveway,

staring back at you, mocking you,

"Blah, blah, blah!"

would rot in the pit of your soul.

before you go on a cruise,

you got to build up a base tan.

My legs don't work.

But I make up for it
by having a very strong upper body.

Well, I do say that.

Oh, <i>The Old Man and The Sea.</i>

I see you're getting
in the mood for our cruise.

Yeah, stupid fisherman...

Sitting out there on a boat
yammering to himself.

He doesn't even know
I'm watching him.

Ah, splendid. Fido McCoke Fiend is home.

Everybody, this is Tina.

What happened to you?

Hey, how about a little less questions

and a little more shut the hell up.

You know, just because
you can't feel your teeth

doesn't mean the girl
can't feel your insults.

Hello, I'm Lois Griffin.

Welcome to our home.

So, what? She's, like,
your mom or something?

(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)

(GOOFY LAUGHTER)

Tina, can I get you
a warm washcloth

to wipe the dried blood
from under your nose?

Here, baby, I'll show
you the channel Lois doesn't know about.

Brian, would you... Chris, look away.

Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

Wait, that man seems to have suffered

a rather serious snakebite.

Brian, would you please ask
your new friend to leave now.

Oh, sorry, things getting
a little too real

for the Stepford wife?

And look at you two.
Quasimodo and Lumpy.

I leave more personality

in tightly coiled piles on the lawn.

Oh, do me. Do me next!

Come on, baby girl,
let's go to the park.

(DOOR OPENS)

Hey, doc, what the hell
are you doing here?

Your family has something
they'd like to say to you.

"Brian, I know
I don't speak up much.

And it's really hard for me to
talk about my feelings, but..."

Why don't we start with someone
more interesting? Peter?

(CLEARS THROAT)

"Brian, ever since your
addiction, you've been a jerk.

I miss the good old days
when you were my sidekick."

Ah, so she hated my tie

until I told her it was made
out of 100% buttofuoco fiber.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Ah, yup, yup.

Ah, yup, yup.

(NONSENSICAL SOUNDS)

Hey, uh, Brian,
how about a little tie music.

<i>Peter's tie, Peter's tie</i>

<i>That's because Peter's the guy</i>

All right, that's it. A little tie music.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

(GIGGLING)

Look, you guys got it all wrong.

I... I... I...

Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone!

Oh, God, I need help.

(SOBBING)

Well, I guess now we know
what kind of dog he is,

a melan-collie.

(LAUGHING)

(LAUGHTER TRAILS OFF)

Nothing?

Oh, wait, wait, wait.

No, I should've said...
I should've said, "chi-wah-wah."

(LAUGHING)

I don't have
to (BLEEP) impress you.

Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois,

but I just don't see why we got
to cancel our cruise

just 'cause the dog's a cokehead.

We're not going on vacation
while Brian's in rehab.

We'll just have to wait till next year.

Oh, man.

Look, Peter, I'll make it up to you.

I have a cousin
who works at club med.

<i>Me mind on fire</i>

<i>Me soul on fire</i>

<i>Feeling hot, hot, hot</i>

Holy crap! Look at this place!

This is where God would come
if he had to stop doing blow.

-They have tennis courts!
-And a full spa!

Wow! No wonder people do drugs.

Good luck, Brian. I just know
you're going to get clean.

Heh, it shouldn't be too hard to get clean

with all these
mineral baths and jacuzzis.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, I see,
the fat man makes a pun

and everyone wets themselves.

I give you gold and I get squat.

I'll be in the car.

That was a very productive
first day, Brian.

Our goal here is to find your "X" factor.

The element in your life

that made you turn to drugs
in the first place.

Well, just having some time away

to sort things out is going to do wonders.

Thanks, doctor.

What... What are you doing here?

I'm on vacation.

And oh, if anyone asks,
I'm also on smack.

Peter, this... This
is a detox clinic.

You can't vacation here.

Why not? This place
is way better than a cruise.

You should've seen it.

I whipped this speed freak's ass
at horseshoes today.

Peter, this isn't
a vacation for me.

For god's sake,
I'm trying to get healthy.

Yeah, okay, okay, all right.

Hey, softball this afternoon.

Bunch of us addicts are taking on

the pregnant teenagers
from across the lake.

Okay, come on, everyone.

Exercise is an important part
of recovery.

Just work with the resistance
of the water.

Ten more reps.

Okay, and one, and two,
and three.

(ALL GASPING)

Oh!

Yeah! I'm also addicted
to boobies.

(GOOFY LAUGHTER)

Trade you this
for your cupcake.

What? It was just carpet fresh.
I'm on your side.

I'm been observing your behavior

and I don't think you're an addict.

I think you're an idiot.

Well, I don't pay you
to think, hot lips.

In fact, I don't
pay you at all.

Count it.

I'll be keeping my eye on you.

What's your name?

Uh, my name?

Uh...

Uh...

Uh, uh... "p..."

Uh, uh...

Uh... Tear...

Uh...

(SCREECHING)

PETER: Uh... Griffin.

Yeah, yeah,
Peter griffin.

Aw, crap.

Hey, Brian,
I was looking for you.

Hey, you want to go mess
with the pregnant teens

across the lake?

I can't. Group therapy, 2:00.

Oh, man, I peeked in on one of those.

It was more boring than when I was

a security guard for George Harrison.

You wacky Beatle.

Well, I... I have been making a lot

I guess missing one session wouldn't be
the end of the world.

There you go.

PETER: Hey, what do you think
they put in the bug juice?

BRIAN: Bugs.

PETER:
No, they don't. Come on.

Shut up.

(LOUD POPPING SOUNDS)

(BABIES CRYING)

Well, I hope you're proud of yourselves...

Fourteen premature births.

Sorry, doc, i don't usually let Peter

talk me into this kind of stuff.

Wait a minute. Brain, you have

a preexisting relationship
with this degenerate?

A degenerate, am I?

Well, you are a fastizio.

See? I can make up words, too, sister.

Well, I think we've found your "X" factor.

What, do you mean Peter?

His behavior is clearly
a negative influence on you,

and with your intelligence
and sensitivity...

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, I made my own mistakes, all right?

This man took me into his home
and he treated me like family.

He's my best friend.

Yes, and look where
you've ended up.

You know what? I think
my therapy here is complete.

I came here to get clean
and I did, so good-bye.

Brian, it's moments like this

that make me sad you're going
to die 50 years before I do.

<i>He was all coked up</i>

<i>And we were choked up</i>

<i>But now</i>

I am serious, Lois,
you could be in show business.

-Hey, Meg, 18 yet?
-No.

Hey, Chris, how are you?

Well, I'm glad...

All right.

Brian, I feel a little guilty.

If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have been exposed to that junk.

Hey, Joe, if I've learned
anything from my experience,

it's that we're all responsible
for our own destiny.

And that's why I'm leaving.

Leaving? You can't leave.

I have to, Peter, for me.

I love you all.

Somebody say
something.

Brain, wait!

Hold on a second.

Airport, please.

He just needs to find himself.

He's not coming back, Lois.

You saw him. He just walked out on us.

(SIGHS) Boy, did we have some good times!

Here it comes, buddy.

(SCREAMING) Oh, God! Oh, God!

Oh! What are the odds?

Well, if he does come back,

I want everything

Easy! Massage the scalp.

You're washing a baby's hair,

You guys, we got a letter from Brian.

-Tell him I'm not here.
-Let me see.

(YELLING)

Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. There. All better?

You know,
you are some piece of work, lady.

If you... Actually, yes, it is.

"I've been very busy.

"I'm having a great time

"It's just as easy

"I've been working the room

Paramount bought his script.

They bought <i>Death Spares Not the Tiger?</i>

Sheesh! He's been in L.A. how long?

You got to look cute if you're auditioning
for national television.

Lois, I told you. There's no way...

National television, you say?

Coast to coast?

Well, that could be the ideal place

to unleash my mass-hypnosis device
on the unsuspecting public.

Oh, I always loved
this little sailor suit.

Or we could do nice corduroys

Or you could make yourself useful

-Yes, you do.

You do, because it's normal.

Tell us, Stewie, what job does a mommy do?

Oh, interesting question.

More to the point,
how does one define "job"

without branding oneself
with useless labels?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm afraid I answered your question
with another question.

Um... How old do you think Daddy is?

42.

Oh, um... Uh...

Have you ever thought about directing?

Oh, just every waking hour!

out here in Hollywood, huh?

Oh, congratulations on all your success.

Uh... Thank you.

Hey, you know what might be

Yes, well, I'm in the business,

-Great.

Yes, and when I make my appearance,

-Unless I saw a script first.
-Of course.

You know, this isn't bad.

It's kind of like <i>Bang the Drum Slowly.</i>

Except the drum's a chick.

(HORN HONKS)

(TIRES SQUEAL)

Peter, slow down.

Brian said he was going
to be on the set all day.

Ah! "On the set." Listen to me!

Two days in Hollywood,
and I sound like a contract player.

-(LAUGHS)
-(SIREN BLARING)

Oh, crap. The L.A.P.D.

(SCREAMING)

Come on, Peter, I want to save some tape
for the Hollywood sign.

Okay. Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.

Hey, our pleasure.
Have a nice vacation, sir.

Ooh!

WOMAN: (MOANING) Yes... Yes...

Yes... (PANTING)

Yes... Yes...

Cut.

Uh, okay. Uh, nice take, Jenna.

But, uh, let's try giving the lines
a little subtext this time.

Your husband's always away on business,

and you feel increasingly
isolated and unloved,

so you begin to think maybe
you should go back to graduate school

and finish your dissertation,

and that's when you notice the cable man
has taken his pants off.

Oh, wow! A real movie set!

Hey, this house looks kind of familiar.

I'll bet Samuel L. Jackson is here.

He's in everything. There's Brian!

All right, now, Samuel,
when you lay her down

in front of the fireplace,
I want you to enter from...

Oh, my God!

Uh, hey, you guys.

Hey, Brian. Can I be in the movie?

Well, actually, one of the Jacuzzi girls
didn't show up.

How long can you hold your breath
underwater, sweetie?

Real long. One time at Hatch Pond...

No! Absolutely not. This is a closed set.

You gotta leave.
Get these people out of here... Now.

Oh, what? Now that you're a big director,
we embarrass you?

No! No, I... I mean, yes.

Does anyone else smell Astroglide?

You're going to look so handsome.

Oh, look at these crow's feet.

My God, you stay up past 7:30
and you pay for it in the morning.

Who the hell does Brian think he is?

Well, maybe he thought
we'd get in the way.

I mean, it wouldn't be the first time
you've disrupted a performance.

Oh, geez! Oh, God!
Oh, God, I didn't see it.

It jumped right out in front of my car.

Oh, I am so sorry.

I think we just have to face it, Peter.

Brian's a big-time Hollywood director,
and we're just simple, small-town people.

Uh... All right, one more, one more.

-Uh, Rob Lowe.
-Straight.

-No!
-Yes.

-Come... Stop.
-Ho-hum.

-Pull over.
-Absolutely.

-Really?
-Yep.

-Oh, well, he hides it well.
-Yeah, he wishes.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Stewie... That's a funny name. Stewie.

It's like Stew,
only with an "E" at the end.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Hmm.

I meant it's funny, Stewie.

See, I had an uncle named Stewie
and he used to sell bicycles.

Look, I'm sorry. Aren't you supposed
to be asking me a question?

Stewie, what do you think
candy is made out of?

Sunshine and farts!

What the hell kind of question is that?

I love candy!

When I was a little boy,
we would play stickball.

No, no, I'll wait. Oh, are you finished?

I'm sorry. You know,
it's my fault, really.

I was under the impression
the name of the show was

<i>Kids Say</i><i>the Darndest Things,</i>

not <i>Old Black Comedians</i>
<i>Never Shut the Hell up.</i>

Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.

-And we also used to play brock-brock.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Enough of your blather.

Good evening, world.

From this moment on, I will be your...

(BABY TALK)

What you got there?

Oh, you get to go skiing now!

Give... Give that back to me!
They're of no use to you!

Oh, I'm going down the mountain.

-(BABY TALK)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

No! Don't listen to him!

That's not funny!

That's just saying what happens
when you go skiing!

-(GRUNTS)
-Here I go, down the slope.

Oh, I'm going zip-zop-zoopedy-bop!

Stop it! Stop applauding him!

He's not even using real words anymore!

We'll be back with a little girl
from Atlanta,

who skips rope with her sister's pigtails!

(MUTTERING NONSENSE SYLLABLES)

No! My segment's not over!

Come on, little fellow.
You like to jump rope, don't you?

(IN A MONOTONE) I like jump rope.

All right, so you gonna
just sit here and enjoy it.

I'm going to sit here and enjoy it
and I like pudding,

and <i>Ghost Dad</i> was the best movie I've seen
since <i>Leonard Part VI.</i>

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Good news, good news!

What, more people I love
think I'm an arrogant jerk?

You're more than that,

Mr. Nominated-for-an-adult-movie-award
for-Best-New-Director.

A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?

Come on! Call your family!
I'll bet they'll be really proud of you.

No. I'd rather they think I'm a jerk
than a smut peddler.

Brian, they're your family.

They'll love you even if you made
a couple of crappy movies.

I mean, Blythe Danner
still loves Gwyneth Paltrow.

Ooh! Score one for me.

Welcome back to E!'s
Adult Video Awards preshow.

It's a good crowd here tonight, Mom.

It sure is, Melissa.

All the studs and sluts are arriving.

-Brian! Brian!
-Uh, hey.

You're nominated for three
of the seven films you directed yesterday.

<i>Add Mama to the Train,</i>
<i>The Purple Head of Cairo,</i>

and, uh... What was the third one?

Uh, <i>You've Got</i><i>Male Genitalia.</i>

You know, I was asked
to star in a porno once,

but I couldn't because, you know,
most of my body is less than 18 years old.

(WHEEZING CHUCKLE)

I used to guest-host the <i>Tonight Show.</i>

Oh, yeah. What was that,
like 30 years ago?

Your mic isn't plugged in.

You're... You're not even on television
right now, are you?

In my mind...

(SOBS THEATRICALLY)

The next award is for best original score
in an adult film,

and the nominees are Ron Jones...

(SULTRY JAZZ PLAYING)

Walter Murphy...

(IDENTICAL SONG PLAYING)

And John Williams.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

LOIS: Well, you've come a long way
from hiding from the vacuum cleaner.

-Lois!
-Hey, buddy.

Hey, how are you,
Alfred Hitchcock... Eh? Eh?

You like that one, Dick Hurtz?

Ah, I'm sorry. I'm already drunk.

How did you guys know... I...

Jasper called.
Brian, why didn't you tell us?

I thought you'd be ashamed of me.

Oh, are you kidding?
I ought to knock you out

for not bringing me here sooner.

Look at the pair on that one, Lois.
Bigger than your head.

So you guys aren't offended by this?

Well, I can't say I approve, but...
We love you.

If this is what makes you happy,
we support you.

My God. I... I thought I needed
to get away from you guys

to find what was missing
in my life, but...

The only thing I'm missing is my family.

How could I ever have become involved
in this filthy, degrading business?

MC: And the award goes to...
Brian Griffin.

Whoo!

Whoo! Oh-ho! Wow! My God!

(CHUCKLES) This is unexpected.

I want to thank my incredible
production team,

who have been me from <i>Shaving Private Ryan</i>

all the way to <i>Welcome to my Face...</i>

He lives with us back in Quahog.

You got a nice wiggle, baby.

You want to be in a movie? Huh?

Little girl-girl action, maybe?

Ah! Peter!

(SCOFFS) Good luck, buddy.

I've been barking up that tree
for 17 years.

Wow, that was a wonderful trip,

and everyone has something
to remember it by.

You're going to love it
at our house, Janet Jamieson.

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

It seems today
that all you see

Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

But where are those good
old-fashioned values

On which we used to rely?

Lucky there's a family guy

Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

All the things
that make us

Laugh and cry

He's...
a... fam... ily... guy!

That's funny-- I don't remember
buying Stewie <i>these </i>toys.

( <i>gasps </i>)

My God, it all makes sense now.

My baby is some kind
of diabolical genius

bent on world domination!

Bravo, Lois.

The last horse finally
crosses the finish line.

Stewie! All these months

I should have been
paying attention

to what you've been saying.

You're an evil child.

Why, why did I have
to go and smoke pot

when I was pregnant with you?

Cheer up, Mother--
you should be proud.

You've given birth

to the future emperor
of the world.

Pity you won't be around
to enjoy it. Cheerio.

( <i>yelling </i>)

( <i>gasps </i>)
Lois... Lois...

Hmm?
What's the matter?

Oh, I just had
the strangest dream.

Something about Stewie
and Cheerios...

Uh... Huh, it's gone.

Well, come on, get up.

It's opening day
for the Sox.

Hey, Chris, Meg,
we're going to Fenway!

Peter, you can't
just pull the kids

out of school for
a baseball game.

Ah, there's nothing
these kids learn in school

they can't learn on the street.

It's 3:00. Where
the hell is Louie?

Well, you tell me.

Louie left his house at 2:15

and has to travel
a distance of 6.2 miles

at a rate
of five miles per hour.

What time will Louie arrive?

Depends if he stops
to see his ho.

That's what we call
a "variable."

Look what I made
for the game.

What's that mean, anyway?

"And the Lord said, 'Go Sox.'"

Dad, don't you have
to work today?

Heh-heh. It's nothing
a little phone call can't take care of.

Hello?

Mr. Weed, I can't
come to work today.

I was in a terrible
plane crash.

My entire family
was killed

and I am a vegetable.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Eh? Eh?

Oh, please, Peter

your excuses are lamer
than FDR's legs.

( <i>gasping </i>)

Too soon?

( <i>crowd cheering </i>)

Here it comes, Jeremy.

I got it! I got it!

Yes! Yeah! Whoo!

All right!
I'm the man! Yeah!

Hold on to this, Stewie.

It'll be a souvenir

of your first major league game
with your dad.

My God, I...
I shall cherish this forever.

I say, Opie, I'll trade you this
baseball for your souvenir bat.

Sure.

Aah!
What did you learn?

This is great. We haven't done
anything together like this

since we saw Mike Tyson
get beat.

All right, Mike

the word again is...

"onomatopoeia."

Uh... "C."

I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

Oh, dang.

I'm so glad you talked us all
into playing hooky.

Me, too. Hey,
maybe we can get on TV

if we take our shirts off
and run onto the field.

Peter, I'm not
taking my shirt off.

-There-- now they're old news.
-Peter!

Go Sox!

Go... Aah!

( <i>yelling and grunting </i>)

Ow!

Hmm.

Peter?
( <i>gasps </i>)

Oh, uh...,
hi, Mr. Weed.

Well, it seems you have made
a full recovery.

Oh. Yeah, yeah.

Uh, that plane crash
I told you about?

It turned out to be gas.

Aha! Liar!

Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.

I'm tired of Mr. Weed
treating me like a common doormat.

I-I want him to treat me
like one of those deluxe ones

from Pottery Barn,
with the fancy straw.

Mm, I don't care
for Pottery Barn.

Peter, if you want
Mr. Weed to respect you

you're going to
have to earn it.

Hmm. Earn it.

( <i>slurping </i>)

( <i>sobbing </i>):
Why have you forsaken me?

Uh, M-M-Mr. Weed?

Um, I heard you ran
into my identical twin brother

at the ball game yesterday.

And if you don't buy that

I'm sorry I was
at the ball game yesterday.

Peter, I just received
terrible news--

this company has been taken over
by a conglomerate.

After 23 years
of faithful service

I've been terminated!

Wow, the business world
sure is funny.

Hey, Dilbert,
what do you call it

when a guy in
middle management

moves all the way
to upper management?

I don't know.
What do you call it?

A promotion.

Oh, thanks.

Here's a memo.

Well, <i>sometimes</i>
the business world's funny.

And so, on behalf of
the El Dorado Cigarette Company

I'd like to welcome you
to our family.

I think you'll be very happy
with the changes we've made.

Ah, this is sweet!

Hey, why are you
putting a window

in the middle of the factory?

So Aunt Bee has a place
to let her pies cool.

Hello, boys.
Today's pie is cherry.

It'll be ready just
in time for lunch.

Wow, these guys sure know
how to run a company.

Look how happy
those morons are.

They'll never realize
we're using those toys

to get children addicted
to our company's cigarettes.

( <i>fiendish laughter </i>)

( <i>thunderclap </i>)

( <i>whistles </i>)

Good boy, Connor.

Pull.

( <i>dog yelps </i>)

( <i>all laughing </i>)

Can't we eat?

I'm so hungry,
I could ride a horse.

I don't get it.

Well, I could ride it
to the store, I guess.

I told you, we're not starting
without your father.

Dinner just isn't dinner
without him.

Ooh, well, perhaps I could help
simulate the experience.

Num, num, num, num, num!

( <i>excited noises </i>)

( <i>raspberries </i>)

Peter:
Hey, family

anyone in the mood
for lobster...

Aah! Aah! Ow! Oh, God!
One of them has my pupil!

Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, God! Aah! Aah!

Ah.

Peter, how the hell can you
afford lobster on your salary?

I got a raise.
What?!

Yeah. The new owners
gave everyone raises.

Even Kenneth,
the bad-ass mail clerk

with the heart of gold.

Hi, Kenneth. Hey,
did I get any mail?

No, and if you come any closer,
I'll slice you!

Okay, okay.

Man, what a bad-ass.

Yeah? Well,
that "bad-ass"

just gave half his
paycheck to orphans--

orphans with diseases.

And check out
the new toys we're making.

"Baby Smokes-A-Lot"?

( <i>doll giggles </i>)

Tastes like happy!

Cool! That's imitatable.

What the hell...?

"El Dorado Cigarettes"?

They bought your company?

Oh, my God!

They're trying
to corrupt our children.

What do you expect?

Those bastards turned
a whole generation of Americans

into smokers with their
damn subliminal advertising.

Timmy, where's Lassie?

She's out in the orchard, Ma.

Peaches are coming in
mighty early this year.

Smoke.

You know what
they say, Timmy--

"Early peaches;
long summer."

Smoke.

( <i>barks </i>)

What's that, Lassie?

Are you smoking yet?

Peter, if kids
see this doll

they're going to think
smoking's okay.

You have to talk
to these new bosses of yours

first thing in
the morning.

Don't you worry, Lois.

I'll set them straight,
just like I did with Chris.

Dad

what's the blowhole for?

I'll tell you what
it's not for, son

and when I do,
you'll understand

why I can never go
back to Sea World.

Gentlemen, we need to talk.

My wife says you're trying
to get kids to smoke.

That's just not true.

Well, what about this toy?

Peter, it's just a doll
with a cigarette.

I mean, Barbie has a dream car

but you don't see every
eight-year-old kid driving.

They're just fun toys.

Smoke.

Not now, Jerry.

Trust me, Peter--
the last thing we want

is to get kids
to start smoking.

Well, then-then what
about that graph on the wall that says

"The first thing we want

is to get kids
to start smoking"?

That? Oh, that's just something
my son made me in art class.

Huh. Well, wh-what about
that poster that says

"The graph was not made
in art class.

We really do want kids
to start smoking"?

Look, we're a caring company.

I mean, uh, would you really be
the president of a company

that didn't care about kids?

No, but I'm not
the president.

Yes, you are...
if you want to be.

All:
Ah...

Oh, wow! Imagine <i>me, </i>president!

I'll do it!

( <i>Peter humming</i>
<i>"Hail to the Chief" </i>)

So, how did it go?

I-I'm not finished yet.

( <i>resumes humming </i>)

Aren't you going to ask me
how it went?

Yes! Did you talk
to the company executives?

( <i>resumes humming </i>)
Peter, answer me!

Yeah, I did,
and they made me president.

Of the whole company?

All right, Dad!

You should have seen
the way they were treating me.

I've never gotten
that kind of respect before.

Great workout, Bobby.

Up yours, sack breath!

That's <i>Mr. </i>Griffin.

But, Peter, why would they
make you president?

Well, maybe it's because
I can recite all 50 states

in a quarter of a second.

( <i>yelps </i>)

Peter, that was just
a loud yelping noise.

Geez, Lois, I thought
you'd be proud of me.

After all these years

the company finally thinks
I'm worth something.

Just wait till you see all
the perks we're going to get.

Um... hi.
Can I help you?

Yeah. Some company hired me
to stand next to you all day

so you'd look better
by comparison.

That's ridiculous!
I don't need...

Hey, Meg, did you
get less ugly?

Yeah!

Surprise!

Uh, everything
looks the same.

Oh, it looks the same

but actually,
El Dorado Cigarettes

has coated the entire
inside of the house

with a microfilm of Teflon
so it's easy to clean.

Oh.

Heh. Maybe I shouldn't have
had them do the floors.

I'm "Nudes on Ice!

Ah, this is so exciting.

Your father's first day
as president.

Good morning, first family.

Ooh, Lois,
what's in this coffee?

Isn't it wonderful?

The company sent Martha Stewart
to help me with the housework.

I take back all the bad
things I said about them.

The coffee is
delicious, Martha.

A little chicory
perks up the taste

of roasted coffee beans.

It's a good thing.

Well, I think
it's a crappy thing.

In fact, this is
my last cigarette ever.

You make me sick

letting yourselves be bought off
with a few lousy perks.

Ooh, I beg to differ.

Oh, you don't need to
park here, Mr. Griffin.

You have an executive
parking space now.

Well, that looks exactly
like my old space.

Yeah, but this one comes
with your own company suck-up.

Morning, Mr. Griffin.
Nice day.

Eh, it's a little cloudy.
It's <i>absolutely </i>cloudy--

one of the worst days
I've seen in years.

So, good news
about the Yankees.

-I hate the Yankees. Pack of cheaters,
-that's what they are.

I love your tie.
I hate this tie.

It's awful, it's gaudy--
it's got to go.

And I hate myself.
I hate you, too.

You make me sick,
you fat sack of crap.

But I'm the president.
The best there is.

But you just said
you hated me.

But... not you
the... president..

the you who said
you hated... you..

you who love... hate..

Yankees... clouds...

I'll have that fixed
for you tomorrow, sir.

Here's your new digs.

Now get to work, sport.

We're counting on you.

Wow, my own office.

Well, I guess
I'd better get busy.

( <i>pencil sharpener whirring </i>)

( <i>sighs </i>)

Ow!

( <i>zipper zipping </i>)

( <i>pencil sharpener whirring </i>)

( <i>screaming </i>)

Gentlemen, we have a problem.

There's an anti-smoking
bill before Congress

that could put us
out of business.

Yes, apparently causing cancer
is this year's "hot button."

I don't understand it.
We've tried everything

to get through
to these politicians.

Harvard lawyers, lobbyists,
wisecracking leprechauns.

Excuse me, do you
have a dollar?

I'm a little short.

( <i>chuckling </i>)

Maybe that's the problem.

They're all idiots
in Washington.

Instead of a smart guy

we should send a moron
they can relate to.

( <i>all agreeing </i>)

But where are we going
to find someone

within the company
who's that stupid?

Yeah, and not just stupid--
fat, too.

( <i>all agreeing </i>)

Hey, wait a second.

Didn't we just make
a fat, stupid guy president?

You bet we did.

Gentlemen, our new
tobacco lobbyist is...

that guy.

( <i>up-tempo musical intro)</i>

Diamonds, daisies,
snowflakes, that guy

Chestnuts, rainbows,
springtime is that guy

He's tinsel on a tree

He's everything
that every guy should be

Sable, popcorn,
white wine, that guy

Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway
is that guy

He's mine alone,
but luckily for you

If you find a guy to love

Only one guy to love

Then he'll be that guy, too

That guy!

So, uh, what's this
big assignment

you got for me,
Chairman of The Broad?

( <i>chuckles </i>)

"Chairman of The Broad."

When did you become
such a stitch?

Don't you remember?

You gave me writers.

"Sir, I don't want
to say you're rich

"but when you walk
into a bank

all the tellers
go, 'whoopee.'"

That wasn't funny.

I thought you guys
said you were Jewish.

Well, he's only
half Jewish.

You're fired.

Here's the thing,
Griffin.

Some troublemakers
in Congress

are trying
to shut us down.

We need someone
important like you

to go down to Washington
and help those bastards see

what kind
of fun-loving people

the tobacco industry's
really made of.

Washington? Ah, sweet.

I'm your man, but
I got to warn you--

I've made some
enemies on the Hill.

And that's when Clarence Thomas
forced me into his chambers

and showed me lewd pictures.

Mr. Griffin, we have
indisputable evidence

that not only have you never
been in the same room

as Clarence Thomas

you've never been in
the same state.

How do you respond to that?

Bababooey, bababooey,
Howard Stern's penis.

Bababooey, bababooey,
bababooey.

How long is Dad
going to be in Washington?

As long as it takes.

He's a very important man now.

You know, he's the spokesman
for his entire industry.

Thank you, Martha.

Brian, could you pass
me the <i>TV Guide?</i>

Piss off.

What?!

I'm... I'm sorry.

It just... it feels like
forever

since I've had a smoke.

I'm just a bit testy.

Stop staring at my tail!

Hello, Mr. Harrison?

Yeah, I see those
government guys

you were telling me about.

I'll show them a good time

and get them to come around
to our side.

Excuse me.

Al Gore? George W. Bush?

-Yes.
-Yes.

Great.

And what's your friend's name?

Dick Armey.

( <i>laughing </i>)

Oh, gosh. No, seriously,
what's his name?

Dick Armey.

( <i>laughing </i>)

Oh, I just got it.

Hey, Armey, hey, what's
your wife's name--

Vagina Coast Guard?

Oh, no, I'm kidding you guys.

Get in the car.
We're going to a skin bar.

( <i>all agreeing </i>)

That sounds good.

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

I don't know
what happened.

It's okay.

It's okay, Senator.

This girl didn't
have a family.

It'll be like
she never existed.

Now grab ahold
of yourself.

All right, now listen--
you may have killed her

when you shoved all
those dollar bills down her throat.

You may have
killed her

when you hit her
with the stool--

I don't know,
I'm not a doctor--

but I'll tell you what
didn't kill her--

smoking.

You have our
support, Griffin.

Look, kids, here's your father
in <i>People </i>Magazine

with Jim Carrey.

And they're both... smokin'.

I loved that in <i>Mask.</i>

Smokin'.

Smokin'.

Smokin'...

Damn it! Do I have
to listen to this drivel

24 hours a day?!

But, hey, I guess
anything's better

than looking
at your smelly face.

Mom!

Now, honey, your face
smells fine.

You know he doesn't
mean it.

It's just the lack
of nicotine.

Hey, Mom, the school
janitor said

that Dad's working
for the bad guys

and he said it through
a hole in his throat.

Well, that doesn't
make him right.

If I had a hole
in my throat

I'd put pennies in it.

Listen, you father's
doing great work

and life's
never been better.

Yes, I too applaud the oaf

for finally showing
some initiative.

God knows it was years overdue.

( <i>gasps </i>)

Oh, you know who I saw

at the market today?

Patty Croft.

Oh, and she has gotten fat.

Oh, my god! Stewie, no!

Oh, God,
what have I done?

I knew smoking was bad,
but I still sold my soul

and for what?
Martha Stewart?

Come on, kids,
we got to put a stop to this.

Now!

( <i>sighs </i>)

Finally.

( <i>breaking wind </i>)

Ah.

They call me Bill

Yes, they call me Bill

And I'm standing here
on Capitol...

( <i>screams </i>)

Bob Dole's a friend
of the tobacco industry.

Bob Dole likes your style.

Bob Dole, Bob Dole...

Bob Dole, Bob Dole,
Bob Dole, Bob Dole...

Bob Dole... Bob Dole...

Lois:
There you are.

Peter, I caught
Stewie smoking.

That cigarette company
is evil.

We can't be a part
of this anymore.

Lois, this is
the best job I ever had.

Hey, since I
became president

profits have been higher
than Alyssa Milano.

( <i>laughing </i>)

What kind of cheap shot?!

Joel!

I'm suing, I'm suing.
I'm on it.

Mr. Griffin, time
for your speech.

But Peter, what about
your son?

So Stewie
had a puff.

He's old enough to make
his own decisions.

For God's sakes,
Lois, he's one.

Cut the umbilical cord.

( <i>applause </i>)

Ladies and gentlemen
of Congress--

I am here today to talk
to you about smoking.

Oh, please, Peter,
do the right thing.

I know a lot of you are
already on my side.

And for you naysayers

I have two strong words
for you--

Come on.

Come on!

Okay.

Oh, okay.

Sure.

Thank you, ladies and...

( <i>coughing </i>)

And... and...

( <i>coughing </i>)

Baby needs to suck ash.

Baby needs
to suck ash.

Not ass, you pervert.

Save it for
the interns.

Is that a baby?

( <i>coughing </i>)

Oh, my God, that's Stewie!

Lois was right.

Children under four
shouldn't smoke.

Look, I don't care about
this stupid job anymore.

Cigarettes are bad.

Mr. Griffin is right.

Smoking is a horrible vice.

It shortens life expectancy
and pollutes our air

and according to recent polls,
air is good.

Cigarettes killed my father...

and raped my mother.

Gentlemen, I propose
we send a message

to tobacco companies everywhere

by fining the El Dorado
Cigarette Company

infinity billion dollars.

That's the spirit, Frank.

But I think a real number
might be more effective.

All in favor of fining
this evil tobacco giant

$100 million, say aye.

All:
Aye.

But that will
bankrupt us.

Oh, you mean the way

you've morally
bankrupted America?

( <i>laughing </i>)

Thanks for that
zinger, boys.

Now give me
a snappy line to go out on.

Actually, our lunch
is here.

Uh...

well, that's my mama.

( <i>chuckling </i>)

Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

You know, we've had
a lot of laughs tonight

but I'll tell you
what's not funny.

Killing strippers.

Strippers are people, too.

Naked people who may be willing
to pleasure you

for a price you negotiate later

behind the curtain
at a VIP room.

Besides, there's no need
to kill them.

'Cause most of them are already
dead inside.

Good night, everyone.

REPORTER: <i>We interrupt this program</i>

to bring you a special bulletin

Here with an update
is Greg the Weathermime.

Okay, it's gonna be cold. Very cold.

And... And there's gonna be wind.

And people's parents
will throw fecal matter down on them

from the rooftops. How awful!

Oh. No. I'm sorry. That's rain.

Yes. It'll rain.

Remember, the number one cause of injury

So, stay away from the windows.

And Peter, put those away.

Aw, come on Lois. Just one more song.

(PLAYS SOFT MUSIC)

Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

the hurricane's gonna sneak up on me
and give me a vasectomy.

Relax, Chris. Nothing bad ever happens

good things can happen.

<i>is off-spinner, Heath,</i>

<i>who has a cover point, long-on,</i>

<i>square leg, deep extra cover</i>
<i>and two short legs.</i>

What the hell is he talkin' about?

Oh, it's cricket. Marvelous game, really.

You see, the bowler hurls the ball
towards the batsman,

who tries to play away to fine leg.

He levels the score
by dashing between the creases,

provided the wicketkeeper
hasn't whipped his bails off, of course.

-Anybody get that?
-The only British idiom I know

is that "fag" means "cigarette".

Well, someone tell this cigarette
to shut up.

Hey, guys, there's no more

by a bunch of lousy, limey,

-Peter!
-Hello. Nigel Pinchley here.

I was just introducing myself
to your wife,

who, I must say,
is an absolutely gorgeous bit of crumpet.

(CHUCKLES)

-Holy crap, you're one of them.
-Peter.

Nigel and his daughter
are our new neighbors.

Yes, and I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard
who's purchased your bar.

Bit of an awkward moment, really.

Awkward moment?
I'll give you an awkward moment.

One time during sex,
I called Lois "Frank."

-Your move, Sherlock.
-Peter! Excuse us.

Why are you acting like this?

Nigel's charming. All British men are.

Yeah, right. That's what they said
about Benjamin Disraeli.

You don't even know who I am.

The British are a lovely people.
Not physically, of course, but inside.

And Nigel has
a very sweet little daughter.

Aw! Look at the little baby!

Ugh! What the devil is that ghastly noise?

It's me. Eliza Pinchley.

You wanna flower, little baby?

Excuse me,
what I think you mean to say is,

would I like a flower?

Heavens. You don't so much
speak the language

as chew it and spit it out.

Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?

(SHUDDERS) Everything.

Here's a shiny sixpence
if you keep your mouth shut and go away.

Eh.

Honey, I know
the Drunken Clam was your bar,

but maybe you and your friends can find
somewhere else to act like idiots.

Maybe Steve won't remember you.

Well, well, Officer Swanson.

You and your friends are dead.
You're all dead!

(SIGHS) Oh, good.

He thinks we're zombies.
He'll leave us alone.

No, no, no.

(STRUGGLING) "The loif of the..."

No, no. Not "loif," "life!" "Life!"

That's wha' I said! "Loif!"

Now, listen to me,
you tin-eared piece of baggage,

we've got five days left,
and I'll not lose my wager.

Now, repeat after me.

"Hello, Mother.
Have you hidden my hatchet?"

(LOUDLY) "'Ello, Mother,
'ave you hidden my 'atchet?"

God, no! It's an "H" sound, you moron.
H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

-Ew, your breath smells like kitty litter.
-I was curious!

Our husbands couldn't have done this.

Yeah. Cleveland can't even light
the damn hibachi on the fourth of July.

Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find Nigel Pinchley?

I'm from Quahog Insurance.
I have a cheque for him.

Five million dollars?

Yeah, lucky fellow took out a huge policy
the day before the fire.

Doesn't that strike you
as a little suspicious?

No, not really. In fact,
it seems to happen all the time.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

-Oh, no. Here comes Steve!
-I haven't forgot about you boys.

Saturday night at midnight.
You're dead. All of you are dead.

Midnight on Saturday? Thank God!
We can still be in the talent show.

From the top, boys.
A-five, six, seven, eight.

(SHOW MUSIC PLAYING)

Ugh!

Once again, here is how it should sound.
"How do you do?"

And here's how you sound.

-(COW MOOING)
-Now try it again.

-How do you do?
-What did you say?

"The life of the wife
is ended by the knife. "

I think she's got it.
I think she's got it!

Hello. So nice to see you.

There he is. All right.
We need to search the house for evidence,

but one of us is gonna
have to distract Nigel.

Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't.

What about Loretta?
Nigel looks like he's down with the swirl.

There you are, Lois.

Shall I give you the grand tour,
and show you my...

(CLEARS THROAT) Private quarters?

-I'd love to.
-I must say, you look absolutely...

Mm... Mm...

Oh, don't be shy, my lambie lamb.

This is my study, where I...
Study things that arouse my interest.

Oh, good. The girls are in place.

Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone,
I've been searching for someone new.

You know, someone with a sense
of danger and adventure.

I once played a game of cricket
without shin guards.

Oh, I love a reckless man.

One time, I went up to this bloke's flat,
rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.

(GROWLING) More! Tell me more!

I burned down my pub
for the insurance money,

-and framed your husband.
-Aha!

I knew it! And what's more,
I have witnesses. Bonnie.

Loretta?

Demond Wilson from Sanford and Son?
What are you doing here?

I know. I'm surprised I'm alive, too.

(CHUCKLING) Sorry, love.
Better luck next time.

Mr. Pinchley, I heard everything.

And what you've done is a textbook
example of insurance... Fra-ud?

Oh, bloody hell.

What the devil were you doing
in the closet, anyway?

I came with Demond.

Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.

(EXCITED CHATTER)

Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here.
Get a front-row seat for this one.

How kind of you all to come.

Oh, magnificent!

I say, old sport, why don't you
pull your face from your own loins,

and bury it into some humble pie?

(TRICKLING)

Oh, bloody 'ell! I've gone and wet meself.

Don't give me that smug look. Fine!

Well, you have extra-sensitive hearing.
Hear this.

(INAUDIBLE)

-I'm telling.
-Hey... No! I said "vacuum!"

Hurry, Peter. Steve's gonna be here
in five minutes.

Oh, crap. We're dead.

This is the end, boys.

Looks like our next stop
is a corner booth in a bar in heaven.

Peter, Nigel confessed. You're free!

You hear that, guys? We're free!

-(ALL CHEERING)
-JOE: Freedom!

Get ready to die! Oh.

Huh.

I wonder what this feels like.

Ow! That hurts!

My God, is that what I've been doin'
to people? I belong here.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Ah, Horace, I never thought
I'd see you or the Clam again.

Ah! Florida stunk.

Alligator mounted me
when I wasn't lookin'.

Laid eggs in my lower intestine.

But you're all thirsty.
I'll bore you another time.

Here's to our wives.

They may not be as hot
as the women you see on TV,

or as entertaining.

But, um...

You know, I don't know where I'm goin'
with this. But thanks, anyway.

I guess that lousy Nigel
learned his lesson.

Whatever he gets is too good for him.

I am high on James Woods High.

Hey, guys.

What do you want, Meg?

I'm here to try out for cheerleading.

Peter Rabbit would be wise
to stay out of Mr. MacGregor's garden.

Why don't you try the flag girl squad?

Are you trying out for flag girl?

(GARBLING)

Yes! I win again, Andy.

Come on, mate.

One more before the missus notices
I'm not snoozing on the couch.

Too late.

Hey, careful, Quagmire.

Don't get too close to that thing.

What the hell?
Did I just get laid?

Nice game, Peter.
Yeah, I'm on a roll.

I whipped Chris on the ice today, too.

Enjoy it while it lasts.

It's only a matter of time
before he beats you.

What are you talking about?

I'm better than him at everything.

You name it, sports, video games,
even magic tricks.

(LAUGHS) Got your nose.

Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.

(SCREAMING)

Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.

Face it, Peter, sooner or later,
you're going to have to pass the torch.

I remember the first time Kevin beat me.

I was so proud of him.

I gave him a little congratulatory punch
in the arm...

And then another,

and then everything got a little hazy.

Kevin went to live
with a foster family for a while.

Anyway, it's inevitable.

Oh, don't feel bad, Joe.

I think I know why your son beat you.

Apparently, you're a 12-year-old
prepubescent girl.

Which is good,

'cause I finally have someone
to give this training bra to.

Here you go, Josephina.

Does that feel good
on your new budding bosoms?

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
It sure does, Mr...

Get the hell off of me!

Well, Rudolph, we finally figured out
what makes your nose red.

Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails?

No, it's a tumor.

You mean like a magical Christmas tumor?

No, a malignant tumor,

the base of which is lodged
deep within your brain.

Oh.

Like a happy, special...

You're going to die.

Hey, everybody, guess what I am.

The end result of a drunken
backseat grope-fest

and a broken prophylactic?

I'm on the flag girl squad.

Oh, honey, congratulations.

Hey, Chris, I bet you can't do this.

I bet I can.

We perform at all the football games.

I'm practically a cheerleader.

Oh, Meg, that's wonderful.

Isn't that wonderful, Peter?

Yeah. Way to go, Stewie.

All right, Chris, I'll see you a fork
and raise you a gravy ladle.

(LAUGHING) You're on.

So, you're a flag girl.

That's great, Meg.

Yes, yes.

Now you can be somewhere else
when the boys don't call.

All right, saltshaker up the nose.

I've got pepper.

(LOUD SNEEZE)

Yes! I win!

That was fun, Dad.

I'm the man!

Yeah! Yea...

Um, Lois, go get the medical dictionary
and look up fork and lung.

-Why?
-Time's a factor, Lois.

Say, Meg, looking sharp.

You want to go out
after the game tonight?

Neal, I'm a flag girl now.

I'm way too cool to be seen with you.

Really?

Not even if I smoke this corncob pipe?

Hey, you guys.

Are we all ready to cheer
at the game tonight?

We?

You made flag girl, huh?

Yes. So this morning,
my mom was all like,

"Meg, don't forget your lunch."

And I'm all like,
"Mom, I'm a flag girl now.

"I'm not going to forget my lunch."

And she's all like, "Meg, don't forget
your half-time routine at the game."

Moms.

Hey, maybe we could all,
like, hang out after the game.

Go, team!

Uncool people are like animals.

Hey, you want to go feed
the Science Club after school?

Shut up.

The dog just told me to shut up.

I demand to know
what you plan to do about this.

Hey, hey, the dog just told me...

Be quiet, Stewie.

Freezing my nips off out here.

Oh, look, there's Meg.

Meg.

Meg!

Meg!

-Hi, there.
-Hi, Meg.

Here we go.

(MARCHING BAND PLAYING <i>ELECTRIC AVENUE</i>)

Peter, isn't she beautiful?

Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.

They've been holding hands all night.

I mean Meg.

Oh, oh, yeah.

Yeah, she's hot.

Aw, this meat stinks something fierce.

This ought to knock her down
a couple notches.

(CROWD GASPING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Yay, Meg.

Oh, man, I love how these kids celebrate
these days.

What do you got?
What do you got, huh?

Come on.

Come on, ref. That's charging.

Your feet were moving. No foul.

No foul?

There's a stupid call.

And I know something about stupid calls.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

PETER: Lois, I can't take out the garbage,

because I'm at the office
and they're making me stay late.

Peter, the caller ID says
you're calling from the kitchen.

In fact, I can see you.

-Can you see me now?
-No.

Okay, now I'm at the office.

The score's tied. Next basket wins.

Chris, you might finally
beat your old man.

What are you talking about "old man"?

I'm the white Larry Bird.

What do you got?
What do you got, huh? Come on.

Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

You are?

Yes! Yes!

Oh, no, we worked it out.

Yes!

Well, son, you played good,
but your dad is still number one.

Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.

Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?

Oh, my God!

That's not your leg!

(PETER GROANING)

What's wrong, honey?

I'll tell you what's wrong.

I'm trying to make love to you
and you're thinking about Chris.

Peter, is there something
you need to tell me?

Thanks to you,
our son has a huge wang.

Thanks to me?

Well, he didn't get it from me.

What are you talking about?

I'll show you.

All right, stand back, Lois.

Oh, my.

Well, no wonder
he's always slouching.

How the hell did this happen?

I'm supposed to be the man of the house.

You must be so ashamed of me.

Oh, Peter, I care as much
about the size of your penis

as you care about the size of my breasts.

Oh, my God!

Meg, honey, you can't let
those awful kids get to you.

Oh, they won't.

Because I'm never going back
to that school again.

Dad, after dinner,
could you help me with my algebra?

Hey, you're a big man.
You figure it out.

You know, I bet there's a part of you
that really wants to be friends with them.

Maybe.

So, be nice to them.

Win your enemies over
with unflappable kindness.

Chris, drink your milk.

It'll make you big and strong.

No! No more milk for him, Lois!

He's had enough!
Give me that.

Meghan, you must try the brisket.

Allow me to serve it in the manner
to which you're accustomed.

Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.

I know what it takes to be cool.

a man's only as big as the gun he carries.

and give me the biggest
freaking gun you got.

Hey, Stewie, you can come out now.

Ah! Turn off the light.

I'm reading a ghost story.

Pull.

Oh, yeah. Who's the big man now, huh?

Madonna or Janet Jackson?

-Which Janet Jackson?
<i>-Velvet Rope.</i>

Yeah, that one. Pull!

Peter, what the hell are you doing
with that thing?

You want to touch it?

Go on. Got to be careful, though.

You don't want it to get too excited
and go off in your hair.

This is pathetic.

And all because you feel inadequate
next to Chris.

Don't be stupid.

I don't need to compete with my son
or his freakishly large penis.

I'm a freak.

Don't despair.
Let's just hang a tire on the end of it,

to the old swimming hole.

Okay, listen up.

Connie D'Amico's house is two stories.

Now, if we set up

Peter, some of the guys from the club
are going hunting tomorrow.

Count me in.

Hunting? I thought you were going
to play hockey with Chris.

Well, you can bring him along.

Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

Hey, check it out, Chris.

I can write my name in the snow.

This is fun, Dad.

Son, son, I told you.

Out here in the wilderness,
call me Rooster Cogburn.

You know, Rooster,

I was starting to think
you didn't like me anymore.

Chris, look. Tracks.

There must be a deer around here.

Those are snowmobile tracks.

Shh, there he is.

in the closet with Meg.

Have fun.

(ALL GIGGLING)

Okay, everyone, get ready.

Say hello to the lovers.

(SCREAMS)

I don't know who should
be more humiliated,

Meg or the pig?

She's such a dork.

I think I feel worse for the pig.

(PIG SQUEALING)

Mom, you were right.

I should have just stuck to the plan.

Well, I figured you might get soft on me,

so I hired an old friend
to scar them for life.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, there, sweetie.
How old are you?

Sixteen.

-Eighteen? You're first.
-Mom?

I like where this is going.
Giggedy-giggedy, giggedy.

Don't worry, Chris. I'll handle the bear.

Say hello to Satan for me.

(SCREAMS)

It's a boy, Mrs. Griffin.

I'm afraid the fever has affected
his motor skills, Mrs. Griffin.

Looks like he's going to have to repeat
the fourth grade, Mrs. Griffin.

Looks like he's going to have to repeat
the fourth grade, Mrs. Griffin.

The only way to get rid of them

is with this special shampoo
and a tiny comb, Mr. Griffin.

Congratulations, you've passed
the fourth grade, Mr. Griffin.

Oh, great. Listen, I got to leave, though.

I'm going hunting with my son.

Dad, I know what to do.

I saw it on Fox's <i>When Bears Attack.</i>

Go away! Go on! Git!

Stay tuned for an all-new <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

Holy crap.

Chris, that was amazing.

I mean, I just froze up,

but you handled that bear
like a real man.

-I'm proud of you, son.
-You are?

'Cause I heard what you said
about my huge... You know?

Oh, oh, you...

You heard that, huh?

Well, I was just being stupid.

Take it from me,
that thing you got there is a blessing.

I mean, every guy you see
with a big house,

or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth,

is really just saying,
"Don't look at my penis,"

but you'll never have to worry about that.

Thanks, Dad. You're the best.

You know, Dad,
I just realized something.

Your name's Peter.

(LAUGHS)

You're right. It is.

(LAUGHS)

Peter.

We got to find an anniversary gift
for Mom and Dad.

Don't look!
We're shopping, we're shopping!!

Oh, kids, you don't need
to do anything special

for our anniversary, just your father.

I hope he doesn't wait and get your gift
at the last minute again.

My goodness, a human thumb.

Where did you ever find this?

It was on eBay...

(VOMITING)

Oh, God, call an ambulance!

This year, instead of exchanging gifts,

I told him it'd be nice

if we could just spend
a romantic day together.

Oh, dear, I think we all know
what that means...

(IMITATES BED SPRINGS)

Gross.

Hey, fellas, guess what?

I got us a tee time tomorrow
at Barrington Country Club.

Barrington, wow.

I'm in.

-Uh, Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
-Ah, crap.

If Lois finds out
I'm ditching her to play golf,

she'll hit me with a frying pan.

Which is why I'm going to drink
this frying pan antidote.

All right, hit me with this.

Didn't work.

What the hell?

"Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt.

"Your first clue
is at the Quahog Mini-mart. Love, Peter."

Oh, how fun!

All right, gentlemen, before you tee off,

here are your complimentary
monogrammed bag towels,

a sleeve of balls,
and this mobile ball cleaner.

(SQUEAKING)

Clean as a whistle, sir!

I'm not going to get short
by touching your spit, am I?

(LAUGHS) You'd be the first, champ.

Well, it's about time.

Sorry, fellas,
I'm not going to be able to play.

Loretta's mother is in town,

and we have to go buy new sheets
for the dog bed.

-Cleveland!
-I mean the pull-out sofa bed.

Cleveland, this is Barrington.

You could be the first black guy ever
to play this course.

People are gonna be impressed.

-Hey, a black guy!
-Ooh, fun!

Come on, Cleveland.

Look, maybe we should play another time.

Screw that.

I busted my ass keeping Lois busy,
so I could be here.

Now let's grip it and rip it.

The Fed is going to be lowering rates,

so get your money out of T-bills,
and put it all into...

Waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup.

Waffles! Buy waffles!

ALL: Waffles! Waffles!

(IN JAPANESE ACCENT) Waffle.

Okay, kids,
keep your eyes peeled for a clue.

Now what Jughead has done here,

and it's really quite ingenious, actually,

is paint pupils on his eyelids,

so he can sleep through class
without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.

(CACKLES) He's sleeping!

Mom, I found Dad's first clue.

I can't believe
your father organized this.

Usually, he can't even handle
simple tasks.

Peter, why is there a diaper
in the lamp socket?

Oh, Lois, he's done it again!

Wait a minute.

(ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

Ha!

Peter, let's pack it in.
There's too much water out here.

Yeah, let's hit the bar, huh?

Oh, come on,
there's worse things in life than rain.

Like, uh... Like spiders.

Oh, he's behind the door...

(COUGHING)

Peter, he's bothering everyone.

-Say something.
-Say something?

I'll kick his ass,
someone ought to kick his ass.

Don't go in there!

Peter.

All right, give me a Kleenex.

I knew he was bad!

I knew... (SCREAMS)

Out of me way,
they're after me Lucky Charms!

I paid him $10 to say it.

Classic.

We'll be in the clubhouse.

Go on, run away.

More golf course for me.

That was close.

Huh, that looks dangerous.

Somebody's going to get hurt.

(GRUNTING)

Ah, it'll be fine.

(GASPS)

BOTH: You again?

Oh, Death, please don't take me now!

Relax, you're not dying.

You're just having
a near-death experience.

Oh, thank God.

Oh, yeah, thank God.

Thank God I get to hang out
with a fascinating gent like yourself.

So, when am I going to die?

About two years
after your wife divorces you.

What the hell are you talking about?

Lois would never leave me.

She's been crazy about me
since the night we met.

Oh, my God, that's me.

Look how thin I was!

My, this is certainly a beautiful night.

I love looking at stars.

Say no more.

Peter, wait.

"Very interesting... But stupid!"

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God, I love Arte Johnson!

Then why don't you give him
a kiss, eh?

Oh, Peter, get away from me!

-Come on, come on.
-Stop it.

-Peter, stop it.
-Come on, give Johnson a kiss.

Oh, my God!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(CRASHING)

(SONG PLAYING ON RADIO)
<i>Oh, baby, I love your way...</i>

Oh, Peter, I hear music.

Yeah, me, too.

From now on, this'll be our song.

(<i>BABY, I LOVE YOUR WAY</i> PLAYING)

(EXPLOSION)

(GROANING)

I've never met a guy like you.

You're so full of life.

(WOLVES GROWLING)

(MAN SCREAMS)

It's like I can really be myself with you.

I'm so happy.

Ah, man, she was beautiful.

You know, this looks awfully familiar...

Wait a second, I remember this.

That's me.

Look at all that hair.

I can't believe
I thought that looked good.

I must've been high.

I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.

I love you, Peter Griffin.

Look at that, huh, huh?

There's no way she's going to leave me.

Now put me back
in my freakin' body, all right?

I can't put you back
until you have a revelation.

You know, one of those things
that changes your life.

Oh, to hell with this, I'm going home.

What are you doing?
You can't get in that way.

I'm sure as hell
not going in the back door.

Oh, crap, I don't have time for this.

Listen, I'm late for an appointment.

You don't want to follow procedure, fine.

Stay here in limbo.

No, no, no, wait.

I don't want to be in limbo.

Okay, it says the next note
will be right under my nose.

-(BELL RINGS)
-COMMENTATOR: And they're off.

And quick out in front, Silver Dasher,
followed by My Nose.

Aha! Hold my purse!

What's Mom doing?

I'll tell you what she's doing.

She's screwing up
my 6-2 quinella, damn it!

My Nose out in front,
followed by Sea Biscuit,

followed by Some Crazy Lady,

followed by Middle-Aged Housewife,

followed by Wait A Minute, Who's That?

Followed by Silver Dasher.

And now, it appears
there's a woman chasing the dogs!

(DOGS BARKING)

Let's go, kids!

Lucky, tell the boys in Kansas City
the bet's off.

Too late, Stewie.

The fix is in and the noodles
are boiling in the pot.

Boiling, I tell you!

(GROANS)

Wait a minute, I got it, I got it!
I figured out my revelation.

-Uh, God loves a working man.
-No!

The Shadow is, in reality,

Lamont Cranston,
wealthy young man-about-town.

No!

Crap, I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble.

Geez, you're pretty shook up
about that appointment of yours.

You're Death, what are you afraid of?

Where the hell have you been?

When I said lunch, I said noon,
not noon-ish.

Sorry, Ma...

Sorry!

Is sorry going to reheat the casserole?

So, who's your friend?

It's a work thing, Ma,
near-death experience.

-Where are you going?
-I got to take a leak.

Don't forget to zip up your fly.

If you don't zip up your fly,
a seagull will get you.

God, she's a pain in the ass,
I wish Dad was still dead.

Lois' dad was a pain in the ass
when I met him.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?

Oh, Peter, you look so wonderful.

You aren't nervous
about meeting Daddy, are you?

Oh, you'll know when I'm nervous.

-CARTER: Lois!
-(FARTS)

Now!

Lois, take the rap for this.

I only get one chance
to make a first impression.

(SNIFFS)

Hi, Daddy, that was me,
and this is Peter.

Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

What are you feeding this gal?

Peter Griffin.
Can I take this freakin' tie off?

It's a pleasure, Peter.

My daughter is quite taken with you.

And I'm taken with her.

I mean, look at her.

Show us front and back there, Lois.

And don't think I don't know
where that comes from.

That's some world-class juice
you got brewing

in the old flesh balloon
down there, Carter?

-I'm going to get my purse.
-All right.

Based on what you've seen
with your wife,

what can we expect
in terms of droopage here?

Are we talking a slight slope,

or the full-blown fried eggs
hanging on a nail thing?

Peter, what do you think
of this bronze statue?

-It's nice.
-It's early Etruscan.

Oh, get out of here!

-No, seriously.
-Oh, that's great.

(SPUTTERING)

Hey, look, a manatee.

We can use it for soup.

Ensign Glen Quagmire, welcome aboard.

You picked a great day to get rescued.

We were just about to sing a song
about mopping.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS)

(SINGING)
<i>We're mopping the deck</i>

<i>Which is Navy for floor</i>

<i>And when we're done mopping</i>
<i>We'll mop it some more</i>

<i>Swab means mop</i>
<i>Deck means floor...</i>

Could you tell me
when you're leaving to go back in time?

I was talking to a robe
on the coat rack for 20 minutes

before I realized you weren't in it.

Ma, for God's sake, leave me alone,
I'm working.

Don't yell at your mother.

If you yell at your mother,

a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.

Wow, brilliantly choreographed.

That's your tax dollars at work.

Why don't you join us and see the world?

Sorry, pal, I've seen the world,
and its name is Lois.

How romantic.

Why can't you find a nice girl?

Ma, she's going to dump him.

Well, at least he got that far.

You know who he took to the prom?
His cousin!

-(LAUGHS) That's weak.
-Yeah.

All right, that's it,
I'm sick of both of you.

Come on, Peter.

Death, put your jacket on
or you'll get frostbite.

I don't have skin.

That's 'cause you didn't eat your beans.

Come on, come on,
get back in your big, fat body.

Why should I help some guy
save his marriage

when I can't even get a girl?

Whoa, wait, what are you saying?

The revelation, jackass.

It could've helped you save your marriage.

Oops, but too late.

Oh, and, uh, by the way,
when the lightning hit you,

you soiled yourself. Enjoy.

Wait, wait, wait. I can't lose Lois.
Please, I'll do anything.

What if I helped you get a girl?

Really? You think you could do that?

Sure, all we got to do
is get you a little fixed up, you know?

Get your hair cut,
give you a good, clean...

(SCREAMS)

Shave, maybe some cologne,
the chicks will be all over you.

-Gee, you really think so?
-Absolutely.

You got any SPF-50?
I bleach like a gym sock.

Look? Death, will you relax?

I told you the beach is the perfect place
to pick up chicks.

I want you to go over there
and ask those girls if you can play.

Uh... Hey! Can I join you?

I guess. What's your name?

Josh.

Do you, like, live around here?

No. I, uh... I live with my mom.

Let's get out of here.

See you, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.

(GIGGLING)

MAN: Heads up!

How do we get up there?

Dad put grease on the pole.

Don't worry, Meg.

We've been studying fulcrums in school.

You simply have
to counterbalance the weight

at the point where the lever pivots.
Like so.

Stewie, honey,
you want to play rocket ship?

-What the deuce?
-Blast off!

Go on, Stewie. Get the note for Mommy.

How dare you use me
for your own personal, selfish...

Hmm... Ooh. Pull slower.

I must remember to do this again
when no one's around.

What the hell was I thinking?

You don't know anything
about picking up chicks.

Are you kidding? I learned from the best.

Come on, buddy.
We're about to anchor in Jamaica.

Aw, great, we're getting closer
to Rhode Island.

Rhode Island? Forget that.

I'm taking off for some shore leave.

Does this look like a "q" to you?

-No.
-How about now?

Sorry, Quagmire.

Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.

Well, let's ask her, then.

Hey, Lois, should Peter sit around
and mope all night?

Or should Peter go out with his buddy
and have some fun?

(CHUCKLES) All right.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay. That one's a feminist type.

She's into He-Man,
and that one's mad for jazz.

Watch this.

The plight of women in this hemisphere
is deplorable.

I can bench-press 800 pounds.

You, me and Coltrane till dawn.
Giggedy-giggedy-giggedy!

There you go, Peter.
One for you, two for me.

(SIGHS) You guys go on without me.

(SIGHS)

So why didn't you go
with them?

You don't know what it's like
when you're in love.

Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy.

She works at a pet store.

I met her last summer
when her dad hung himself.

But I was too shy to ask her out.

(SCREAMS) What's with that mustache?

Huh? Let me see that.

Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos.

Here. This is her.

Ah, nice ass.

Oh, sorry. No, no.

That's Edward James Olmos's ass.

I guess I don't have a photo of her,
but trust me, she's cute.

Well, let's go get her.

I'm going to need that picture
of Olmos's ass back.

Oh. Yeah, right.

Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell.

I found the note.

"Go back to the Mini-mart"?

Well, this isn't very creative.

Let's go, kids.

CHRIS: Mom, you remember that goldfish
we flushed down the toilet?

-He wasn't dead.
-(GUN COCKS)

There she is. That's her.

All right now, go on.
Just like we practiced.

(EXHALES)

-(BELL CHIMING)
-Hey, you.

Hi. I was, just, uh...

(ANIMALS SCREECHING)

Uh... And, uh, I was just
in the neighborhood and, uh...

So I thought that, uh...

So, uh, you...

Uh, I'll, uh...

(SPEAKING LOUDER)
This is a bad time!

Maybe I'll just come back.

Who am I kidding? I'll never get her.

Not with that attitude.

Come on! Robert Reed
got Florence Henderson,

and he was one of them
toe-tappin' burgermeisters.

You've got to find a way
to make it happen.

So long, Peter. I hope you find your girl.

Thanks, Quagmire.
Hope you live next door to me someday.

Hey, hey! Does this look
like a "q" to you?

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

How about now?

So, where is it that you need to go,
my new honky friend?

Rhode Island. That's not to far, is it?

Nothing's too far away
from Maxine, the cheatin' queen.

Women. That's not fair.

I'm just speaking out of hurt.

That truck's coming up on us awful fast.

(HORN HONKING)

Holy crap!

-Do you see what I see?
-I'm afraid I do.

We're being chased by ghosts!

So you went through all this trouble
just to see a girl?

I just did, and I'm just a fat idiot.

What's your excuse, you big chicken?

-Chicken? You take that back.
-Yeah? Make me.

I don't make monkeys. I train them.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

No. But this will!

(SCREAMS) You bastard!

(YELLING)

What the hell is going on out here?

Um... Actually, I, uh... I, uh...

Actually, he wanted to ask you something.

Amy, you want to go somewhere
and grab a coffee?

Sure. I get off at 2:00.

Great. Uh, uh, great.

Uh, I'll meet you here.

You did it! All right!

Hey, who knows?
You might even, uh, you know?

I'm not following you.

-Intercourse.
-Huh.

What are you doing here?

Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack,

so we had to pick her up
some Kibbles 'n Bits.

-Cleveland!
-I mean Cheez-its.

Did Peter give you a clue for me?

Peter? He's down at Barrington
with Brian and Quagmire.

He's golfing?

On our anniversary?

Oh, boy. You just put Peter in a doghouse,

-which is where your mother...
-Don't say it!

Your mother smells.

See? This is why I hate clothes shopping.

I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.

You're trying too hard, Death.

She's not going to care
what you're wearing.

She's just going to be glad to see you.

That's how it was with Lois.

(GROWLING)

-(YELLS)
-(BARKING)

Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

(BARKING FEROCIOUSLY)

Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

What the hell are you doing here?

That's a long story

with some terrific performances
and a wonderful scene in a carnival,

but I'll cut to the ending.

I want to marry Lois.

Out of the question!

Now, listen, Griffin,
I want you to take this,

and stay away from my daughter forever.

(GASPS) A million dollars!

A million dollars.

No deal.

Lois may be worth a million to you,

but to me, she's worthless.

I love her, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Oh, Peter!

Holy crap!

Back then, I gave up a million bucks
just to be with Lois.

Now I won't even miss a lousy golf game
to spend our anniversary together.

No wonder she's going to dump me.

Or is she?

Wait a minute. That's my revelation.

I got to pay more attention to my wife!

Eureka.

Now come on back to the golf course.
I've got a date.

Death, wait, wait, wait.

Before we go, I need you
to do me one more favor.

(SPOOKILY) Peter...
Peter Frampton!

Oh, no! God, please, no!
I'm too young to die.

Are you sure you're not supposed
to be at Keith Richards's house?

All right. If you want to live,

come with me.

(IN NORMAL VOICE) And bring your guitar,

and bring that thing you use
to make it go.

(VOCALIZING)

Hey! Hey!

(TIRES SQUEALING)

How could he lie to me on our anniversary?

(BRAKES SCREECHING)

(GUITAR PLAYING SOFTLY)

(FRAMPTON SINGING)
<i>Ooh, baby, I love the way...</i>

(STRUMMING GUITAR)

<i>I wanna tell you I love the way...</i>

<i>I wanna be with you night and day</i>

Oh, Peter, our song!

Happy anniversary, Lois!

This is the most romantic gift
you've ever given me.

How did you ever put all of this together?

Well, I had a little help
from a very special friend.

I like animals.

Uh-huh.

'Cause they're like people.

Just little furry people.

Yeah. Uh, hey!
You ever go on the Internet?

They've got some cool stuff
there on that Internet.

Oh, yeah. I bought these shoes
from a company on the Internet,

because they don't test on animals.

Wow. (SIGHS)

You know, animals never have wars.

War is an invention of mankind.

What the hell are you talking about?

Animals fight all the time.

Not with nuclear arms.

You can't hug your children
with nuclear arms.

Check, please.

I can't believe how terrific you look.

Thanks. I've been taking
tae-jitsu classes.

You should come with me sometime.

I'd love to.

Oh, the baby's kicking. Want to feel?

Sure.

Ow! Ow!

-Peter!

MEG: Oh, I love this time of year.

Me, too.

The summer tourists are gone,

(HORNS HONKING)

Leafers!

Holy crap. We got to get out of here!

-What about the boat?
-Leave it!

Hurry, Peter.

We're too late.

Yo, Mattie, check out those colors...

Yellow like a taxi,

Orange like the ball at the Knicks' game,

and red like the sauce

Yeah, and brown like the guys

We're going to be late for Church.

Move it! Damn Leafers.

Chris, quit it.

Mom, Chris put his foot on my side again.

I can't help it.
I have these long dancer's legs.

Move it!

Meg, stop your whining.
Chris, stay on your own side.

Lois, for God's sake, get off your ass
and do some parenting.

If you kids don't knock it off,

we're not going to McDonald's
after Church.

BOTH: Mom!

Don't worry, we're going.

But... But you don't get to super size.

(GROANS)

Okay, you can super size.
But no apple pie.

Oh, come on.

Okay, you get an apple pie,
but you can't blow on it.

Peter, don't contradict me
in front of the kids.

Lois, brothers and sisters fighting

is as natural as a white man's dialogue
in a Spike Lee movie.

Wussup? Can I get two slices of pepperoni?

(GROWLING)

Who are all these people?

Damn New Yorkers.
They took all the good seats.

Aren't you precious?

-(HISSING)

Some of my novelty items

were provided by Jack's Joke Shop

Remember, if it ain't funny,
it ain't worth jack.

I'd like to welcome
all our out-of-town parishioners.

My cousin, Father Sapienza,
is in from New York to see the leaves,

and I'd like to invite him
to do the opening prayer.

Yo, God is good, huh?

And he expects us to be good,
and if you're not,

He's going to come down
and bust your freakin' skull. Amen.

Who do you think you're talking to?

Your God ain't tougher than me.

You can't talk to the Father like that,
you stupid <i>gavone.</i>

I ought to come over there
and break your freakin' arm.

You want to go, tough guy?

I'll snap you in half

like an almond biscotti
from Belaro's on 51st Street.

Best in the city.

Fellas, this is God's house,

Patriots suck!

(GASPING) Blasphemy!

It burns! Ah, gee!

"Holy water"?

Where's that acid I ordered?

Hey, guido, watch this.

(WHIRRING)

Whoa! I've got to lay off the coffee.
Hot-cha-cha, cha-cha!

That's Jack's, exit 14 off 295.

Tae-jitsu is about power
for your body and your mind.

Don't be afraid to free
the beast inside you.

Left kick! Right kick!

Punch combo! Stomp!

Beautiful! Again!

Left kick!

Wow, you're doing great
for your first lesson.

I'm really cutting loose,
just like Julie Andrews

in that movie
where she showed her breasts.

Oh, Mary, you'll never leave us, will you?

Yes, those are lovely,
but it doesn't quite answer our question.

Jets rule!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, watch where you're going, will you?

Hey, Horace, put the Pats game on the TV
and get me a few beers, huh?

Sorry, Peter, someone stole
the remotes and the kegs,

and I'm not sure,
but I think I've been shot.

Yep.

Hey, pal, watch my seat.

I got to bleed the lizard.

(TINKLING)

Public urination is just wrong,

except during the Million Man March

when protesters burned our port-a-potties.

Then I used my stream of justice
to put out the hate.

I don't know, fellas,
I think there's potential in this crowd.

(SNICKERS)

Hey, honey, why don't you turn around
and show me the lower east side?

(IN A DEEP VOICE) Sure.

Whoa! Transvestite! Back off!

Wait a sec... Pre-op or post-op?

Pre-op.

Whoa! Transvestite! Back off!

You're right, this place blows.

We got to send these strap-hangers
back where they came from.

Don't worry, I got an idea.

An idea so smart, my head would explode

if I even begin to know
what I was talking about.

(PETER YELLING)

I am a man-eating tree.

Go back to New York or I will eat you,

just like I ate insane
New York anchorman, Dan Rather.

(SPITS)

And look who I had for dessert...

Asexual former mayor Ed Koch.

(SPITS)

Leave my land or I will smite you
with my powerful limb.

What? Are you nuts?

Give me that branch.

Oh! Get off of me.

(YELLING)

Why, you...

Oh, my God!

-Stop fighting.
-(YELLING)

(GROANING)

Holy crap.

Oh, my God.

Mom, you could be a world champion,

and no one could hit you below the belt,

'cause girls don't have anything
down there.

Can you teach me to kick ass?

Oh, no, I do not condone violence,

and I am not going to be responsible

for bringing fist fighting
into our schools.

Gee, Lois, can you hear me
all the way back there in the '50s?

Oh, that was lame.

Oh, poor Peter.

I emasculated him
in front of all those people.

I think he's really upset.

PETER ON BULLHORN:
Gather 'round, everybody.

Ten bucks is all it takes.

Step right up and fight my wife.

(GASPS)

Come one, come all.

She floats like a butterfly
and stings like when I pee.

Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction.

At least not anymore.

Me likey bouncey! Me likey bouncey!

I want you to get rid
of all of this right now,

'cause I am never fighting again, ever.

Come on, Chris,
we'll have to go to plan "B."

(CROWD MURMURING)

(GROWLS)

Oh, no! Ah! Oh, God!

Oh, my God! Help me!

Help me, for God's sakes!

He's going to kill me!

Help!

-(GASPS)
-Don't worry, it's a trained bear.

He's in no real danger.

(GRUNTS)

Oh, he's teaching a class.

I... I can't bother him now.

Sure you can.

Hey, hey, Ralph Macchio.

My wife here needs to talk to you.

There you go, honey.

-What is it, Lois?
-I, uh...

I don't think I should do
tae-jitsu anymore.

I'm afraid I'm going to hurt someone.

But, Lois, you're my star pupil.

I want you in my advanced class.

Advanced class? No, no, no.

I'm trying to quit.

Well, fine, quit.

But get used to people
walking all over you.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on there.

Nobody walks all over my wife,
'cause I won't let them.

-Peter...
-Quiet, Lois, men are talking.

She learns things eventually.
It just takes her longer.

Come on, honey, we're out of here.

If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats.

I won't let you buy,
but you can try them on.

I'll do it.

(GROWLING)

(YELLS)

Ow!

(CRYING)

Stewie, you want to swing?

Yes, why not?

I'll have a go at it.

Perhaps a quick stretch first.

-(CRACKING)
-Ooh, damn.

Must have pulled something
playing hoops last week.

I know you're not putting
that rock up from here.

You ain't got no J.

Yo, man, that's trippin'.

Brother, please,
you're the one who's trippin'.

Go on, cry home to your mama.

She waitin' for ya.

Now, don't make me put
my size 13s up your narrow ass!

I don't sweat, you. Bring it on, bitch.

Now, how you going to act?

Geez, bringing that trash in here.

This is my house.

Excuse me, we were about to use that.

You snooze, you lose, lady.

You have two choices.

Either my baby swings
from this jungle gym,

or you do.

Ooh, Lois, someone's wearing
their ovaries on the outside.

She saw me walking to the swing.

Yes, yes, she saw you. Easy, now.

Nobody walks all over me.
Those days are over.

-Lois Griffin demands respect.
-(STEWIE SCREAMS)

(GRUNTS)

(SNIFFS)

Oh, I smell a messy diaper.

God, why does that turn me on?

-Hold it, Meg, those two are mine.
-What?

That's Randy and that's Fred.

Randy is the messy one.

Fred's very neat.

When you get them together,

woohoo, hold on to your sides.

Nice to meet you both.

(GASPS) Murderer!

Stop it! Both of you!

Starting now, you two
are going to love each other.

Now, stay that way.

It's going to be weird to potty.

Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage

those damn Leafers dumped on our lawn.

<i>New York Post,</i><i>New York Magazine,</i>

The New York Mets.

Peter, I'm sick and tired
of hearing you whine about the Leafers.

Take some action. Free the beast!

(CROWD GASPS)

(LOIS GRUNTING)

That was strangely arousing.

Ow!

(GRUNTING)

Hello, 911?

It's Quagmire.

Yeah, yeah, it's in a window this time.

Wow, look at them run.

Wait a second, Brian.

That gives me an idea.

The Drunken Clam?

Why couldn't we go someplace fancy,
like the Olive Garden?

Oh, the breadsticks.

Me likey breadsticks, me likey...

You're a big girl now. Stop it.

Hold... Hold on, Lois.

Excuse me, New Yorker.

I think you're in my seat and I had sex
with your mother last night.

Peter, are you crazy?

What did you say?

About the seat
or about my plowing your father's wife?

Hey, ooh!

What the hell are you doing?

Excuse me, is your refrigerator running?

Because if it is,
it probably runs like you.

Very homosexually.

What?

Oh? You want to dance?

Jets suck, Yankees suck, Knicks suck.

Krypton sucks.

ALL: Hmm?

(ALL SCREAMING)

That's right, go back
where you came from, you bastards.

We'll conclude today's graduation ceremony
with a demonstration by the black belts.

Okay, people, let's show 'em
what we've learned.

Kathy, get in there with Lois.

Uh... I can't. I have cramps.

Why are you putting me
up against the scrubs, Jared?

Why don't you be a man
and fight me yourself?

Well, Lois, the sensei
is a sacred position.

I could never violate the spiritual bond
of the student-master relationship.

Oh, then allow me.

ALL: Ooh.

The bond is broken.

Then spin the wheel, raggedy man.

Go, Lois! Pummel him
with your powerful fists of female fury!

And then, when he's weary,

emasculate him
with your incessant nagging.

Huh, women. Yakety-yak, yakety-yak-yak.

You know, huh?

Enjoy the fight.

Hiyah!

Lois, that was amazing.

Congratula...

This is mine.

This is where my babies come from.

ANNOUNCER ON TV:

<i>than one mile a year,</i>

<i>we're all dead!</i>

<i>Tell me something I don't know.</i>
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

Lois, I was watching that.

Whatcha... Whatcha looking at?

The underpants. Lose 'em.

Uh, actually, I... I kinda...
I sorta have a headache, kinda.

See, you know, maybe tomorrow or, uh...

-Take 'em off.
-Yeah, oh... Okay, honey.

Whoa. What the hell are you doing?

Those are my graham crackers.

Run along, Stewie.

Daddy had a rough night.

Why, you tottering fen-sucked dewberry.

I'm going to go find something
to strike you with. Excuse me.

Good morning.

Peter, you look terrible. What happened?

Last night, Lois was... The man.

Good Lord.

I just want you to know, Brian...

I didn't cry.

(SOBBING)

It's okay, it's okay.

(SOBBING)

Oh, no. Peter!

Stewie, what did you do?

It looks like he freed the beast
all over the back of Peter's head.

Oh, my God. This is my fault.

This is my fault. I brought violence
into this house.

I'm the worst mother in the world.

Aha! I got it all on tape.

STEWIE: <i>Okay, um,</i>
<i>this is me interviewing Ed Sullivan.</i>

<i>What's new, Ed?</i>

(IMITATING ED SULLIVAN) <i>Well, Stewie,</i>
<i>tonight we have a really big show.</i>

STEWIE: <i>Okay, okay, and now,</i>
<i>a word from our sponsors.</i>

<i>It takes a very steady hand.</i>
<i>Don't touch the sides.</i>

-(IMITATES BUZZER)
<i>-Butterfingers.</i>

I... I was making radio shows for fun.

Everybody does it.

At least, everybody I know.

Shut up!

Now, Stewart, I want you to take
this mommy doll and this daddy doll,

and show me how they act together.

Oh, yes, very well.

All right, um...

You see, Margaret,
after 20-odd years of marriage,

your curious indiscretions
no longer faze me.

(IN FALSETTO)
Really? And I suppose you think

I enjoy hanging onto those
hammocky deposits of gin sugars

you call buttocks?

What was that?
What did you just write there?

Give me that.

"Insecurity"? "Gender confusion"?

I'll give you something to write about.

Look at me. I'm insane.

I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender.

(SHRIEKING)

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
does Stewart have a history of aggression?

No, no, hitting Peter
Is the first violent thing he's ever done.

Well, technically,
the first act of violence

was that time bomb I left ticking
in your uterus before I came out.

Happy 50th birthday, Lois.

It's obvious that your son
is learning this behavior from someone.

I, uh... I know who's responsible
for Stewie's behavior.

But if I told you who it was,
Lois would beat the crap out of me.

-Now, just a minute.
-(SCREAMS)

The whole reason I started fighting
is because of you.

I felt weak. You...
You never listen to me.

You undermine me in front of the kids.

And besides, you're not...
You're not exactly

Father of The Year yourself.

Well, there seems to be a lot of anger
in your household.

You owe it to your son
to learn how to manage these feelings.

Manage what?

I know I went a little overboard
with my tae-jitsu,

but from now on, we're not going to have
any more anger in this house, okay?

Then tell Chris to quit drawing
pictures of me with a pig's body.

-Don't censor me!
-No more anger!

Okay.

The psychologist wants us
to try an exercise called role reversal,

where we pretend to be
the person who makes us angry.

I'll go first.

(IMITATING PETER)
Don't listen to your mother, kids.

She's worthless and dumb and ignore her,

and only listen to me, Peter.

I'm Lois, I brake for yard sales,

but I don't let Peter buy
anything he likes,

like that Narraganset beer sign
where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.

It was eight freakin' dollars,
and we have a dozen places to put it!

Ooh, ooh, me next, me next.

I'm the dog.

I'm well-read and have
a diverse stock portfolio,

but I'm not above eating grass clippings
and regurgitating them

on the small braided rug near the door.

I'm a pompous little Antichrist,

who will probably abandon my plans
for world domination

when I grow up and fall in love
with a rough trick named Jim.

Whoa, whoa, Peter, calm down.

I'm sick of Lois'
anger management techniques.

They're not working.

What about the writing angry letters
and not sending them exercise?

Oh, geez, I wasn't supposed to send those?

MEG: Hey, look, I got a letter from dad.

"Dear Meg,
for the first four years of your life,

"I thought you were a house cat."

Dad!

"Dear Stewie, get out."

Oh, that's nice.

Mine just says "Dear Lois."

And after that, it looks
like someone just spit on the paper.

You got something to say to me?

Yeah, "PS..."

(SUSTAINED SNORTING)

Oh, oh, hold on a sec.

(HAWKING LOUDLY)

Hold on, hold on, relax. Everybody, relax.

All right, look, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this,

but we need to get our anger under control
before we kill each other.

Now, my psychiatrist gave me these pills.

They're mood elevators.

I think they could help, uh...
Even us out.

We're not taking pills. It's not natural.

Neither is bleaching the hair
on your upper lip, Martin Mull.

Give us the pills.

were placebos, sugar pills.

Wait a minute. Are you telling me

I just sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo
for nothing?

Did it kill you to be multicultural

I... I died a little inside, yes.

Don't you use

-Wide load?
-Dough boy?

How about all of the above?

What do you got for me, Joe?

Oh, let me see here.
Uh, it's here somewhere.

Uh, yeah, here we are.

A big bag of liver spots for Lois.

You... You just hit me.

That's right.

You can't hit me.

I'm a girl.

Sometimes I wonder.

(GASPS)

Kicking, Lois?

Huh. Hurts, doesn't it?

You tell me.

Ow! Ow! Ow!

Ow! Oh!

Go, dad!

Kick her ass!

Shut up, this is all dad's fault.

I don't like to be touched!

(SCREAMING)

Ow! Ow!

(SCREAMING)

Ooh! Ow! Ow!

(SCREAMING)

(LAUGHING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Man, I'm glad we got that
out of our systems.

I wonder what came over us?

Maybe people are just naturally violent.

I don't believe that.

I think it's all the TV we watch.

There's so much violence.

Yeah, TV is dangerous.

Why the hell doesn't
the government step in,

and tell us what we can and can't watch?

And shame on the network
that puts this junk on the air.

Uh, Peter. Peter, maybe you shouldn't
say anything bad about the network.

Why, what are they going to do,
cut our budget?

(SCOFFS) I'm going to go get a beer.

Oh, let me guess. You've picked out
yet another colorful box with a crank

that I'm expected to turn and turn

until, ooh, big shocker, a Jack pops out.

And you laugh, and the kids laugh,
and the dog laughs,

and I die a little inside.

-(GASPS)
-Surprise, honey.

A trikey!

I think he likes it.

When I stick this Army guy
with the sharp bayonet up my nose,

it tickles my brain.

(LAUGHING)

Ow! Oh, now I don't know math.

Give it to me! Give it to me now, damn it!

-Not now, Stewie. When we get home.
-(SPRAY CAN HISSING)

That's right. You're a big fat phony!

What I'm about to show you

is a fight scene from <i>Star Trek,</i>
season one, episode 18.

And, as a bonus, I'm going to identify
when it's Shatner,

and when it's his stunt double,
Fred Lubins. Let's watch.

That's Shatner, of course. That's Lubins.

That's Shatner. That's Lubins.

That's Shatner. That's Lubins.

Now, that's Shatner,
but when I freeze-frame,

you can clearly see Lubins' coffee cup
sitting on that rock!

He is the biggest dork on the planet!

Oh, totally.

And so, because of his
rough-and-tumble style of command,

Captain Kirk is clearly superior
to Jean-Luc Picard.

Any questions... Meg?

No. Leave me alone!

Thank you, Neil, for that incredibly
irrelevant presentation.

We all know Captain Picard
is the superior officer.

Ugh!

Hey, everybody!
Mr. Lazenby's getting arrested!

(ALL CLAMORING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Well, what in God's name...

Mr. Lazenby,
what the hell's going on here?

Apparently, there's some law
against teaching the evolutionary theory

that Gil Gerard used a time machine,

went back, and ejaculated
into the primordial ooze.

This stupid country.

Hello, Tom Tucker,
live at James Woods High School

with this sensational breaking story.

A teacher caught molesting children...

With crackpot theories.

Full story at 11:00.

DIRECTOR: And out.

(GASPS) Oh, my God!
That's Tom Tucker from the news!

Hey, kids, remember, Mr. T says,

"I pity the fool who does drugs."

(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

-Better hurry up, Mr. Tucker.
-I'm coming.

<i>And reports indicate she has also consumed</i>
<i>a record amount of seamen.</i>

<i>by a substantial margin...</i>

("MOVING IN STEREO" PLAYING)

Hi, Meg.

You know how cute I think you are.

TOM: <i>A bit of turmoil</i>
<i>at the White House today,</i>

<i>when President Bush stuck his finger</i>
<i>in an electrical socket...</i>

-Whoa!
-(GASPS)

Yikes. Awkward.

TOM: <i>...that's where leprechauns</i>
<i>hide their gold. More at 11:00.</i>

Hey, you know who lives in this house?

A great big phony!

That's right! A phony lives here!

A big fat phony!

I say, look at me.

I feel like a regular grease monkey.

Hey, remember that time
I had that Mustang?

Oh, yeah, you took it
for a spin that time.

(LAUGHS) Yeah, that was awesome!

Then those chowder-heads on the corner,
they busted your stones.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, your sister say anything about me?

Oh, my God! I'm missing the news!

We all miss The News, Meg,

but Huey Lewis needs time to create,

and we have to learn to be patient.

And, in entertainment,

Mary Tyler Moore is 64-years-old today.

-Really? 64?
-Yes.

-Now, I thought she was dead.
-Nope. She's alive.

Fantastic. And now, this.

Are you an area high school student,

interested in the glamorous world
of unpaid internships?

If so, we'd like to invite you

to try out for Channel Five's
Young Anchor Program.

(GASPS) Oh, wow!

You'll gain valuable experience,

have a chance to work closely
with Tom and me,

and best of all,
produce your own on-air report.

So, call us now.

BOTH: Yeah!

(NARRATOR READING)

All right, question number one.

Would you consider growing a mustache?

I guess so.

Question number two.

Look at my mustache.

Do you think it tickles women
when I kiss them?

-I... I don't know.
-Wrong.

The answer is
"Only slightly. Only slightly." Next.

<i>Oh, God, I can't hire any of these girls.</i>

<i>They're all too pretty.</i>
<i>Their breasts are too perky.</i>

(GASPS) <i>Perfect!</i>

Congratulations! You got the job.

Oh, my God!

Oh, oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

This is beyond anything
I've ever dreamed of!

You and your partner will start
first thing tomorrow after school.

-Great! Who's my partner?
-Hey, there, hot stuff.

(GASPS)

Well, well.

It appears the fates have conspired
in our favor, eh, Meg?

Look, stay away from me, Neil.

Just because we're working together
does not mean I have to like you.

-Give it to me!
-What's that?

Give it to me, Neil!

MEG ON TAPE: <i>Give it to me!</i>

<i>Give it to me, Neil!</i>

Yeah, that'll work just fine.

Ugh!

Hey, look who's here, Diane.

It's our bright-eyed young interns.

Did you two remember
to wear your eager caps?

I sure did, Mr. Tucker.

Great! 'Cause you two are going
to have so much fun.

(CHUCKLES) Don't act any cheerier, Diane.
You'll give us all diabetes.

-Bite me, Tom.
-Come on, kids.

And here's where we produce
our in-studio celebrity interviews.

I just did one with Dustin Hoffman.

He's almost impossible to book,
but we got him.

<i>So, Dustin, it's been a while.</i>

<i>I got to say, you look great.</i>

<i>-Are you trying to seduce me...</i>
-TOM: <i>Mr. Tucker?</i>

(LAUGHS) <i>I am not trying</i>
<i>to seduce you, Dustin Hoffman.</i>

<i>You really look great.</i>

<i>Uh-oh. Twelve minutes to Wapner.</i>

<i>Yes, I understand your hectic schedule.</i>

<i>Well, Dustin, we really appreciate</i>
<i>you taking the time</i>

<i>to be with us here in the studio.</i>

<i>If there's anything</i>
<i>I can ever do for you...</i>

<i>Bring me Peter Pan!</i>

(LAUGHS) <i>I'll keep my eye out for him.</i>
<i>Thanks, Dustin.</i>

He's this tall.

Uh, can you believe it?

Our little Stewie learning to ride
his first tricycle.

Yeah, this is going to be
even more exciting

than when Brian taught me
about Christopher Columbus.

Where are we going, Brian?

Peter, we're going to visit the year 1492.

That's when Columbus set sail
on his famous voyage to the New World.

-We're on a ship.
-That's right.

This is the <i>Santa Maria,</i>
one of three ships Columbus took

to find a direct route to India.

-Any sign of India yet, fellas?
-Nothing yet, Captain.

India! But I thought
Columbus was going to America!

On the contrary, Peter.

Columbus discovered America
entirely by mistake!

Wow!

What the deuce do you think you're doing?
Back off, fat man.

Hang on, Stewie.

What the... Hey, hey, let go!

Get your filthy paws off.

Let go! Let go, I say! Let go!

Don't let go!

Oh, this is exhilarating!

-Go, Stewie!
-Yay, Stewie!

Here. I got to go check on dinner.

You keep taping Stewie.
Don't miss a moment.

PETER: I got it.

Oh, look... It's dancing with me.

It's like there's this
incredibly benevolent force

that wants me to know
there's no reason to be afraid.

Sometimes, there's so much beauty
in the world, it makes my heart burst.

It's just some trash blowing in the wind!

Do you have any idea how complicated
your circulatory system is?

Hi, Mr. Tucker.

I brought you some Rice Krispies treats,

'cause I remember you saying
you liked them once on the news.

See, look, this one,
it's in the shape of a heart.

I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man
in my spoon.

You'll have to come back later.

(MEG SIGHS)

(GASPS) Oh, my God!

Meg's in love with Tom Tucker!

Try to move in on my woman,
will you, Tom Tucker?

Well, no one crosses Neil Goldman
and gets away with it.

(CACKLING)

I added a little something to your coffee
that I don't think you're gonna like.

Here's your coffee, Mr. Tucker.

What the hell is in this?

Sweet 'N Low!

That's for trying to steal my woman!

Go back and bring it to me
with urine in it like I asked!

Yes, sir.

Nice bike.

Oh, if that's not the understatement
of the century.

It's cool.

Too cool for you.

Oh, no, no. No, no,
I think it's right where I'm at.

-Out of my way!
-Oh, well, I see.

Yes, yes, I suppose you do have to ride it
to truly appreciate its virtues.

Well, then, I'll just wait right here
till you get back.

(SIGHS) Where the devil is he?

You've obviously never met a bully.

What the deuce do you mean "bully"?

He wasn't taking it for a test ride.
He was just taking it.

(GASPS) You... You mean...

Mm-hmm.

(SOBS) He... Stole... My... Trikey?

(WAILING)

MEG: You know, Mr. Tucker,

has anyone ever told you your eyes are...

Hang on a second, sweetie.
I've gotta call Peter Jennings,

and reschedule our golf game.

(LINE RINGING)

(HENDRIX GUITAR INTRO PLAYING)

VOICEMAIL: <i>This is Peter.</i>

<i>-You know what to do.</i>
-(BEEPS)

Mr. Tucker, Ms. Simmons!

There's some nut on top of Town Hall
with a high-powered rifle!

The gunman has been identified
as the notorious mass-media murderer

who targets members of the press.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mass media murderer?

You know, I think
this would be a fine opportunity

to give our interns
some real world experience.

Hey, that means you'll get to ride
in the Action 5 News chopper.

I'm so jealous!
Better put in for some new interns.

Good luck.

I've got Hugh Downs up here,

and I'm going to splatter
his distinguished career

all over the pavement.

Hey, why me? Why the media?

I've got my reasons.

Dan Rather thinks he can just condense

a whole day's worth of events
into a half hour.

Oh, don't get me started on Rather,
that arrogant jerk.

Really? You know him?

I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody.
In fact, he's right down there.

-Where?
-(HUGH LAUGHS)

See you later, sucker!

And, by the way,
Rather is an okay guy in small doses.

Look how close we're getting, Meg.

Hey, that was my lucky assassin hat!

-(GUN FIRING)
-(ALL SCREAMING)

Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!

(GUN COCKING)

Oh, my God. We're going to die!

There's so much of life
I haven't experienced.

I never even got the chance

to be some drunk college guy's
last resort.

My years of expensive orthodontic work
will be a total waste!

I never even had my first kiss!

It's not too late, Meg.

I'm here for you.

-(GUNSHOT)
-(BOTH GASP)

Time to sign off.

Remember me, dirtbag?

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GRUNTING)

(GUN COCKS)

Wow, you saved those kids' lives,
Mr. Downs.

All in a day's work.

Remember, if you ever need me,
just blow this whistle.

Or call John Stossel's cell phone.

Hugh Downs away!

Oh, honey, thank God you're safe.
We were so worried.

<i>We now go to Junior Anchor Neil Goldman</i>

<i>Thank you, Diane.</i>

<i>There may have been</i>

I just want to kill myself!

I'm going upstairs right now

I'm allergic to peanuts.

You don't know anything about me!

Who was that guy?

I say, Constable, I'd like to report
the theft of my tricycle.

Oh, look at the little baby.

Aren't you cute?

Where's your mommy?

How dare you condescend to me?

I demand justice!

I'm here to turn myself in.

I have a dismembered Baltic hooker

Aren't you cute?

Where's your mommy?

(ALL SNICKERING)

(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Where did you get that shirt?

Neil's giving them out.

Hello, lover.

Neil, what are you doing?

I'm not your lover. I don't even like you.

Meg, I strongly suggest you hold my hand,

lest you look like a slut.

Listen, you freak!

Tell these people that there's nothing
going on between us.

Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg.

I won't let you burn.

(GROANS)

Al, why haven't I leaped?

Uh, Ziggy says you can't leap
until she loves you back.

Don't worry. I'll get her.

So, what were you wanting to work on?

-Cardio, upper body, what?
-Upper body, definitely.

I... I need to get buff,
so I can get my tricycle back.

Well, luckily, we're running a special
right now for the next 17 minutes.

Uh, okay, well, that's...
That's a little unusual,

but, uh, okay, well, tell me.

Okay, well, the normal plan

is 78 months at $40 a month and $200 down.

Watch this, forget the down,
are you watching?

-Yeah, uh...
-Goodbye, $40 a month, let's do $35.

Okay, $35, all right, now,
that's the cheapest?

Yeah, hang on, hang on.

Trace, can you bring me
some of those free gym bags?

-Thanks.
-Gosh, you know, I... I, you know...

I could probably just do
some push-ups at home.

Well, let's start you off
with the complete body fat test.

-Maybe a heart rate...
-You're actually not hearing me.

I don't think this is for me.
Um, thanks, anyway.

And, uh, for the future...

(WHISPERING) You came on a little strong.

What's going on here?

Oh, we invited Neil's family over
for dinner.

-Hi.
-Hello.

You what?

Yeah, we wanted
to get to know them better.

Seeing as how the two of you
will, one day,

bless our home with the pitter-patter

of sweet little grandchildren
as ugly as sin.

Meg, you never told me
your mother was such a stone-cold fox.

Now I see where you get it.

(CHUCKLES) Meg, he's so charming.

My name is Chris.

I'm supposed to be
on my best behavior tonight,

and not mention pooh.

Oh, God, what have I done?

(CHUCKLES) Well... Let's eat.

I think it's very, very nice
that our children had this wonderful kiss.

I remember when Muriel and I
had our first kiss,

and it was just awful.

Oh, just awful.

We were both very sick.

Weren't we, dear?

Oh, we were terribly sick.

We were both 14, and it was winter,

and we had terrible head colds.

Yes, mine, especially, was very bad.

I had terrible mucus
coming out from inside my nose,

and the other children,
they were very nasty to me about that.

They said bad, hurtful things to me.

They called me Tastykakes,

and they would beat me
and stick pine cones in my ass.

Those were very bad times.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Thank you very much.

Excuse me. I'm going to go throw up.

Ah, please flush the toilet twice.

Once for the bulk
and again for the remainder.

Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.

(CHUCKLING)

Hey, you're blocking my light,
you stupid baby.

You know, my hooligan friend,

I've been racking my brain
in a thus far fruitless attempt

to resolve our recent unpleasantness.

Then it dawned on me.

Your cruelty merely stems
from some deep-seated inner pain.

So, the obvious remedy
is a healthy dose of outer pain!

(SCREAMS)

Schoolchildren washing cars

Is there anything more arousing?

Finally, we go to Meg Griffin
for a special Channel Five

Junior Anchor segment on the moon. Meg?

MEG: The moon.
There's a reason no one goes there.

It's cold. And it's ugly.

And its surface is plagued
with deep craters and jagged peaks.

(GASPS) Oh, wait.

That's not the moon.

It's Neil Goldman's face.

Recently, many of you saw me
kissing this freak of nature.

But if I didn't think
I was seconds away from death,

I would've never done it.

I mean, who in their right mind would?

Well, I went to the streets to find out.

Would you kiss this guy?

-Ugh, no.
-No way.

-No.
-No.

-No.
-No.

Ugh! God, no.
What's the matter with you? Ugh!

It's official. Neil Goldman is unkissable.

Hear that, Neil?
I don't like you and I never will!

Back to you, Tom.

Thank you, Meg.

I guess beggars can be choosers.

And now this.

Well, well, isn't this a darling picture?

(GROANS) Let me go, man.

Tell me, how old are you, Charlie?

-Seven.
-Seven?

Well, my, my, you're practically a lady.

Ironic that your fate
is in the hands of an infant.

Now, tell me where my tricycle is!

I don't know. I lost it.

-Ow!
-Very well.

I have other ways of obtaining the truth.

(WHIRRING)

(CRYING) No! Don't!

Stewie... Look what I found.

(GASPS) My trikey!

What's going on down here?

Oh, we're playing house.

That boy is all tied up.

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story,
the President has been shot.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Tragedy strikes the nation.
The President has been shot.

What's the President doing in this casket?

We'll tell you right after this.

Hey, Meg, nice job
on that report last night.

Wow, thanks, Mr. Tucker.

That means so much, coming from someone
as handsome as yourself.

Say, how'd you like to pick up
a handsome man's dry cleaning?

(GIGGLES) Well, sure.

But isn't that Neil's job?

(SCOFFS) Little jerk
hasn't been in all day.

He hasn't?

We've got a breaking story!

There's some geek on top of Town Hall
and he's about to jump.

Oh, my God! Neil!

Is it Neil?

Huh, I've been calling him Ned all week.

Oh, my God. Neil, please don't jump.

I was just a piece of eye candy
that she turned into an all-day sucker.

-(CHOPPER BLADES WHIRRING)
-(SCREAMS)

(ALL GASP)

Mr. Tucker! Thank God, you're here.

Someone's gotta do something.
He's gonna fall!

I'm on it, Meg.

Hey, have that cartoon sound effect guy
cue up the...

(FALLING BOMB WHISTLES)

And then top it off with a... (SQUISHING)

And if there's time before commercial,

be ready with a wah-wah-wah-wah.

Oh, my God.

You don't care about him at all, do you?

All you care about
are your stupid ratings.

You're a horrible man.

-Neil, I'm sorry!
-Meg?

-Uh-oh.
-There he goes!

Good stuff, good stuff,
good stuff, good stuff!

-Neil!
-(THUD)

Meg. You do care.

Don't read too much into this, Neil.

Well, it's hard not to,
when I'm lying right on top of you.

Look, just because you're repulsive,

and probably the most annoying person
on the planet,

and I'm not the only person who thinks so,

that doesn't mean I want you to go
and kill yourself.

Ah, thanks, Meg.

But I was never really planning to jump.

Wasn't going to jump?

You're a phony!

Hey, everybody!

This guy's a great big phony!

who aren't familiar with the tradition,

can you tell us
about the Renaissance Faire?

Yea, but first, bride of Genghis,

thou must explainest to me
thy very peculiar electronic wand.

Ooh!

All right, Rupert, are you ready
to hear our Mad Lib?

(CLEARS THROAT)

"Cinderella had three wicked
stepwatermelons,

who were very smelly to her,

so her fairy godtoilet
turned a pumpkin into a fanny,

and sent her off to the poop.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my, how ruthlessly absurd!

LOIS: Peter! How was your big presentation
at Chris' class?

Oh, it was a huge waste of time.

Well, it couldn't have been that bad.

Oh, it was terrible.

Everyone else there
had some big, important job,

and was way more successful than me.

Hey, come on, you have...

You have a great job.

Yeah, you... You're doing...
You're doing...

You're doing good.

Peter, if you're not satisfied,
then be more assertive.

Invite Mr. Weed over for dinner,

and show him
what you have to offer the company.

Yeah, I guess I could.

I just hope it goes okay.

We've had some bad luck
with dinner guests.

You remember when Margot Kidder
was here?

Oh, we loved you
in the Superman movies.

You were just wonderful!

(HYSTERICAL SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Mr. Weed, I, uh, was wondering if maybe

you'd like to come over to my house
for dinner Friday night.

Huh. That wasn't so hard.

WEED: Well, what time?

Uh, I don't know, 7:30, 8:00?

Fabulous! What shall I bring?

Peter, calm down.
Everything's going to be fine.

Ah, I hope so, 'cause if I blow this,

I'm going to have to go back to my old job
at the "Electric Company."

-Duh...
-Ot.

BOTH: Dot.

-Buh...
-Et...

-Bet.
-Bet. I... I knew that.

-Slow it down, will you?
-Puh.

It.

-Pit.
-Pit. Come on, pal, it's my first day.

-Fuh.
-At.

-Fat.
-Oh, that's it, buddy!

(GRUNTING)

(CHOKING)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

That must be him.

Oh, God! I hope that thing doesn't happen

where I get nervous and I can't control
the volume of my voice.

Hello, Peter. How are you?

(YELLING) Fine!

(SOFTLY) Please come in.

It's so nice to have you over, Mr. Weed.

Thank you, Mrs. Griffin.

I understand that you have
a beautiful family.

Yes, we do, but the children
won't be joining us for dinner.

It's almost their bedtime.

(BLOWS TUNING WHISTLE)

State your names.

Meg.

Chris.

And I'm Liesl.

Mr. Weed, the Griffin children
would like to say goodnight to you.

Oh, well, thank you.

Bam! (LAUGHING)

Oh...

(CLEARS THROAT)

Peter, don't you have
something to say to Mr. Weed?

Oh, yeah.

Uh, Mr. Weed,

I don't care what the guys at work say.

I never thought
you were an effeminate weirdo.

Uh-uh. So, uh,
what kind of a name is "Weed"?

They gave it to my grandfather
on Ellis Island.

Our original name was Bermudagrass.

Peter, being here
with your wonderful family,

your beautiful home,
and your funny-talking dog,

well, I'm impressed.

In fact, starting Monday,

I would like to promote you
to Head of Toy Development.

-(COUGHS)
-Holy crap!

Ah, thanks, Mr. Weed!
Oh, you won't be sorry!

(GASPING)

Brian, quit it.
You're embarrassing me here.

Peter, Brian's choking!
Do the Heimlich maneuver! Quick!

(SPITS)

(CHOKING)

(YELLS)

He's dead!

(BOTH GASP)

(SCREAMING)

Forgot my purse.

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Let's not panic! Nobody even knows yet.

MAN: Police!

Random dead body search!

Oh, my God. Lois, stall them!

Peter, what are you doing?

Just... Just stall them, Lois!

(FLUSHING)

Ha, ha! Gotcha!

It's just me, Death.

I'm here for the body.

Oh, Peter, it's okay.

It's just Death.

Ah, thank God!

Uh, hey, did someone choke
on a roll in here?

Oh, no, no, no, I... I... I spit it up.

Oh.

Recapping our top story...

Doreen, I lost your phone number.

We met at the Sky Lounge last night.

Please call me.

In other news,
toy industrialist, Jonathan Weed,

was found dead last night
in the home of an employee

who claims Weed choked
on a dinner roll.

No charges will be filed
against the employee,

but the dinner roll has been taken
into police custody.

I'd do her, do her, wouldn't do her...

Ugh, who hasn't done her!

Do her, lose the pigtails and we'll talk.

Do her, do her...

And now, the last man
to see Jonathan Weed alive

has offered to say a few words.

Good afternoon, everyone.

As you know, we of the Christian faith
believe that Jesus is not really dead,

but that he must let the world think
that he is dead,

until he can find a way to control
the raging spirit that dwells within him.

(HUMMING OMINOUS TUNE)

Anyway, right before he died,

uh, Mr. Weed promoted me
to Head of Toy Development,

and I've brought along my attorney

who confirms that this constitutes
a verbal contract.

Isn't that right, Saul?

Yes, sir. Verbal contract.

Thank you.

Glad to see you all found your way
over from the cemetery.

I'm Leonard Hale, Mr. Weed's lawyer.

We found this tape
among Mr. Weed's personal effects

with instructions that it be screened
immediately following his funeral.

Enjoy.

Okay, we've got your typing test here,

about your, um...

Um, you know, your background
and... And, um...

Uh, skills...

And...

And?

You know, I... I gotta be honest with you.

I only have
another week and a half here,

and I have completely checked out.

Oh.

Yeah.

Well, what should I do?

Um...

(BLOWING SOFTLY)

Chef?

Oh, sorry, we're out of towels.

Uh, let me get that for you, sir.

(BLOWING LOUD)

(GASPING)

What, I'm supposed to pay
two bucks for stickers,

'cause this guy can't hear?

Come on!

Hey, I might be deaf,
but I have feelings!

Oh, uh, I... I mean...

What?

Has Dad found a permanent job yet?

Meg, your father's going
through a bit of a career transition.

He's just sampling a few things,

searching for something
that fits him just right.

(GASPS)

Well, clearly, it's not that tube top.

Hey, looking for a good time,
sweet cheeks?

Oh, my God!

Peter, get in the car!

Okay, but it'll cost you.
What do you want, a Cleveland Steamer?

I said, get in the car...
What's a Cleveland Steamer?

-It means that he'll...
-Whoa, whoa. Be cool. Be cool.

Yes, you go to Maple Street
and then take a left,

and then, uh... You go, uh...

Okay, so you want a party or what?

Get in this car right now!

It's eerie, isn't it?

Like looking into the future.

MAN: <i>Forgetful Freddy was so forgetful...</i>

AUDIENCE: <i>How forgetful was he?</i>

<i>He was so forgetful,</i>

<i>whenever he tried</i>
<i>to remember someone's name,</i>

<i>he drew a blank.</i>

Oh, God, this is all my fault.

If I hadn't pushed you so hard
to invite Mr. Weed to dinner,

he'd still be alive
and you'd still have your job.

Don't worry, Lois,
we'll get through this.

We just have to scrimp a little,
that's all.

You know, sell some stuff
we don't really need.

This will bring in a couple of bucks.

Peter, please, listen to me!

When we got married,

you always talked
about your one dream job.

Remember?

And you put that dream aside
in order to provide for this family.

Yeah?

Well, I've saved some money
from teaching piano,

and I say, this is the perfect time
for you to pursue that dream.

-Really?
-Yes!

Wow. You know,
since money's getting tight,

I was going to suggest
that we eat the kids.

You know, I mean, like, jokingly at first,

but then I was going
to gauge your reaction,

and if you were cool with it,

then, uh, you know,
we could go from there.

But this is a much better idea.

I'm going to do it, Lois!

I'm going to realize my dream!

I am going to be
a Renaissance Faire jouster.

Oh, Peter!

(SCREAMS)

LOIS: Oh, this is so exciting!

My little jouster's first day.

Here's your lunch.

Thanks, honey.

Oh, egg salad?

Have a good time.

Yeah, I'll try.

-Hey, Mort!
-Oh God, don't hurt me!

Oh, hi, Peter.

Hey, you're going to be a jouster, too?

Yes, I'm trying to overcome
my fear of swords,

because a man in a pirate suit
stabbed me in the ear

when I was five.

And then, again when I was 30.

What about you, the same?

Nah, not really.

It kind of all goes back to when I was 18.

I was going through that rebellious phase,
and, uh...

I was hanging out with a bad crowd.

Here, Peter. Try one of these.

What is it?

It's a cheeseburger.

(LAUGHING)

Of course, now I know
it wasn't a cheeseburger.

But at that time,
I was ready to believe anything.

I didn't know what the hell was going on.

I wandered around for hours,

and somehow ended up
at the Renaissance Faire.

I can fly!

Oh, my God!

(SCREAMING)

I was saved by the one
and only Black Knight

of the Quahog Renaissance Faire.

A word of advice,

the path to knighthood is paved
with strength and nobility,

not LSD and sideburns.

And from that moment on,
I knew someday,

I wanted to be a knight like him.

Ah, mercy, I was once addicted
to antihistamines.

I took so many,
I thought I was Mr. Peanut.

Ah, that's a great story, too.

So, you all think you got
what it takes to be jousters?

If you're going to joust,
you got to want it!

Let me hear your war cry!

(EXCLAIMS WEAKLY)

Is that the best you got,
you pile of crap?

Yes.

From an early age,
my parents discouraged loud noises.

You know what you are?
You're a candy-assed maggot!

(CHUCKLING)

-You find something funny, maggot?
-Sir, no, sir!

You love the Middle Ages, don't you?

Sir, yes, sir!

The concept of a geocentric universe

gets you sexually excited, doesn't it?

Sir, yes, sir!

You wanna make 16th century mathematician,
Johannes Kepler, your bitch, don't you?

Sir, yes, sir!

-Welcome, apprentices!
-(GASPS)

It's him!

Look alive, ladies.

Allow me to introduce
the best of the best,

the Black Knight himself!

And this is his trophy wench,
Maid Madeline!

Ding.

Uh, excuse me, uh, Mister Black Knight?

I'm busy.

Oh, well, uh, I...
I just wanted to thank you.

I... I don't know if you remember,

but, uh, when I was a kid,

you helped me get my life back
on the right path.

Ah!

Damn it! Look, I'm busy, all right?

Oh, okay, I'll come back later.

Damn rookies.

Are all the other men
out of the shower yet?

Hey, you, Porker.

Yes, I'm calling you a porker,

and there's nothing you can do about it,

because I'm protected
by my impenetrable cereal box fort.

(EVIL LAUGH)

Hey, you, Drunky.

Yes, that's right. I'm calling you Drunky,

and there's nothing you can do about it,
because I'm protect...

Ah!

Oh, the toast is ready.

PETER: I'll get it, Lois.

There you go.

Uh, Peter, maybe you shouldn't bring
your lance to the table.

Lois, if I'm going to get good enough
to impress the Black Knight,

my lance must be with me at all times.

Aw, you guys are going to be so proud
when you see me out on that field.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go practice.

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

Oh, my God, Dad, my earring!

Dad, stop! Ah!

Uh, yeah, two mutton joints, please.

Oh, thou wishest to feast

on the appendage of the humble ovine.

Listen, you freak,
we don't all watch <i>Frasier,</i> okay?

Now give me two mutton joints.

Thank you!

'Tis a glorious afternoon,
wouldst thou not agree?

Uh, uh, uh... Yea, kind shrew.

Uh, I... Before... Thee...

Except after C.

Wouldst thou take a gander
underneath my frock?

Uh... Uh, sure.
Whatever floats your boat.

There you go.

Geez, freaking perverts.

Madeline!

Go wait in the Hyundai!

What were you doing with my girl?

Huh? Oh, oh, geez.

She walks over here and asks me
to put a bird in her panties.

I'm standing here going,
"What the hell?"

(GRUNTS) Oh, God!
Peter, play dead!

Curl up in an ass-ball or something!

What? What's the problem, BK?

I don't like you.

I don't like your face,

and I don't like you
hanging around my girl.

I don't ever want to see you here again.

Oh.

Okay, so we... But we can see each other
outside the fair, right?

I'm just trying to understand
the rules here.

If I see you again, I'll kill you.

Okay, that's much clearer.

Oh, God, I think I just miscarried!

Peter, what are you doing?

I spent hours soldering
that costume for you.

I don't need it anymore, Lois.

I quit the team.

Quit the team?

But you can't quit jousting.

The big meet is today,
and I thought you were...

(LAUGHING) Did you just say "big meet?"

(GIGGLING)

Oh, my God, I did.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, we almost missed that one.

I know, that was a close one.

But I'm being serious here, Peter.

We were all set
to come see you joust today.

You were so excited

to be on the same field
as the Black Knight.

Well, I'm going to be watching it
from the stands, Lois.

Because the Black Knight
is just a big jerk.

Just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.

There you go, all fixed.

Turns out a half-eaten meatball
was clogging up the intake.

Oh.

Well, did you save it?

Uh, no.

You bastard.

DIANE: Well, it's an exciting day for all

here at the Renaissance Faire
jousting meet.

Wouldn't you say, Tom?

Diane, I'd say it was a perfect day,

if you weren't reminding us all
of our grandmothers' cleavage.

Now let's go live to the field

where the Black Knight is preparing
to challenge his next opponent.

(BUGLES BLOWING)

(CHEERING)

<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

Hey.

How you doing there, big guy?

You holding up all right?

You want a soda?

Hmm?

Ah, screw it, I tried.

The Black Knight's next challenger
will be Sir Mort Goldman.

(GRUNTING)

(WHIMPERING)

Oh, God, I forfeit!

TOM: Well, that's it, folks.

It looks like the Black Knight
is out of challengers,

and is once again undefeated.

Hey, what's your fat ass doing here?

He's my only means of conveyance.

But I guess I do spoil him.

Clearly, you do.

And what are you doing here, Griffin?

I thought I told you
never to show your face here again!

Hey, we're just watching.
I don't want any trouble.

Well, you got trouble
if you don't beat it.

-Listen, buddy...
-I said, get lost!

-Where's he going?
-Dad!

Let him go, kids.

You see that, kids?

Your father's nothing but a fizzle!

Nobody calls me a fizzle
and gets away with it!

(CROWD GASPS)

Except that one guy
who called me a fizzle,

and then ran off.
He got away with it.

But most people who call me a fizzle
don't get away with it!

Well, actually,
that guy who got away with it

was the only one
who ever called me a fizzle.

After today, only half the people
who ever called me a fizzle

will have gotten away with it!

It appears a new challenger
has entered the field.

The crowd has fallen deathly ill.

Silent. Sorry.

Oh, my God, I'm going to die!

Oh, ah, ah, to the owner
of a yellow Hyundai,

your car is being towed.

What?

I won!

(CHEERING)

Oh, Peter, that was amazing!

You were so brave!

Nice going, Dad!

Oh, boy, that was lucky
about the car, huh?

Take that, you bastard!

Nobody makes a fool out of Mort Goldman!

Spectacular performance, maggot!

How would you like to come
on the road with us

as our lead jouster?

Thanks, but no thanks, Coach.

I've lived my dream.

And besides,
my life is here with my family.

But, Mom, what's Dad going
to do for a job?

LOIS: Oh, it'll be okay, Chris.

Remember that episode of <i>The Honeymooners</i>
when Ralph lost his job,

but at the end of the show,
he didn't get it back?

PETER: Oh, yeah, what was up with that?

That bugged the crap out of me.

I have not, Lois.

He's right. It's actually been
more like, uh... (GRUNTS)

You at least have to do something

All right, all right.

Brian, let's go for a walk.

Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong?

My life, that's what's wrong!

I was totally humiliated
at school today.

Okay, we're going to do
a little informal survey here, kids.

Would those of you
who are going away for spring break,

please move to the left of the room?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Oh, Meg, what do those kids know?

They know how to have a good time.

Well, so do we.
I'll tell you what.

How about you and I have
our own little spring break?

We'll go to that fancy new spa
that just opened up in Warwick.

Massages and facials...
Ah! It'll be great.

What do you say?

Well, I guess it couldn't be worse
than last year

when we all went to Sea World.

(GIGGLING)

And how long has this been going on?

(SIGHS)
You know, Lois is right.

I've been out of work too long.

Well, I think you should find something
you really enjoy doing.

Take those guys out there, for example.

Where?

Oh, yeah, now, that's a job.

Fresh sea air, working outside.

That's how a real New England man
makes a living.

Well, maybe that's something
to think about, Peter.

What's that, Daddy?

Well, that's Mercury, Jake,
the planet closest to the sun.

What it's doing down here by the wharf,
I haven't the foggiest,

but we should probably ask a scientist.

I'm a guy, you jackass!

Ah, yeah, that feels good.

Chris, don't forget
to mist under his chins.

(GASPS)

Oh, boy, Lois,
it's a real mess down there.

I'm afraid I'm not going
to be able to do this

in the time I quoted you earlier.

Chris, shut the hose off for a second.

Everybody, I have an announcement.

I am going to drop this weight
and rejoin the workforce.

I have decided to become
a professional fisherman.

What? Why a fisherman?

It makes perfect sense, Lois.

You know how much time
I've spent on the ocean.

Wilson!

What are we going to do now?

Wilson!

Wilson!

My name is Voit, dumb ass!

Hello, Doreen? Yeah,
I'm still over at the Griffin job.

Um, listen, tell Walter
I'm not going to be able

to make it to the construction site.

So, um, I don't know, have him send Frank
or Glen or Harelip Steve.

I know, it creeps me out, too.

So you think I can find
a boat here, huh, Joe?

Oh, yeah. You wouldn't believe
what we confiscate from these crooks.

Welcome. We open today's bidding

with this pair of panties
confiscated from a prostitute.

50 bucks!

She had nine STDs.

45 bucks.

And when we caught her,
she wet herself.

50 bucks.

Excuse me.

Are you going to sell anything
that's not gross?

And now, our next item.

Please direct your attention to this photo
of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.

Oh, man, that's perfect.

$12,000.

-$13,000.
-$25,000.

Sold for $25,000.

-Yes!
-Aw, crap!

Thanks.

And now, the actual boat itself.

-Do I have an opening bid for...
-$50,000.

Sold for $50,000.

Good for you, Peter.

(WOOD CLACKING)

Congratulations.
You've just bought yourself a cursed boat.

-Cursed?
-The last captain of that vessel

lost his life, and it weren't no accident.

His name was Salty,

and he was devoured by Daggermouth,
the man-eating bluefish.

You want to buy that boat?

Go ahead, take it,

but don't expect me to fish your dead body

from an angry sea
that gave you fair warning.

Are you up for bids, too?

You are just precious.

Are you going to miss me?

Only until I go to the newsstand
and buy a <i>Hustler.</i>

(BOTH GIGGLE)

All right, I left you the number
for the spa.

See you in a few days.

Not if I strangle myself
with a seaweed wrap and die.

(CHUCKLES) You are dark!

Uh, Peter, you still haven't told me
how you expect to pay for that boat.

Don't worry, Brian.

There's got to be a hundred banks
that'll give me a loan.

Oh, wow, so you can really give me loan?

I sure can.

You see, Mr. Griffin,
what sets us apart from other banks,

is that other banks are banks.

Now, I trust you have collateral.

Um... I got three kids.
(CHUCKLES)

I'll take 'em. Just kidding.

Or maybe I'm not. Sign this.

Here you go. Good luck.

So, what do you want on your thigh?

I want a skull.

Okay, well, I can draw Kermit the Frog.

How about a nice Kermit the Frog?

No, I want a skull.

Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead
and do Kermit the Frog.

Mom, this is so lame.

Come on, Meg, try to have fun.

I promise after a few days here,

you won't even remember
the word "Spring-break."

(SIGHS)

How about some TV?

This is MTV and we're rocking
at spring break.

<i>Hey, this is VH1</i>
<i>and we're rocking at spring break.</i>

...leaving thousands injured.
For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw,

keeping it real and kicking ass
at spring break!

Woo!

(SIGHS)

There she is, boys,

<i>the S.S. More Powerful Than</i>
<i>Superman, Batman, Spiderman</i>

<i>And The Incredible Hulk</i><i>Put Together.</i>

Yes, she's a fine vessel.

Welcome to the wharf.
The name's Hennessey.

Hi, there. Peter Griffin.
My friends call me Peter for short.

I'll let you in
on a little secret, neighbor.

The best fishing
is at latitude 42, longitude 71.

-Keep that to yourself.
-Oh, wow, thanks.

Hey, I'll see you, fellas.
I got some fish to catch.

Ah, let's see.
"Latitude 42, longitude 71."

This is it. What the hell?

Papa, he killed Mordecai,
the dancing Yiddish clown.

Stop crying.

You just became a man, now act like one.

Hey, Hennessey, what's the big idea
sending me to that bar mitzvah?

'Cause I don't like you
and I don't like your face.

We don't need any more fishermen
crowding up this wharf.

Oh, well, fine, Hennessey.
You want an enemy, you've got one.

Fine!

(GRUNTS) There we are.

So, Steve, you ever think
of growing a mustache?

Nice fish you got there, Griffin.

What are you selling? Your bait?

Um, nice face, Hennessey.

Yes! Me one, you zero.

Hey!

Wow. So, how do you do it?

Oh, you're very nice to ask.

Well, first I hang the old worm out there.

They usually go for it.

So, I jerk them around a little,

they fight for a while,

and then they just lay back and accept it.

How about we get together later?

-Um, okay.
-(LAUGHING)

What the hell?

Oh, damn it.

(CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

(GASPS)

Hey, what's going on here?

Peter, did you read the fine print
on this loan contract?

Um, if by read you mean
"imagined a naked lady," then, yes.

Peter, listen.
The bank's taking all our stuff.

And according to this,

if you don't pay them within 48 hours,
they get the house, too.

Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!

Meg, did I ever tell you
that if you're on birth control,

and you take an antibiotic,
it makes it not work?

Because no one told me.

(LAUGHING)

I thought you should know.

Look, Mom, I don't really feel like
talking right now, okay?

Fine. I just don't understand
why we had to leave the spa so early.

Look, I just want to go home,

and spend the next three days
in solitary confinement,

where I belong.

Well, I tried.

(GASPS)

MEG: Mom, what the hell
are we doing here?

This is where you wanted to be,
right, honey?

Yeah, but not with you.

Hey, did you hear what happened
to that dude from U. Mass?

He got so drunk,
he fell off his hotel balcony.

He's in a coma.

Oh, man, I want to party with him.

-You know it!
-Yeah!

-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
-Woo! Woo! Woo!

Hey, look, Meg made it, you guys.

Yeah, and she brought her mommy.

(ALL LAUGH)

Oh, my God.

Come on, Meg, get out of the car.

Like the kids say,
"Up your nose with a rubber hose."

(LAUGHS) Whoo!

Hey, look, everybody,
it's Spuds McKenzie.

(YELLING)

(DOG GROWLING)

(YELLING)

Well, that's the last of the furniture.

(SIGHS)

No TV. I miss my friends,

John Ritter and Florence Henderson
and Alfonso Ribeiro.

Is he the guy from <i>Silver Spoons?</i>

Um, uh... No, he was on
<i>French Prince of Bel Air.</i>

<i>Fresh Prince.</i>

<i>Fresh Prince of Bel Air,</i>

but, you know, I don't know
if was also on...

-Hey, Alfonso.
-Yeah?

-Were you on <i>Silver Spoons?</i>
-Yes, I was.

Oh, there you go.

Come on, just a little higher, honey.

Mom, I don't think I can... (CHOKING)

Hey, who's holding Lois?

I don't know. Some dude named Mel.

This is Carson Daly,
and we're live here at Spring Break.

Who wants to party?

Okay, one, two, three, four, five.

Okay, we're going to need cake
and juice for 14 people.

All right, now let's go to Tom Green,

who's going to do something
really outrageous.

Does anyone out there like me yet?

Can I stop this?

Hey, what the hell
are you doing in my house?

Your house?

This is my house.

My wife and I bought it from the bank.

But I still got another day
to pay back the loan.

The bank said it wouldn't matter,
because you're a fat, deadbeat loser.

Fat, deadbeat loser?

Well, sir, while I may not agree
with what you say,

I'll defend to the death
your right to say it.

There we are. Its a Van Gogh print.

Isn't it beautiful?

Oh, yes, I've often fantasized

about what this house would be like
with more culture.

-The port is quite good.
-Yes, quite good.

-Indeed.
-Most certainly.

-What year is it? Delectable.
-'51.

-Indeed.
-Yes.

-Oh, dear.
-What is it?

-I've spontaneously combusted.
-Oh, I am sorry.

It's quite all right.
I've grown tired of living.

-Very good, then.
-For the best.

-Indeed.
-Is it raining again?

Hey, did you hear the one about us?

Wow, you're such a good dancer.

Way to go on that beer bong.

Yeah, no fake. No fake.

Mom!

Hey, what are you doing here?

What am I doing here?

I've been waiting out here for hours.

What?

You were supposed
to pop inside real quick

and find someone
who looked enough like me

so I could use their ID.

And then you were supposed to come out

and give me the ID so I could get inside.

(CHUCKLING) What?

God, it's like talking
to a three year old.

Oh, you know what?

You need to learn
how to loosen up a little, toots.

Yeah, I get the feeling
you're loose enough for the both of us.

-What?
-Nothing.

That's right, nothing.

Don't you sass me.

(PHONE RINGS)

Good evening. Stevenson residence.

Chris, honey, we've been over this
a thousand times.

It's pronounced Griffin.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, Chris.

Put your father on.

Hey, Dad.

And the French guy says,
"Deodorant? What's that?"

(ALL LAUGH)

All right, all right.
I've... I've got one.

I've got one.

Um, okay, two men are standing
at the pearly gates...

Oh, God, wait,
how did that one go?

Well, anyway, it turns out
they're Siegfried and Roy.

I'm no good at telling jokes.

Dad, it's Mom.

Oh, God, please be Somerset Maugham.
Please be Somerset Maugham.

Hello?

-Peter?
-Damn.

I was just calling
to check in with my boys.

See how you guys are doing.

Oh, uh, we're fine.

(LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND)

What's all that noise?

Uh, nothing. Nothing.

LOIS ON TAPE: <i>Peter,</i>
<i>I need you to take out the trash.</i>

Okay, Lois.

Lois, I got to go.

Holy crap, Brian, what am I going to do?

Lois is going to be home
in a couple of days,

and we're getting kicked out
of the house tomorrow.

What do you suggest?

Get out your ring.

Peter, that's not going to...

Come on!

BOTH: Wondertwin powers, activate!

Form of... Steam!

Peter, we got these
in a box of Frankenberry.

A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal!

It looks like a jackal! Jackal! Jackal!

It's a Jackal! Jackal!

Time!

It wasn't right
the first time you said it,

why the hell would it be right
the next ten times?

God!

Oh, man, I am screwed.

I'm going to lose my house,
and my boat and everything.

How am I going to come up
with 50 grand by tomorrow?

You could whore yourself out
to a thousand fat chicks

for 50 bucks apiece.

Or 50 really fat chicks
for a thousand bucks.

What? Don't look at me like that.

Fat chicks need love, too...

But they got to pay.

Ah, what is this?

Sea water. Courtesy
of that gentleman over there.

(LAUGHING)

You need 50 grand, Griffin?

Well, I got a suggestion for you.

Why don't you kill Daggermouth?

Maybe I will, Hennessey.

OLD MAN: You'd be buying yourself
a one-way ticket to a watery grave.

Daggermouth is the meanest,
most ruthless creature

that's ever inhabited the sea.

Legend has it he dwells
out by Fish Stench Cove.

He'll kill any man
that comes near there.

I saw him once.

Sure, I'm blind in one eye,

and my other eye was infected that day
from picking at it,

and I was tired,

and I'd been swimming in a pool
with too much chlorine,

and that was the hour
my glasses were at Lenscrafters,

but I seen that fish!

Well, if there's 50 grand in it,
I don't think I got a choice.

Well, you could whore yourself out
to a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks.

No, we covered that.

You ain't got a chance, Griffin.

Daggermouth killed my friend, Salty,

and he was twice the fisherman you are.

And half the weight.

(SIZZLES)

Hey, no. No. Hot.

He's right, Peter.

It'd be suicide to go after that fish.

There's got to be another way.

We could have a bake sale.

Oh, now, see,
I think that's a neat idea.

No, I am not going to let my family
live on the street.

Not even if it means
ending up like Seamus here.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I have a date with destiny.

So, were you, like,
in an accident or what?

No. Me father was a tree.

What's wrong with me?

I got to be crazy to think
I can kill that man-eating fish.

I mean, what the hell am I doing?

Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, Peter.

What kind of talk is that?

Yeah, you can do it.

-Who's my big, brave boy, huh?
-Me.

-Who's my big, brave boy?
-Me.

(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

(LAUGHS)

-This sucks, Mom.
-Meg, stop moping.

These are the best years of your life.

Now, let's get up there
and live a little, huh?

Mom! I look like an idiot.

No, you don't.

Come on. Just move your hips a little,
like this.

(CHANTING) Lois, Lois, Lois, Lois...

(CHANTING) Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

(ALL CHANTING) Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

Attagirl. Shake your moneymaker!

Oh, my God! It's a chick!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

All right, everybody. This party's over.

Hey, why do you cops
always have to kill our buzz?

He used a teenage colloquialism.

Get the tear gas.

Not so fast, big guy.

What are you guys doing here?

We're going to help you kill the fish.

But this is going to be dangerous.
We could all die.

Oh, come on.
You're our best friend, Peter.

Besides, I can remember a time
when you saved all our butts.

(MUFFLED) Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

Hyah!

Yeah, too bad I didn't get there
till after the sodomy.

All right, let's go kick
some fish ass, eh?

(ALL CHEERING)

I can't believe I just showed
everyone my tater tots.

Worst of all, now I'm going to have
a police record!

Now, Meg, if you're going to grab
a hold of life,

you've got to expect
to get your hands dirty once in a while.

It was kind of cool
that people noticed me.

That's the spirit, honey.

Okay. One, two, three, tuck and roll!

Ah. We're right on course, guys.

Give me another beer.

Ah. You know,
these are the precious moments,

the four of us out at sea,

miles away from civilization,
tossing back brews.

-Amen.
-You got that right.

Hey, hey, you guys. Here's one for you.

Let's say none of us were married.

If you could have any woman in the world,
who would it be?

Mariel Hemingway.

-Ah, come on! Really?
-That's not a very good choice.

She's so jagged.

No, no. I think she's very attractive
in a classical kind of way.

Yeah, but you could cut a roast
on her face.

I would go with Margaret Thatcher.

-Margaret Thatcher?
-Margaret Thatcher?

-Why the hell Margaret Thatcher?
-Ew!

Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy?

Not one of you finds power sexy?

-How about you, Peter?
-Like you gotta ask.

The chick with the three knockers
from <i>Total Recall.</i>

-Interesting.
-I never saw that movie.

Hey, you know, one of them
was papier maché, right?

Oh, gee! Can I change my ans...

Of course, I know it's paper...
I don't care!

What's wrong with you.

-So, what about you, Quagmire?
-Taylor Hanson.

Taylor Hanson's a guy.

(LAUGHS)

Oh, you guys are yanking me!

Ha! Hey, let's put one
over on old Quagmire!

(LAUGHS)

No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire.

What...

Well, this is insane!

That's impossible!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
I can... Oh, God, I...

Oh, I got all these magazines...

Oh, God, oh, God!
Oh, God!

(GASPS)

This must be Fish Stench Cove.

Right now, all we got to do
is find the fish.

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
I wonder where that fish did go.

A fish, a fish, a fishy, oh.

I heard that when Daggermouth eats you,
he devours your guts first.

I heard he doesn't just eat you,
he eats your soul.

I heard that one of Shannon Doherty's eyes
is off-center,

'cause it's trying to escape.

MALE VOICE: Welcome, gentlemen.

(ALL GASP)

It's him! Quick, shoot him!

Not so fast.

Perhaps I could offer you a glass of port,

and you a glass of starboard.

(CHUCKLES) That's a little nautical joke.

I'm a fish, you see.
I'm also delightfully mad.

Oh, dear. Would you mind holding still
for a moment?

These antique pistols
take about ten minutes to reload.

Peter, catch!

Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe.

Peter, shoot him!
Oh, yeah. Right.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

My God.

Isn't it amazing that that's what
we all look like on the inside?

It's a robot, you idiot.

-Who are you?
-I'm Salty.

Salty? But everybody said
you were killed by that fish.

That's what I wanted them to think.

I disappeared and spread
the Daggermouth rumor myself.

-Why?
-Merchandise.

Daggermouth T-shirts, mugs, posters,

and I'm in talks with Nickelodeon
for a cartoon show.

Figured I'd pair him with an
effeminate cat. What do you think?

-Yeah, I'd watch that.
-Sure, sure.

-Yeah, me, too.
-Sounds like a good balance.

And now I'm going
to give you $50,000 to be on your way.

$50,000? But why?

To keep your mouth shut,

and because the longer we stay here,
the more people are going to question

how a fisherman
with no engineering background

managed to build
a sophisticated talking fish robot.

You know, honey,
I'm really sorry for how I acted...

Getting so drunk
and ditching you at the bar,

and letting those boys
take pictures of you

while you were sleeping.

I was so busy having fun,
I guess I kind of ruined it for you.

(HORN HONKS)

Uh-oh. We got company.

(HORN HONKS)

Looks like your fans are back, Mom.

(CHANTING) Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

No, I think this one's all yours.

-Whoo!
-You go, girl.

MAN: See?
One's an innie and one's an outie.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now,</i><i>back to</i>
Daggermouth and Boom Boom

<i>on Nickelodeon.</i>

Boom Boom, did you do
your exercises today?

Yes. I did 20 laps
and I'm about to do 20 more.

-Oh, you...
-Yikes!

Oh, Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman
is working out for you.

You know, I got to admit,

I half expected to come home
and all our stuff would be gone,

and we'd owe somebody
a whole lot of money.

How can you half expect something?

I... I don't know.
It's just a turn of phrase.

How do you turn a phrase?

God, you're dumb.

Thank God for that ass.
Now, come here and kiss me.

-Goodnight, honey.
-Goodnight, Lois.

Goodnight, Jim and Abbie.

BOTH: Goodnight.

My sister just called.

Her baby's due any day now

-Scream and you're dead.

Thanks for the ride, lady.

Hey, it's the Griffins.
What can I do for you?

Glenn, we have a family emergency.

We really need you to take the kids
for just a couple of days.

Uh, in accordance with Megan's Law,
I'm obligated to inform you that...

You know what, that's fine.
I'll take the kids.

Aw, thanks, buddy.

Gosh, I never entertained kids before.

Oh, it was so nice of you to come, Peter.

You're so considerate.

-Ah, it was nothing.
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

(GLASS SHATTERS)

(FURNITURE DRAGGING)

Mr. Quagmire, I finished
the scavenger hunt.

Well, hold your horses, hold your horses.
Let's go down the list.

-Uh, an unsharpened pencil?
-Check.

A speed-limit sign
that doesn't end in five or zero?

-Check!
-Your mom's hairbrush?

-Check!
-You win!

Oh, boy! What's my prize?

-A pencil and a speed sign.
-I did it!

I'll be right back.

A couple of teeth
and some toenail clippings,

and we'll be ready for our date.

PETER: Hey, Carol, since Ted dumped you,
can I have his shirts?

Peter, what are you gonna do
with Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

I know, I know, but check this out.

Hey, Carol, say, "David Banner,
I just slashed your tires."

David Banner, I just slashed your tires.

(SCREAMS)

(LAUGHING)

I'm priceless!

Peter, sit with Carol.
I'm gonna use the ladies room.

Does she still take the newspaper
in there?

Ugh, yeah.

And after she does, I just can't read it.

Oh! Oh, God!
The baby's gonna be here any minute.

We'd better get moving.

Carol, you gotta relax.

You let that kid start calling
the shots now and you're screwed.

Is Mr. Quagmire babysitting
all these people, too?

Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
I'd put U and I together.

Hey, you must be a parking ticket,

'cause you got "fine" written
all over you.

Hey, there. I don't wanna
come between you... Or do I?

Oh, that's awful. That's awful.

Um, this is a song I've been singing
for a number of years,

and I find it grows truer and truer
as time goes by.

(SINGING)
<i>Hungry eyes</i>

<i>I feel the magic</i>
<i>between you and I</i>

Ooh, I'm hungry for you, baby.

Come on, walk with me, talk with me.

(SMACK)

(HORN BLARING)

(GASPING)

(GROANING)

Don't worry, Carol. We're almost there.

Peter, why have we stopped?

Um, yeah, I'll have three cheeseburgers.

Peter, for God's sake,
she's having a baby!

Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
And, uh, I guess I'll have fries.

I... If I have fries,
is anybody else gonna have any?

'Cause you know, I don't wanna be
the only one eating 'em.

I'll feel like a fatty.

-Nurse, this woman is in labor.
-Excuse me. I was here first.

My leg is asleep.

(GROANING)

All right, let's see what we have here.

Oh, the baby's crowning.

(GROANING)

All right, I'm just going
to put on a pair of gloves

and we'll deliver this baby.

These don't feel like gloves at all.

They feel like used needles.

But this is where I always
keep the gloves.

Uh, maybe if I dig deeper.

No, just feels like more needles.

That's the craziest thing.

Oh. Now I'm sure
this isn't the glove drawer.

Oh, my God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?

Honey, do something!

No baby, but it looks
like Carol's blowing a bubble.

-Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
-I am! It won't go back in.

Not you, Peter. Carol, push.
Peter, you pull.

(SCREAMS)

-Oh, my God!
-What? What?

It's a beautiful baby girl.

-Oh, a baby girl. I'm so happy!
-(BABY CRYING)

But she has a penis.
We'll have to do something about that.

-Peter, no! It's a boy.
-Well, how do you like that!

Hey there, little fella.
Welcome to the planet Earth!

Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!

-(FARTS)
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

Hey, he takes after his Uncle Peter.

Peter, he's Carol's baby. Give him to her.

Oh, oh, yeah.

Honey, you were fantastic.

And you were so cute
when you were holding it.

I know. I didn't wanna give it up.

-Yeah?
-Let's steal it.

-What?
-No, wait. I got a better idea.

-Lois, let's have another baby.
-What?

-Sweetie, you're not serious?
-I sure am.

The best thing I've ever done
with my life is being a dad.

Oh, Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.

-Why haven't you sent for help?
-(THUDS)

I can't believe you guys
wanna have another kid.

Peter, did you find
Chris and Meg's baby books?

No, not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
It's our pet rock.

Ah, I remember the first day
we brought it home.

See that? Huh? Huh?

Bad rock! Bad!

We do that outside.

Look at him. He knows what he did.

I found my baby book!

Hey, here's the broken condom
that led to my birth.

And the resulting lawsuit
bought us this house.

You're my favorite mistake.

You see, Meg? I'm the favorite.

Ah, baby books.

Nostalgic for the days
of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

-Oh, somebody hasn't heard the news.
-News? What news?

What's the most wonderful thing
that could happen to this family?

Hmm.

Oh, the Phillies won.

-You're gonna have a baby brother, buddy.
-Or a sister.

Oh, a new baby. That's wonderful.

Call me when <i>Kojak</i> starts.

What?

Another baby? But I'm the baby.

Why the deuce would they
want to replace me?

My cheeks are pinchable,
my bottom is smooth,

my laugh is heart-warming.

(LAUGHS)

What's that? I certainly
am not overreacting.

What the devil do you think
happened to Bobby

when they added Cousin Oliver
to <i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

Oliver, did you break this vase?

-No, the floor did.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

-He's so cute.
-(DOOR OPENS)

-Hey, everybody! I...
-Bobby, you get back in the garage!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

It can't happen. I was here first.

Well, technically third,
but no time for semantics.

This is Stewie country,
and I intend to keep it that way.

As God is my witness,
from this day forward,

Peter and Lois shall not conceive.

(MENACING MUSIC PLAYING)

(GASPS)

What are you doing here?

Uh, Peter and Lois are, uh,
getting intimate.

My God, I thought I had more time.
I've got to stop them.

(WAILING)

Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!

I saw the bo...

Blast! What the devil is that name again?
Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!

-I saw the bogeyman.
-Aw. Did someone have a bad dream?

Why don't you sleep with Mommy and Daddy?

Peter, for God's sake.
Stewie's right here.

Come on, Lois. We can still do it.
He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.

Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

(SWITCH CLICKS)

(SNORING)

Ugh. Roll over. Roll over, I say!

(STEWIE GRUNTS)

STEWIE: Smells like cheese.

-Okay, insert rod support A into slot B.
-That's what...

If you say "That's what she said"
once more, I'm gonna pop you.

What you buildin' there, neighbor?

Well, we were keeping it a secret,
but you guys are my best friends,

so I'll tell ya. Lois and I
are having another baby!

(ALL WHOOPING)

We are so throwing you a shower.

Well, fat man, we'll see if Lois
wants to have sexual relations

when she finds lipstick on your collar.

There we are.

Well, look at you there.

You're a filthy girl, aren't you?

Yes, yes, you're looking for a bad time,
that's what you're after.

You're a dirty flirt.

You want it bad and you don't care
who you get it from,

because you have no self-respect,

and that gets you off,
doesn't it? (GROWLS)

Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.

And you got it all over
your father's favorite shirt.

Now, go to your room.

Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

Make any joke you want.
You know I look good.

Oh, my God! They're at it again.

(SIGHS) All this time spent

Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?

To the can,

-What?
-Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.

-Oh, like I could! He's so fat.
-I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.

That's it. Your dad's had enough.

I want you kids to go downstairs
and drink the antifreeze in the garage.

I'm gonna chug it all
so there's none left for you.

Hey, watch it!

-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-Peter!

What?

Hey, Peter.

I see nussing. Nussing.

I've had it with these interruptions.
All we want is a little time alone.

Now, you kids go to your rooms,

and don't come out
for the rest of the night.

I don't wanna go to my room.
There's an evil monkey in my closet.

(LAUGHING) Evil monkey! That's funny.

(SCREAMS)

This romantic dinner
was a wonderful idea, Peter.

Oh, you deserve it, my beautiful princess.

do you know about Lois?

You've seen that little gleam
in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?

That's me, plotting my escape.

You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
What else do you hate?

Oh, oh. People who use
the word "guestimate."

Guys who wear sandals with socks.

You know, perhaps I've been looking
at this the wrong way.

I daresay, I should embrace the idea

It's been a long time

And it's gonna be impossible
to spend time together like this

if we're raising another child.

Well, I thought, you know,

I'm having a birthday party next week.

I was hoping you could come.

Oh, no!

Someone peed in my pants!

You're funny.

Well, I hope you can make it.

Your friend's birthday party

(SCREAMING)

Oh, God!

I want to get Barbara a really nice gift.

What kind of gifts
have boys gotten for you, Meg?

Oh, well, my boyfriend, Prince William,

got me this beautiful watch
and this diamond tiara,

and this wonderful scepter.

(LAUGHS)

(SOBBING)

She needs to get laid, big time.

Listen, Chris, I read a book
saying that women are from Venus.

All right, so here's what you get her.

Thick layers of sulfuric acid,
viscous surface rock and coronae,

which seem to be collapsed domes
over large magma chambers.

Here's $5.

Well, that's okay, Dad.

I was thinking about getting a paper route

so I could pay for Barbara's gift myself.

Oh, well, I think
that's very sweet, honey.

Oh, boy, I remember my first job.

I was in a folk music trio.

Hey, how about "Here's To You,
Mrs. Fleckenstein?"

Yeah. You've been pitching that
for an hour,

but it's just not a very attractive name.

Oh, oh, fine, fine!

And I... I suppose we're also not going

with "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary
and Lowry's Seasoning Salt"?

(SCOFFS)
That's it. I'm going to 'Nam.

Well, hey, there, young fella.

Bringing me good news today?

What?

Come on over here, son.

Hand me the paper
so I don't need to use my grabber.

Mm. That's a nice,
muscley throwing arm you got there.

Uh, thanks.

Got a nice tip for you
right here in my pocket,

but my arthritis...

Why don't you reach in there
and fish it out for yourself?

Oh, that's okay, mister.

I don't collect till the end of the month.

I'll see you tomorrow.

(QUIETLY) Weird.

I hope you like it.

Wow! Perfume!

That is so sweet.

It'll make you smell
like Elizabeth Taylor.

I guess that means
you'll smell like bourbon and Vicodin.

That's very thoughtful.

Can I spray some on you?

Ow! My eyes!

They're beautiful.

Oh, just get away from me, Chris!

(SOBBING) I'm so awkward!

Hey, Muscley Arm.

Why the long face?

Oh, it's this girl.

I can't talk to her.

It's like girls are a different species
or something.

Aw, who needs them?

You like Popsicles?

Well, sure.

Then, you need to come on down
to the cellar.

I got a whole freezer full of Popsicles.

No, thanks, I got to get going.

Oh, don't make me beg now.

we'd like to get a positive ID
as quickly as possible.

Absolutely, Chris.

You're 100% safe.

Okay. That's him. Number six.

Hi, uh, excuse me, you guys.

Yeah, I'm here to pick up
my son, Chris Griffin.

Uh, he's here to finger the guy
who held up that convenience store.

Maybe you've seen him.

His name is Chris Griffin.

No, wait a second.
I think I got a picture of him somewhere.

Here... Here you go.

Yeah, you can go ahead
and hang on to that.

I got a ton of them at home.

In fact, I was going
to throw that one out, anyway,

'cause Chris messed it up
by writing his school schedule

and a list of his fears
all over the back of it.

Oh, we're so proud of you, Chris,

for helping to put
that horrible man in jail.

Geez, you couldn't have said
it was Celine Dion, huh?

Peter, what's the upstairs like?

There's a crunchberry
underneath the fridge.

Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement
and it has a hand in it.

I'm going to plant it
and see if a human grows.

Well, at least the TV
gets decent reception.

Huh. Must be some kind of nature show.

(SCREAMING) Help, help!

Get it off! Get it off!

MEG: Great.

We're here five minutes,
and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.

This place is horrible.

Okay, now, everybody calm down.

We don't know anything
about this community.

I bet if we explore the town,

we'll each find something
about it we like.

You know, that's a great idea, Lois.

I just got to hit the can.

I think there's just an outhouse, Peter.

Hey, uh, Lois, I don't get how this works.

It's just a hole.

I don't think it goes anywhere.

No, it definitely doesn't go anywhere.

Ugh! Oh, God!

Oh, it's everywhere!

Ah, it's in my raccoon wounds!

Oh, God!

Excuse me, do you have an ATM?

Over there, ma'am.

How much you want to take out?

$40.

There's a service charge of a buck fifty.

You'll accept?

Yes.

Mm... You smell like the inside
of my mama's purse.

(LAUGHS WEAKLY)
Thank you.

What are those dulcet tones?

Why, this is the music of the angels.

What is that magical device?

Banjo.

Pluck that string.

(NOTE PLAYS)

Oh, I feel so deliciously white trash!

Mommy, I want a mullet!

All right, that about does it.

Isn't she beautiful, Brian?

The Duke boys would be proud, Peter.

Yeah, and you got to get in
through the window like this.

Okay, now you.

Oh, sorry. I forgot to roll yours down.

You all right?

Hello?

Wake up, sleepy head.

Hi.

Hi.

Are you mad at that pond?

Shoot, no.

'Course this pond did kill my grandpappy.

He saw his reflection in the water,

thought it was him and drowned,
trying to save himself.

That's why my mom doesn't let me look
in the toilet.

-I'm Sam.
-I'm Chris.

Sam, come on in now.

Well, I got to go help my daddy
bring in the mud harvest.

Nice making your acquaintance, Chris.

Oh, my God, I'm drowning!

All right, there's one. Let's jump that.

Yeehaw!

Oh, that was great.

Hey, next time, let's get Meg to be

-Enos. Anus.

All right, class,

Everyone, please welcome Megan Griffin
from the North.

Y'all got them talking pictures?

We sure do.

All right, class.

That's enough questions for Megan.

Time to hand back
last week's spelling tests.

And it looks like Oinky
set the curve again.

Oh, dang it.

That is some smart pig.

Good thing I copied off of Oinky.

Ta-da!

Possum surprise!

Actually, I made it with Shake-'n'-Bake.

And I helped.

Kids, where's your father?

PETER AND BRIAN: Yeehaw!

Oh, Peter, what the hell are you doing?

I'm blending in.

Relax, Lois. It's not our house.

Well, I'm glad you're having fun,
but we need some money coming in.

Have you thought about looking for a job?

Yes, Lois, I have.

But I've also thought
about getting fired from that job.

Is that something you want
to put our family through?

Think about that
while I get myself a drink.

Ah, ah! Oh, God!

(SCREAMING)

It's right up here past this clearing.

He's been here about three months now.

Wow!

Where do you think you go when you die?

I learnt at church that if you're good,
you go to heaven.

But if you're bad, you go to a place

where the dead believe
they're still living

and they pray for death,
but death won't come.

UPN?

(LAUGHING)

You're funny.
I like you, Chris.

I like you, too, Sam.

Want to poke him?

Do I?

You know, it's true.

The best things in life really are free.

I don't know, Brian. Maybe Lois is right.

Maybe it is time for me to get a job.

Yeah, too bad you always blow it
in the interview.

So, Peter, where do you see yourself
in five years?

<i>Don't say doing your wife.</i>
<i>Don't say doing your wife.</i>

Doing your...

Son?

Hey, Brian, look at that.

Y'all interested? We just
take turns being the Sherriff.

It's real easy.

You just hang out here,
eat some pie and get drunk.

Wait, hold on a second.

"Pie"? "Drunk"? "The"?

You got yourself a Sheriff.

Boy, it's so quiet around here.

I know.

The phone hasn't rang all day.

I... I know.

There's nothing, nothing to, um...

To, uh...

Um...

Uh... Oh, boy,
what's the word I'm looking for?

Do.

Uh, Brian, you... You're drunk.

You're drunk. Give me your keys.

What is this, Dad?

A Southern tradition, son.

It's a reenactment of the Civil War.

Robert E. Lee.

I knew I'd find you here,

where they seat the sorry-ass losers.

(LAUGHS DRUNKENLY)

Ulysses S. Grant, you invite me to lunch,

then show up an hour late, drunk?

I was busy looking for your wife
to give her the old...

(BABBLES INCOHERENTLY)

Sir, this means war.

I am vanquished.

I hereby declare victory
in the name of the Confederacy.

(CHEERING)

Uh, excuse me.

Uh, I don't think that's how it happened.

I'm pretty sure the North won.

What are you saying, fella?

I'm saying that drunken idiot
kicked your sorry asses

south of the Donna Dixon line.

We don't take too kindly
to that sort of talk, Mister.

And I sure as shoot don't want your kid
hanging around with my kid.

And if you think I'm mad now,

you got to answer
to them Civil War survivors.

(GRUMBLING)

Uh, uh, uh, wait!

Look over there! It's a newly married
interracial gay couple

burning the American flag.

Get him!

I guess we can't hang out anymore.

Guess not.

That sucks, 'cause I really like
spending time with you.

Me, too.

Anyone seen my foot?

Man, was last night weird.

I kissed a boy.

But the truth is I really like him
as a friend.

His name is Sam.

You kissed Sam last night?

How did you know?

Well, you're saying it out loud.

I could hear you in the other room.

The weird thing is kissing Sam
kind of felt right.

But I don't know if I can face him again.

Brian, what should I do?

I haven't been this confused

Oh, he's not here.

Well, where is he?

I can't release that information.

Oh, uh, did I say Chris?

I meant Chris's sister.

Oh. Oh, well, if it's for Meg,
that's a whole other story.

Here's her address.

What are you doing?

You were busy,
so I played your guy.

Fine, I didn't want to play, anyway.

Well, then, it worked out for everybody.

I'm going to draw boobs
on the Etch-A-Sketch.

Go ahead, they always come out square.

Oh, hi, Chris.

Hey.

Um, listen, Sam,

I like hanging out with you and all.

It's just that I don't want
a romantic relationship.

But I'd like it
if we could still be friends.

I'd like that, too.

Want to go for a swim?

Sure.

(GASPS)

You're a girl!

Of course, I am.

Oh, my God!

Hang on one sec, honey, I'm on the phone.

Who's that?
My wife.

Peter, Chris is in danger.

Do something.

Round up a posse.

Yeah, well, see,
I kind of pissed off the whole town

at that Civil War reenactment.

Oh, what are we going to do?

I don't know, Lois,

Sam, can I talk to you?

Sure, but why aren't you looking at me?

Well, that's the thing, um.

I'm no good at talking to girls.

That's why I ran away from you.

Well, you didn't have trouble
talking to me

when you thought I was a boy.

Yeah, that's true.

Just pretend I'm a boy.

Okay.

You want to go down

Yes, sir!

And in the city,

glasses are considered really sexy.

Dang, I hope her brother

Meg, where's Chris?

That criminal's here, and he's after him.

He's down by the Old Town Bridge.

You know, my brother is the one
he's here to kill.

Well, we take care of our own.

And as long as y'all live here,
y'all are Southerners, too.

Wow, thanks.

It's our pleasure.

Sam, I'll see you at home.

You know, I think the lesson here

is it really doesn't matter
where you're from,

as long as we're all the same religion.

It was great having you in class, Meg.

Thanks.

I'm really going to miss everybody.

We didn't have no money for a present,

so we all just spit in a jar.

I can't believe you're leaving.

Me either.

I'll be sure to write.

And I'll be sure to learn to read.

The next time I see a dead guy,

I'm going to poke him

Hey, that's a great idea.

I'll learn how to act like a rich guy.

Sorry, honey.
I'd rather be stuck in an elevator

with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Godfried,
Carrot Top,

uh, Sean Hayes.
Oh, you get the picture.

-Please?
-No!

Peter like to play poker with us?

He'd love to, Daddy.

That sounds dynamite.

Brian, come over here and meet Sea Breeze,
my prize-winning dog.

Isn't she a perfect specimen?

I mean, look at these legs,

and that beautiful coat,

and feel the heat
coming off of her genitalia.

You could roast a marshmallow.

That's how you can tell she's a champion.

Go on, put your hand there.

-Oh, boy, that is... That is...
-Is that something?

That is something.
That is... That is hot.

Isn't she the most beautiful dog
you've ever seen?

Yes, yes.
She is a beautiful dog.

(SIGHING) And that's okay.

Gentlemen, this is Peter.

He's the idiot my daughter married.

Michael Eisner.
Bill Gates.

Bill, Peter's an antitrust lawyer
with the Justice Department.

Ah, just kidding, he's a fisherman
or some stupid thing.

Hey, fellas.

Wow, Ted Turner!

I told you guys not to invite him.

Oh, he must have followed us.

Come on, ladies.

We going to play cards or what?

Peter, why don't you deal?

Okay, guys, we're playing Texas Hold 'Em.

Are aces high or low?

They go both ways.

(GIGGLING) He said, "They go both ways."

(LAUGHING)

Like a bisexual.

Thank you, Ted, that was the joke.

I see your bet, Carter,

and I raise you CNN.

Oh, I don't think I can...

Wait, wait. You can beat him,
Mr. Pewterschmidt, he's bluffing.

Peter, he just bet CNN.

There's no way he's bluffing.

I'm sure he is. He's got a tell.

Listen, if you lose this hand,
I'll divorce your daughter.

I'm in.

All right, Teddy,
I'll see your CNN with U.S. Steel.

-What have you got?
-Two pair.

Ace high, straight.

You sold me out!
I could use a man like you.

How's a million a year sound?

You disgust me. Get out of my face!

Peter, that's the first time
any of us have ever beaten Ted.

Yeah, how did you know he was bluffing?

When he lies, he blinks twice.

I first noticed it when he did
that Barbara Walters' interview,

and he said he'd be
with Jane Fonda forever.

Well, I'm going to turn in.

Yeah, me, too.
I got to be at Disneyland before it opens.

We're ethnically cleansing
the Small World ride.

Oh, come on, you guys
practically run this country.

There's got to be a ton
of fun stuff we could do.

(WHOOPING)

Oh, man, there's a tollbooth.

Hey, anybody got a quarter?

What's a quarter?

Well, we got to give him something.

(WHOOPING)

Man, looking up at the sky
just makes you feel so small.

Yeah.

I mean, if God created all this,
who created God?

Maybe He created Himself.

Or Herself.

-Oh!
-Think about that.

Neat. This guy's deep, Carter.
Where'd you find him?

He's my son-in-law.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Okay, honey. I got to go.

-You want a ride?
-Sure.

Wow.

You know, Peter,

I actually had a good time
with you tonight,

and I just want to say...

Well, I'm glad you married my daughter.

Oh, thank you, Jesus!

Oh, actually, it wasn't me. It was...

It's okay. I am used to it.

Having fun, Peter?

Oh, you bet.

I put all my poker winnings
on your dog, Mr. P.

Dog?

You've got nothing to worry about.

Sea Breeze is a sure thing.

Sea Breeze?

Dad, where are the jockeys?

They're all in the laundry, son.

I'm going Indian today.

ALL: Come on, Sea Breeze!

Yeah!

Come on, Sea Breeze, come on!

(GROANING)

What's Brian doing?

Oh, my God.

He's violating Sea Breeze!

Oh, no, he's just
awkwardly positioning himself...

Now he's violating Sea Breeze.

(IMITATING PORN JAZZ RIFF)

Mr. Pewterschmidt, again,

I just want to tell you
how sorry I am about this.

I don't know what came over me.

You'd better not have ruined my race dog.

Brian, I am very disappointed in you.

I'd turn my back on you,

but I've seen what you do
in that situation.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

Carter and I have a polio match to attend.

Get away from me.

You and that filthy mongrel of yours!

How is she, Doctor?

She's fine.

Sea Breeze will be able to race again.

But, unfortunately,
not for another nine weeks.

-She's pregnant.
-(ALL GASP)

Look, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
I just want you to know

I am going to do the right thing here.

You're not doing anything.

In fact, you're never going to see
Sea Breeze again.

All of you, pack your things and get out!

I am never speaking to you again.

Don't worry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

I have a plan.

I am going to go back in time,

and stop Brian
from getting it on with your dog.

Everybody, stand back.

(MAKING WHIRRING NOISE)

(GROANING)

Uh, oh. Oh, boy. Oh, God.

(SCREAMS)

Mr. Pewterschmidt,
please can we still be pals?

See, look, I made a picture of you and me
out of glue and macaroni.

Wow, Peter, that means a lot to me,
because you made it.

-Really?
-No. Get out of here!

Mr. Pewterschmidt, Sea Breeze is gone.

-What?
-I can't find Brian.

Peter, do you know
what I'm going to do to you

if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?

I think I have an idea.

(BLUBBERING)

This is the room.

The light switch is here,
it's mostly for show.

There's your Murphy bed.

Don't mind the Epsteins.

They keep to themselves.

We're going to see Bobby Darin
at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?

Bobby Darin tomorrow.

And this is the bathroom.

But watch out.

We got some bad roaches here.

Hey, you're on our turf, man.

Hey, man, I'll cut you.
I'll cut you up so bad,

you gon' wish I no cut you up so bad.

Those are bad roaches.

I blame the schools.

Were you followed?

Don't worry. I've got a decoy.

Hey, Lois.

Hubba-hubba! Whoa, Lois,
you put on a few, huh?

Well, I never!

That's all right, honey.
I don't think he was the one anyway.

Now, let's go get sundaes.

You know, we all really miss you,

and Peter talks about you all the time.

Oh, really? Anything nice?

No.

Mm, so he's still mad, huh?

Well, I should go.
Here, take this.

It's probably not a good idea
for us to meet anymore.

Daddy swore he'd track you down
any way he could.

Bingo!

I told you she'd lead us to him.

Let's call Pewterschmidt.

No, wait. Let's take the jet packs.

Cool!

Man, the people look like ants
from up here.

They are ants, Michael.

They are ants.

This is Tricia Takanawa reporting live

where police have discovered
the whereabouts of Sea Breeze,

the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.

The dognapper has been traced
to this sleazy motel.

Ah, I see my colleague, Tom Tucker,
is already on the scene.

Who's that, baby?

Hello, this is Tom Tucker's
evil twin, Todd Tucker,

out to destroy his brother's reputation.

(LAUGHS EVILLY)

Now I'm going back inside
to have freaky sex with my prostitute,

with whom I still have 45 minutes.

Now, back to this breaking news.

Brian, please, eat something.

Why bother?

My face is plastered all over the news,

your father won't let me see the dog
who's carrying my puppies,

and my best friend is going
to incredible lengths to ignore me.

Brian, don't let him get to you.

Peter, come out of that thing!

He can't hear you, Lois.

Besides, it's not him
that's getting to me.

It's your father.

I'm sorry. I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.

He can be so stubborn.

I don't know
how my mother puts up with it.

He did promise to take good care
of the puppies, though.

Well, you know,
they're not his to take care of.

They're my kids,
and I'm going to get them back.

My father wasn't there for me,

but, damn it, I'm going
to be there for my kids.

I'm going to sue your dad for custody.

Daddy, please, stop this.

Brian has every right to see his puppies
when they're born.

Sorry, Pumpkin.

I had no idea you could be so cruel.

I'll never forgive you for this.

Oh, you'll be fine.

You're just having your period.

This court will now come to order.

Brian...
Do you like children?

I... I love children.
That's why I'm here.

I want the opportunity
to raise my puppies.

Do you remember an incident
at a South Attleboro Denny's

in December of 1996?

Uh, yeah, I guess.

(BAWLING)

Waa! Waa! You like that, huh?

You like that? Waa!

You just tune this out, don't you? Waa!

Well, tune this out! Waa!

-(CRIES)
-Waa!

-(CRIES)
-Waa!

-(CRIES)
-Shut up!

Look, I was angry,

because my Moon Over My Hammy
was overcooked.

I also have your rental records
from the Quahog video store.

Can you read
the last two titles, please?

Uh, <i>Son-In-Law </i>and <i>Biodome.</i>

And who's the star of those films?

Uh, Paulie Shore.

Paulie Shore.

(ALL GASPING)

But, I... I... I rented those for Peter.

He got banned from the video store
for taping over their movies.

Rosebud.

<i>It's his sled.</i>

<i>It was his sled</i>
<i>from when he was a kid.</i>

<i>There, I just saved you</i>
<i>two long, boob-less hours.</i>

How convenient,
blame it on someone else.

Is that the kind of man
we want raising these puppies?

Peter...

Oh, you've got to believe me,
Your Honor.

Peter, I'm putting together
another card game. You in?

You want me to play?

Absolutely.

But first, I want you to testify
against that horny mutt of yours.

I... I don't know if I can do that.

Ooh, that's too bad,

because Bill and Michael
really want to see you again.

They're coming over later,

and Bill's going to bring
his Stretch Armstrong.

Oh, man, and his arms
stretch out to next week!

Your Honor, Peter Griffin
would like to take the stand.

Mr. Griffin, which of the following
two phrases best describes Brian Griffin?

"Problem drinker,"

or "African-American haberdasher?"

Um... I... I guess "problem drinker,"
but that's...

Thank you.

Now, "sexual deviant,"

or "magic picture that if you stare at it
long enough you see something?"

Well, "sexual deviant,"
but that other one's...

Thank you.

Now, isn't it true that you told
my client, Carter Pewterschmidt,

that Brian is a menace to society

and should never be allowed
to see his children?

(ALL GASPING)

Uh... Uh...

Brian should be allowed
to see his puppies.

Peter, think about what you're doing.

I am.

Your Honor, Brian will be a great dad.

Hell, if I was half the parent Brian is

I'd know that Chris'
favorite ice cream is...

Chocolate chip.

-And Stewie's favorite bedtime story is...
<i>-Goodnight, Moon.</i>

And Meg's real father's name is...

Stan Thompson.

I've heard enough.

I do believe that Brian
would be a successful parent.

However, if he was to repeat
his actions at the dog track,

he would be setting
a bad example for his puppies.

Therefore, I grant Brian custody

with the condition
that he be neutered first.

Yeah! You did it, buddy!

Oh, congratulations!

Oh, man!

What does "neutered" mean?

You're almost there, Sea Breeze.

Oh, and, uh, also,
I didn't bring this up before,

but, promise me
you won't eat any of them.

You know, Brian, it occurs to me
that this is like a Greek tragedy,

where a man must choose
between himself and his children.

Of course, you'll be playing
the role of Sanstesticles.

(SNICKERING)

We're ready for you down the hall.

Are you sure you want to go
through with this, Brian?

'Cause, you know, you could have puppies
with another dog.

Oh, or maybe with a condor.

Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.

Would you like that, Brian?

Huh? Flying puppies?

No, Peter.
Those puppies in there are mine,

and I'll give anything
to be with them. Anything.

I am not looking forward
to what you're going to be like

once they do this to you.

Mm, I love chocolate!

But I can't eat it,
because then I'll get fat.

But it's so good!

Are you ready, Brian?

I guess so.

Stop! Brian, come quick.

Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies.

Well, then, whose are they?

(PUPPIES BARKING)

You... You're a whore!

A filthy, filthy whore!

You must be so relieved.

Well, actually, I...

I was kind of looking forward
to being a dad.

Well, don't worry.
There will be other chances.

You know what's funny?
I always thought that dogs, um, laid eggs.

And I learned something today.

Yeah, I was looking to break off
a little somethin' somethin',

but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank,

and she's all about the bling-bling.

Peter, what's wrong?

and don't stop reading till I tell you.

-The power of Christ compels you.

Peter, stop. He's not possessed.

Yeah, he's just talking street.

Oh. Well, that's kind of weird.

Pete, that's just a phase.

You've gone through
a few yourself, you know?

Yeah, like those two weeks you spent
narrating your own life.

I walked into the kitchen
and sat down at the table.

I looked with a grimace
at the questionable meal

Lois had placed in front of me.

Of course, I'd never tell her
how disgusted I was with her cooking,

but somehow, I think she knew.

Lois had always been full
of energy and life,

but lately, I had begun to grow
more aware of her aging.

The bright, exuberant eyes
that I had fallen in love with

were now beginning
to grow dull and listless

with the long fatigue of a weary life...

So, I started beating him with a hose,

then my arm got tired and so I came here.

Peter, perhaps Chris has adopted
another culture's mannerisms,

enough about his own.

-Yeah, that's right.

Y'all know that Exxon Valdez thing?

That ain't how it happened.

-Some brother just fell in the ocean.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, God, I remember that.
And all those seals died.

(LAUGHTER STOPS ABRUPTLY)

It was... It was all over the news.

The Channel 2 News with Dan Rather.

Although I think Connie Chung might have
been substituting for him that night.

Well, about time for me
to be hitting the old dusty trail.

I like your hat.

Can't get out that way.

(ALARM BLARING)

PETER: Oh, found the emergency exit.

And 1967 was the same year

that Thurgood Marshall was named
to the Supreme Court of the United States.

(WHOOPING)

Well, I should probably
be saddling up now.

-(ALARM BLARING)
-PETER: Oh, found the fire door.

Ugh, look at how fat you are.

You disgust me.

Oink-oink, fatty.

Oh, yes, you'll take butter
on that English muffin, won't you?

Because you're the cheerleading squad's
token blimp.

You don't deserve to eat.

(VOMITS)

Hey, thanks
for bringing me here, Cleveland.

Welcome. For our first order of business,

I believe Brother Cleveland
has an announcement.

(CLEARS THROAT) Yesterday,
I received reparations

from the family
that enslaved my ancestors.

-MAN 1: Amen!
-(ALL APPLAUDING)

Now, the family has become
poor white trash since then,

so they only gave what they could,

this tray of scrumptious
Rice Krispie treats.

I share them with all of you in the hopes

that one day, your wounds
may be healed as well.

-MAN 1: Amen!
-Right on, man, right on.

Hey, why is he taking one?

Oh, this is my friend, Peter Griffin.

He recently discovered he was black.

-(ALL MURMURING)
-He doesn't look very black to me.

Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please.

Please, judge me not
by the color of my skin,

for I have always been there with you.

(MURMURING DISSENT)

I was there when George and Weezie
moved on up to the East Side.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-PETER: Oh, oh!

Hallelujah, those were happy times.

But... But I was also there
for the bad times.

(APPROVING MURMURS)

When Florida lost James
to that tragic auto accident.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES)

And I was there when Tootie
got those terribly painful braces.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-PETER: Oh, yes.

And when Arnold Jackson
got beat up by the Gooch,

-I was there.
-MAN 2: You hit home!

So before you decide
that I don't belong here,

remember this... I was there!

(ALL CHEERING)

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

Way to go, Peter. You tell it like it is.

Now, Chris, this one's for you.

-What's the secret to happiness?
-Money.

Very good. Babs, give him a caramel.

(EXCLAIMS)

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey, Lois, what are your parents
doing here?

Oh, they surprised us with a visit

after I told them
about your recent discovery.

Yes, Peter, we hear you're a Negro now.

Yep, I even got my own posse.

Hey, uh, Big Dog, T-Bone, Shades,

you guys go make yourself some sandwiches.
We'll hook up later.

My jacket's in the kitchen.
Please don't write on it.

Well, I think Chris and Meg should know

the Pewterschmidt side
of their ancestry, too.

Kids, did you know the Pewterschmidts
were among the first to colonize America?

Now, kids, don't be taken in by the Man.

Stay black and proud.

Here's your ancestor, Silas Pewterschmidt,

bartering with some local Indians.

-Cool.
-And here's a picture of...

Oh, uh, never mind that one.

-Wait, wait, wait, what was that?
-Oh, that was nothing.

Just some fellow we fed and took care of
in exchange for doing a few chores.

You mean a slave. Let me see that.

Oh, my God.

It's Nate Griffin.

Well, 'bout time for me
to be hitting the old dusty trail.

Lois, your family owned my family.

Daddy, is that true?

Well, it appears so.
Boy, this is pretty embarrassing.

Yes, it is. And don't call me "boy"!

Peter, please, calm down.

Babs, I think it's time we went to bed.

Things will look better in the morning.

Come here, kids. Give Grandma
and Grandpa a kiss goodnight.

-Whoa!
-(SCREAMS)

You can whip me all you like, white devil,

but you'll never break my spirit.

Damn. There must be some clue
to the source

of their mental manipulation techniques.

<i>"Your Body and You."</i>

"Every four weeks for three to four days,

it's entirely normal
for every young woman to..."

Oh, my God! Oh!

That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard in my life!

-Oh!
-(DOOR OPENS)

(GIRLS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

That totally sucked.

You guys call yourselves cheerleaders?

Well, I call you cheerlosers!

This Cindi is definitely
the alpha of the group.

And what happened with the pyramid?

I almost broke my neck.

(GASPS) The pyramid! Of course.

That must be the key to their power.

Mission objective,

eliminate Cindi and take her place
at the top of the pyramid.

(GASPS) They're getting nude.

I mustn't watch.
It's not the proper thing to...

Whoa! I say, nice ones, Janine.

And look at Lisa
in all of her curvaceous glory.

Oh, Heavens, it appears that my wee-wee
has been stricken with rigor mortis.

-Good morning.
-Peter, what on earth are you wearing?

It's a dashiki.

And don't call me Peter.
That's my slave name.

From now on, call me Kichwa-Tembo.

Cool. And I'll be Mambutu O'Malley.

-Peter...
-Kichwa.

I'd like to have a word with you.

-Peter, I think...
-Kichwa!

(SIGHS) Kichwa, we're both sensible men.

There must be something I can do
to make things right with you.

Actually, there is.

I want reparations
just like Cleveland got.

What the hell are you talking about?

I want an apology
and some Rice Krispie treats.

Well, I absolutely will not give you
an apology.

And I'm assuming "Rice Krispie treats"

is black slang for money,
so here's $10,000.

And I expect you never to mention
this ugly business again.

$10,000?

Not enough? Fine, make it 20.
How do you spell "Kichwa"?

You know what? Screw the Kichwa.
Make it out to Peter. P-E-T-E...

This just in, slave owner descendant,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

has paid $20,000 or two million pennies

in reparations to a local black man.

We now go live to the local black man.

Well, the money helps,
but I'll always feel my ancestors' pain.

(LAUGHS) Hey, from down there,

does it look like I'm talking
into a bunch of robot penises?

Hey, Lois, come in here

and see what I did
with the money your dad gave me.

(GASPS) Oh, my God.

You turned the den
into Pee Wee's Playhouse?

(SINGING)
<i>Come on, get up</i>

<i>Knock off your napping</i>

<i>It's a crazy messed-up place</i>
<i>where anything can happen</i>

<i>There's a chair</i>
<i>that freakin' talks, hey look!</i>

<i>There's some fish</i>
<i>that give advice, holy crap!</i>

<i>It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse</i>

-Peter...
-Wait, wait, wait. Watch this.

Hey, Jambi!

Okay, say it.

Mekka-lekka-hi, mekka-hiney...
God, I hate you so much.

Peter, that reparation money
should be going to a worthy black charity.

Lois, the King of Cartoons
will be here in five minutes,

and I will not have you embarrass me.

You're acting ridiculous.

-(CHEERING)
-(MACHINES CLANGING)

You said the secret word!

(SIREN BLARES)

Uh-oh.

Hey, you're that black guy
I saw on the news conference, ain't ya?

Uh, yeah, that's me.

This is car 15, I'm going to need backup.

I've got a stolen vehicle here.

-But this is my car...
-Suspect's getting belligerent.

-What?
-Officer down.

-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-(SIRENS BLARING)

So it's agreed.

We'll keep on pretending
to like pigs' feet,

simply to confound the white man.

Oh, sorry I'm late, you guys.

The white man was making me his bitch.

What? Oh, sorry. His beeyatch.

Peter, we know
about your selfish squandering

of your reparation money.

I shared mine.

You, however, have given nothing
back to the community.

Uh, that's not true.

I've brought you the greatest gift of all,

a child's laughter.

(HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLE)

Peter, I think you should go.

Yeah, I'm gone.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Hi, guys.

Uh, hey, how's it going?

Geez, Lois, no one wants to sit with me.
It's like I'm a freakin' leper.

-Hey, can we sit there?
-No, these are saved.

Where is Cindi?

I don't know, but she better show up soon.
It's almost half-time.

You know, Cindi, I'd feel worse about this

if you didn't spell your name
with that insufferable "I" at the end.

Oh, and that cockadoody smiley face
you use to dot it.

You sicken me!

I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

-(SCREAMS)
-Hello, Peter.

(GASPS) Nate Griffin.

Oh, my God, you're haunting me,
because I've been a terrible black man.

Peter, you got to stop
putting so much importance on race.

I know I didn't.

-You didn't?
-No.

If I had, do you think I would've slept

with your white
great-great-great-great granny?

-I guess not.
-That's right.

And I wouldn't have slept
with her fine sister neither.

You see, Peter, the most important thing
is how a man acts.

You know what I'm getting at?

You think I should do something good
with that reparation money, don't you?

That'd be mighty fine, Peter.

Eh, I guess you're right.

Listen, for what it's worth,

I'm real sorry my wife's ancestors
made you suffer so much.

Oh, don't worry about me.

If it makes you feel any better,
I peed in their cereal every morning.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

Well, so long, Peter.

Wait, wait, wait. Before you go...

-What's heaven like?
-Oh, it's fine.

There's a shortage of chairs.

Oh.

Yeah.

Take it easy, Peter.

(BUZZER SOUNDS)

Okay, look, we're just going
to have to go on without her.

-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
-(ALL CHEERING)

-Give me a "D"!
-ALL: "D"!

All right, that's enough of that.
There's a large hunting knife

under each one of your seats.

On my command, I want you to... (SCREAMS)

Ah! You idiots, I had them!

Oh, Cindi was right.
We need a lot more work.

Uh, excuse me.

Yeah, uh, hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

Listen, uh, as many of you may know,

I recently came into some money.

Well, I don't really deserve it.

So I've decided to share it
with my brothers.

(ALL CHEERING)

Uh, actually, I just meant
the black guys. Uh.

Peter, that was very generous.

And look how happy you've made everyone.

Yeah, it just goes to show you, Lois.

It doesn't matter
if you're black or white,

the only color
that really matters is green.

Oh, Peter.

I wonder what happened to Cindi.

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

Dear diary...

Jackpot.

And that concludes the list of people
who were mean to me in junior high.

Tomorrow, high school.

Finally, we go to Asian reporter,
Tricia Takanawa, for 60 seconds of filler.

Thanks, Tom. I'm here on Spooner Street,

where several Quahog families
are holding a car wash

to raise money for an organ transplant
for young Paul Lewis.

So, what do you call this device, Paul?

It's an iron lung. It keeps me from dying.

I want to play baseball!

And with me is one of Paul's classmates,
Chris Griffin,

who helped organize this charity event.

You're a very thoughtful young man, Chris.

-Can I say hello to my mom?
-Sure.

Hi, Mom!

Hi, sweetheart.

Okay, so you want
the full wash, and, uh...

Oh, you got a nick there.
I can probably get that out for you.

Now, if you want to go with a scent,

I've got "PB and J," "Sugar Cereal,"
and "New Toy."

What the deuce?

Hey, somebody dropped their money clip.

Wow, $26.

I've never seen so much money at one time!

What do you think we should do with it?

I say we buy $26 worth
of ice cream and just pig out.

Oh, we can dish,
talk about who's getting fat...

Oh, we'll just be great big bitches.

Hold on, kids, that's not your money yet.

The law says you got to put up signs,

and wait two weeks
for someone to claim it.

If no one does, it's yours.

Ah, lunch is here.

(CLANGING)

Everyone, we've reached our goal.

It looks like somebody's
going to live to see puberty.

-Oh, my God, that man just took our money!
-What man?

He was a wearing a Jimmy Carter mask,

like that robber
in the Keanu Reeves movie.

<i>-The Matrix.</i>
-No, no, no. It wasn't that recent.

The one where they're jumping
out of the plane.

<i>Executive Decision?</i>

No, that was with Kurt Russell.

But the other guy in this movie,
he kind of looks like Kurt Russell.

He's getting away!

Don't worry. He won't get far.

(SIRENS BLARE)

Stop! Police!

(PANTING)

(GASPING)

Joe, what happened?

I got the money.

(ALL CHEERING)

But I lost the perp.

Well, the money's the important thing.

Now little Paul can get his...

<i>Point Break!</i> That was the movie!

Here's to Joe, who helped little Paul
get a new liver,

and barring a massive infection,
a new lease on life.

Don't you understand?

I lost the perp.

I lost the perp!

(SOBBING)

(SOBBING CONTINUES)

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

(SCREAMING)

MEG: So, um, the $26
would probably be safe in my room.

(SCOFFING) Right. It'd probably get lost

among the pinups of Justin Timberlake
and Tom Cruise and...

And... Oh, blast! Who the devil
do the teenagers like?

Uh... Morgan Freeman!

Well, we can't keep it in my room,

'cause there's an evil monkey
that lives in my closet.

You know, the sad part is,
he wasn't always evil.

Honey, good news!

I made partner!

(SCREECHING)

(ALL SCREECHING)

Peter, Bonnie says
Joe's been really depressed

about that robbery.

Why don't you go talk to him?

Well, I don't know. There's a game on.

Shame on you.

You march right over there
and cheer your old friend up.

Don't listen to that sissy.

Grab a beer and watch the game.

Yeah, that sounds good.

(GUNSHOT)

-Oh, my God!
-Now, get your fat ass over to Joe's.

-Look, buddy, I...
-Move!

All right, all right,
just take it easy, man.

Everything's cool.

-Hey, buddy.
-Close the door.

I don't want to see the light.

Oh, come on, Joe, cheer up, huh?

Hey, hey, what do you say
you and me go rollerska...

Bike rid...

Jump ro...

Go lay on the grass?

Peter, the other day was the first time
I've ever lost a perp.

It was also the first time
I've ever really felt handicapped.

I've made up my mind about this.

I'm quitting the force.

Oh, come on, Joe,
you don't have to quit the force.

You could get a desk job. Eh?

You could be a desk.

Forget it. I'm washed up.

Oh, thank God!

Oh, God, I was standing out there,

Hey, Mort, Joe here is going to be

Uh, you got anything
that might give him a little extra juice?

You mean steroids?

But, Peter, haven't you seen what happens
to those ladies on ESPN2?

They get big hair faces
and their breasts become like flapjacks!

I... I was thinking more
like a protein shake.

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

this is not my first memory.

Look, everybody, cool it.

I'm not gonna put up

I'll hold on to the money.

I'm a neutral party, so it'll be safe.

You'll cheer, you'll cry,

you might even get a cheap laugh or two.

I know I will, Tom.

In fact, there's the distinct possibility

that by the end of the day,
we'll all be going to hell.

-Oh, great. Thank God.

Now... Now listen here, Joe.

You can do this. I know you can.

Yeah. Yeah!

Hey, you think you're so hot, fellow?

Well, at least I can do this.

his starting position.

(CHEERS)

(ALL CHEERING)

Way to go, Joe!

Yeah! How do you like that, buddy?

-The sphincter says what?
-What?

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

You stupid bastard.

Oh, good to see
your new fiscal responsibilities

haven't interfered with your reading.

Ah, Dostoyevsky. The mad Russian.

Good stuff. Good stuff.

You're not going to get the $26,
and you're despicable for trying.

What? Oh... Oh, you thought...

I wasn't trying to get the $26.

I thought we were just having

a perfectly innocent conversation
about literature.

Oh, you're silly. You're silly.

I love that you go there. You're silly.

Goodbye.

We'll take you to bulimic pie-eating
in just a moment.

But first, decathlon front-runner,
Joe Swanson, will attempt the long jump.

Come on, Joe, break a wheel.

I'm ready. Let's get it on.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(CROWD GASPING)

Ooh, a short jump.

That's going to knock him out of the lead.

-Tough break.
-Tough break it is, Tom.

Good contribution, Diane.

If Swanson expects to take the gold,

he's going to have to come in first
in the final event, the 100-meter dash.

That's okay, Joe.
You can still win this thing.

That was pathetic.

Tell your wife to come over to my place

if she wants a little
boom-shaka-laka-laka-laka,

boom-shaka-laka-laka-laka,

boom-shaka-laka-laka-laka-boom.

Peter, it's over.

Over? What are you talking about?

Well, if I couldn't catch
a two-bit criminal,

how am I supposed to win a race?

Hey, hey, hey, what kind of talk is that?
It's un-American.

("AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL" PLAYING)

Did George W. Bush quit
even after losing the popular vote?

No.

Did he quit after losing
millions of dollars

of his father's friends' money
in failed oil companies?

No.

Did he quit after knocking that girl up?

No.

Did he quit after he got that DUI?

No.

Did he quit after getting arrested

for drunk and disorderly conduct
at a football game?

No. Did he quit...

I get the message, Peter.

-Yeah.
-It's yours.

-Do you like my pants?
-Uh, sure.

They're yours. You know what a merkin is?

-No.
-Pubic wig, I've got one. You want it?

-No.
-Of course, you don't.

You're a classy guy. You want to be rich?

-Yes.
-Sign here.

-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-What the hell?

I just... I don't understand
how he could do that without me.

We were going to do everything together.

It was one cereal ad, Peter.

Besides, he's the one who won the medal.

Yeah, I guess.

What the hell is this?

<i>Starring Tony Danza as Joe Swanson.</i>

<i>Once a man at his physical peak,</i>

<i>brought down by a cruel twist of fate.</i>

Why?

<i>With Valerie Bertinelli as Bonnie.</i>

Joe, you've got to accept
your limitations.

Why don't you just ask me
to lay down and die?

I can't live like this anymore.

That's it!

That's not how it happened.
It was my idea.

<i>With Bea Arthur as Peter Griffin.</i>

You'll never make it, Joe.

Why don't you just give up right now?

No, I've got to try.

Even if it's by myself.

You're a fool, Joe, a fool.

(ANNOUNCER READING)

<i>Friday on ABC,</i>
<i>followed by</i> Dharma and Greg.

(WHISPERING)
<i>But you don't have to watch that.</i>

I don't believe this.

Joe wouldn't be famous
if it hadn't been for me.

How come he's getting all the glory?

He's handicapped. That's what makes
his story so inspirational.

Handicapped.

Hmm...

Ah, how did these get up here?

What the hell is this, Brian?

It's my new passport.
What are you doing going through my mail?

You weren't planning on going somewhere
with our $26, were you?

Oh, for God's sake,
I just had the damn thing renewed.

What's the matter with you?

Look here, you're obviously
taking us for saps, but we're not.

Now fess up, or I'll do to you
what I did to John Lennon.

John, have you met Yoko? Yoko, John.

You want your money, fine.

I hope you all kill each other.

All right, I know how to settle this.

Whoever wants the money, raise your hand.

Oh, you're smarter than I thought.

Give yourselves a round of applause.

Damn!

Yeah, honey, I'm going
to be a little late tonight.

I've got a hooker coming over.

Well, I know it's late notice.

But what about the pool guy? He likes you.

Mr. Tucker, Mr. Griffin's here to see you.

I got to go.

Mr. Tucker, I have just become handicapped
like Joe Swanson,

and I demand commercial endorsements
and a TV movie based on me,

starring Valerie Bert-and-Ernie.

-But Mr. Griffin...
-Uh-uh.

I even got the first piece
you're going to run,

exclusive video footage
of my tragic accident.

Oh, no, a car going too fast
to stop in time.

(SCREAMING)

(WAILING) I'm handicapped now.

Mr. Griffin, you can't possibly expect me
to believe this.

That was clearly a scarecrow
dressed in your clothes.

-Oh, come on.
-And when I freeze-frame...

That's you driving the car.

-Well, there's your hook.
-Get out.

Today, we're here to honor Joe Swanson

for pulling my poor one-eyed cat, Bootsie,

out of the old stovepipe
of my grandmother's cabin.

Joe Swanson won
the Special People's Decathlon,

and we're here to honor him.

(ALL CHEERING)

Backstabber.

Oh, Peter, I'm sure Joe's
going to acknowledge you, you'll see.

Just don't forget our deal, Lois.

I sit through this,
and later tonight, I get anal.

You hear me? No matter
how neat I want the house,

you have to clean it.

Thank you, thank you.

You know, no one could win
a gold medal by himself.

It takes friends,

and I want to acknowledge
a special friend in the audience today.

My friend, Peter.

Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary.

Let's give him a hand, folks.

But that's nothing
compared to what this next man did.

He challenged me to go that extra mile.

And that man is Mr. Griffin.

Comedian Eddie Griffin, get up here.

Your acerbic, anti-white humor
was a constant inspiration.

Thank you, sir.

And last, but not least,
who could forget the fat guy?

Chef Paul Prudhomme,
you get your Cajun ass up here.

Wow, I didn't even do anything.

That's it. Excuse me,
but there's someone else he didn't thank.

Mr. Steroid. That's how he won.

That's not true.

Yes, it is. I put steroids
in your water bottle

right before the last race.

(ALL BOOING)

I'm sorry, everybody.
I've let you all down.

Yes. You suck. I rule.

(WAILS) Ugh!

Peter, you should go talk to him.

After all, you set out
to make him feel better,

and now he's worse than ever.

Yeah, I don't know, Lois.

He's probably over there,
waiting to be interviewed by Dan Rather

or that dreadful Gene Shalit.

Oh, I think those days
are over now, Peter.

Uh, hey, there.

Uh, hi, Peter.

-Listen, Joe, about this whole mess...
-Hold it, Peter.

That's the car wash thief.

(LAUGHS) Tough luck, wheelie.

Yeah, for you.

-I'm Joe, your waiter.

Today's special is justice,

And order the soufflé now,

Hey, Peter, I really appreciate
what you did for me.

What do you mean?

Well, that slimy agent
had me believing the hype.

And I forgot it was really you
who got me to believe in myself again.

Oh, and by the way,
I'm going back to the force.

Good for you.

Say, what happened to the car wash thief?

Ironically, I severed his spine
when I landed on him.

Well, looks like you've got
more competition

at next year's games, huh?

Nope, he's dead.

Just one more thing...

Lois!

I need you to take the presents
out of the trunk.

Aren't you going to do it?

It's already done.

I dropped them all off
at "Toys for Toddlers" last night.

All?

Peter, only one gift was for charity.

The rest were for the family.

No, the rest were from the family.

Weren't... Weren't they?

Aw, crap.

Since when did they change
the meaning of "for" to "from"?

I think they had a meeting
about it last night.

Why wasn't I told?

They sent you a card,
but it said "For Peter" on it,

so you must've thought it was "from" you,

so you didn't, uh...

You know, it's just easier
to call you "stupid."

You're really going to take back
donated gifts on Christmas Eve

Yep. Now, here's the plan...

You'll enter through
the air conditioning duct here.

Now, there'll be an invisible laser grid
three inches above the floor,

So, you'll have to compress your body

to the size of an ordinary

and slide underneath

like some kind of weird,
amphibious dolphin.

Can I buy some pot from you?

What you want?

are supposed to be for my family.

It was just some crazy mix-up.

See, that remote control car
was for my son and...

And those barrettes
were for my daughter,

and, uh... Hey, where's my VCR?

Dang it, Buck, it's my turn
to use the sex box.

It's my sex box...

And her name is "Sony."

LOIS: You gave away all the presents?

Lois, if you strike me down,

I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

Peter, you brought glad tidings
to a family less fortunate than your own.

You mean you're not mad?

Well, I am a little irritated
that I have to do all the shopping again,

but at least some good came out of it.

So, I can drink beer and watch tv?

'Cause, you know, <i>Kiss Saves Santa</i> is on.

But, Mrs. Claus, who would kidnap Santa?

Well, Ace, that's what I want
you boys to find out.

Someone stole Santa?

That does not rock!

Easy, Gene.

Guys, let's go save Christmas.

-Yay!
-Yay!

You can watch all the TV you want...

Just as soon as we get back from the mall.

The mall? On Christmas Eve?

Peter, I just want this family
to have a perfect Christmas,

and I need a little help, okay?

Brian, my turkey's in the oven.
Can you turn it off at 3:00?

No problem.

We'll shop, come home, eat,

and then it's off to the pageant

to see our little Stewie play baby Jesus.

Oh, yes, yes, by all means
turn me into a child star.

Perhaps I can move
to "Californ-eye-ay,"

and wrangle me a threeway
with the Olsen twins.

There's a spot!

(ENGINE REVVING)

Aw, screw this.

Okay, Peter, we'll each take
half the list to save time.

Kids, why don't you take Stewie
to see Santa?

Santa?

Oh, it's not possible!

Sitting alone in this public setting?

No bulletproof glass?

Claus, you make it too easy.

Change me. I've leaked
through my ski pants,

and I won't face him wet!

And how about this having
to sit still for 60 seconds

to have your picture taken?
How about that?

It'll be on next Christmas.

Well, who the hell knows
when that's going to be?

(BELL DINGS)

Ah!

If I was an oven mitt...

(SMOKE ALARM BEEPING)

Damn it, Peter!

Ho, ho, ho.

And what can I bring you this year?

Oh, a peace offering, is it?

Very well.

What say you trim
those gin-soaked whiskers

and bring me some plutonium?

Well, can you be a good boy?

Hmm, your inquiry intrigues me.

Can any of us be a good boy?

Are our primal urges innate
or the result of the choices we make?

Okay, wrap it up, kid.

All right, Kringle.

If the reward is plutonium,
then your wager is accepted.

I will be...

Nice.

Good boy.
Now, smile for the camera.

Yes, yes, smile!

Ow, ow!
Titty twister!

Ow, hurts!

Hey!

Aha!

All the clownfish and yellow tangs
in the world can't help you now.

That's it?

Fish food?

That's your ace in the hole?

(LAUGHS)

Ow, ow... Ow, ow, ow!

Turkey!

(SCREAMS)

Oh, Lois, it was horrible.

The fish were jumping
all over my eyes and in my nose,

and on the way out, I think one of them
muttered something anti-semitic.

We're almost home, honey.

Oh, look!

There's the star
on the town Christmas tree.

We're following it home.

Just like the three wise men.

So, what'd you get him?

Gold.

Gold?

Ah, I thought we agreed
on a $5 limit, here.

Yeah, I just got him
a crappy little bottle of myrrh.

Hello! Frankincense.

You always do this.

Okay, okay, okay, look.

We'll put everything together
and put all our names on it.

No!
That is so cheap.

(ALL CLAMORING)

(GASPS)

(TURKEY SIZZLING)

Oh, my God.

Brian, are you okay?

I told you we should have
left cookies for Santa.

(SCREAMS)

My couch, my TV!

-What the hell did you do?
-Me?

Who the hell buys
a novelty fire extinguisher?

I'll tell you who.

Someone who cares enough
about physical comedy

to put his whole family at serious risk.

Boys, please!

It's Christmas Eve.

This is a night for magic
and wonder and joy.

Okay, so a couple of things
have gone wrong,

but we can still have a great Christmas!

(SIGHS)

Ah, jeez, kids.

I was this close to losing it,
but your mom's right.

Well, sure I am.

Meg, honey, get me some paper towels.

Let's lose the bad tidings,

clean up this mess,
and find that holiday cheer.

Yeah, all right, yeah.

We're out of paper towels.

No... Paper... Towels!

(SCREAMING)

Hey, I was going to pick at that.

Shut your fat mouth!

You all think Christmas just happens.

You think all this goodwill
just falls from the freakin' sky!

Well, it doesn't!

It falls out of my holly jolly butt!

So, you can cook your own damn turkey,

wrap your own damn presents,

and hey, while you're at it,

you can all ride
a one-horse open sleigh to hell!

(SCREAMING)

(MUTTERING)

Oh, here's the paper towels.

I... I changed my mind.

Clarence, I want to live again.
I want to live again.

-Whoa!
-(SPLASH)

Hey!

I guess there's some magic
in that old silk hat.

(LOIS GROWLING)

Merry Christmas!

Easy, lady! You want some of this?

(LAUGHS)

Ah!

What the hell is her problem?

Frosty, let it go!

Just a second, just a second.

Hey, lady, you got something to say to me?

Yeah, all he did was wish you
a merry Christmas.

Wish?

It's easy to wish,

but does anyone take responsibility
and make it happen?

No!

You all expect someone else
to do it for you.

Like Santy Claus or mommy!

Ah, ah, ah! What the...

Ah, take it off!

Take it off!

Must... Kill... Star.

Dad, what happened to mom?

What if she never comes back?

I... I think the bigger question

is if this is the way
she's going to act at Christmas,

do we even want her back?

All right, which is better?

Around the waist or off the shoulder?

Waist? Shoulder?

Waist? Shoulder?

Stewie, I thought
you didn't want to be in the pageant.

Oh, Megan!

Santa would think it
terribly naughty of me

not to fulfill my obligation to mother.

You know how much
the pageant means to her.

Where do you think she is?

Well, thank God,

years ago I planted a homing device

in your mother's skull
for just such an occasion.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

I forgot, I also put them
in a bunch of squirrels.

This isn't going to do us any good.

May as well see if she's at the pageant.

You... You lied to me.

Oh, my God! There's mom!

Hi, Lois!
Hey, do we look like ants down here?

-Bite me!
-(GLASS BREAKING)

Peter, great time last night.

Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.

Locked and loaded, sir.

Wait! You can't shoot my mom.

Don't worry, kid.
It's just a mild sedative.

Go!

Wait, wait, hang on.

Look, Lois is only up there,

because we sucked the Christmas spirit
right out of her.

Maybe if she sees the pageant,
it'll bring her around.

Give her a chance, huh?

Trust him, Joe.

This man has seen
every Christmas special ever made.

Are you wearing a girl's sweater?

Does that really matter right now?

You got ten minutes.

Lights, please.

As we all know,

Christmas is that mystical time of year

when the ghost of Jesus
rises from the grave

to feed on the flesh of the living.

So, we all sing Christmas carols
to lull him back to sleep.

Outrageous!

How dare he say such blasphemy!
I've got to do something.

Bob, there's nothing you can do.

(SIGHS)

Well, I guess I'll just
have to develop a sense of humor.

I am the Virgin Mary.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Oh, our savior has arrived.

Good evening.

I'm playing the role of Jesus,

a man once portrayed on the big screen
by Jeffrey Hunter.

You may remember him as the actor

who was replaced by William Shatner
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

Apparently, Mr. Hunter was good enough
to die for our sins,

but not quite up to the task
of seducing green women.

Anyhoo...

The perennial dictum
is to spread goodwill towards all men.

The irony, of course,
is that this is contrary to our nature.

So, why do we do it?

Because we are being watched.

And so, we unselfishly think of others,

assured that our good behavior
will be rewarded

with love and plutonium.

Yeah, she's not getting it.

Okay, boys, take her down.

Merry Christmas, buddy.

Huh, wonder what this could be.

Oh.

This Christmas rocks!

Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts.

Mom?

Ah, it's okay, Meg.

Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer

and enough tranquilizer
to bring down a bull elephant.

Uh, honey, you got a little something.

You got a little...

Uh... I'll get it.

<i>Hungry, hungry hippos?</i>

Claus, you porcine double-crosser.

And to think, I was nice!

You got another one, dude.

(GASPS)

Plutonium!

He is real.

He's really, really real!

So, Peter, did you get everything
you wanted for Christmas?

You bet! A week's vacation, a new VCR,

and best of all,
my own copy of <i>Kiss Saves Santa.</i>

You just practice that guitar, Santa.

Next time, we'll let you<i></i>do a solo.

Don't encourage him!

(ALL LAUGHING)

From all of us at <i>Family Guy...</i>

We wish you Christmas joy.

May all your wishes now come true...

For every girl and boy.

We hope your freakin' holidays
are filled with fun and cheer.

So, have a merry Christmas and...

I met him down at the general store.
He makes canoes.

Oh.

How come I've never met him?

Mm... He hasn't really

Lois, I'm going to grow a beard.

Oh, Peter, you know I hate beards.

No, no, Lois.

It's time I joined the ranks

Why do you think Jesus Christ
was so popular? Huh?

'Cause... 'Cause of all them magic tricks?

Listen, Brian's very depressed.

Could you and the guys take him with you
to the laser rock show tonight?

Yeah, sure. If there's one thing
I'm good at doing,

it's cheering people up.

Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey,

Jon-Benet's untimely death is a tragedy,

Richard Grieco would probably

I mean, with Johnny Depp, it's like...

I had to keep it there for a whole week.

Ha! What a week!

will be just like baby-sitting,

only with bigger diapers.

Aha! So they do make bigger diapers!

That deceitful woman told me
I'd have to learn to use the toilet!

Well, fie on the toilet!

It's made slaves of you all.

No one has seen Pearl Burton

since that fateful night
over 30 years ago.

She's presumed dead.

My God. And I said
all those awful things to her.

(GASPING) Pearl!

(SIGHS) Come on, Pearl, don't do this!

You should be happy.

I'm taking your advice
and doing the world a big favor.

Now, move!
Your fur is making my feet sweat.

Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing.

It was the most beautiful sound
I've ever heard in my life.

Oh, sure, warbling for Vicks VapoRub
and Dippity Do.

No, no, Pearl, I mean...

Oh, stop trying to talk me out of it.

I'm a pathetic sellout.

No one who sings <i>Carmen</i> like you
is pathetic.

-What?
-I heard you sing "Habanera."

You were sublime.

You... You liked my aria?

I was overwhelmed.

You're the first person
who ever complimented my "Habanera."

Thank you.

Well, I'd, uh... I'd better get going.

I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

But you're not scheduled tomorrow.

I know.

(GURGLING)

"And then the cow came out of the barn."

See? See? Look... There's the cow.

Now, what does a cow say?

-(CHIRPING)
-Yes, yes, that's right.

A cow says peep, peep, peep, peep.

You know, Peter,
they're getting awfully big.

-So?
-So, every good mother knows

when it's time for her babies
to leave the nest.

Hey, they're free to go
any time they want.

(SCREAMS)

Fine, I'll let them go.

(OPERATIC SINGING)

Pearl, do you rent or own?

-Own what?
-Those wings, you angel.

That was fantastic.

That was so incredible!

So, what do you want for dinner?

I was thinking about making us
that lamb and rice you love.

You know, Pearl,
what I'd really like for dinner

is, uh, to go out.

Brian, you know I can't do that.

I haven't left this house
in such a long time.

I'm afraid.

I know, but I'll be with you.

(SIGHS) I don't know...

Come on, Pearl, there's so much
you've missed in the last 30 years.

In fact, allow me to fill you in.

Mark's been trying to get me
to see his one-man show for weeks.

Oh, I think it's wonderful
you're supporting your old pal.

Go long, Eddie, go long.

Further, further.

Ah...

Life sure was crazy,
growing up in Brooklyn.

We had some real characters
in my neighborhood.

Like Frank, the mailman.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT) Hey, Mark,
the ants for your ant farm came today.

(CHUCKLES) And my friend, Lonny,
that knucklehead.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT) Yo, Marky!

Let's play some B-ball.

B-ball, that's what we called it.

B-ball.

And my grandma.
Boy, was she something else.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT) Hey, Marky!

Don't forget to take your cod liver oil.

(COUGHS)

Great job.

God, what a piece of self-indulgent crap.

All the characters sounded
exactly the same.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT)
Great show, Mark.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT)
Yeah, you captured me perfectly.

(IN BROOKLYN ACCENT)
Me, too. You are so talented.

That was awful.
You know, with a little practice,

I could act circles around that guy.

Oh, yeah? Well, then, put up or shut up.

"This Thursday, auditions
for the Quahog School of Performing Arts'

You should try out.

Oh, you know,
that's not a bad idea, Lois.

Okay, ready for the best acting
you've seen all night?

Mark, wow. What a journey.
Thank you so much.

I... Those three and a half hours
just flew by.

Hey, Santos, Pasqual, listen.

You guys have done
such good work today,

Oh, my God, he was just floating

Yep, he was so grateful I saved his life,

he invited us all over for dinner tonight.

-Oh, good, I don't have to cook.
-Oh, no, no.

Go ahead and cook anyway, Lois,
and we'll throw it out.

I don't want you to get rusty.

Say, Peter?
My audition's coming up.

Would you mind listening
to my monologue?

Sure, buddy, let's hear it.

Julie, there's something
I got to tell you...

Ha, that's awesome. Go on.

Um, uh, tell you.

I... I saw Dr. Phil...

Wow, wow, yes, yes. I love it.

Dr. Phillips today.

I might not make it to Christmas.

Oh, yeah, drop the bomb. Drop it.

There's not a dry eye in the house.
Keep going.

No, no, you know what?
I'm going to stop.

Um, maybe we'll work on it later.

Okay, well, just so you know, it was good,

but, uh, I was also being pretty generous.

Well, look at you, you little jaybird.

You want to tell your mommy and daddy
the Griffins are here?

MAN: Come on in!

Welcome, Griffins.

Oh, uh, uh...

-We must be early.
-WOMAN: Oh, nonsense.

You're right on time.

Oh, my God, she's got hair growing
out of her boobs and up to her head.

You're, uh... You're completely...

Nude? Yes, we're nudists.

Permission to freak out?

Peter, did you know about this?

I... I thought he lost his bathing suit
in the ocean.

So, you're the man
who saved my husband's life.

Dotty Campbell.

Oh, what am I doing? Come here.

Watch my hands, Lois. Look, look.

See where they are? See? No touchy.

And this is the backyard.

that's premium Blue-Tip Bermuda.

Real hardy, but soft.

Oh, good Lord.

Don't look directly into it, Lois.

Can I get you a beer, Peter?

-Uh, what have you got?
-I've got Busch.

Oh, and Busch Lite.

(CAR DOOR SLAMS)

Oh, sounds like Jeff's home.

Hey, sport, how'd you do?

I got first place, Dad.

Way to go, champ.

Jeff plays varsity tennis
for St. Genevieve High.

Oh, cool.

Is this the biggest thing
you've ever seen?

Hey, don't get too cocky.

I had a big one like that
when I was your age.

Oh, you were a showoff,
yourself, Dave.

He brought it out on our first date.

Lois, I'm scared.

Oh, I'll get that.

Hey!

Ah, oh, oh, God!

Oh, Dave, sorry. Uh, oh, God.

-Boobies!
-Chris, that's enough.

Well, I'm sure glad to be out of there.

You said it, Lois.

What those people are doing
just ain't natural.

Boobies!

Did you hear me, young man?

I don't know what the big deal was.

-I thought they were nice.
-Boobies.

-Peter?
-Do it.

Did you have fun
at the circus today, Chris?

Elephants are bigger in person.

Oh, break a leg up there, Brian.

You seem awfully enthusiastic.

Well, at first, I wanted you to fail.

And this is from John Walts'

Julie, there's something
I got to tell you.

I saw Dr. Phillips today.

I might not make it to Christmas.

(YAWNS) Thank you. Next.

Next? Now, hold on, Brian.
Stay up there. Stay there.

Now, see here.

Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor
with talent and passion.

But you alleged "experts"
obviously didn't notice.

Well, I did notice.

I saw a man bare his soul up here.

And his pain ran through my heart
like an errant locomotive.

But it was wasted,
wasted on all of you.

Well, it looks like we're going
to have to reconsider.

Brian, we want you...

-Yes!
-...off the stage.

But your young friend there
would make a perfect addition

to the school's Rising Star program.

Oh, splendid.

This calls for a sexy party.

(MUSIC PLAYS)

Okay, funcakes, let's do a scene.

Okay, uh, Stewie, how about you?

And, uh, let's see, one of our veterans...

Um, Olivia.

I'm not doing a scene with him.

He's inexperienced.

He'll drag my whole performance down.

Are you serious?

Is she serious?

Ah, okay, Stewie,
I'll give you a solo exercise.

Now, you're going to do a little exercise
we call the "life cycle."

Now, without using words,

you're going to act out your entire life
from birth to death,

exactly as I describe it.

Okay, ready? Lie down.

Now, you're being born.

Ready, and... Burst through the placenta!

Whoo!

Okay, now, fast-forward.

It's your first day of school.

You're alone and scared.

(GASPS)

But it's all right, it's all right.

-It's Sloppy Joe day.
-Oh!

Okay, pull it back.

The lady touched the bun,
and she's not wearing gloves.

-Ooh!
-Okay, fast-forward. You're a businessman.

You manage a lot of people.

And here comes Henderson,
and he lost the big account.

You're mad.

Madder!

Madder!

Come on, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, ooh.

Ooh, there it is, you got it.

And fast-forward.

You're an old man now.

You're on your deathbed.

Your son is there, holding your hand.

You tell him you accept his lifestyle,

and regret humiliating him
at his only sister's wedding

by introducing him
as your "other daughter."

And... Scene.

Okay, any comments?

You are the weakest link.

Goodbye.

(LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING)

Oh, gosh, that's funny.

That's really fu...

Do... Do you write your own material?

Do you? Because that is so fresh.

"You are the weakest link. Goodbye."

You know, I... I've never heard anyone
make that joke before.

Hmm, you're the first.

I've never heard anyone reference that
outside the program before.

Because that's what she says
on the show, right? Isn't it?

"You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye."

And yet, you've taken that
and used it out of context

to insult me in this everyday situation.

God, what a clever, smart girl you must be

to come up with a joke like that
all by yourself.

Hmm, that's so fresh, too.

Any <i>Titanic </i>jokes you want to throw at me,

as long as we're hitting these phenomena

at the height of their popularity? Hmm?

'Cause I'm... I'm here.

God, you're so funny!

JEFF: Meg?

Jeff! Wow, hey, what you doing here?

They had a sale on Super Soakers.

Check it out.

(LAUGHING)

Ah, what the heck?

Nudist!

My dad's a tailor, you jerk!

Oh, gosh, that's awful.

Ah, that's all right.

I'm used to it.

Well, I better go.

So, um, would you want to do
something sometime?

Sure, that'd be great!

Cool. I'll call you later.

Holy moly, it must be my birthday.

Thank... Thank you.

Thank you very...

Thank you very...

So, Olivia... Beautiful day.

You're not going to fart again, are you?

Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but you're a total bitch.

The quarterly review's tomorrow.
Think all your kids will pass?

Well, I'll tell you
who's not going to pass.

It starts with an "O"
and rhymes with Bolivia.

Give up? Olivia.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

She's such a little frosty box.

She won't work with anybody.

And Stewie Griffin is also on the fence.

If he and Olivia don't deliver
at their quarterly reviews,

I'm just going to have to kick
their cute little bottoms out of here.

(GASPS)

Uh, this table is reserved
for people with talent.

Stow the 'tude, queenie!

You and I have a problem!

"Doesn't work well with others"?

Yes, mine's no better.

I'll spare you the details.

Suffice it to say
the phrase "garden variety"

appears a number of times.

What am I going to do!

What are <i>we </i>going to do?

Look, our evaluation's tomorrow.
You need someone to work with,

and, well, I need someone
to make me look good.

I don't know...

Well, fine, refuse my offer,

get booted out of this place
and wind up like Linda Evans.

How do you like yours?

Okay, let's both answer at the same time.

One, two, three.

-Without.
-Without.

Holy moly, that's eight things
we have in common!

Kids, we're home.

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

You guys remember Jeff?

Sure! Lois, I'm going to borrow your mace.

(SCREAMS) That's better.

So, Meg, did any of the neighbors
see Jeff come over?

Mom! Come on, Jeff,
let's go in the other room.

Now, Meg, no need to get so testes...

Uh, testy.
Oh, nuts!

I mean, crap!

You want to sit down?

Wait a second, don't sit down yet.

Dad, what are you doing?

I'm, uh-uh, keeping the couch fresh.

-Dad!
-It's okay, Meg.

I understand what's going on here.
I'm going to go.

Oh! Just, uh-uh, step on these coasters
on your way out.

Here we go, yeah.

Yeah, don't step on the hot lava.
The carpet is hot lava.

I can't believe you guys!

Meg, how could you bring
that naked kid into our house?

Because I like him.

He remembers my name.

Well, I'm sorry, honey,

but we don't think
you should see him anymore.

(GASPS)

Oh, I hate the sound of her crying.

You know what sounds even worse?

(PLASTIC SCREECHING)

Ah, listen to that.

(PLASTIC SCREECHING)

Don't you hate that?

(PLASTIC SCREECHING)

That is awful.

(PLASTIC SCREECHING)

I think it's easier on me,
'cause I'm the one making the sound.

(PLASTIC SCREECHING)

Okay, nice effort, Brad,

but, uh, let's remember
our performance hierarchy,

legitimate theater,
musical theater, stand-up,

ventriloquism, magic, mime.

All right, next up is Olivia.

Liv, what monologue
are you doing for us this time?

I'm not doing a monologue.
I'm doing a piece with Stewie.

A duet? Really?

Well, let's see it.

Uh, five, six, seven, eight...

I totally called him on it.

Okay, no secrets.

I want to share Stewie
and Olivia with the world.

Well, they're awfully young.

Is this really a good idea?

It's a great idea.

I've always dreamed
of becoming an actress,

but that's not why
I'm pushing Olivia to do it.

Is it suspicious
that I brought that up unprovoked?

Well, I guess it might be okay.

Sure, Lois, I mean, look at Elroy Jetson.

He was a child actor
and he turned out just fine.

You know who I am?

I'm Elroy Jetson.

Yeah, yeah, come back
when you have some money.

Take him home, BamBam.

Bam, bam, bam.

Yes, we're a hit! You were amazing!

Oh, so were you.

Well, it was a good crowd.

They didn't even notice
that you missed that F-sharp.

Yes, well... Beg pardon?

The F-sharp, darling.

You were just slightly off.

I'm pretty sure I wasn't.

Oh, well, maybe it was me.

<i>Like this, listen to me!</i>

Oh, hi, Meg.

Peter, do you think
maybe it was unfair of us

to tell Meg she couldn't see that boy?

Oh, completely. We totally reamed her.

Did you see that look in her eyes?

She hates you.

(BOTH SINGING CHORDS)

Well, there it is, kids.
Your first marquee. Meet you inside.

Pretty exciting.

What? The marquee or the other thing?

What other thing?

You know, the sex with Simon.

Why else would your name be first?

Well, it's obvious.

You know, lead with strength,

put your best foot forward,
et cetera, et cetera.

So, the sex was good?

Oh, shut up, you egotistical jerk!

You shut up, you sack-bellied strumpet!

Blimp-headed jackass!

Mealy-mouthed crotch pheasant!

(SINGING)
<i>Thank goodness</i>

<i>I've got you!</i>

Jeff! What are you doing here?

Look, I'm not supposed to see you.

Your parents invited me.

My parents? But they wouldn't...

Yes, we would.

Oh, my God! What are you doing?

We were wrong, Meg.

If you like Jeff,
we should give him a chance.

Yeah, and we wanted him
to feel welcome in our home.

Mom, I need new batteries for my Walkman.

Hey, why is everybody else naked?

Yahtzee! I win!

Yeah, in your face! In your face!

In your face!

(SCREAMS)

Uh, I got to get going.

Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

Our pleasure, Jeff.

Nice hanging with you, Jeff.

I'm sorry about my parents.

I hope they didn't embarrass you.

Are you kidding? I think they're great.

It took a lot of guts
for them to do what they did.

I'll see you later.

Thanks, you guys.
That was really cool.

Hey, Peter, can I borrow your lawnmow...

Ah. You folks got a towel?

Simon, would you be a dear,

and ask Stewie to dance
on his own feet tonight?

Pardon me, Simon,
could you provide Olivia with a bucket,

so she can carry a tune?

People, people, stop this craziness.

The critic from the <i>Providence Journal</i>
is here.

If he gives us a good review,
the doors are going to fly open.

Now, go get them, my little silly-billies.

All right, let's just get through this.

Fine with me.

Wait a minute.
You're wearing ruby lipstick.

You're painted up
like some attention-grabbing Jezebel.

Well, you're one to talk.

You've been stuffing your diaper
since day one.

It's where I keep my peppermint Mentos.

Just because your breath reeks
of rotten Lunchables

doesn't mean mine has to.

Break it up. Break it up!

I don't need this act
and I don't need you.

You've done nothing but hold me back.

I quit!

The only thing
I've held you back from is failure.

Come on, Simon,
we don't need that little Bebe No-worth.

I don't know, Stewie.

Without Olivia, this act
is like Fire Island after Labor Day.

Over.

Fine, I don't need you.

I can manage my own career.

Yes... Yes, I'm...
I'm quite capable of that.

Would somebody get a hook?

This is worse than <i>Seussical!</i>

No, no, wait, wait.

I was about to do this thing.

Oh, hello. Didn't notice you there.

You know, it's not easy
living with my family.

A bunch of characters they are.

Like my father...

"Holy crap, Lois, check out
the freakin' log in the toilet."

Get off the stage!

Oh, what do you say, Bernie?

Two nights at the old rate?

Like I told you before, kid,
I can't book you without Olivia.

But that's the good news.
We're back together.

She's right here.

Hi, Bernie, glad to be back.

Ask Stewie about his sexy parties.

"Ask Stewie about his sexy parties."

What were you thinking?
I was just trying...

I'm not speaking to you.

-But, Stewie.
-Shut up!

I guess... I guess the best advice I got
was from Martin Scorsese.

Um, I was having a problem
understanding why I'd be taking abuse

from this lower-ranking officer
played by Chris O'Donnell,

and he told me,

"You don't have to understand it,
your character does."

Oh, that always stuck with me.

Stewie?

Olivia, what are you doing here?

Oh, I must be an absolute mess.

The studio made me fire my makeup girl.

Oh, I, um...

I just wanted to stop by
and see how you were doing.

I had heard some things.

Oh, that it's going great for me?

Well, you heard right.

Oh, glad to hear that.

But, hey, um...

You know, if you're not busy, um...

What say you and I
get the old team back together?

Well, actually, I can't.

I'm on my way to Hollywood.

I got this part in a movie, and...

Oh, oh, oh, what am I thinking?

I... I, you know... I'd love to,

but I... I just... I'm booked solid.

I'm doing a three-episode guest shot
on <i>The Gilmore Girls.</i>

I play Rory's
motorcycle-driving boyfriend.

He's a bad boy at heart, you know?

But there's... There's some good
in there, Olivia,

and it comes through absolutely.

That's really good to hear, Stewie.

Please, take care of yourself.

See you on the coast.

So, did you let him have it?

No, he let himself have it.

This is it.

Hey, uh, how you doing, kid?

Are you from wardrobe?

No, no, it's me, Brian.

I brought what you wanted,
but they wouldn't let me leave it.

So, uh...

Hit it once, please? Just once?

(VOCALIZES IN HIGH-PITCHED TONE)

Oh, my God, I was flat.

All right, then, help me up.

Let's go home.

Brian, will you watch Stewie for a minute?

Sure.

And please a close eye on him.
Remember what happened last time.

Stewie, get down before you hurt yourself.

Shut up. You're not my mother!

Good God, are you all right?

Fine. Why do you ask?

Mm, delicious.

I will seriously consider purchasing
this product.

Oh, what have we here? May I partake?

Mm...

(IN JAPANESE ACCENT) Ah, sausage-san.

Plan to buy great amount

Sir, you don't have to keep moving

You can have as many as you want.
They're free.

What are you talking about?

-Hey, can I have some more sausage?
-Yeah, me, too.

Oh, they got a great deal on pianos

Meg, help me get these down.

-MAN: Lois?
-Oh, my God.

-(MEG SCREAMS)
-I don't believe this.

Ross Fishman, is that really you?

I haven't seen you since college.

How are you?

Great, great.

Wow, Lois, you haven't aged a bit.

(CHUCKLING) Mm, thank you.

This 12-pack of fungicide
is for my daughter, Meg.

-That was great.

Is it 1981?

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Ah, yes, there you are.

You people
at the Industrial Adhesives Corporation

certainly know how to make a tasty glue.

Now, then, let the banquet begin.

Whoa, whoa. What the hell are you doing?
Don't eat that.

Oh, for God's sake, don't be such a nerd.

Look, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
If Lois sees this, she'll kill me.

You can let go of my hand now.

You can let go of mine.

(YELLING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

-Oh...
-Crap.

Well, Ross, I can't tell you
how wonderful it's been to see you.

It's a crime that it's been so long.
We were so close.

Maybe we could get together
for a cup of coffee. Catch up.

Well... I don't know, Ross.
I'm married now.

(CHUCKLES) Well, so am I.

Does that mean we're not allowed
to stay in touch with old friends?

Tell you what?
If you change your mind, here's my card.

Hey, look, Dad,
they have 12-packs of kidneys.

Yeah, but you got to buy the cooler, too.
That's how they get you.

-Okay, thanks.
-Well?

Well, the good news is the same company
makes a solvent that'll get us unstuck.

The bad news is it takes
two weeks for delivery.

You're telling me that we're stuck
like this for a bloody fortnight?

You cannot tell Lois about this.

Oh? And what if I do?

I'll show her those pictures of you
wearing her wedding dress.

You said there was no film in that camera.

-(DOOR OPENS)
-Come on, Stewie.

-It's time to change your diaper.
-Uh, mind if I watch?

And I'm just ashamed of myself, Brian,

that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me
from rekindling an old friendship,

just because it was with a man.

Yeah, Peter's not exactly
the most understanding guy

when it comes to you and other men.

Like that time at the movies...

Uh, I... I... This is...

This is terribly awkward,

but I... I wanted to tell you something,

but I... I... Oh, I seem to be
so charmingly befuddled.

Ah, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.

Oh, is that how it is?

Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!

Don't do it, Dad. He's bigger than you.

And when you went to that concert.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

And then there was last Saturday night.

Oh, look at that handsome man.

You son of a bitch!

I can't let Peter's irrational emotions
run my life.

I'm going to call Ross,

to take him up on his offer.

-Would you mind finishing up?
-Uh, sure.

Yes, yes, do you like cleaning
my doodie, Brian?

Say it. Say, "I like cleaning

Uh... So, I... I'll return in a few hours.

Yeah, I'll do it when this is over.

Hey, Lois, could you grab me a beer?

-Lois?
-Dad, I think she went out.

-All right, then you be Lois.
-Okay.

Hey, Lois, could you grab me a beer?

Nah. What would Lois be doing

Peter Gifford?

(GASPS) My God, Dora, my old girlfriend.

What a surprise
that you would want to look me up.

You always thought I was so handsome.

Peter, can I see you in the other room?

-Yeah, yeah, say it.
-Should I?

-I can't.
-Yeah. Just say it.

How far can you get this banana down...

I can't say it. She's looking right at me.

Peter, what the hell is this about?

I'll tell you what it's about.

-It's about you and Ross Fishman.
-What?

I saw you with him the other day,

breaking the fifth commandment.

Congress passes these things
for a reason, Lois.

That's it. Peter, you're suffocating me
with your jealousy.

I can't take it anymore.

I'm calling a marriage counselor.

I can't even have coffee with a friend
without you freaking out.

What is your problem?

You want to know what my problem is?

You want to know what my problem is?

I love too much.

Peter, what are you talking about?

Don't you see, Lois? We're alive!

-Peter, you're scaring me.
-Good! Embrace the fear.

Dance with me, Lois.
Dance the dance of life.

Yeah, maybe you should call
that marriage counselor.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I've reviewed your situation,

and I have a suggestion.

We're willing to do whatever it takes.

I'd like to put video cameras
in every room of your house,

so that I can observe
your uncensored behavior.

Wow, just like that show <i>Big Brother.</i>

Except somebody will be watching.

All right, I've looked
through all the video footage,

and I've compiled what I believe to be

an accurate cross section
of your home life.

Here are the results.

-Peter, give Chris a spanking.
-Okay.

Chris, I'm watching the game.
You know what to do.

Ow, ow, ow, ow!

This hurts me more than it hurts you. Ow!

Get my back, would you?

Oh, that's it.

Ooh, that feels good.

Hey, Lois, can you give me a hand
with this jar?

Oh, for heaven's sake, Peter.

-(SCREAMING)
-(BEES BUZZING)

(LAUGHING) Gotcha!

To be honest,
I've never seen such dysfunction.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,

what I'm about to suggest
may seem unorthodox.

I recommend a trial separation,

during which time,
I advise that you date other people.

I believe this will help you
gather perspective on your marriage.

-Date other people?
-Oh, my God.

I realize this is very upsetting for you.

That's why I've invited Howie Mandel
to lighten the mood

by blowing up a surgical glove
with his nose.

Boy, this feels really weird, Lois.

I know, but maybe the doctor's right.

This time apart could be good for us.

I don't know, Lois.

Splitting up didn't work too well
for Pac-Man and his wife.

Hey, come on, buddy, forget about her.

Yeah, you're too good for her, anyway.

Cheer up, man.

Hey, hey, you want to eat us?

Oh, he's not budging.

Come on, let's go to Q-Bert's.

I really appreciate
you putting me up, Cleveland.

Our house is your house, Peter.

I'd sit here and chat with you,

but I need to get back upstairs
to Loretta,

Peter, you are welcome to stay with us
as long as you like.

Oh, thanks, Muriel.

So, what do you guys do
for fun around here?

We like to watch old movies
while listening to "Hotel California"

to see if it synchs up
in a significant way,

and so far, no, nothing has.

(PHONE RINGS)

-Hello?
-GLENN: <i>Hey, Lois, is Peter there?</i>

Oh, hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home.

We're, uh... (SIGHS)

We're having some minor marital problems.

Our therapist has advised us
to date other people.

-(LINE DISCONNECTS)
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

-Hey, Lois, you want to go out?
-What?

I don't know, Glenn.
Peter and I just separated.

I feel like I need more time.

How about now?

Well, we are supposed to see other people,

and I guess it's better to go out with you
than some sex pervert.

I'm in! Giggedy-giggedy,
giggedy-giggedy-goo!

(STEWIE GASPING FOR BREATH)

Oh! God blast it,
will you hold it for five seconds?

(PANTING)

Okay.

(LISPING) So, Mr. Griffin,

how's it feel to be a bachelor
on the prowl once again?

Eh, it's not as great as you might think.

I guess I just don't have
the same way with women that I used to.

(COUGHING)

Mm, that was nice, that was nice.

I had a really great time
with you today, beautiful stranger.

What's your sign?

(COUGHING)

(CHUCKLES) Gross.

I still think you're neat, though.

You should try
a video dating service, Peter.

That's how Muriel and I met.

Let me show you Mort's tape.
He was so charming.

Hey, there's the mail! Oh, finally.

All right, it says it takes an hour

Well, let's see... What takes an hour?

We could watch Rita Rudner
do five minutes of stand-up.

Ba-zing.

Oh, boy, we're going to have
a swell time tonight, Lois.

Glenn, thank you
for being such a good friend,

-and looking after me like this.
-No problem.

It's kind of chilly out,
so I brought you a jacket.

No, thanks, I'll be fine.

Please?

Peter, Muriel and I both feel

that you need to follow
your therapist's advice and start dating.

Oh, jeez, Mort, I don't know if I'm ready.

Oh, come on, stud.

We've got it all set up for you
to go out with our niece.

Honey, come on out here
and meet Peter Griffin!

Peter, this is our niece,
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

-Nice to meet you.
-All right, I'm getting up.

Hi. Peter Griffin.
So, where do you want to go?

We can go anywhere except the disco.
They don't let me in there anymore.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

(SCREAMS)

Crafty Mexicans and your glass candy.

Hey, what's going on?

There's a little girl down in that well.

Oh, my God.

Unfortunately, nobody's arms
are long enough to reach her,

except that one guy, but he's helping
that woman tickle a midget in a tree.

Tee-hee. Oh, stop!

Tee-hee. (GIGGLING)

Oh, God, you want to rescue her,
don't you?

Ugh. It's times like this I wish
they'd used me for stem cell research.

Help me!

"It rubs the lotion on its skin,

"or else it gets the hose again." Ha!

All right, I'm going to lower you in.

I just noticed... How often do you see
a 17th century well in this day and age?

-Hurry up! The glue's wearing off!
-All right, all right.

-We did it.
-Job well done.

And we're not stuck together anymore.

-Thank God.
-You said it.

-You want to hold hands on the walk home?
-Yeah, sure.

Oh, Suzie. Thank God, you're all right.

Sometimes, you got to do a lot of crap

Oh, the food here is fantastic.

This is where I took Lois
on our first date.

You ordered a pie for an appetizer?

Don't worry. I'll go to the john
and fire one out in about five minutes.

That should make some room for dinner.

Here's your table, Mr. Quagmire.

Thanks. Hey, how about a couple of drinks?

Certainly, sir. Martini for you,
and the usual roofie colada for your date?

No, no, no... (MUMBLING)

A glass of wine.

(GASPS) Oh, my God,
it's Jennifer Love Hewitt!

Wow, I wonder who she's here with.

She could date any man she wanted to.

(FLUSHING)

There, made lots of room.

Hey, waiter, that sign in the bathroom
about washing your hands...

That's only for the staff, right?

Uh, technically, yes.

That's what I thought. Great.

Oh, man, these all look good,
every one of them.

-Hey, you want some bread?
-No!

Peter, is that you?

Peter? Oh, no! I can't let him see me!

It's okay, Quagmire.

We're just doing what the therapist said
we should do.

Peter, I think it's great
you're out with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

(CHUCKLES) Hi.

I loved you in <i>Heartbreakers.</i>

You be on your best behavior.

Here you go, sweetheart, open up.

-No!
-There you go.

-Isn't this romantic?
-That's it.

You have got to be the most vile,
disgusting human being I've ever met,

and I have never been
more turned on in my life.

Hold on, toots!

I don't care what our therapist says,

I'm not going to stand by and watch
my husband lock lips with another woman!

-Now beat it!
-What's your problem, grandma?

You are, and I only
saw <i>Heartbreakers </i>on a plane!

And the flight was delayed,
so the headphones were free!

Wow, that was pretty cool, Lois.

Huh, gosh, I guess I finally understand...

(SCREAMING)

-(YELPS)
-Yeah, you better run, you little bitch!

I guess I finally understand how you
can get so jealous sometimes.

Oh, seeing her kiss you like that
just made me crazy.

Well, I... I guess we're just going
to have to learn to control our jealousy.

Together.

Together.

Ma'am, you dropped your napkin.

Here's your drink, sir.

Eh, we'll work on it later.

I love you, Lois.

I love you, too, Peter.

Lois hurry, it's back on!

Calm down, Peter,

Okay, let's take a call.
You're on <i>Kiss Forum.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Kiss rules! Whoo!</i>

Okay, good call, good call. (CHUCKLES)

All right, hey, you're on <i>Kiss Forum.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Yeah. Kiss sucks.</i>

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Trace the call, trace the call.

<i>Yeah, um, they suck big time.</i>
<i>They bite ass.</i>

Wait a second, I recognize that voice.

Is this Dennis De Young,
lead singer from Styx?

Come clean, man.

<i>Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Dennis.</i>

Dennis, you jealous douche,

how about I crank
a little "Detroit Rock City"

and play "Come Sail Away,"

and we can see how they stack up
side by side, huh?

You want that, you high-voiced bastard?

We'll be right back after this.

Hey, didn't see you come in.

We're just getting into shape
for our upcoming tour.

We're playing five big shows in five days.

-So, if you're...
-Rock and roll!

Why don't you just sit
in the corner, huh? Go on.

So, if you're a Kiss fan
and you live in the Northeast,

come out for all five shows
of what we're calling "Kiss-Stock."

Aw, hell, the Northeast?

You know, it's times like this,

I curse the fact that we live
in French Polynesia.

No, Peter, we're in the Northeast.

We are?

And Kiss is coming to the Northeast.

That means... Uh...

-That means...
-No, no, Lois, don't help me.

It means we can do something...

Come on, Peter, you're almost there.

(DRILLING)

-We can go to Kiss-Stock!
-(SCREAMS)

PETER: Hey, yo, Lois!

-What?
-I'm packing for Kiss-Stock.

I can't find my favorite underwear.

You mean the pair with the rip
in the right butt cheek

from when you stepped on them
pulling them up

in the airplane bathroom
from when you had the trots?

No, no, the pair with the hole
in the left butt cheek

from when I held it in for two hours,

'cause it was that extra long
Palm Sunday Church sermon

and I thought blowing gas
would offend Jesus,

so I let it go in the vestibule after mass
and it sounded like Louis Armstrong?

Oh, bottom drawer.

Children, tell Mother Maggie
what you want to be when you grow up?

-A scientist.
-A novelist.

A Cambridge don.

Oh, what's my future,
coming from these squalid surroundings?

Getting into a fight
with some dude at the Laundromat,

'cause he was hitting on my baby's mama?

I should be there, not here.

<i>London...</i>

Hey, Dad, can me and Meg
stay up late every night

when you're at Kiss-Stock?

You can do whatever you want, son.

Just don't eat from the Candy tree.

He's right to caution you.
I feed on children.

(SCREAMS)

You don't mind watching Stewie
for a few days, do you, Brian?

No, ever since <i>Jolly Farm Revue </i>came on,

he's been pretty distracted.
It'll be a breeze.

Well, bye, everyone.

I can't believe my stupid parents
are going to spend five days

following stupid old Kiss around.
It's painful.

Not half as painful
as a tire iron upside your head.

-What?
-I'll miss you.

Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch?

Ugh, a man can hardly breathe in here.

You should get some hash, man.

You can't go wrong.

Oh, not true.

Ground meat can go very wrong
for me very quickly,

and everyone in this room
will suffer the consequences.

You are out there, man, in the ether.

Yes, well, I'd love
to further pursue our palaver,

but I'm not fluent in Freaka,

so I'm just going to turn back over here,

back towards my table.

-Say, are you hungry?
-I wasn't when I came in,

but isn't that so funny?
I'm getting there.

Yeah, same here.

-I think the only reason we die is that...
-Dude, dude.

I know what you're going to say
and I am so completely...

Wait, wait, wait... (SHUSHING)

The only reason we die

is because we accept it
as an inevitability. Ah!

Do you think I'll ever find
the right woman?

Oh, God, I... Yes, man!

Come on, dude, you're great.

Peter, are you ever going to forgive me?

Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you,

so I will take my rage out on my own body.

Let's go to Denny's.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Oh, man. I don't believe it! Kiss is here!

We don't deserve
to be under the same roof with them.

-Let's go.
-Well, all right.

I guess I could fix us something
when we... Chaim?

Lois, do not address Kiss
unless they address you first!

Oh, my God, Chaim Witz? It is you!

Uh, which one do you want me to sign,
left or right?

No, no, no, it's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt.

I knew you before you changed your name.

Lois! I don't believe it. It's been ages.

Hey, guys, this is the girl
I told you about.

You know, I knew her
before we formed Kiss.

"Loose Lois."

-Cool. Loose Lois!
-The legend herself!

My Grand Slam was supposed
to be with sausage.

I never realized
you were Gene Simmons, the rock star.

You look great, Lois.
Anyone nailing you now?

Yes, my husband nails me.

This is him, Peter.

-You... Are... Gods!
-Yeah, thanks, right.

Hey, we're recording some tracks
in Boston next month.

You should come on by.

We'd love that, Chaim.
I mean, Gene, you big rock star.

(CHUCKLING) Bye.

Oh, wow, such a small world.

He was a nice boy. And he's still nice.

Listen, Lois, uh, what I said before...

I've never been more wrong in my life.

You are the coolest girl in the world.

-My wife did Kiss!
-And J. Geils.

-What?
-Nothing.

There it is... The BBC.

(GASPS)

Well, this is it.
I'll say goodbye to you now.

-Well, have a good life, Stewie.
-Oh, I shall.

Oh, hey, I meant to ask you.

Did you ever find out
what that button on my bureau was from?

Oh, yeah, Chris's denim jacket.

Ah. I like that jacket.
It looks good on him.

-Okay, then, so, we'll keep in touch?
-Sure.

Well, I have your address. See you.

(GASPING) Oh, there's Happy Hill!

(GRUNTING) What the deuce?

(GASPING) Pengrove! Pengrove Pig!

Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm.

Oh, my. The Magic Tome!

Well, it's... It's cardboard.

And there are no words. There are just...
What is it you've drawn here?

Oh, that's Oswald Owl
slammin' Mother Maggie

in one of them Chinese baskets.

(LAUGHING) I did well, aye?

(YELLING)

Oh, Mother Maggie, thank God!
Something's terribly wrong!

(IN COCKNEY ACCENT)
Whose stinky brat is this?

Oh... Oh, that's not your voice.

Your voice is lyrical,
like the gentle strum of a lute.

Piss off, you grotty little wanker!

It's a fake.

It's not real.

I thought it would be best for you
to find out on your own, kid.

I feel like such a fool.
Don't even look at me.

Hey, come on.
You want to get some ice cream?

That would make you feel better, right?

You want to get some McDonald's?

You want to take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes?

Okay, let's go take a dump
in Mother Maggie's shoes.

<i>Jolly Farm </i>is on, Stewie.
Don't you want to watch?

Oh, the Stewie who loved <i>Jolly Farm</i>
is dead, Megan.

is that you never know

Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.

Many of you have written to the show

with suggestions
for episodes you'd like to see.

They're mostly god-awful.

(LAUGH TRACK PLAYS)

Well, tonight, we took your advice,

and produced three
of our favorite suggestions.

"Favorites." Oh, that's charitable.

(LAUGH TRACK PLAYS)

-What is that?
-Oh, I got this from Dharma & Greg.

Oh, I'm surprised
there's anything left in it.

I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

Nick actually said, "The antidote."

Oh, my God! A genie!

Hey, uh... Three wishes?

Oh, this is so exciting!

-I want a new hat!
-I want a new hat!

I want them to have new hats.

Kids, these are your father's wishes.

Go ahead, honey, get whatever you want.

Oh, that's easy.

I wish I could see

Great show today, Kelly.

Gellman needs us on stage

Be right there, Reege.
I just have to put on my face.

My goodness, did you see the size
of that dressing room?

Yes, they must really want to keep her.

Your second wish?

I got just the thing.

I wish I had my own theme music.

Done.

I don't hear anything.

Get up. Try it out.

I can't turn it off.

Well, then, I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

I wish I had no bones.

Done.

-(YELLS)
-(ALL GASPING)

That ought to show you.

(LAUGHING)

(ALL SCREAMING)

Oh, no.

I got to fart, but I don't know
which way to lean.

Okay, now, I know
you guys might be a little concerned

about me not having bones and all,

but I got to tell you, it's not that bad.

Dad's just like Silly Putty.

But, Mom, I've got to use
the bathroom now.

Well, I'm sorry,
but your father gets incredibly filthy,

rolling around everywhere.

He just has to take his 12 baths a day.

I don't like Dad anymore.

I invited some friends over
to jump on him like a trampoline,

but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe

and his mom yelled at him
when he got home,

and he beat me up at school the next day.

It's all here in this pamphlet.

Kids, we just have to learn
to accept this.

Like one of those stories on Dateline,

where a family member suffers
a horrible accident,

and becomes a burden on everybody.

Sure, they pretend to be happy,
but they're dead inside.

They're dead.

And that'll be our lives, hmm?

What a big boneless jerk I am.

I might have screwed up my life,

but there's no reason
I got to keep screwing up theirs.

Goodbye, cruel, bone-filled world.

(YELLING)

Oh, so this is where all the waste
and sewage winds up.

(MAN SCREAMING)

-DIRECTOR: Cut, and print.
-(BELL RINGING)

That's a wrap. Great job, Peter.

Are you coming to the wrap party tonight?

Aw, gee, I don't know.

I got a stand-up comedy class
I'm taking at The Learning Annex.

Well, actually,
I won't be a stand-up comic.

I'll be more like an amorphous blob comic.

(LAUGHS) I gotta write that one down!

Nonsense! I'll have the studio
send a flatbed for you.

See you at 8:00.

(SIGHS)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Peter, there's something I've been wanting
to say to you all evening.

What's that,
Mrs. Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglas?

I want to jump your non-bones.

Geez, I can't believe I'm your type.

Well, as you can tell from my husband,

I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.

I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Will you sleep with me?

Oh, yeah, I'm going to have to pass.

But Louie Anderson's eating
the decorative soaps in the bathroom.

Why don't you try him?

Excuse me, aren't you Peter,
the human stunt bag?

Well, that all depends on who's asking.

I'm a doctor about to conduct
an experimental procedure

to give bones to a jellyfish,

but I'd like to try it on a human first.

-Interested?
-Well, I don't know.

-Interested?
-Didn't you just say that?

-Yes.
-I'll do it!

Well, Peter, the operation
was a complete success.

What are you going to do now?

Well, the whole reason I had the operation
was so I could go back to my family.

But it's been so long.

What if they don't love me anymore?

Peter, where do you think
all those bones came from?

ALL: Surprise!

My, God! You mean,
it's your bones that are inside me?

Well, mostly. We picked up a drifter
to fill in the torso.

Well, like I always say,

"A family of freaks is better
than no family at all."

Let's go home.

PETER: You know what's really weird?
This was covered by my HMO.

Hey, Terry, you dare me
to pop a wheelie in this thing?

Well, that doesn't sound safe at all,
but okay, I dare you.

(BRAKES SCREECHING)

BOTH: Woohoo!

Wow, that was great.

-Hey, is the Count a vampire?
-What's that?

Well, he's got those big fangs.

Have they ever shown him doing somebody in
and then feeding on them?

You're asking if they've ever done
a <i>Sesame Street</i>

in which the Count kills somebody
and then sucks their blood for sustenance?

-Yeah.
-No, they've never done that.

Everybody, come quick!
There's something out in the yard!

It looks like the back of a tanker truck.

Wow.

What do you think is inside?

-Maybe it's candy!
-Chris, no!

Lois, Lois. Let him dream.

(GRUNTING)

(ALL YELLING)

Ugh. What is this stuff?

Some kind of nuclear waste.

Tell me, does anyone else feel
a trifle queasy?

(ALL SCREAMING)

What? Do I have a boogie? (GASPS)

I say! It appears
my cranium has doubled in size.

How delightful!

This toxic stew seems to have given me
telekinetic abilities.

(SCREAMING)

Hey, I can make fire!

Hey, Chris, Chris, come here a second.

(LAUGHING) This is going to be hilarious.

Okay, on the count of three.

One, two, three.

(FARTS)

-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Do it again.

-(FARTS)
-(ALL LAUGHING)

All right, everyone.

Clearly, something very strange
has happened here.

We each seem to have acquired superpowers
from that nuclear waste.

We've been given a gift.

And whether that gift
is Chris's fire-conjuring,

Stewie's telekinesis,

Brian's super speed.

Ask me how the Queen of England is.

-How's the Queen of...
-She's great.

Peter's morphing ability...

Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.

(LAUGHING)

My super strength,

or Meg's, um...

Super amazing ability
to grow her fingernails...

(SIGHS)

We have a responsibility
to use these powers properly,

and not to abuse them for personal gain.

-Understand?
-ALL: Yes.

-Mm-hmm.
-Got it.

Oh, no, I forgot the detergent.

Excuse me, would you watch him
for a moment?

Sure thing, ma'am.

Whoa, there, little guy,
you got to pay for that.

Go suck a railroad spike,
I haven't got any money.

Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take it away from you.

(SCREAMS)

Oh, God! Please, help me!

(HORNS HONKING)

-Move it, you slowpoke! The light's green!
-(HONKING)

What does that cloud
look like to you, honey?

To me, it looks like... Rain.

(LAUGHS) I used that joke at work today.

I'm the funniest guy at the office.
They say I should do stand-up.

Ah! This is insane!

(GRUNTS)

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, Dad, 'N Sync is in town.

If you can get me a lock of Justin's hair,

I'll never ask you
for shopping money again.

Please!

Eh, we promised Lois
we'd use our powers responsibly.

But I suppose doing the exact opposite
couldn't hurt.

Hey, do you want to split a Toblerone?

Oh, gosh.

Yeah, I think I do.

Whoo-whoo!

Next stop, my thighs.

All right, Meg, wait here.
I'll be right back.

(IN PETER'S VOICE)
Hi, there. Britney Spears.

You mind if I go in?

Oh, uh, not at all, Miss Spears.

Oh, call me Peter.

Hey, there, fellas.

Britney? What are you doing here?

Oh, you know,
I was just in the neighborhood,

and, uh, I'm going to steal
one of your beers,

and, uh, figured I'd stop by and say hi.

You mind if I have a seat?

(SIGHS)

I am out of shape.

Say, uh, Justin, I got a favor to ask you.

-What is it?
-I got a hole in my car's muffler.

I need something to plug it with.
Can I have some of your hair?

-Um, I guess so.
-Oh, great. Thanks.

All right, hold still now.

(BUZZING)

(SCREAMS)

Ah, you'll be fine.
Hey, come here, give me a kiss.

-(SCREAMS)
-(LAUGHS) I'm Gene Shalit now.

Bye.

-Here's your martini, ma'am.
-Thanks.

Hey, it's gone!

Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one.

What the hell is going on here?

Hi, can I get some pretzels or something?

I... 'Cause, I...
I gotta... I gotta drive.

Whoa, hey, did you bring enough breasts
for the rest of the class?

-(LAUGHING)
-(THUDS)

Hey, Hector,
how long have we known each other?

-Since first grade.
-Yeah, yeah.

You remember that time
you called me Chris Gristle?

-I think so.
-Well, burn for it!

(SCREAMING)

It's a bird, it's a plane,

it's a lower middle-class Irish family.

That's right, Tom.

This is just one
of many public disturbances

caused by the Griffin family of Quahog,

who seem to have acquired superpowers.

Very strange story, Diane.

Coming up next, can bees think?

A new study confirms that no, they cannot.

Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem.

You're damn right we do.
Peter Griffin stole my hair.

Settle down, Jeffrey.

-Justin.
-Mike.

Clearly, the Griffin family
is out of control.

But not to fear.

I've tangled with superbeings before,

and they can be stopped!

You can't stop us, Mayor West!

We are all-powerful!

Clearly, you've let yourselves
become drunk with power.

Silence!

We demand obedience!

Or else!

Is that all you can do?

Ow! That kind of hurt.

Oh, is that bleeding?

No, no, I guess it's all right.
Ouch, though.

Anyone who opposes our demands
will be destroyed.

Our first demand...

You will erect a statue
in the town square.

This statue will depict
Blair Warner admitting to Mrs. Garrett

that the poem she submitted
for her creative writing class

was actually plagiarized
from a work by Emily Dickinson.

We have spoken!

(GROANS)

(SCREAMS)

That's it!
We have to fight fire with fire.

If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers,

it can do the same for me.

Citizens, I'm off to the toxic waste dump.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

-Mayor West, you have lymphoma.
-Oh, my.

Probably from rolling around
in that toxic waste.

I see.

What in God's name
were you trying to prove?

I was trying to gain superpowers.

-Well, that's just silly.
-Silly, yes.

Idiotic, yes.

No, no, that's not what
Mrs. Garrett's bosom looked like.

It looked more like this.

Notice the sun spots
at the top of the right can.

Excuse me. I have a message
from the Quahog Hospital.

Well, I just feel awful
about this, Mayor West.

Yeah, me, too.

Stewie, fluff his pillows.

I'll heat up his soup.

I'll go to China
to see if there's a cure. Nope.

Now, now, the doctor says
I'm going to make a full recovery.

The important thing
is you learned your lesson.

I can't believe we let those superpowers
go to our heads.

-I feel like such a bastard.
-Me, too.

Well, for now, we are gonna use our powers
to help you get better.

Thank you.

But as long as I have
Mrs. Garrett's giant rack by my bedside,

I'll be all right.

Girls! Girls! Girls!

(LAUGHING)

Hear ye, hear ye!

I call to order the first meeting
of the "We Hate Broads Club."

ALL: Yeah!

'Cause all you need in life
is your best pals.

Sure, as long as those pals ain't dames.

O-tay!

-(CREAKING)
-What was that?

Hey! I thought we told you guys
to quit snooping around here.

But we need to find a story

if I'm ever going to be
a big-time reporter man.

All right, all right.

Make like Siamese twins and split.

And... And then one of you die.

Boys and girls, we have a new student
joining us this morning.

Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.

-Ugh, just what we need, another girl.
-You said it!

Wow! I'd like to play doctor with her.

And... And remove her inflamed appendix

before it bursts, causing sepsis.

Giggedy, giggedy, giggedy!

-Lois, what you reading?
<i>-The Red Badge of Courage.</i>

(SIGHS)

like the guy in this book.

You know, uh, I'm a brave guy, Lois.

Oh, yeah? I bet you're not brave enough
to laugh at death.

Watch me! (LAUGHING)

Oh, thanks.

Like I don't have
enough trouble fitting in.

I bet you're not brave enough
to take all your clothes off.

Way ahead of you. Ow!

Well, I bet you're too chicken

to spend the night
at the old Selberg place.

PETER: Uh, Cleveland,
you mind stepping out of the way?

Oh, sorry.

Well, I ain't chicken
to spend the night there!

Well, I ain't neither,

and to prove it,
I'm going up there tonight!

See you there, pal!

You can't stay in that house.

Old Man Selberg's ghost still haunts it.

Not to mention the myriad
of bacteria and allergens

from years of substandard housekeeping.

It does not augur well for you.

Ah, zip it, egghead.

You with your big words and your...

And your... Your small, difficult words.

Wow. Any boy who would spend the night
in that creepy place

sure would be the bravest fella
I ever met.

That Lois is some kind of woman.

Yeah. Just thinking about her
makes my testicles want to drop.

Oop, speak of the devil.

Oop, make that devils.

All right, Quagmire's team
will take the left side of the house,

and Peter's team will take the right.

And whoever's alive in the morning

It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.

(WOLF HOWLING)

What was that?

Ah. It's just Michael Winslow

This house gives me the creeps.

Yeah, let's get out of here.

Wait, wait, wait.
We can't let those guys win.

What we ought to do
is pretend we're ghosts, see?

And then we'll scare the other guys
out of the house.

-Then we can say we spent...
-The...

Night, and everyone'll think that we're...

-The...
-Bravest kids in the world.

Especially Lois. (LAUGHING)

All right!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(CHUCKLES)

Hey, I got a great idea!

This will really scare 'em. Everybody set?

-Check.
-Check.

(GIGGLING) Sock it to me!

-Whoa!

but their innards are made of children!

Peter, it's us.

(GHOSTLY HOWL)

Yeah. That's really scary.

Wait a second.

If you're there, and I'm here,

and Istanbul is somewhere
in this general area,

then who the hell is that?

(ALL SCREAMING)

Ha! Get used to this sight, Diane,

guys running away from you.

Tom, you're so deep in the closet,

you're finding Christmas presents.

All right, now, remember our story.

We tell Lois
that we both stayed all night,

and I caught the ghost with my lasso.

Yeah, yeah. And I punched him so hard,

he ran, crying, all the way back to Hell!

She'll have to believe that.

It hangs together so perfectly.

DIANE: Our top story today,

cowardly kids lay down rubber
at the old Selberg place.

Wait, wait, turn that up.

Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire
were seen bolting...

(YELLING) Were seen bolting
out of the supposedly haunted house

after just one half-hour,

leaving only their pride
and twin trails of urine behind them.

Ah, cheese and crackers!

Now Lois will know everything!

Not if I can help it.

-Hello, this is Peter Griffin.

You better stop saying that stuff,

or we're going to watch something else.

(LISPING) "Cooties, the silent killer."

Uh, Lois? There's something
we got to tell you.

Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house.

We're not brave.

Oh, I decided I don't care about bravery.

BOTH: You don't?

No. I realized
what I really like is smarts.

Sorry, I'm late, darling.

I was checking my stool for blood.

BOTH: Mort Goldman?

He's so clever. Show 'em, Morty.

(GHOST HOWLING)

(BOTH SCREAM)

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

He got us again.

Yeah, this whole thing just shows
that women are nothing but trouble.

You said it!

Let's you and me swear off 'em for good!

And how!

I say, Quagmire, it seems to me

we've each made another $500 million.

Good thing we swore off women,

so we wouldn't be distracted

and unable to accumulate
this vast amount of wealth.

Yes. Hey, you watch the ticker.

I'm going to go microwave a bagel

Hello, sir.

Enough with the foreplay, sir.

Now what are you selling?

Well, I was going to try
to sell you some handsome cream,

but I can see
you already bought out the store.

Go on.

So, perhaps, you'd be interested
in something

every homeowner cannot be without...

Volcano insurance.

Go on.

According to my uncle,

who's a real whiz with volcanoes,

a volcano is coming this way.

PETER: <i>Hmm I, too,</i><i>have an uncle.</i>

Come in.

How much is this volcano insurance?

I... I don't know.

Uh, let's say $200.

$200? That's more than I spent
on all that handsome cream.

I don't have that kind of money.

What about that jar of money?

No way, that's Lois's rainy-day fund.

Ah, come on.

It never rains in Rhode Island.

Well, yeah, but I'm pretty sure
we've never had a volcano either.

Well, don't you think
we're overdue for one?

Touche, salesman.

(STEWIE SNORING)

Oh! What the hell are you doing?

Watching you sleep, cutie-pie.

Why, you sick, sick little moo cow.

You shall watch no more!

-Stewie!
-My glasses!

I can't see a thing without my glasses.

Why won't you let me get laser surgery?

Because I just don't think it's safe.

Okay, I just need to make
a quick incision here,

Luke, use the force.

Really? 'Cause I was just going to...

You will use the force.

Okay.

Are you happy?

I've never been happy.

Oh, don't worry, honey,
we'll get you a new pair tomorrow.

Yes, and in the meantime,

Peter, did you take the money
from the family jar?

Who, me? Yes, me.
Couldn't be. Then who?

Yeah, I did it.

I bought us volcano insurance.

Volcano insurance. That's ridiculous!

That's the same thing you said

when you talked me out
of getting that cloud insurance.

Look at them up there.

Just plotting... Picking their moment.

So, Bill, we attack tomorrow.

Yes. Tomorrow.

I mean it this time.

I do, too.

Peter, that was our emergency money,

and your daughter just so happens
to need a new pair of glasses.

Lois, no one really needs glasses.

You wear glasses.

That's only to fool the man
from the draft board.

I can't believe
you squandered that money.

I swear, sometimes, I feel
like I'm married to a child.

What can I say
about my beautiful bride,

except milk, milk, lemonade,

around the corner, fudge is made.

(GOOFY LAUGH)

You better watch
who you're calling a child, Lois,

because if I'm a child,

then you know what that makes you?

A pedophile. And I'll be damned
if I'm going to stand here

and be lectured by a pervert.

Can you believe it, Cleveland?

Lois thinks I'm bad with money.

She's got a point, Peter.

You're the white version of a black guy
who's not good with his money.

Hey, guys and dolls,

drinks are on do-re-me! (LAUGHS)

Whoa, where'd you get that?

This loot's thanks to my stockbroker,

Ian Greenstein.

He made some smart investments
that really paid off.

That guy is to money what Miss Ann-Margret

is to... (IMITATES BED CREAKING)

Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire.

My accountant, Larry Rosenblatt,
just got me a huge tax refund,

and tickets to
<i>Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk.</i>

The noise was good,

but I thought they phoned in
a lot of the funk.

Wait a second.
Rosenblatt? Greenstein?

So, you're saying I need
a Jewish guy to handle my money.

Peter, not every Jewish person
is good with money.

Well, yeah, I guess not the retarded ones,

but why would you even say that?
For shock value?

Shesh, Cleveland, there's edgy
and there's offensive.

Good day, sir.

Mother, you know how I hate
asking for money, but...

Mother, Peter's an excellent provider.

No, Mother, I do not think
I'd be better off married to a chimp.

I don't care how well that chimp
across the street is doing.

Really? Well, yeah, okay.

I guess you can tell him I said hi.

But don't make me sound desperate.

I got to get a Greenstein or a Rosenblatt
of my very own.

I can get your money back.

Max, Max, Max.

Let's not deny our heritages.

You're Jewish. You're good with money.

I'm Irish. I drink and I ban homosexuals

Now help me get my money back.

Oh. It's you.

Um... I'm not in right now.

Look, sir, I have reviewed this contract,
and it offers no coverage at all.

It just says "volcano insurance"
over and over again.

And down here in small print it, says,

"He's signing it, he's signing it,
I can't believe it."

-So?
-So, just refund this man's money,

and we'll be on our way.

I don't have your money.

No way.

He's Jewish.

Oh, my, how exotic.

Thank you?

See? Here's your rainy-day money,

and I balanced our checkbook, too.

(LOONEY TUNES SOUND EFFECT PLAYS)

You balanced our checkbook?

Yep. Isn't that right, Max?

Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure.
He did it.

Well, I'm going to go
call my mother right now,

and tell her to tell that chimp
across the street.

(IMITATING MONKEY SCREECHING)

Oh, look how low I've sunk.

a smart Jewish person did.

-Oh, that's okay, Peter.
-No, no, no.

for too damn long.

It is the white devil
that has propogated, exacerbated,

Instigated our hatred like a Buick.

This is so degrading. It's...

This is worse than the time I was

fell out of my pants.

Lois, I appreciate
the marshmallow and fish casserole,

but, I'm sorry, I... I can't eat this.

Oh, because it's not kosher.

Yeah, let's go with that.

Can Stewie and me be excused?

He's going to help me
with my math homework.

Chris, he's just a baby.

Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar?

Where was it you graduated from,
again? Hmm?

The University of Duh?

I can help you with your homework, son.

Oh, my God, is there nothing
you people can't do?

I mean, you know, other than manual labor?

Peter, what a ridiculous thing to say.

They built the pyramids.

You'll have to excuse Peter.

He can be a little tactless sometimes.

Yes, like the time he soiled himself
at that dinner party?

I was so sorry to hear
that your father passed away.

Yes, it spread through his body so fast,

but he's at peace now, and a whole...

Uh-oh.

Ah... Well, there's only one thing
that will top a great dinner like that.

Operation.

-May I play?
-Mom?

-Mom?
-Mom?

Thank you, but I can't stay.
It's Friday night.

I've got to go to temple.

Temple? Ah, like Indiana Jones?

Will you just pick it up already?

Look, they'd better not
be expecting us to give money,

because I already gave
at Church last Sunday,

and I'm pretty sure
it all goes to the same God.

Peter! Max, it was nice of you
to invite us along.

Your husband's got a good heart, Lois,

but his views on Judaism
are a little misguided.

I'd consider it a mitzvah
to educate him a little.

No, no, no. No.
I don't think so.

It is not that I have
ideological differences.

I'm just not a hat person.

Hey, look. I didn't know
the principal of Meg's school was Jewish.

Hey, there's Bill Nye, the science guy,
and half of Lenny Kravitz.

Optimus Prime?

He's Jewish?

Aw, jeez, Max, I...

I don't know about this.

I went to Catholic school.

I'm not sure this is allowed.

Aw, what the hell.

Oh, dear.

Sister Mary Joseph, it appears
Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.

Excellent, excellent.

Hello.

Oh, we're not Jewish.

But I hear you people
have such lovely services.

Oh, my God,
I didn't mean "you people."

I didn't mean, "Oh, my God" either.

I know he's your God, too.

-I... Sorry.
-(SHUSHES)

And on this day, the Sabbath,
we gather here to...

Uh-oh!

That was so nice.

A good sermon,

and such beautiful songs.

Yeah, it was just like
that other Jewish musical we saw.

(BOUNCY VIOLIN MUSIC)

A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no?

But here,
in our little village of Anatevka,

you might say each one of us...

Card!

Card!

Well, there's my cab.
It was nice meeting all of you.

Aw, thanks for everything, buddy.

Wait, Mr. Weinstein.

I thought you were going to help me
with my homework.

I'm sorry, son. I have to go, but I'm...

I'm sure you'll do just fine.

I don't know, Max.

The kid's not exactly
an honor-roll student.

Watch.

-Hey.
-He did it.

See?

Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner,
came to temple with me.

You're a nice family.

I have faith that Chris will grow up
to be a real mensch.

You... Ow! Ow! Dad! Dad!

Lois, I just figured out

how to make sure Chris
becomes a big success.

Please tell me this doesn't have
anything to do with Tony Robbins.

Oh, no. I learned my lesson.

Could you sign this book, please?

Tony Robbins hungry.

No, Lois, I'm going to make Chris Jewish.

What are you talking about?

He thinks if Chris is Jewish,
he'll become smart.

Peter, you can't convert someone,

because you think it'll help their grades.

Now, I don't want to hear
another word about this.

Where we going?

Son, it's too late for me
and Meg's a girl,

but for you, the sky's the limit.

We're going to take you to that synagogue
and turn you Jewish.

Okay!

Chris, duck.

(SIGHS)

Mr. Griffin, I still don't understand.

Why exactly does your son
want to join the Jewish faith?

I don't know. He's bi-curious.

I appreciate your interest,

but Judaism takes a serious commitment.

Elliot, here,

has spent years preparing
for his bar mitzvah this Saturday.

A bar mitzvah. Perfect.

How much for one of those?

You can't just buy a bar mitzvah.

It requires a lot of study.

Well, can't we skip that part?

I mean, come on,
if Chris knew how to study,

he wouldn't need to become Jewish,
in the first place, right?

Right?

Right?

Don't worry, dad.

I don't need a bar mitzvah.

I'm okay just the way I...

Ow, ow, ow!

Now, we got no time to lose.

There's got to be some place in America

where you can take
a solemn spiritual ceremony

that begins a lifetime commitment,

and blow through it in about 20 minutes.

All right, dad!

So, how do I look in my new glasses?

How shall I put this?

In an attic somewhere,

there's a portrait of you
getting prettier.

Wow. Someone needs a nap.

After lunch, it's straight to bed, Stewie.

(GROANS) This isn't the first time
my wit has gone unappreciated.

And in the comedy competition,

Stewie Griffin receives
three and a half stars.

Challenger Sinbad receives four stars.

We have a new champion, Sinbad!

Stewie, any parting words?

Um, you know, I got beat,
pure and simple.

You... You are a very funny man.

"Men be acting all like zombies
at the mall."

God, ain't that the truth?

Where's your father and Chris?

It's not like them to be late for lunch.

I think they left a note.

(SNICKERING)

Brian, what do you know about this?

Nothing.

I know when you're lying to me, Brian.

No, no, I swear.

Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

What... What are you...
What are you doing?

Oh, you don't know that, either.

Last chance, Brian.

I've got a bar mitzvah to stop.

No problem. Let me grab my keys.

Aw, Chris, in a few minutes,

you'll become a smart,
successful Jewish man.

I could make a foreskin joke right now,

but this is a solemn occasion.

And besides,
there'll be plenty of time for that

on the ride back.

Aw, I got so many of 'em, too.

I know, I know.
Shh, shh, shh! But later...

(READING IN HEBREW)

Chris!

Chris!

Stop this travesty right now!

So, bar mitzvahs are travesties, huh?

No, my son getting bar mitzvahed
is a travesty.

He's doing it for all the wrong reasons.

Well, lookie here, Herschel.

We got us one of them self-hating Jews.

Nothing I hate worse than a Jew

who doesn't appreciate
her own rich heritage.

Come on, Mordecai, let's get her!

(CROWD CLAMORING)

I'm sorry, Lois.

I just wanted our son to be Jewish
so he'd be smarter.

Then maybe his wife wouldn't be sorry
she didn't marry the chimp next door.

Oh, Peter...

Just because Steven
makes more money than you

doesn't mean he's any smarter.

And I think Chris will do just fine.

How do you know that?

Because I have faith in him,

the way I have faith in you.

Besides, a person's religion
is no guarantee of success.

I see what you're saying.

The Jewish are just like us.

No better, no worse.

Yeah, and as they say,
<i>"Zo zion, mit glick."</i>

What?

I think what he's trying to say
is everything's gonna be okay.
