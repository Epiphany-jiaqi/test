The Internet affords anonymity to its users, a blessing (to privacy) and freedom (of speech). 
互联网为其用户提供了匿名性，是（隐私）和（言论自由）的福音。 
But that very anonymity is [also] behind the explosion (of cyber-crime (that has 1 [across the Web])).
但这种匿名性[也]是（网络犯罪（有1个[跨网络]））爆炸的背后。

Can privacy be preserved 2 bringing safety and security to a world (that seems [increasingly] 3)?
能否保留隐私2给这个世界带来安全和保障（似乎[越来越多]3）？

[Last month], Howard Schmidt, <the nation's cyber-czar>, offered the federal government a 4 to make the Web a safer place -- || a "voluntary trusted identity" system (that would be the high-tech 5 (of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card),) all rolled 6 one.
[上个月]，霍华德-施密特（Howard Schmidt），<国家的网络警察>，为联邦政府提供了一个使网络更安全的地方--|"自愿可信的身份 "系统（这将是高科技的（物理钥匙、指纹和身份证照片），）都卷在一起。
(safer 为 safe 的比较级形式)
The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential 7 [to a specific computer], and would authenticate users [at a range (of online services)].
该系统可能使用一个智能身份证，或一个数字证书7[到一个特定的计算机]，并将验证用户[在一系列（在线服务）]。

The idea is to [8 a] federation (of private online identity systems). Users could 9 which system to join, and only registered users (whose identities have been authenticated) could navigate those systems. 
这个想法是[8]一个（私人在线身份系统的）联盟。用户可以9加入哪个系统，而且只有注册用户（其身份已被验证）可以浏览这些系统。 
The approach contrasts with one (that would require an Internet driver's license 10 [by the government]).
该方法与一个（需要互联网驾驶执照10[由政府]）形成对比。

Google and Microsoft are among companies (that already have these "single sign-on" systems (that make it possible [for users] [to 11]) [just once]) but use many different services. 
谷歌和微软等公司（已经拥有这些 "单点登录 "系统（使其有可能[为用户][11]）[只需一次]），但使用许多不同的服务。 
12,the approach would create a "walled garden" [in cyberspace], [with safe "neighborhoods" and bright "streetlights"] to establish a sense (of a 13 community).
12,该方法将创建一个[网络空间]的 "围墙花园"，[有安全的 "社区 "和明亮的 "路灯"]，以建立一种（社区的）感觉。

Mr. Schmidt described it as a "voluntary ecosystem" (in which "individuals and organizations can complete online transactions [with 14]), trusting the identities (of each other) and the identities (of the infrastructure 15 (which the transaction runs))."
施密特先生将其描述为一个 "自愿的生态系统"（其中 "个人和组织可以完成在线交易[与14]），信任（对方的）身份和（基础设施15（交易运行）的身份）"。

[Still], the administration's plan has 16 privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are concerned. 
[不过，政府的计划有16位隐私权活动家。一些人对这一做法表示赞赏；其他人则表示担忧。 
It seems clear | that such a scheme is an initiative push [toward {what would}] 17 be a compulsory Internet "driver's license" mentality.
似乎很清楚，这样的计划是一种主动推动[走向[什么会]]17的强制性互联网 "驾照 "心态。
(has 为 have 的第三人称单数形式。)

The plan has [also] been greeted with 18 [by some computer security experts, (who worry | that the "voluntary ecosystem" envisioned [by Mr. Schmidt] would [still] leave much (of the Internet 19))]. 
该计划[也]受到了一些计算机安全专家的欢迎，他们担心[施密特先生]设想的 "自愿生态系统"[仍然]会留下许多（互联网的19）]。 
They argue | that all Internet users should be 20 to register and identify themselves, [in the same way (that drivers must be licensed to drive [on public roads])].
他们认为，所有的互联网用户都应该注册并确定自己的身份，[就像（司机必须获得许可才能[在公共道路上]开车一样]。

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs's board [as an outside director] [in January 2000]; [a year later] she became president (of Brown University).
露丝-西蒙斯[作为外部董事][于2000年1月]加入高盛董事会；[一年后]她成为（布朗大学的）校长。
[For the rest (of the decade)] she apparently managed both roles [without attracting much criticism].
[在（这十年的）剩余时间里]她显然同时扮演了这两个角色[没有招致很多批评]。
But [by the end (of 2009 Ms. Simmons)] was under fire [for having sat on Goldman's compensation committee]; how could she have let Those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked?
但[到了（2009年）年底，西蒙斯女士]因[在高盛的薪酬委员会任职]而受到抨击；她怎么可能让那些巨额奖金的发放不受关注？
[By February] [the next year] Ms. Simmons had left the board.
[到[第二年]2月，西蒙斯女士已经离开了董事会。
(left 为 leave 的过去分词。)
The position was [just]只是 taking up too much time, || she said.
这个职位[只是]只是 ，占用了太多的时间，|她说。
(said 为 say 的过去式。)

Outside directors are supposed to serve [as helpful, yet less biased, advisers] [on a firm's board].
外部董事应该[在公司的董事会中][作为有帮助的、但不那么有偏见的顾问]发挥作用。
[Having made their wealth and their reputations [elsewhere]], they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive's proposals.
[在[其他地方]赚取了财富和声誉之后，他们大概有足够的独立性来不同意首席执行官的提议。
If the sky, and the share price, is falling, || outside directors should be able to give advice (based on having weathered their own crises).
如果天空和股价都在下跌，外部董事应该能够提供建议（基于经历过他们自己的危机）。

The researchers (from Ohio University) used a database (that covered [more than] 10,000 firms and [more than] 64,000 different directors [between 1989 and 2004]).
研究人员（来自俄亥俄大学）使用了一个数据库（涵盖[超过]10,000家公司和[超过]64,000名不同的董事[在1989年至2004年期间]）。
[Then] they simply checked | which directors stayed [from one proxy statement to the next].
[然后，他们简单地检查了哪些董事[从一份代理声明到下一份]留下来。］
The most likely reason (for departing a board) was age, || so the researchers concentrated on those "surprise" disappearances [by directors] [under the age (of 70)].
最有可能的（离开董事会的）原因是年龄，所以研究人员集中关注那些[70岁以下的][董事]的 "意外 "失踪。
They found | that [after a surprise departure], the probability (that the company will [subsequently] have to restate earnings) increases by nearly 20%.
他们发现，[在意外离职后]，（公司[随后]必须重报盈利）的概率增加了近20%。
(found 为 find 的过去式。)
The likelihood (of being named [in a federal class-action lawsuit]) also increases, || and the stock is likely to perform [worse].
被列入[联邦集体诉讼]的可能性也会增加，||而且股票的表现可能会[更差]。
(worse 为 badly 的比较级形式)
The effect tended to be larger [for larger firms].
这种影响倾向于更大[对较大的公司]。
(larger 为 large 的比较级形式)

Although a correlation (between them leaving and subsequent bad performance (at the firm)) is suggestive, || it does not mean | that such directors are [always] jumping off a sinking ship.
虽然（他们的离开和随后的不良表现（在公司）之间）有一定的关联性，但这并不意味着这些董事[总是]跳下沉船。
[Often] they "trade up," leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.
[通常情况下，他们会 "向上交易"，离开风险较高、规模较小的公司，转而选择规模更大、更稳定的公司。
(riskier 为 risky 的比较级形式, smaller 为 small 的比较级形式, larger 为 large 的比较级形式)

But the researchers believe | that outside directors have an easier time (of avoiding a blow [to their reputations]) || if they leave a firm || before bad news breaks, || even if a review (of history) shows | that they were on the board [at the time (any wrongdoing occurred)].
但研究人员认为，如果外部董事在坏消息传出之前离开公司，他们会更容易（避免[对其声誉]的打击）||即使审查（历史）显示|他们[在（任何不法行为发生时）]是董事会成员。
Firms (who want to keep their outside directors [through tough times]) may have to create incentives.
公司（想留住他们的外部董事[度过艰难时期]）可能必须建立激励机制。
Otherwise outside directors will follow the example (of Ms.Simmons), once again very popular on campus.
否则，外部董事将效仿（西蒙斯女士），再次在校园里非常受欢迎。

Text 3

We tend to think of the decades [immediately] following World War Ⅱ [as a time (of prosperity and growth)], [with soldiers returning [home] [by the millions], going off [to college] [on the G.I. Bill] and lining up [at the marriage bureaus]].
我们倾向于认为第二次世界大战后的几十年[紧接着]是一个（繁荣和增长的）时期，[士兵们[数以百万计]返回[家]，[靠G.I法案]去[上大学]，并[在婚姻局]排队。


But when it came to their houses, || it was a time (of common sense) and a belief (that less could truly be more).
但当涉及到他们的房子时，这是一个（常识）和一个信念（少即是多）的时代。

[During the Depression and the war], Americans had learned to live [with less], || and that restraint, <in combination (with the postwar confidence (in the future))>, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.
[在大萧条和战争期间，美国人学会了[少花钱]的生活方式，而这种克制，<与战后的信心（对未来）>相结合，使小而有效的住房成为积极的时尚。
(made 为 make 的过去式。) 


Economic condition was [only] a stimulus [for the trend (toward efficient living)].
经济状况[只是]刺激了[（走向高效生活）的趋势]。

The phrase "[less] is more" was [actually] [first] popularized [by a German], || the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, (who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school (of design)), emigrated to the United States [before World War Ⅱ] and took up posts [at American architecture schools].
少即是多 "这句话[实际上]是[首先]由一个德国人推广的，|建筑师路德维希-密斯-凡-德-罗，（他和其他与包豪斯这个学校（设计）有关的人一样），在[第二次世界大战前]移民到美国，并在[美国建筑学校]任职。
(took 为 take 的过去式。) 

These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course (of American architecture), but none more so than Mies.
这些设计师对（美国建筑）的进程产生了巨大的影响，但没有人比密斯更有影响力。
(came 为 come 的过去式。)


Mies's signature phrase means | that less decoration, <properly organized>, has more impact [than a lot].
密斯的标志性短语的意思是，较少的装饰，<适当的组织>，具有更多的影响[比很多]。
(has 为 have 的第三人称单数形式。) 

Elegance, <he believed>, did not derive from abundance.
优雅，<他认为>，并不来自于富足。


[Like other modern architects], he employed metal, glass and laminated wood -- materials (that we take for granted [today]) but (that [in the 1940s] symbolized the future).
[与其他现代建筑师一样]，他采用了金属、玻璃和层压木材--（我们[今天]认为理所当然的）但（在1940年代）象征着未来的材料。

Mies's sophisticated presentation masked the fact (that the spaces (he designed) were small and efficient), [rather than big and often empty].
密斯复杂的表述掩盖了（（他设计的）空间小而有效）的事实，[而不是大而空]。


The apartments (in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, <for example>,) were smaller--two-bedroom units (under 1,000 square feet)--than those (in their older) neighbors along the city's Gold Coast.
这些公寓（在密斯在芝加哥湖滨大道上建造的优雅的塔楼中，<例如>，）比城市黄金海岸的那些（老旧的）邻居的公寓要小--两居室单位（低于1,000平方尺）。
(built 为 build 的过去分词。feet 为 foot 的复数形式。smaller 为 small 的比较级形式, older 为 old 的比较级形式) 

But they were popular [because of their airy glass walls, the views (they afforded) and the elegance (of the buildings' details and proportions)], the architectural equivalent (of the abstract art (so popular) (at the time)).
但它们很受欢迎[因为它们有通风的玻璃墙，（它们提供的）景色和（建筑的细节和比例）的优雅]，相当于（当时）抽象艺术（如此流行）的建筑。


The trend (toward "less") was not entirely foreign.
这种趋势（走向 "少"）并不完全是外来的。

[In the 1930s] Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses -- [usually] [around 1,200 square feet] --[than the spreading two-story ones (he had designed [in the 1890s and the early 20th century])].
[20世纪30年代]弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特开始建造更加适度和高效的房屋--[通常][1200平方英尺左右]--[比起（他[在19世纪90年代和20世纪初]设计的）蔓延的两层楼的房屋]。
(feet 为 foot 的复数形式。)


The "Case Study Houses" commissioned [from talented modern architects] [by California Arts & Architecture magazine] [between 1945 and 1962] were yet another homegrown influence [on the "[less] is more" trend].
由《加利福尼亚艺术与建筑》杂志[在1945年至1962年期间]委托[有才华的现代建筑师]建造的 "案例研究房屋 "是["少即是多 "趋势的又一本土影响。

Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing.
审美效果来自于景观、新材料和直截了当的细节设计。
(came 为 come 的过去式。) 
[In his Case Study House], Ralph Rapson may have mispredicted | just how the mechanical revolution would impact everyday life -- || few American families acquired helicopters, || though most eventually got clothes dryers -- || but his belief (that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable) was [widely] shared.
[在他的 "案例研究之家 "中，拉尔夫-拉普森可能错误地预测了机械革命对日常生活的影响--很少有美国家庭购买直升机，尽管大多数家庭最终都有了干衣机--但他的信念（自给自足是理想的，也是不可避免的）得到了广泛认同。
(got 为 get 的过去式。)

以[法国]为首的 "南方 "阵营想要一些东西（不同）。"欧洲经济政府"（在（欧元区成员的）内部核心中）。

[Translated], that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system (of redistribution) [from richer to poorer members], [via cheaper borrowing] [for governments] [through common Eurobonds] or complete fiscal transfers.
[翻译]，这意味着政治家干预货币政策和一个系统（重新分配）[从较富裕的成员到较贫穷的成员]，[通过更便宜的借款][为政府][通过共同欧洲债券]或完全的财政转移。
(richer 为 rich 的比较级形式, poorer 为 poor 的比较级形式, cheaper 为 cheap 的比较级形式)

现在注销[欧盟]是[为时过早]。

It remains the world's largest trading block.

(largest 为 large 的最高级形式)

领先的医生们（今天）在[关于政府在促进公共健康方面的作用][的辩论中]进行了权衡，[要求]部长们对不健康的食物征收 "脂肪税"，并向儿童提出香烟式的警告[关于不良饮食的危险]]。

他[还]批评了名厨杰米-奥利弗[在英国]改善学校午餐的高调尝试[作为一个例子（说明 "说教 "人们并不是改变他们行为的最佳方式}）]。


Stephenson suggested | potential restrictions could include banning TV advertisements [for foods] [high in fat, salt or sugar] [before 9 pm] and limiting them [on billboards] or in cinemas. "If we were really bold, || we might even begin to think of high-calorie fast food [in the same way (as cigarettes)] -- [by setting strict limits [on advertising, product placement and sponsorship (of sports events)]]," he said.
斯蒂芬森建议，潜在的限制措施可以包括禁止[高脂肪、高盐或高糖][在晚上9点之前]的电视广告，并限制它们[在广告牌上]或在电影院里。"他说："如果我们真的很大胆，我们甚至可以开始考虑高热量的快餐[以同样的方式（香烟）]--[通过对[广告、产品投放和（体育赛事）赞助]进行严格限制。


Such a move could affect firms (such as McDonald's, (which sponsors the youth coaching scheme run [by the Football Association])). 
此举可能会影响到公司（如麦当劳，（它赞助了[足球协会]实施的青年教练计划））。 

Fast-food chains should also stop offering "inducements" (such as toys, cute animals and mobile phone credit) to lure young customers, || Stephenson said.

"如果让孩子们了解（食物对[他们的成长]的影响），以及（有些东西会造成伤害），|[至少]信息可以[提前]获得。"

Section Ⅱ Reading Comprehension
Part A Directions: Read the following four texts. Answer the questions [after each text] [by choosing A, B, C or D]. Mark your answers on the ANSWER | SHEET.(40 points)

Text 1
Homework has [never] been terribly popular with students and [even] many parents, || but [in recent years] it has been [particularly] scorned. School districts (across the country, <most recently Los Angeles Unified>,) are revising their thinking [on this educational ritual].
[Unfortunately], L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy (which mandates | that [with the exception (of some advanced courses)], homework may [no longer] count for more than 10% (of a student's academic grade)).

This rule is meant to address the difficulty (that students (from impoverished or chaotic homes) might have [in completing their homework]). 
But the policy is unclear and contradictory. 
Certainly, no homework should be assigned | that students cannot complete on their own or that they cannot do [without expensive equipment].
But if the district is [essentially] giving a pass to students (who do not do their homework [because of complicated family lives]), || it is going [riskily] close [to the implication (that standards need to be lowered [for poor children])].

District administrators say | that homework will [still] be a part (of schooling); teachers are allowed to assign as much (of it) || as they want. 
But [with homework counting for no more than 10% (of their grades)], students can easily skip half their homework and see very little difference [on their report cards].
Some students might do [well] [on state tests] [without completing their homework], || but what about the students (who performed [well] [on the tests] and did their homework)? 
It is quite possible | that the homework helped. 
Yet [rather than empowering teachers to find | what works [best] for their students], the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.
(best 为 well 的最高级形式)

[At the same time], the policy addresses none (of the truly thorny questions (about homework)). 
If the district finds homework to be unimportant [to its students' academic achievement], it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. 
[Conversely], if homework matters, || it should account for a significant portion (of the grade).
[Meanwhile], this policy does nothing to ensure | that the homework (students receive) is meaningful or appropriate [to their age and the subject], or | that teachers are not assigning more || than they are willing to review and correct.

The homework rules should be put on hold || while the school board, (which is responsible for setting educational policy), looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework [right].
(put 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。)
21. It is implied [in Paragraph 1] | that [nowadays] homework. 
(A) is receiving more criticism 
(B) is gaining more preferences 
(C) is [no longer] | an educational ritual 
(D) is not required [for advanced courses]
22. L.A. Unified has made the rule [about homework] [mainly] || because poor students. 
(A) tend to have moderate expectations [for their education] 
(B) have asked for a different educational standard 
(C) may have problems finishing their homework 
(D) have voiced their complaints [about homework]
23. [According to Paragraph 3], one problem (with the policy) is | that it may. 
(A) result in students' indifference [to their report cards] 
(B) undermine the authority (of state tests) 
(C) restrict teachers' power [in education] 
(D) discourage students from doing homework
24. As mentioned [in Paragraph 4], || a key question (unanswered) (about homework) is | whether. 
(A) it should be eliminated 
(B) it counts [much] in schooling 
(C) (it places extra burdens on teachers 
(D) (it is important for grades))
25. A suitable title (for this text) could be. 
(A) A Faulty Approach (to Homework) 
(B) A Welcomed Policy [for Poor Students] 
(C) Thorny Questions [about Homework] 
(D) Wrong Interpretations (of an Educational Policy)

Pretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed [with the colour], || yet it is pervasive [in our young girls' lives]. It is not | that pink is intrinsically bad, || but it is such a tiny slice (of the rainbow) || and, <though it may celebrate girlhood [in one way]>, it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girls' identity [to appearance].
(women 为 woman 的复数形式。lives 为 life 的复数形式。)
[Then] it presents that connection, [even among twoyear-olds], [between girls] [as not only innocent] but as evidence (of innocence). [Looking around], I despaired [at the singular lack (of imagination)] [about girls' lives and interests].
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。)

Girls' attraction (to pink) may seem unavoidable, <somehow encoded in their DNA>, || but [according to Jo Paoletti, <an associate professor (of American Studies)>], it is not. Children were not colour-coded [at all] [until the early 20th century]: [in the era] before domestic washing machines || all babies wore white [as a practical matter], || since the only way (of getting clothes [clean]) was to boil them.
(wore 为 wear 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。)
[What's more], both boys and girls wore | what were thought of [as gender-neutral dresses]. 
When nursery colours were introduced, || pink was [actually] considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version (of red, (which was associated with strength)). 
Blue, <with its intimations (of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness)>, symbolised femininity.
(wore 为 wear 的过去式。thought 为 think 的过去分词。)
It was not || until the mid-1980s, <when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children's marketing strategy>, (that pink) fully came into its own, || when it began to seem inherently attractive [to girls], part (of {what defined them [as female]}), || [at least] for the first few critical years.
(became 为 become 的过去式。came 为 come 的过去式。began 为 begin 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。)

I had not realised | how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception (of {what is natural}) to kids, including our core beliefs (about their psychological development). 
Take the toddler. I assumed | that phase was something (experts developed [after years (of research)] [into children's behaviour]): wrong.
Turns out, [according to Daniel Cook, <a historian (of childhood consumerism)>], it was popularised [as a marketing trick] [by clothing manufacturers] [in the 1930s].

Trade publications counselled department stores | that, <in order to increase sales>, they should create a "third stepping stone" [between infant wear and older kids' clothes]. 
It was [only] after "toddler" became a common shoppers' term | that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage.
(became 为 become 的过去式。older 为 old 的比较级形式)
Splitting kids, or adults, [into ever-tinier categories] has proved a surefire way to boost profits. 
And one (of the easiest ways to segment a market) is to magnify gender differences -- || or invent them || where they did not [previously] exist.
(proved 为 prove 的过去分词。easiest 为 easy 的最高级形式)
26. By saying "| it is... the rainbow" (Para.1) , the author means pink. 
(A) cannot explain girls' lack (of imagination) 
(B) should not be associated with girls' innocence 
(C) should not be | the sole representation (of girlhood) 
(D) cannot influence girls' lives and interests
27. [According to Paragraph 2], which of the following is true of colours? 
(A) Colours are encoded [in girls' DNA]. 
(B) Blue used to be regarded as the colour [for girls]. 
(C) White is preferred [by babies]. 
(D) Pink used to be a neutral colour [in symbolising genders].
28. The author suggests | that our perception (of children's psychological development) was [much] influenced [by]. 
(A) the observation (of children's nature) 
(B) the marketing (of products (for children) ) 
(C) researches into children's behaviour 
(D) studies (of childhood consumption)
29. We may learn [from Paragraph 4] | that department stores were advised to. 
(A) classify consumers [into smaller groups] 
(B) attach equal importance to different genders 
(C) focus [on infant wear] || and older kids' clothes 
(D) create some common shoppers' terms
29. We may learn [from Paragraph 4] | that department stores were advised to. 
(A) classify consumers [into smaller groups] 
(B) attach equal importance to different genders 
(C) focus [on infant wear] || and older kids' clothes 
(D) create some common shoppers' terms
30. It can be concluded | that girls' attraction to pink seems to be 
(A) fully understood [by clothing manufacturers] 
(B) clearly explained [by their inborn tendency] 
(C) mainly imposed [by profit-driven businessmen] 
(D) well interpreted [by psychological experts]

Text 3
[In 2010], a federal judge shook America's biotech industry [to its core]. Companies had won patents [for isolated DNA] [for decades]-- [by 2005] some 20% (of human genes) were patented. 
But [in March 2010] a judge ruled | that genes were unpatentable. 
Executives were [violently] agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), <a trade group>, assured members | that this was [just] a "preliminary step" [in a longer battle].
(shook 为 shake 的过去式。won 为 win 的过去分词。longer 为 long 的比较级形式)

[On July 29th] they were relieved, [at least] [temporarily]. 
A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling | that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes (that help forecast a woman's risk (of breast cancer)). 
The chief executive (of Myriad, <a company (in Utah)>,) said | the ruling was a blessing [to firms and patients] [alike].

But as companies continue their attempts [at personalised medicine], || the courts will remain rather busy. 
The Myriad case itself is [probably] not over. Critics make three main arguments [against gene patents]: a gene is a product (of nature), || so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests (such as Myriad's).
A growing number seem to agree. [Last year] a federal task-force urged reform [for patents (related to genetic tests)]. 
[In October] the Department (of Justice) filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing | that an isolated DNA molecule "is no less a product (of nature)... than are cotton fibres (that have been separated from cotton seeds)".

[Despite the appeals court's decision], big questions remain unanswered. 
[For example], it is unclear | whether the sequencing (of a whole genome) violates the patents (of individual genes) [within it]. 
The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.

As the industry advances, <however>, || other suits may have an even greater impact. 
Companies are unlikely to file many more patents [for human DNA molecules] -- || most are [already] patented || or [in the public domain]. 
Firms are [now] studying | how genes interact, looking for correlations (that might be used to determine the causes (of disease) or predict a drug's
(greater 为 great 的比较级形式)
Companies are eager to win patents [for "[connecting the dots]"], || explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer (for the BIO).

Their success may be determined [by a suit (related to this issue)], brought [by the Mayo Clinic, (which the Supreme Court will hear [in its next term])]. 
The BIO recently held a convention (which included sessions to coach lawyers [on the shifting landscape] [for patents]). 
Each meeting was packed.
(brought 为 bring 的过去分词。held 为 hold 的过去式。)
31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 (that the biotech companies would like). 
(A) genes to be patentable 
(B) the BIO to issue a warning 
(C) their executives to be active 
(D) judges to rule out gene patenting
32. Those (who are against gene patents) believe that. 
(A) genetic tests are not reliable 
(B) only man-made products are patentable 
(C) patents (on genes) depend [much] on innovation 
(D) courts should restrict access to genetic tests
33. [According to Hans Sauer], companies are eager to win patents for. 
(A) discovering gene interactions 
(B) establishing disease correlations 
(C) drawing pictures (of genes) 
(D) identifying human DNA
34. [By saying "Each meeting] was packed" (Para. 6), the author means that. 
(A) the supreme court was authoritative 
(B) the BIO was a powerful organisation 
(C) gene patenting was a great concern 
(D) lawyers were keen to attend conventions 
35. Generally speaking, the author's attitude (toward gene patenting) is. 
(A) critical (B) supportive (C) scornful (D) objective

Text 4
The great recession may be over, || but this era (of high joblessness) is [probably] beginning. 
Before it ends, || it will [likely] change the life course and character (of a generation (of young adults)). 
And [ultimately], it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character (of our society) [for years].

No one tries [harder] [than the jobless] to find silver linings [in this national economic disaster]. 
Many said | that unemployment, <while extremely painful>, had improved them [in some ways]: they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles (of others).
(said 为 say 的过去式。become 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。harder 为 hard 的比较级形式)
[In limited respects], [perhaps] the recession will leave society better off. 
[At the very least], it has awoken us [from our national fever dream (of easy riches and bigger houses)], and put a necessary end to an era (of reckless personal spending).
(awoken 为 awake 的过去分词。put 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。bigger 为 big 的比较级形式)

But [for the most part], these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. 
In The Moral Consequences (of Economic Growth), the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that [both inside and outside the U.S.], lengthy periods (of economic stagnation or decline) have [almost always] 
left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have [usually] stopped or reversed the advance (of rights and freedoms).
Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, || as does conflict [between races and classes].

Income inequality usually falls [during a recession], || but it has not shrunk [in this one]. 
[Indeed], this period (of economic weakness) may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them -- [especially for young people].
(shrunk 为 shrink 的过去分词。)
The research (of Till Von Wachter, <the economist (at Columbia University)>,) suggests | that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those (with degrees (from elite universities)) catch up [fairly quickly] [to {where they otherwise would have been}] || if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses [beneath them (that are left behind)].
(left 为 leave 的过去分词。better 为 good 的比较级形式)

[In the Internet age], it is particularly easy to see the resentment (that has [always] been hidden [within American society]). 
More difficult, [in the moment], is discerning | precisely how these lean times are affecting society's character.
(hidden 为 hide 的过去分词。)
[In many respects], the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this recession || than at any time [in its history], || and a variety (of national polls (on social conflict (since then))) have shown mixed results. 
We will have to wait and see [exactly] | how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. 
But they certainly will reshape it, and [all the more so] the longer they extend.
(shown 为 show 的过去分词。longer 为 long 的比较级形式)

36. By saying "to find | silver linings" (Para.2) the author suggests | that the jobless try to. 
(A) seek subsidies from the government 
(B) make (profits (from the troubled economy) )
(C) explore reasons (for the unemployment) 
(D) look (on the bright side (of the recession))
37. [According to Paragraph 2], the recession has made people. 
(A) struggle (against each other) 
(B)realize the national dream 
(C) challenge (their prudence) 
(D) reconsider (their lifestyle)
(made 为 make 的过去分词。)
38. Benjamin Friedman believes | that economic recessions may. 
(A) impose a heavier burden on immigrants 
(B) bring out more evils (of human nature) 
(C) promote the advance (of rights) || and freedoms 
(D) ease conflicts [between races and classes]
(heavier 为 heavy 的比较级形式)
39. The research (of Till Von Wachter) suggests that [in the recession (graduates (from elite universities) tend to)]. 
(A) lag behind the others [due to decreased opportunities] 
(B) catch up [quickly] [with experienced employees] 
(C) see their life chances (as dimmed as the others') 
(D) recover [more quickly] [than the others]
40. The author thinks | that the influence (of hard times (on society)) is. 
(A) trivial (B) positive (C) certain (D) destructive

Part B Directions: Read the following text and answer the questions [by choosing the most suitable subheading from the list A-G [for each (of the numbered paragraphs)]] (41-45). There are two extra subheadings (which you do not need to use). Mark your answers on the ANSWER | SHEET. (10 points)

"Universal history, <the history (of {what man has accomplished [in this world]})>, is [at bottom] the History (of the Great Men) (who have worked here)," wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. 
Well, [not any more] it is not.
(wrote 为 write 的过去式。men 为 man 的复数形式。)

[Suddenly], Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. 
This could be no more than a passing literary craze, || but it also points to a broader truth [about {how we now approach the past}]: less concerned with learning from our forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. [Today], we want empathy, not inspiration.
(fallen 为 fall 的过去分词。broader 为 broad 的比较级形式)

[From the earliest days (of the Renaissance)], the writing (of history) meant recounting the exemplary lives (of great men). 
[In 1337], Petrarch began work [on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus] -- [On Famous Men], highlighting the virtus (or virtue) (of classical heroes). 
Petrarch celebrated their greatness [in conquering fortune and rising [to the top]].
(meant 为 mean 的过去式。began 为 begin 的过去式。lives 为 life 的复数形式。men 为 man 的复数形式。earliest 为 early 的最高级形式)
This was the biographical tradition (which Niccolò Machiavelli turned on its head). 
[In The Prince], he championed cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, [rather than virtue, mercy and justice], [as the skills (of successful leaders)].

[Over time], the attributes (of greatness) shifted. 
The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors (of their day), stressing the uniqueness (of the artist's personal experience) [rather than public glory]. [By contrast], the Victorian author Samuel Smiles wrote Self-Help [as a catalogue (of the worthy lives (of engineers, industrialists and explorers))].
(wrote 为 write 的过去式。lives 为 life 的复数形式。)
"The valuable examples (which they furnish of the power) [of self-help], [of patient purpose, resolute working, and steadfast integrity], [issuing in the formation (of truly noble and manly character)], exhibit," wrote Smiles, "| what it is [in the power (of each to accomplish [for himself])]."
(wrote 为 write 的过去式。)
His biographies (of James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood) were held up [as beacons] to guide the working man [through his difficult life].

This was all [a bit] bourgeois [for Thomas Carlyle, (who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives (of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte))]. 
These epochal figures represented lives [hard] to imitate, but to be acknowledged [as possessing higher authority [than mere mortals]].
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。higher 为 high 的比较级形式)

Not everyone was convinced [by such bombast]. 
"The history (of all hitherto existing society) is the history (of class struggles)," || wrote Marx and Engels [in The Communist Manifesto]. [For them], history did nothing, || it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles: "It is man, real, living man (who does all that)."
(wrote 为 write 的过去式。)
And history should be the story (of the masses) and their record (of struggle).
[As such], it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations (in which each epoch stood). 
For: "Men make their own history, || but they do not make it || just as they please; they do not make it [under circumstances chosen [by themselves], but under circumstances directly found], given and transmitted from the past."
(stood 为 stand 的过去式。chosen 为 choose 的过去分词。found 为 find 的过去分词。men 为 man 的复数形式。)

This was the tradition (which revolutionised our appreciation (of the past)). 
[In place (of Thomas Carlyle)], Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. 
History (from below) stood [alongside biographies (of great men)]. Whole new realms (of understanding -- <from gender to race to cultural studies> --) were opened up || as scholars unpicked the multiplicity (of lost societies). 
And it transformed public history [too]: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.
(stood 为 stand 的过去式。became 为 become 的过去式。men 为 man 的复数形式。)

41.Petrarch 
42.NiccolòMachiavelli 
43.Samuel Smiles 
44.Thomas Carlyle 
45.Marx and Engels
【A】emphasized the virtue (of classical heroes). 
【B】highlighted the public glory (of the leading artists). 
【C】focused (on epochal figures (whose lives were hard to imitate)). 
【D】opened up new realms (of understanding the great men [in history]). 
【E】held (that history should be the story (of the masses) and their record (of struggle)). 
【F】dismissed virtue (as unnecessary) for successful leaders. 
【G】depicted the worthy lives (of engineers, industrialists and explorers).

Section Ⅲ Translation
46. Directions: Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation [on the ANSWER | SHEET]. (15 points)
When people (in developing countries) worry about migration, || they are [usually] concerned at the prospect (of their best and brightest departure) [to Silicon Valley] or to hospitals and universities [in the developed world]. These are the kind (of workers) (that countries (like Britain)), Canada and Australia try to attract by using immigration rules (that privilege college graduates).
(best 为 good 的最高级形式, brightest 为 bright 的最高级形式)

Lots of studies have found | that well-educated people (from developing countries) are particularly likely to emigrate. 
A big survey (of Indian households (in 2004)) found | that nearly 40% (of emigrants) had [more than] a high-school education, compared with [around 3.3% (of all Indians)] [over the age (of 25)]. 
This "brain drain" has [long] bothered policymakers [in poor countries].
They fear | that it hurts their economies, depriving them of much-needed skilled workers (who could have taught [at their universities], worked [in their hospitals] and come up with clever new products for their factories to make).

Section Ⅳ Writing
Part A 47. Directions Suppose | you have found something (wrong) [with the electronic dictionary (that you bought from an online store [the other day])]. 
Write an email to the customer service center [to 1]) make a complaint, || and 2) demand a prompt solution. 
You should write about 100 words (on ANSERE SHEET) 2. Do not sign your own name [at the end (of the letter)], 
Use "Zhang Wei" [instead]. Do not write the address. (10 points)

[Given the advantages (of electronic money)], you might think | that we would move [quickly] to the cashless society (in which all payments are made [electronically]).
(made 为 make 的过去分词。 )
1, <a true cashless society> is [probably] not around the corner. [Indeed], predictions have been 2 [for two decades] but have not [yet] come to fruition. [For example], Business Week predicted [in 1975] | that electronic means (of payment) would [soon] "revolutionize the very 3 (of money) itself," [only to 4] itself [several years later].
(come 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。)
Why has the movement (to a cashless society) been || so 5 (in coming)?

Although electronic means (of payment) may be more efficient [than a payments system (based on paper)], || several factors work 6 (the disappearance (of the paper system)). 
[First], it is very 7 to set up the computer, card reader, and telecommunications networks (necessary to make electronic money the 8 form (of payment)).
Second, paper checks have the advantage (that they) 9 receipts, something (that many consumers are unwilling to 10).
Third, the use (of paper checks) gives consumers several days (of "float)" -- it takes several days 11 (a check is cashed and) funds are 12 (from the issuer's account, (which means | that the writer (of the check) can earn interest [on the funds] [in the meantime])). 13 electronic payments are immediate, || they eliminate the float [for the consumer].

Fourth, electronic means (of payment may 14 security and privacy concerns). 
We often hear media reports (that an unauthorized hacker has been able to access a computer database and to alter information 15 [there]). 
The fact (that this is not an 16 occurrence) means | that dishonest persons might be able to access bank accounts [in electronic payments systems and 17] [from someone else's accounts].
(media 为 medium 的复数形式。)
The 18 (of this type (of fraud)) is no easy task, || and a new field (of computer science) is developing [to 19 security issues]. 
A further concern is | that the use (of electronic means (of payment)) leaves an electronic 20 (that contains a large amount of personal data). 
There are concerns (that government, employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby violating our privacy).

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions || after each text [[by choosing A, B, C or (D) Mark]] your answers [on the ANSWER | SHEET].(40 points) 

Text 1
[In an essay entitled "Making It in America "], <the author Adam Davidson> relates a joke [from cotton country] [about {just how much a modern textile mill has been automated}]: The average mill has [only] two employees [today]," a man and a dog .The man is there to feed the dog, || and the dog is there to keep the man away [from the machines]."

Davidson's article is one (of a number of pieces (that have [recently] appeared making the point (that the reason (we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes [today]) is [largely] because of the big drop [in demand] [because of the Great Recession]))), but it is [also] because of the advances (in both globalization and the information technology revolution, (which are [more rapidly] [than ever replacing labor] [with machines or foreign workers])). 

[In the past], workers (with average skills), <doing an average job>, could earn an average lifestyle.

But, [today], average is officially over. Being average [just] won't earn you | what it used to. It can't || when so many more employers have [so much] more access (to so much more) [above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius].
[Therefore], everyone needs to find their extra -- their unique value contribution (that makes them stand out [in {whatever is their field (of employment)}]).
(won't = will not, can't = can not)

Yes, new technology has been eating jobs [forever], and always will. But there's been an acceleration. 
As Davidson notes," In the 10 years ending in 2009, ( U.S.) factories shed workers [so fast] || that they erased almost all the gains (of the previous 70 years); [roughly] one (out of every three manufacturing jobs -- <about 6 million (in total)>--) disappeared."
(there's = there has)

There will [always] be change -- new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing (we know [for sure]) is that [with each advance (in globalization)] ||and [the] I.T. revolution, the best (jobs will require workers to have [more]) and better education to make themselves above average.

[In a world (where average is officially over)], there are many things (we need to do to support employment), || but nothing would be more important [than passing some kind (of G. I. Bill) [for the 21st century (that ensures | that every American has access (to post-high school education))]].

21. The joke (in Paragraph 1) is used to illustrate. 
(A)the impact (of technological advances) 
(B) the alleviation (of job pressure )
(C) the shrinkage (of textile) mills 
(D) the decline (of middle-class incomes)
22. [According to Paragraph 3], [to be a successful employee], one has to. 
(A)adopt an average lifestyle 
(B)work (on cheap software) 
(C)ask | [for a moderate] salary 
(D) contribute something (unique)
23. The quotation (in Paragraph 4) explains that. 
(A)gains (of technology) have been erased     
(B) | job opportunities are disappearing [at a high speed]
(C) (factories are making much less money || than before 
(D) new jobs and services have been offered
24.According[to the author], [to reduce unemployment], the most important is | 
【A】to accelerate the I.T. revolution 
【B】to advance (economic globalization) 
【C】to ensure more education || for people 
【D】to pass more bills [in the 21st century]
25.Which (of the following) would be the most appropriate title [for the text]? 
【A】Technology Goes [Cheap].
【B】New Law Takes Effect.
【C】Recession Is Bad.
【D】Average Is Over.

[A century ago], the immigrants (from across the Atlantic) included settlers and sojourners.
[Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home [in the United States]] came those (who had no intention to stay), and (who would make some money) and [then] go [home].
[Between 1908 and 1915], about 7 million people arrived || while about 2 million departed.
About a quarter (of all Italian immigrants, <for example>,) eventually returned to Italy [for good].
They even had an affectionate nickname, “uccelli di passaggio,” birds of passage.

[Today], we are much more rigid about immigrants.
We divide newcomers into two categories: legal or illegal , good or bad .
We hail them [as Americans] [in the making], or brand them [as aliens to be kicked out].
That framework has contributed [mightily] to our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis [over {how to fix it}].
We don't need more categories, || but we need to change the way (we think about categories).
We need to look [beyond strict definitions (of legal and illegal)].
[To start], we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving [in the gray areas].
We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.

Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today's birds of passage.
They are energetic participants [in a global economy driven [by the flow (of work, money and ideas)]].
They prefer to come and go || as opportunity calls them.
They can manage to have a job [in one place and a family] [in another].
[With or without permission], they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities [with ease].
We need them to imagine the United States [as a place (where they can be productive [for a while] 
[without committing themselves to staying [forever]])].
We need them to feel | that home can be both here and there and | that they can belong to two nations [honorably].

Accommodating this new world (of people) [in motion] will require new attitudes [on both sides (of the immigration battle)].
Looking [beyond the culture war logic (of right or wrong)] means opening up the middle ground and understanding | that managing immigration [today] requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes, [including some (that are not easy to accomplish [legally] [in the existing system])].

26. "Birds of passage" refers [to those] | who. 
(A)stay in a foreign country [temporarily]
(B)leave their home countries [for good]
(C)immigrate [across the Atlantic]
(D) find permanent jobs overseas 
27.It is implied [in Paragraph 2] | that the current immigration system (in the US). 
(A)needs new immigrant categories
(B)has loosened control [over immigrants]
(C)should be adapted to meet challenges
(D) has been fixed [via political means]
28. [According to the author], today's birds of passage want. 
(A)financial incentives 
(B) a global recognition 
(C) the freedom to stay and leave 
(D) opportunities to get regular jobs 
29.The author suggests | that the birds of passage (today) should be treated. 
(A)as faithful partners (B) (with legal tolerance 
(C) (with economic favors (D) as mighty rivals))
30. The most appropriate title (for this text) would be. 
(A)Come and Go: Big Mistake (B) Living and Thriving: Great Risk 
(C) (With or Without): Great Risk (D) (Legal or Illegal): Big mistake

Scientists have found | that although we are prone to snap overreactions, || if we take a moment and think about {how we are likely to react}, || we can reduce or [even] eliminate the negative effects (of our quick), hard-wired responses.

Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging | whether someone is dangerous, || our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react [very quickly], [within milliseconds].
But we need more time to assess other factors.
[To accurately tell | whether someone is sociable], studies show, || we need [at least] a minute, preferably five.
It takes a while to judge complex aspects (of personality), [like neuroticism or open-mindedness].

But snap decisions (in reaction (to rapid stimuli)) aren't exclusive [to the interpersonal realm].
Psychologists (at the University of Toronto) found | that viewing a fast-food logo [for just a few milliseconds] primes us to read [20 percent faster], || even though reading has little to do with eating.
We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into | whatever else we're doing.
Subjects (exposed to fast-food flashes) also tend to think | a musical piece lasts [too long].

Yet we can reverse such influences.
If we know | we will overreact [to consumer products or housing options] || when we see a happy face (one reason (good sales representatives and real estate agents are [always] smiling)), || we can take a moment [before buying].
If we know | female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, || we can help screeners understand their biases -- || or hire outside screeners. 
John Gottman, <the marriage expert>, explains | that we quickly "thin slice" information [reliably] || [only] after we ground such snap reactions in "thick sliced" long-term study.
When Dr.Gottman really wants to assess | whether a couple will stay [together], he invites them to his island retreat [for a much longer evaluation]: two days, not two seconds.

Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions [by pausing] is | what differentiates us from animals : dogs can think about the future [only] [intermittently] || or [for a few minutes].
But [historically] we have spent about 12 percent (of our days) contemplating the longer term.
Although technology might change the way (we react), || it hasn't changed our nature.
We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.

31. The time needed in making decisions [may].
[A] predetermine the accuracy (of our judgment)
[B] prove the complexity (of our brain reaction)
[C] depend on the importance (of the assessment)
[D] vary [according to the urgency (of the situation)]
32. Our reaction (to a fast-food logo) shows that snap decisions
[A]can be associative
[B]are not unconscious
[C]can be dangerous
[D]are not impulsive
33. [To reverse the negative influences (of snap decisions)], we should.
[A]trust our first impression
[B]think | before we act
[C]do || as people usually do
[D]ask for expert advice
34. John Gottman says that reliable snap (reactions are based on).
[A]critical assessment
[B]"thin sliced" study
[C]adequate information
[D]sensible explanation
35. The author's attitude (toward reversing the high-speed trend) is.
(A)tolerant (B)optimistic 
(C)uncertain (D)doubtful

Europe is not a gender-equality heaven.

[In particular], the corporate workplace will [never] be completely family-friendly || until women are part (of senior management decisions), || and Europe's top corporate-governance positions remain [overwhelmingly] male.
[Indeed], women hold only 14 per cent (of positions) [on European corporate boards].

The European Union is [now] considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion (of women) -- up to 60 per cent.
This proposed mandate was born [of frustration].
[Last year], European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action.
Reding invited corporations to sign up [for gender balance goals (of 40 per cent female board membership)].
But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.

Do we need quotas to ensure | that women can continue to climb the corporate ladder [fairly] || as they balance work and family?

["Personally], I don't like quotas," Reding said [recently].
"But I like | what the quotas do."
Quotas get action: they "open the way (to equality) || and they break through the glass ceiling," [according to Reding, a result seen [in France] and other countries] [with legally binding provisions [on placing women in top business positions]].

I understand Reding's reluctance -- and her frustration.
I don't like quotas [either]; they run [counter to my belief] [in meritocracy], governance (by the capable).
But, when one considers the obstacles [to achieving the meritocratic ideal], || it does look | as if a fairer world must be [temporarily] ordered.

[After all], four decades (of evidence) has [now] shown | that corporations (in Europe as well as the US) are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions -- || no matter | how much "soft pressure" is put [upon them].
When women do break through [to the summit (of corporate power)] -- || as, <for example>, Sheryl Sandberg recently did [at Facebook] -- || they attract massive attention [precisely] || because they remain the exception [to the rule].

If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women -- || whether CEOs or their children's caregivers -- and all families, || Sandberg would be no more newsworthy [than any other highly capable person living in a more just society].

36. [In the European corporate workplace], generally.
[A]women take the lead
[B]men have the final say
[C]corporate governance is overwhelmed
[D]senior management is family-friendly

37. The European Union's intended | legislation is
[A]a reflection (of gender) balance
[B]a response (to Reding's call)
[C]a reluctant choice
[D]a voluntary action
38. [According to Reding], quotas may help women
[A]get top business positions
[B]see through the glass ceiling
[C]balance work and family
[D]anticipate legal results
39. The author's attitude (toward Reding's appeal) is oneof.
(A)skepticism (B) objectiveness (C) indifference (D) approval 
40.Women entering top management become headlines [due to the lack] of.
(A)more social justice 
(B) massive media attention 
(C) suitable public policies 
(D) greater "soft pressure"

The hugely popular blog (the Skint Foodie chronicles {how Tony balances his love (of good food) [with living]} on) benefits.
After bills, Tony has £60 (a week) to spend, £40 (of which) goes on food, || but [10 years ago] he was earning £130, 000|| (a year working) [in corporate communications and eating [at London's]] best restaurants [at least] [twice] [a week].
[Then] his marriage failed, || his career burned out || and his drinking became serious. 
"The community (mental health team saved my life). 
And I felt [like that] [again], [to a certain degree], || when people responded to the blog [so well]. 
It gave me the validation and confidence (that I'd lost). But it's [still] a day-by-day thing."
[Now] he's living in a council flat and fielding offers [from literary agents]. 
He's feeling positive, || but he'll carry on blogging -- [not about eating [as cheaply]] as you can --" there are so many people [in a much worse state], [with barely any money to spend on food "] -- [but eating] [well] [on a budget]. [Here]'s his advice (for economical foodies).
41.____
Impulsive spending isn't an option, || so plan your week's menu [in advance], making shopping lists [for your ingredients] [in their exact quantities]. 
I have an Excel template [for a week (of breakfast, lunch and dinner)]. 
Stop laughing: it's not [just] cost effective but helps you balance your diet.
It's [also] a good idea to shop [daily] [instead of weekly], || because, <being human>, you'll [sometimes] change your mind [about {what you fancy}].
42.____
This is | where supermarkets and their anonymity come in handy. [With them], there's not the same embarrassment || as when buying one carrot [in a little greengrocer]. 
And if you plan [properly], || you'll know | that you only need, <say>, 350g (of shin (of beef) and six rashers (of bacon)), not | whatever weight is pre-packed [in the supermarket chiller].
43.___
You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas [in the freezer] -- || that's not good enough. Mine is filled with leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. 
Planning (ahead) should eliminate wastage, || but if you have surplus vegetables || you'll do a vegetable soup, || and all fruits threatening to "go off" will be cooked or juiced.
44.___
Everyone says this, || but it really is a top tip [for frugal eaters]. 
Shop [at butchers, delis and fishsellers] [regularly], [even for small things], and be super friendly. 
[Soon] you'll feel comfortable asking | if they've any knuckles (of ham) [for soups and stews, or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads] [for stock (which, <more often than not>, they'll let you have [for free])].
45.___
You won't be eating out [a lot], but save your pennies and [once every few months] treat yourself to a set lunch [at a good restaurant]-- £1.75 (a week) for three months gives you £21 -- || more than enough [for a three-course lunch] [at Michelin-starred Arbutus]. 
It's £16.95 [there] -- || or £12.99 (for a large pizza (from Domino's)): I know | which I'd rather eat.

I can pick a date from the past 53 years and know [instantly] | where I was, | what happened [in the news] and [even] the day (of the week). I've been able to do this || since I was four.

I never feel overwhelmed [with the amount (of information (my brain absorbs))]. 
My mind seems to be able to cope || and the information is stored away [neatly]. 
When I think of a sad memory, || I do {what everybody does} -- || try to put it to one side. I don't think | it's harder [for me] || [just] because my memory is clearer. 
Powerful memory doesn't make my emotions [any more] acute or vivid. 
I can recall the day (my grandfather died) and the sadness (I felt) || when we went to the hospital [the day (before)].

Section I Use of English 

Thinner isn't [always] better. A number of studies have 1 (that normal-weight people are [in fact] [at higher risk (of some diseases)] compared to those (who are overweight)). And there are health conditions (for which being overweight is [actually] 2).
[For example], heavier women are less likely to develop calcium deficiency [than thin women]. 3, [among the elderly], being somewhat overweight is [often] an 4 (of good health).

[Of even greater 5] is the fact (that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define). 
It is [often] defined | 6 body mass index, or BMI. BMI 7 body mass divided [by the square (of height)]. 
An adult (with a BMI (of 18 (to 25))) is [often] considered to be normal weight. 
[Between 25 and 30] is overweight.
And over 30 is considered obese. Obesity, <8>, can be divided into moderately obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.

While such numerical standards seem 9, || they are not. Obesity is [probably] less a matter (of weight) [than body fat]. Some people (with a high BMI) are [in fact] extremely fit, || 10 others (with a low BMI) may be in poor 11.
For example, [many collegiate and professional football players 12 as obese], though their percentage body fat is low. 
[Conversely], someone (with a small frame) may have high body fat [but a 13 BMI].

[Today] we have an 14 to label obesity [as a disgrace]. The overweight are [sometimes] 15 [in the media] [with their faces covered]. 
Stereotypes 16 with obesity include laziness, lack (of will power), and lower prospects [for success].
Teachers, employers, and health professionals have been shown to harbor biases [against the obese]. 
17 very young children tend to look down on the overweight, || and teasing [about body build] has [long] been a problem [in schools]

Negative attitudes (toward obesity, <18 (in health concerns)>,) have stimulated a number of anti-obesity 19. 
My own hospital system has banned sugary drinks [from its facilities]. 
Many employers have instituted weight loss and fitness initiatives.
Michelle Obama has launched a high-visibility campaign 20 childhood obesity, even claiming | that it represents our greatest national security threat.

What would you do [with $590m]? This is [now] a question [for Gloria MacKenzie], an 84-year-old widow (who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house (in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot [in history])). 
If she hopes | her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings (of fulfilment), || she could do [worse] || than read Happy Money [by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton].
(biggest 为 big 的最高级形式, worse 为 badly 的比较级形式)

These two academics use an array (of behavioral research) to show | that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. 
Fantasies (of great wealth) often involve visions (of fancy cars and extravagant homes). 
Yet satisfaction (with these material purchases) wears off [fairly quickly].
What was [once] exciting and new| becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. 
It is far better to spend money on experiences, || say Ms Dunn and Mr Norton, 
[like interesting trips, unique meals or [even] going [to the cinema]]. 
These purchases often become more valuable [with time] -- [as stories or memories] -- || [particularly] if they involve feeling more connected to others.

This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck."
It seems | most people would be better off || if they could shorten their commutes [to work], || spend more time (with friends and family and less (of it)) watching television (something (the average American spends a whopping) two months a year doing, and is [hardly] jollier [for it]).
(jollier 为 jolly 的比较级形式)
Buying gifts or giving to charity is [often] more pleasurable [than purchasing things for oneself], || and luxuries are most enjoyable || when they are consumed [sparingly]. 
This is [apparently] | the reason McDonald's restricts the availability (of its popular McRib) -- a marketing trick (that has turned the pork sandwich into an object (of obsession)).

Readers (of Happy Money) are [clearly] a privileged lot, anxious about fulfilment, not hunger. 
Money may not quite buy happiness, || but people (in wealthier countries) are [generally] happier [than those (in poor ones)].
形式, happier 为 happy 的比较级形式)
Yet the link (between feeling good and spending money on others) can be seen [among rich and poor people] [around the world], || and scarcity enhances the pleasure (of most things) [for most people].
(seen 为 see 的过去分词。)
Not everyone will agree with the authors' policy ideas, (which range [from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives] [for American homebuyers]). 
But most people will come away from this book believing | it was money well spent.
(spent 为 spend 的过去分词。)
21. [According to Dunn and Norton], which of the following is the most rewarding purchase? 
(A) A big house. 
(B) A special tour. 
(C) A stylish car. 
(D) A rich meal.
22. The author's attitude (toward Americans' watching TV is_____). 
(A) critical 
(B) supportive 
(C) sympathetic 
(D) ambiguous
23. McRib is mentioned [in Paragraph 3] to show that_____. 
(A) consumers are [sometimes] irrational 
(B) | popularity usually comes || after quality 
(C) marketing tricks are [often] effective 
(D) | rarity generally increases pleasure
24. [According to the last paragraph], Happy Money_____. 
(A) has left much room || for readers' criticism 
(B) may prove to be | a worthwhile purchase 
(C) has predicted | a wider income gap (in the US) 
(D)may give its readers a sense (of achievement)
(left 为 leave 的过去分词。wider 为 wide 的比较级形式)
25. This text mainly discusses | how to____. 
(A) balance feeling good and spending money 
(B) spend large sums (of money won) in lotteries 
(C) obtain lasting satisfaction [from money spent] 
(D) become more reasonable [in spending [on luxuries]]
(won 为 win 的过去分词。spent 为 spend 的过去分词。)

Text 2
An article (in Scientific America) has pointed out | that empirical research says | that, <actually>, you think | you're more beautiful || than you are. 
We have a deep-seated need to feel good [about ourselves] || and we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies to achieve this.
Social psychologists have amassed oceans (of research) [into {what they call the}] " above average effect, "or" illusory superiority," and [shown | that, [for example], 70% (of us) rate ourselves || as above average [in leadership]], 93% (in driving) and 85% (at getting on) well with others -- all obviously statistical impossibilities.
(shown 为 show 的过去分词。)

We rose-tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. 
We become defensive || when criticised, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem. 
We stalk around thinking | we're hot stuff.

Psychologist and behavioural scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key study [into self-enhancement and attractiveness]. 
Rather than have people simply rate their beauty compared with others, || he asked them to identify an original photograph (of themselves) [from a lineup] including versions (that had been altered to appear [more] and less attractive).
(oversaw 为 oversee 的过去式。)
Visual recognition, <reads the study>, is "an automatic psychological process, occurring [rapidly] and intuitively [with little or no apparent conscious deliberation]." 
If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image -- which most did-- they genuinely believed | it was [really] | how they looked.
(chose 为 choose 的过去式。)

Epley found no significant gender difference [in responses]. 
[Nor] was there any evidence (that those (who self-enhanced the most (that is, the participants (who thought [the most positively] | doctored pictures were real))) were doing [so] to make up for profound insecurities). 
[In fact], those (who thought | that the images (higher up the attractiveness scale) were real) directly corresponded with those (who showed other markers [for having higher self-esteem]).
(found 为 find 的过去式。thought 为 think 的过去式。higher 为 high 的比较级形式)
"I don't think | the findings (that we have) are any evidence (of personal delusion)," says Epley.
"It's a reflection [simply of people generally thinking [well] of themselves]." 
If you are depressed, || you won't be self-enhancing.
(don't = do not, It's = It is, won't = will not)

[Knowing the results (of Epley's study)], it makes sense | that many people hate photographs (of themselves) [viscerally] -- [on one level], || they don't [even] recognise the person [in the picture] [as themselves].

Facebook, <therefore>, is a self-enhancer's paradise, (where people can share [only] the most flattering photos, the cream (of their wit), style, beauty, intellect and lifestyles). 
It's not | that people's profiles are dishonest, || says Catalina Toma (of Wisconsin-Madison University), " but they portray an idealised version (of themselves). "
26. [According to the first paragraph], social psychologists have found that ____. 
(A) our self-ratings are unrealistically high 
(B) | illusory superiority is a baseless effect 
(C) our need || for leadership is unnatural 
(D) | self-enhancing strategies are ineffective
27. Visual recognition is believed to be people's_____. 
(A) rapid matching (B) conscious choice 
(C) intuitive response (D) automatic self-defence
28. Epley found | that people (with higher self-esteem) tended to_____. 
(A) underestimate their insecurities 
(B) believe | [in their attractiveness] 
(C) cover (up their depressions) 
(D) oversimplify their illusions
29. The word" [viscerally] " (Para. 5) is closest [in meaning to_____]. 
(A) instinctively (B) occasionally 
(C) particularly (D) aggressively
30. It can be inferred | that Facebook is a self-enhancer's paradise || because people can_____. 
(A) present their dishonest profiles 
(B) define their traditional lifestyles 
(C) share their intellectual pursuits 
(D) withhold their unflattering sides
Text 3
The concept (of man (versus machine)) is [at least] as old [as the industrial revolution], || but this phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt [during economic downturns and fragile recoveries]. 
And yet, it would be a mistake to think | we are [right now] [simply] experiencing the painful side (of a boom and bust cycle).
(felt 为 feel 的过去分词。)

Certain jobs have gone away [for good], outmoded [by machines]. 
Since technology has such an insatiable appetite [for eating [up human jobs]], || this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy [in ways (we cannot immediately foresee)].
(gone 为 go 的过去分词。has 为 have 的第三人称单数形式。cannot = can not)

When there is rapid improvement [in the price and performance (of technology)], || jobs (that were [once] thought to be immune from automation) suddenly become threatened. 
This argument has attracted a lot of attention, [via the success (of the book Race Against the Machine)], [by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, (who both hail from MIT's Center (for Digital Business))].
(thought 为 think 的过去分词。)

This is a powerful argument, || and a scary one. And yet, John Hagel, <author (of The Power (of Pull) and other books)>, says | Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason (why these jobs are so vulnerable [to technology] [in the first place]).

Hagel says | we have designed jobs [in the U.S. (that tend to be "tightly scripted")] and "highly standardized" ones (that leave no room for "individual initiative or creativity)." 
[In short], these are the types (of jobs (that machines can perform [much better] at [than human beings])). 
That is | how we have put a giant target sign on the backs (of American workers), || Hagel says.
(put 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。better 为 well 的比较级形式)

It's time to reinvent the formula [for {how work is conducted}], || since we are [still] relying on a very 20th century notion (of work), || Hagel says. [In our rapidly changing economy], we more than ever need people [in the workplace] (who can take initiative and exercise their imagination "to respond to unexpected events)." That is not something (machines are good at).
They are designed to perform very predictable activities.

As Hagel notes, || Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point [in their book]. 
We need to reframe race [against the machine] [as race] [with the machine]. 
[In other words], we need to look at the ways (in which machines can augment human labor) rather than replace it.
So then the problem is not [really] about technology, but rather, "how do we innovate our institutions and our work practices?"
31. [According to the first paragraph], economic downturns would_____. 
(A) ease the competition of man vs. machine 
(B) highlight machines' threat (to human jobs) 
(C) provoke a painful technological revolution 
(D) outmode our current economic structure
32. The authors (of Race Against the Machine) argue that_____. 
(A) technology is diminishing man's job opportunities 
(B) automation is | accelerating technological development 
(C) certain jobs will remain intact || after automation 
(D) man will [finally] win the race [against machine]
33. Hagel argues | that jobs (in the U.S.) are often_____. 
(A) performed [by innovative minds] 
(B) scripted [with an individual style] 
(C) standardized [without a clear target] 
(D) designed [against human creativity]
34. According to the last paragraph, Brynjolfsson and McAfee discussed_____. 
(A) the predictability (of machine behavior (in practice))
(B) the formula (for {how work is conducted [efficiently] }) 
(C) || the ways machines replace human labor [in modern times 
(D) the necessity (of human involvement)] [in the workplace]
35. Which of the following could be the most appropriate title [for the text]? 
(A) How to Innovate Our Work Practices? 
(B) Machines Will Replace Human Labor 
(C) Can We Win the Race [Against Machines]? 
(D) Economic Downturns Stimulate Innovations

When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy || the focus is [usually] on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is [seldom] mentioned.

Why is that? [To some extent] the housing sector must shoulder the blame. 
We have not been good at communicating the real value (that housing can contribute to economic growth). 
[Then] there is the scale (of the typical housing project).
It is hard to shove [for attention] [among multibillion-pound infrastructure projects], || so it is inevitable | that the attention is focused [elsewhere]. 
But [perhaps] the most significant reason is | that the issue has [always] been [so] [politically] charged.

[Nevertheless], the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase [all the time] || and we are [simply] not building enough new homes.
The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. 
It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.

There are some indications (that it is preparing to do just that).
The communities minister, <Don Foster>, has hinted | that George Osborne, <Chancellor of the Exchequer>, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap [on the amount (that local authorities can borrow [against their housing stock debt])].
Evidence shows | that 60,000 extra new homes could be built [over the next five years] || if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP [by 0.6%].

Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty [in the rental environment, (which would have a significant impact [on the ability (of registered providers)] to fund new developments [from revenues])].

But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome [in the short term], || we must face up to the fact (that the existing £4.5bn programme (of grants to fund new affordable housing), <set to expire [in 2015]>, is unlikely to be extended [beyond] [then]). 
The Labour party has [recently] announced | that it will retain a large part (of the coalition's spending plans) || if it returns to power. 
The housing sector needs to accept | that we are very unlikely to ever return to the era (of large-scale public grants). We need to adjust to this changing climate.

While the government's commitment (to long-term funding) may have changed, || the very pressing need [for more affordable housing] is real and is not going away.

36. The author believes | that the housing sector_____. 
(A) has attracted much attention 
(B) has lost its real value [in economy] 
(C) shoulders too much responsibility 
(D) involves certain political factors 
37. It can be learned | that affordable housing has_____. 
(A) suffered government biases 
(B) increased its home supply 
(C) offered spending opportunities 
(D) disappointed | the government
38. [According to Paragraph 5], George Osborne may_____. 
(A) prepare to reduce housing stock debt 
(B) release a lifted GDP growth forecast 
(C) allow greater government debt for housing 
(D) stop local authorities [from building homes]. 
39 It can be inferred | that a stable rental environment would_____.
(A) lower the costs (of registered providers) 
(B) relieve the ministers of responsibilities 
(C) contribute to funding new developments 
(D) lessen the impact (of government interference). 
40 The author believes that [after 2015], the government may_____. 
(A) implement more policies to support housing 
(B) stop generous funding [to the housing sector] 
(C) renew the affordable housing grants programme 
(D) review (the need (for large-scale public) grants)

Part B Directions: Read the following text and answer the questions [by choosing the most suitable subheading from the list A-G [for each (of the numbered paragraphs)]] (41-45). There are two extra subheadings (which you do not need to use). Mark your answers on the ANSWER | SHEET. (10 points)

[Emerging [in the late Sixties] and reaching a peak [in the Seventies]], 
Land Art was one (of a range (of new forms)), including Body Art, Performance Art, Action Art and Installation Art, (which pushed art [beyond the traditional confines (of the studio and gallery)]). 
[Rather than portraying landscape], land artists used the physical substance (of the land itself) as their medium.

The British land art, <typified [by Richard Long's piece]>, was not only [more domestically] scaled, || but [a lot] quirkier [than its American counterpart]. [Indeed], while you might assume | that an exhibition (of Land Art) would consist [only] of records (of works) [rather than the works] themselves, || Long's photograph (of his work) is the work. Since his "action" is in the past, || the photograph is its sole embodiment.

That might seem rather an obscure point, || but it sets the tone for an exhibition (that contains a lot of black-and-white photographs and relatively few natural objects).

[Long] is Britain's best-known Land Artist and his Stone Circle, || a perfect ring (of purplish rocks (from Portishead beach laid out [on the gallery floor])), represents the elegant, rarefied side (of the form). 
The Boyle Family, <on the other hand>, stand for its dirty, urban aspect.
[Comprising artists Mark Boyle and Joan Hills and their children], they recreated random sections (of the British landscape) [on gallery walls]. 
Their Olaf Street Study, <a square (of brick-strewn waste ground)>, is one (of the few works) [here] to embrace the commonplaceness (that characterises most (of our experience (of the landscape)) [most of the time]).

Parks feature, [particularly] [in the earlier works], such as John Hilliard's very funny [Across the Park], (in which a long-haired stroller is [variously] smiled at [by a pretty girl] and unwittingly assaulted [in a sequence (of images (that turn out to be different parts (of the same photograph)))]).

[Generally] however British land artists preferred to get away [from towns], [gravitating towards landscapes] that are [traditionally] considered beautiful such as the Lake District or the Wiltshire Downs. 
While it probably wasn't apparent [at the time], || much (of this work) is permeated [by a spirit (of romantic escapism (that the likes (of Wordsworth) would have [readily] understood))].
Derek Jarman's yellow-tinted film (Towards Avebury, <a collection (of long, mostly still shots (of the Wiltshire landscape))>,) evokes a tradition (of English landscape painting stretching [from Samuel Palmer to Paul Nash]).

[In the case (of Hamish Fulton)], you can't help feeling | that the Scottish artist has [simply] found a way (of making his love (of walking pay)). 
A typical work, <such as Seven Days>, consists of a single beautiful black-and-white photograph taken [on an epic walk], [with the mileage and number (of days taken) listed beneath].
British Land Art || as shown [in this] well selected, but relatively modestly scaled exhibition wasn't about imposing on the landscape, more a kind (of landscape-orientated light conceptual art) created passing through. 
It had its origins [in the great outdoors], || but the results were as gallery-bound [as the paintings (of Turner and Constable)].

41.Stone Circle 
42.Olaf Street Study 
43.Across [the Park] 
44.Towards Avebury 
45.Seven days
【A】originates (from a long walk (that the artist took)). 
【B】illustrates a kind of landscape-orientated light conceptual art. 
【C】reminds people (of the English) landscape painting tradition. 
【D】represents the elegance (of the British) land art. 
【E】depicts the ordinary side (of the British) land art. 
【F】embodies a romantic escape into the Scottish outdoors. 
【G】contains images (from different parts (of the same)) photograph.

Most people would define optimism [as being [endlessly] happy], [with a glass (that's perpetually half full)]. 
But that's exactly the kind (of false cheerfulness (that positive psychologists wouldn't recommend)). 
"Healthy optimism means being in touch [with reality]," says Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor. [According to Ben-Shahar], realistic optimists are those (who make the best (of things (that happen))), || but not those (who believe everything) happens [for the best].

Ben-Shahar uses three optimistic exercises. When he feels down -- || say, || after giving a bad lecture -- || he grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself | that not every lecture can be a Nobel winner; some will be less effective [than others]. 
Next is reconstruction. 
He analyzes the weak lecture, learning lessons [for the future] [about {what works} and {what doesn't.
[Finally], there is perspective, (which involves acknowledging | that [in the grand scheme (of life)], one lecture really doesn't matter).

(best 为 good 的最高级形式)

Happy people work [differently].
They're more productive, more creative, and willing to take greater risks.
And new research suggests | that happiness might influence 1 firms work, [too].
(they're = they are, greater 为 great 的比较级形式, happier 为 happy 的比较级形式)

Companies (located in places (with happier people)) invest more, [according to a recent research paper]. 
2, <firms (in happy places)> spend more on R&D (research and development).
That's | because happiness is linked to the kind (of longer-term) thinking 3 [for making investments [for the future]].
(That's = That is)

The researchers wanted to know | if the 4 and inclination (for risk-taking (that come with happiness)) would 5 the way companies invested.
So they compared U.S. cities' average happiness 6 [by Gallup polling [with the investment activity (of publicly traded firms)] [in those areas]].

7 enough, firms' investment and R&D intensity were correlated with the happiness (of the area (in which they were 8)).
But is it [really] happiness | that's linked to investment, || or could something (else) (about happier cities 9 (why firms (there) spend more on R&D))?
(that's = that is, happier 为 happy 的比较级形式)
[To find out], the researchers controlled [for various 10 (that might make firms more likely to invest)]-- like size, industry, and sales -- || and [for indicators (that a place was 11 to live in, like growth [in wages or population])]
The link (between happiness and investment) generally 12 (even after accounting for these things).

The correlation (between happiness and investment) was particularly strong for younger firms, (which the authors 13 (to "[less codified decision making process]" and the possible presence (of "younger and less 14 managers (who are more likely to be influenced [by sentiment]))))." The relationship was 15 stronger [in places (where happiness was spread more 16)].
(younger 为 young 的比较级形式, stronger 为 strong 的比较级形式)
Firms seem to invest more in places (where most people are relatively happy), rather than in places [with happiness inequality].

17 this doesn't prove | that happiness causes firms to invest more || or [to take a longer-term view], the authors believe it [at least 18] [at that possibility].
(doesn't = does not)
It's not hard to imagine | that local culture and sentiment would help 19 how executives think about the future|.
"It surely seems plausible | that happy people would be more forward-thinking and creative and 20 R&D [more] [than the average]," said one researcher.

It's true | that high-school coding classes aren't essential for learning computer science [in college].
Students (without experience) can catch up [after [a few] introductory courses], || said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean (at Carnegie Mellon's School (of Computer Science)).
(said 为 say 的过去分词。It's = It is, aren't = are not)

[However], Cortina said, || early exposure is beneficial.
When younger kids learn computer science, || they learn | that it's not [just] a confusing, endless string (of letters and numbers) -- [but a tool] to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses.
It's not as hard for them to transform their thought processes || as it is [for older students].
(said 为 say 的过去式。hypotheses 为 hypothesis 的复数形式。younger 为 young 的比较级形式, it's = it is, It's = It is, older 为 old 的比较级形式)
Breaking down problems [into bite-sized chunks] and using code to solve them becomes normal.
Giving more children this training could increase the number (of people (interested in the field)) and help fill the jobs gap, || Cortina said.
(said 为 say 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。)

Students also benefit from learning something about coding || before they get to college, (where introductory computer-science classes are packed [to the brim]), || which can drive the lessexperienced or -determined students away.

The Flatiron School, (where people pay to learn programming), started [as one (of the many coding bootcamps (that's become popular [for adults looking for a career change]))].
The highschoolers get the same curriculum, || but "we try to gear lessons toward things (they're interested in)," said Victoria Friedman, an instructor.
[For instance], one (of the apps (the students are developing)) suggests movies (based on your mood).
(become 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。said 为 say 的过去式。that's = that has, they're = they are)

The students (in the Flatiron class) probably won't drop out of high school and build the next Facebook.
Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the"Ruby (on Rails "language (they learned)) may not even be relevant [by the time (they enter the job market)].
(won't = will not)
But the skills (they learn) -- <{how to think [logically] [through a problem] and organize the results}> -- apply to any coding language, || said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant (for the state (of North Carolina)).
(said 为 say 的过去分词。)

[Indeed], the Flatiron students might not go into IT [at all].
But creating a future army (of coders) is not the sole purpose (of the classes).
These kids are going to be surrounded [by computers] -- [in their pockets], [in their offices], [in their homes] -- [for the rest (of their lives)].
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。)
The younger they learn | how computers think, how to coax the machine into producing | what they want-- the earlier they learn | that they have the power to do that -- the better.

21. Cortina holds | that early exposure (to computer science) makes it easier to____.
A. complete future job training 
B. remodel the way (of thinking). 
C formulate logical hypotheses 
D. perfect artwork production 
(hypotheses 为 hypothesis 的复数形式。easier 为 easy 的比较级形式)
22. [In delivering lessons [for high-schoolers]], Flatiron has considered their____.
A. experience 
B. interest 
C. career prospects 
D. academic backgrounds
23. Deborah Seehorn believes | that the skills learned [at Flatiron will____].
A. help students learn other computer languages 
B. have to be upgraded || when new technologies come 
C. need improving || when students look for jobs 
D. enable students to make big quick money
24. [According to the last paragraph], Flatiron students are expected to____.
A. bring forth innovative computer technologies 
B. stay [longer] in the information technology industry 
C. become better prepared for the digitalized world 
D. compete with a future army (of programmers)
(longer 为 long 的比较级形式, better 为 well 的比较级形式)
25. The word" coax" (Para.6) is closest [in meaning to____].
A. persuade 
B. frighten 
C. misguide 
D. challenge

Biologists estimate | that [as many as] 2 million lesser prairie chickens -- <a kind (of bird living on stretching grasslands)> -- once lent red to the often grey landscape (of the midwestern and southwestern United States).
But just some 22,000 birds remain [today], occupying about 16% (of the species' historic range).
(lent 为 lend 的过去式。)

The crash was a major reason (the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service (USFWS) decided to formally list the bird as threatened).
"The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation," said USFWS director Daniel Ashe.
Some environmentalists, <however>, were disappointed.
They had pushed the agency to designate the bird [as "[endangered],"] a status (that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats).
(said 为 say 的过去式。greater 为 great 的比较级形式)
But Ashe and others argued | that the "threatened" tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservation approaches.
[In particular], they called for forging closer collaborations [with western state governments, (which are [often] uneasy [with federal action])], and with the private landowners (who control an estimated 95% (of the prairie chicken's habitat)).
(gave 为 give 的过去式。closer 为 close 的比较级形式)

[Under the plan], [for example], the agency said | it would not prosecute landowners or businesses (that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird), || as long as they had signed a rangewide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat.
(said 为 say 的过去式。)
[Negotiated [by USFWS and the states]], the plan requires individuals and businesses (that damage habitat [as part]) of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres (of suitable habitat).
The fund will [also] be used to compensate landowners (who set aside habitat).
And it gives the Western Association (of Fish) and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition (of state agencies), the job (of monitoring progress).
[Overall], the idea is to let "states" remain in the driver's seat [for managing the species]," Ashe said.
(said 为 say 的过去式。)

Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric.
Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, || and [at least] a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it [in federal court].
[Not surprisingly], industry groups and states generally argue | it goes [too far]; environmentalists say | it doesn't go [far enough]"
The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird [to the same industries (that are pushing it to extinction)]," says biologist Jay Lininger.
(doesn't = does not)

26. The major reason [for listing the lesser prairie chicken [as threatened is____]].
A. its drastically decreased population 
B. the underestimate (of the grassland acreage ). 
C. a desperate appeal (from some biologists ). 
D .the insistence (of private landowners)
27. The "threatened" tag disappointed some environmentalists [in that it_____].
A. was a give-in to governmental pressure 
B. would involve fewer agencies [in action ].
C. granted less federal regulatory power 
D. went against conservation policies
(went 为 go 的过去式。fewer 为 few 的比较级形式)
28. It can be learned from Paragraph 3 | that unintentional harm-doers will not be prosecuted || if they_____.
A. agree to pay a sum for compensation 
B. volunteer to set up an equally big habitat 
C. offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job 
D. promise to raise funds [for USFWS operations ].
29. [According to Ashe], the leading role (in managing the species is______).
A. the federal government 
B. the wildlife agencies 
C. the landowners 
D. the states
30. Jay Lininger would most likely support_______.
A. industry groups 
B. the win-win rhetoric 
C. environmental groups 
D. the plan (under challenge)

Text 3
That everyone's too busy [these days] | is a cliché.
But one specific complaint is made [especially mournfully]: There's [never] any time to read.
(made 为 make 的过去分词。everyone's = everyone is, There's = There is)

What makes the problem thornier| is | that the usual time-management techniques don't seem sufficient.
The web's full of articles offering tips [on making time to read]: "Give up TV" or" Carry a book [with you] [at all times] ".
[But in my experience], using such methods to free [up the odd 30 minutes] doesn't work.
Sit down to read || and the flywheel (of work-related thoughts) keeps spinning -- || or else you're so exhausted || that a challenging book's the last thing (you need).
The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes," is [overwhelmingly] inclined toward communication…
It is not [simply] | that one is interrupted; it is | that one is [actually] inclined [to interruption]."
(you're = you are, book's = book is)
Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind (of time (which can't be obtained [merely by becoming more efficient])).
(can't = can not)

[In fact], "becoming more efficient" is part (of the problem).
[Thinking of time [as a resource] to be maximised means] you approach it [instrumentally], judging any given moment [as well] spent [only] [in] so far as it advances progress [toward some goal].
Immersive reading, <by contrast>, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, <goallessness>, even time-wasting.
(spent 为 spend 的过去式。)
Try to slot it in [as a to-do list item] || and you'll manage [only] goal-focused reading -- useful, [sometimes], but not the [most] fulfilling kind.
(you'll = you will)
"The future comes [at us] [like empty bottles] [along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt]," writes Gary Eberle [in his book Sacred Time], || and "we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, <hours, <minutes>>) || as they pass, || for if they get by [without being filled], || we will have wasted them."
No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself [in a book].
(worse 为 bad 的比较级形式)

So what does work?
[Perhaps] [surprisingly], scheduling regular times [for reading].
You'd think | this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, || but [in fact, <Eberle notes>], such ritualistic behaviour helps us || "step (outside time's flow" (into "soul time))." You could limit distractions [by reading [only] physical books], or on single-purpose e-readers.
(you'd = you would)
"Carry a book [with you] [at all times]" can actually work, [too] -- || providing you dip in [often enough], || so that reading becomes the default state (from which you temporarily surface to take care (of business)), [before dropping back down].
[On a really good day], it [no longer] feels | as if you're "making time to read," || but just reading, || and making time [for everything (else)].
(you're = you are)

31. The usual time-management techniques don't work || because ___.
A. what they can offer | does not ease the modern mind 
B. what challenging books demand | is repetitive reading 
C. what people often forget | is carrying a book [with them]
D. what deep reading requires | cannot be guaranteed
(don't = do not, cannot = can not)
32. The "empty bottles" metaphor illustrates | that people feel a pressure [to ___].
A. update their to-do lists 
B. make passing time fulfilling 
C. carry their plans through 
D. pursue carefree reading 
33. Eberle would agree | that scheduling regular times [for reading] helps ___.
A. encourage the efficiency mind-set 
B. develop [online] reading habits 
C. promote ritualistic reading 
D. achieve immersive reading
34. "Carry a book [with you] [at all (times" can work)] || if ___.
A. reading becomes your primary business (of the day ).
B. all the daily business has been [promptly] dealt [with].
C. you are able to drop back to business [after reading].
D. time can be [evenly] split [for reading and business]
(dealt 为 deal 的过去分词。split 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。)
35. The best title (for this text) could be ___.
A. How to Enjoy Easy Reading 
B. How to Find | Time (to Read) 
C. How to Set Reading Goals 
D. How to Read [Extensively]
(best 为 good 的最高级形式)

Text 4
[Against a backdrop (of drastic changes (in economy and population structure))], younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, || a latest poll has found.
(found 为 find 的过去分词。younger 为 young 的比较级形式, latest 为 late 的最高级形式)

[Across generational lines], Americans continue to prize many (of the same traditional milestones (of a successful life)), including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring [in their sixties].
But while young and old mostly agree [on {what constitutes the finish line (of a fulfilling life)}], || they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.
(children 为 child 的复数形式。)

Young people (who are [still] getting started in life) were more likely [than older adults] to prioritize personal fulfillment [in their work, <to believe | they will advance their careers [most] [by regularly changing jobs]>], to favor communities [with more public services and a faster pace (of life)], to agree | that couples should be [financially] secure [before getting married or having children], || and [to maintain | that children are [best] served [by two parents working [outside the home]]], the survey found.
(older 为 old 的比较级形式, faster 为 fast 的比较级形式)
(found 为 find 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。best 为 well 的最高级形式)

[From career to community and family], these contrasts suggest | that [in the aftermath (of the searing Great Recession)], those just starting out [in life] are defining priorities and expectations (that will [increasingly] spread through virtually all aspects (of American life)), [from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics].

Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities (of both groups) said | they believe | it is harder [for young people] [today] to get started in life || than it was [for earlier generations].
(said 为 say 的过去式。harder 为 hard 的比较级形式, earlier 为 early 的比较级形式)
While younger people are somewhat more optimistic [than their elders] [about the prospects] [for those starting out [today]], || big majorities (in both groups) believe | those "just getting started in life" face a tougher climb [than earlier generations] [in reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing].
(younger 为 young 的比较级形式, tougher 为 tough 的比较级形式, earlier 为 early 的比较级形式)

Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher [today].
Schneider, <a 27-year-old auto technician (from the Chicago suburbs)>, says | he struggled to find a job [after graduating from college].
Even now that he is working [steadily], || he said, "I can't afford to pay my monthly mortgage payments [on my own], || so I have to rent rooms out to people to make that happen."
(said 为 say 的过去式。tougher 为 tough 的比较级形式, can't = can not)
[Looking back], he is struck | that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children || even though neither had completed college || when he was young.
"I still grew up [in an upper middle-class home] [with parents (who didn't have college degrees)]," Schneider said.
"I don't think | people are capable of that [anymore]."
(struck 为 strike 的过去分词。grew 为 grow 的过去式。said 为 say 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。didn't = did not, don't = do not)

36. One cross-generation mark (of a successful life is_____).
A. trying out different lifestyles 
B. having a family [with children].
C. working [beyond retirement age ].
D. setting up a profitable business 
37.It can be learned from Paragraph 3 | that young people tend to ____.
A. favor a slower life pace 
B. hold an occupation longer 
C. attach importance to pre-marital finance 
D. give priority to childcare [outside the home]
(children 为 child 的复数形式。slower 为 slow 的比较级形式, longer 为 long 的比较级形式)
38. The priorities and expectations defined [by the young] will ____.
A. become increasingly clear 
B. focus on materialistic issues 
C. depend [largely] on political preferences 
D. reach almost all aspects (of American life) 
39. Both young and old agree that ____.
A. good-paying jobs are less available 
B. the old made more life achievements 
C. housing loans [today] are easy to obtain 
D. getting established is harder [for the young]
(made 为 make 的过去式。harder 为 hard 的比较级形式)
40. Which of the following is true [about Schneider]?
A. He found a dream job [after graduating from college].
B. His parents believe | working [steadily] is a must [for success].
C. His parents' good life has little to do with a college degree.

Act Your Shoe Size, Not Your Age

[As adults], it seems | that we are [constantly] pursuing happiness, [often with mixed results].
Yet children appear to have it [down to an art] -- || and [for the most part] they don't need self-help books or therapy.
[Instead], they look after their wellbeing [instinctively], and usually [more effectively] || than we do [as grownups].
[Perhaps] it's time to learn a few lessons from them.
(children 为 child 的复数形式。don't = do not, it's = it is)
41._______
What does a child do || when he's sad?
He cries.
When he's angry?
He shouts.
Scared?
[Probably] a bit of both.
As we grow up, || we learn to control our emotions || so they are manageable and don't dictate our behaviours, (which is [in many ways] a good thing).
(he's = he is, don't = do not)
But [too often] we take this process [too far] and end up suppressing emotions, especially negative ones.
That's about as effective [as brushing dirt [under a carpet]] and can even make us ill.
What we need to do | is find a way to acknowledge and express | what we feel [appropriately], || and [then]-- [again], like children-- move on.
(children 为 child 的复数形式。That's = That is)
42.______
A couple of Christmases ago, <my youngest stepdaughter, (who was nine years old [at the time])>, got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas.
It cost [less than] a fiver || but she was overjoyed, and couldn't stop talking about it.
(got 为 get 的过去式。youngest 为 young 的最高级形式, couldn't = could not)
[Too often] we believe | that a new job, bigger house or better car will be the magic silver bullet (that will allow us to finally be content), || but the reality is | these things have very little lasting impact [on our happiness levels].
[Instead], being grateful for small things [every day] is a much better way to improve wellbeing.
(bigger 为 big 的比较级形式, better 为 good 的比较级形式)
43._________
Have you ever noticed | how much children laugh?
If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling, || we would reduce the stress hormones [in our bodies], increase good hormones [like endorphins], improve blood flow [to our hearts] and [even] have a greater chance (of fighting off infection).
All (of which) would, <of course>, have a positive effect (on our happiness levels).
(children 为 child 的复数形式。greater 为 great 的比较级形式)
44.________
The problem (with being a grownup) is | that there's an awful lot (of serious stuff) to deal with-- work, mortgage payments, figuring out | what to cook for dinner.
But [as adults] we also have the luxury (of being able) to control our own diaries || and it's important | that we schedule in time to enjoy the things (we love).
(there's = there is, it's = it is)
Those things might be social, sporting, creative or completely random ([dancing [around the living room]], anyone?)-- it doesn't matter, || so long as they're enjoyable, and not likely to have negative side effects, such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree [if you're on a tight budget].
(doesn't = does not, they're = they are, you're = you are)
45.______
[Having said all (of the above)], it's important to add | that we shouldn't try [too hard] to be happy.
Scientists tell us | this can backfire and actually have a negative impact [on our wellbeing].
(said 为 say 的过去分词。it's = it is, shouldn't = should not)
As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said: "Happiness is the absence (of striving for happiness)." And [in that], [once more], we need to look [to the example (of our children, (to whom happiness is not a goal [but a natural byproduct (of the way (they live))]))].

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible [within its doors].
The reason (for this) is simple: The longer you stay in the store, || the more stuff you'll see, || and the more stuff you see, || the more you'll buy.
(longer 为 long 的比较级形式, you'll = you will)
And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff.
The average supermarket, <according to the Food Marketing Institute>, carries some 44,000 different items, || and many carry tens of thousands [more].
The sheer volume (of available choice) is enough to send shoppers into a state (of information overload).
[According to brain-scan experiments], the demands (of so much decision-making) quickly become too much [for us].
[After about 40 minutes (of shopping)], most people stop struggling to be [rationally] selective, and instead begin shopping [emotionally] (-- which is the point (at which we accumulate the 50 percent (of stuff) [in our cart (that we never intended buying)])).

People have speculated [for centuries] [about a future] [without work].
Today is no different, with academics, writers, and activists once [again] 1 (that technology is replacing human workers).
Some imagine | that the coming work-free world will be defined [by 2]: [A few] wealthy people will own all the capital, || and the masses will struggle [in an impoverished wasteland].

A different and not mutually exclusive 3 holds | that the future will be a wasteland (of a different sort), one 4 by purposelessness: [Without jobs to give their lives 5], people will [simply] become lazy and depressed. 
6, today's unemployed don't seem to be having a great time.
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。don't = do not)
One Gallup poll found | that 20 percent (of Americans (who have been unemployed [for [at least] a year])) report having depression, double the rate [for 7 Americans].
Also, some research suggests | that the 8 (for rising rates (of mortality)), mental-health problems, and addiction 9 poorly-educated, <middle-aged people> is a shortage (of well-paid jobs).
[Perhaps] this is | why many 10 (the agonizing dullness (of a jobless future)).
(found 为 find 的过去式。)

But it doesn't 11 follow from findings [like these] (that a world (without work) would be filled with unease).
Such visions are based on the 12 (of being unemployed [in a society built on the concept (of employment)]).

[Today], the 15 (of work) may be [a bit] overblown.
"Many jobs are boring, degrading, unhealthy, and a waste (of human potential)," says John Danaher, a lecturer (at the National University of Ireland (in Galway)).

[These days], because leisure time is [relatively] 16 [for most workers], || people use their free time to counterbalance the intellectual and emotional 17 (of their jobs).
"When I come [home] [from a hard day's work], || I often feel 18," Danaher says, adding, ["In a world (in which I don't have to work)], I might feel rather different" -- perhaps different enough to throw himself 19 a hobby || or a passion project (with the intensity usually reserved for 20) matters.

[Every Saturday morning], [at 9 am], [more than] 50,000 runners set off to run 5km [around their local park].
The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more [abroad].
Events are free, staffed [by thousands of volunteers].
(began 为 begin 的过去式。)
Runners range [from four years old] [to grandparents]; their times range [[from Andrew Baddeley's world record]] 13 minutes [48 seconds] [up to an hour].

Parkrun is succeeding || where London's Olympic "legacy" is failing.
[Ten years ago] [on Monday], it was announced | that the Games (of the 30th Olympiad) would be in London.
Planning documents pledged | that the great legacy (of the Games) would be to lever a nation (of sport lovers) away from their couches.
The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened.
(fitter 为 fit 的比较级形式, healthier 为 healthy 的比较级形式)
The number (of adults doing weekly sport) did rise, [by nearly 2 million] [in the run-up] [to 2012] -- || but the general population was growing faster.
[Worse], the numbers are [now] falling [at an accelerating rate].
The opposition claims | primary school pupils doing [at least] two hours (of sport) [a week] have [nearly] halved.
Obesity has risen [among adults and children].
(risen 为 rise 的过去分词。children 为 child 的复数形式。faster 为 fast 的比较级形式, worse 为 badly 的比较级形式)
Official retrospections continue [as to {why London 2012 failed to "inspire a generation}]." The success (of Parkrun) offers answers.

Parkrun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock.
The ethos welcomes anybody.
There is as much joy [over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped [over the line]] || as there is [about top talent shining].
The Olympic bidders, <by contrast>, wanted to get more people doing sport and to produce more elite athletes.
The dual aim was mixed up: The stress (on success (over taking part)) was intimidating [for newcomers].

[Indeed], there is something [(a little] absurd) [in the state] getting involved in the planning (of such a fundamentally "grassroots" concept as community sports associations).
If there is a role [for government], || it should really be getting involved in providing common goods -- making sure | there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision (of all these activities) in schools.
But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention [on sport] [in education].
[Instead of wordy, worthy strategies], future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive.
Or [at least] not make them worse.
(worse 为 bad 的比较级形式)

21. [According to Paragraph1], Parkrun has__________.
(A) created many jobs 
(B) gained great popularity

[With so much focus (on children's use (of screens))], it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use.
"Tech is designed to really suck you in," says Jenny Radesky [in her study (of digital play)]," and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement.
It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over [into the family routine]."
(children 为 child 的复数形式。it's = it is)

Radesky has studied the use (of mobile phones and tablets) [at mealtimes] [by giving mother] -- || child pairs a food-testing exercise.
She found | that mothers (who used devices [during the exercise]) started 20 per cent fewer (verbal) and 39 per cent fewer nonverbal interactions [with their children].
(found 为 find 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。fewer 为 few 的比较级形式)
[During a separate observation], she saw | that phones became a source (of tension) [in the family].
Parents would be looking at their emails || while the children would be making excited bids [for their attention].
(saw 为 see 的过去式。became 为 become 的过去式。children 为 child 的复数形式。)

Infants are wired to look at parents' faces to try to understand their world, || and if those faces are blank and unresponsive -- || as they often are || when absorbed [in a device] -- || it can be extremely disconcerting [for the children].
Radesky cites the "still face experiment" devised [by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick] [in the 1970s].
(children 为 child 的复数形式。)
[In it], a mother is asked to interact with her child [in a normal way] [before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback]: The child becomes increasingly distressed || as she tries to capture her mother's attention.
"Parents don't have to be [exquisitely] present at all times, || but there needs to be a balance || and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions (of an emotional need)," says Radesky.
(don't = do not)

[On the other hand], Tronick himself is concerned | that the worries (about kids' use (of screens)) are born [out of an "oppressive ideology (that demands | that parents should always be interacting" with their children)]: "It's based on a somewhat fantasised, very white, very uppermiddle-class ideology (that says | if you're failing to expose your child to 30,000 words (you are neglecting them))."
(children 为 child 的复数形式。) (It's = It is, you're = you are)
Tronick believes | that just because a child isn't learning from the screen| doesn't mean | there's no value [to it] -- [particularly] || if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break [from their child].
Parents, <he says>, can get a lot [out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work [out of the way]].
(isn't = is not, doesn't = does not, there's = there is)
This can make them feel happier, (which lets them be more available [to their child] [the rest of the time]).
(happier 为 happy 的比较级形式)

26. [According to Jenny Radesky], digital products are designed to_______.
(A) absorb user attention
(B) increase work efficiency
(C) simplify routine matters 
(D) better interpersonal relations 
27. Radesky's food-testing exercise shows that mothers' use (of devices_______).
(A) takes away babies' appetite
(B) distracts children's attention
(C) slows down babies' verbal development
(D) reduces mother-child communication
(children 为 child 的复数形式。better 为 good 的比较级形式)
28. Radesky cites the "still face experiment" to show that_______.
(A) it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions
(B) verbal expressions are unnecessary [for emotional exchange]
(C) parents need to respond to children's emotional needs
(D) children are insensitive [to changes (in their parents' mood)]
(children 为 child 的复数形式。)
29. The oppressive ideology mentioned [by Tronick] requires parents to_______.
(A) protect kids from exposure (to wild fantasies)
(B) teach their kids [at least] 30,000 words [a year]
(C) remain concerned about kids' use (of screens)
(D) ensure constant interaction (with their children) 
30. [According to Tronick], kids' use (of screens may_______).
(A) make their parents more creative
(B) give their parents some free time
(C) help them with their homework
(D) help them become more attentive

[Today], widespread social pressure to immediately go to college [in conjunction] [with increasingly high expectations] [in a fast-moving world] often causes students to completely overlook the possibility (of taking a gap year).
[After all], if everyone (you know) is going to college [in the fall], || it seems silly to stay [back] a year, || doesn't it?
And [after going to school [for 12 years]], it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something (that isn't academic).
(doesn't = does not, isn't = is not)

But while this may be true, || it's not a good enough reason to condemn gap years.
There's [always] a constant fear (of falling behind everyone else [on the socially perpetuated "race] [to the finish line])," || whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or a lucrative career.
But [despite common misconceptions], a gap year does not hinder the success (of academic pursuits) -- [in fact], || it probably enhances it.
(it's = it is, There's = There is)

Studies (from the United States and Australia) show | that students (who take a gap year) are [generally] [better] prepared for and perform [better] [in college] [than those (who do not)].
[Rather than pulling students back], a gap year pushes them [ahead] [by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes] -- all things (that first-year students often struggle [with the most]).
(better 为 well 的比较级形式)
Gap year experiences can lessen the blow || when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities [rather than acclimation blunders].
(thrown 为 throw 的过去分词。easier 为 easy 的比较级形式)

If you're not convinced of the inherent value [in taking a year off to explore interests], || then consider its financial impact [on future academic choices].
[According to the National Center (for Education Statistics)], nearly 80 percent (of college students) end up changing their majors [at least once].
(you're = you are)
This isn't surprising, || considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students [with a poor understanding (of the vast academic possibilities (that await them [in college]))].
Many students find themselves listing one major [on their college applications], || but switching to another [after taking college classes].
(isn't = is not)
It's not [necessarily] a bad thing, || but [depending on the school], it can be costly to make up credits [after switching [too late] [in the game]].
[At Boston College], [for example], you would have to complete an extra year || were you to switch to the nursing school [from another department].
Taking a gap year to figure things out [initially] can help prevent stress and save money [later on].
(It's = It is)

31. One (of the reasons (for high-school graduates not taking a gap year)) is that_______.
(A) they think it [academically] misleading
(B) they have a lot of fun to expect [in college]
(C) it feels strange to do [differently] [from others]
(D) it seems worthless to take off-campus courses 
32. Studies (from the US and Australia) imply that taking a gap year helps_______.
(A) relieve freshmen (of pressures )
(B) lower risks (in choosing careers ) 
(C) ease freshmen's financial burdens 
(D) keep students [from being unrealistic ].
33. The word" acclimation" (Para.3) is closest [in meaning to _______].
(A)motivation 
(B) application 
(C) competition 
(D) adaptation
(freshmen 为 freshman 的复数形式。lower 为 low 的比较级形式, closest 为 close 的最高级形式)
34. A gap year may save money for students [by helping them_______].
(A) switch to another college
(B) decide on the right major
(C) avoid academic failures
(D) establish long-term goals 
35. The most suitable title [for this text] would be_______.
(A) In Favor (of the Gap Year )
(B) The ABCs (of the Gap Year )
(C) The Gap Year Comes Back 
(D) The Gap Year: A Dilemma

Text 4
Though often viewed as a problem (for western states), || the growing frequency (of wildfires) is a national concern [because of its impact] [on federal tax dollars], || says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist (in fire ecology) and management.

[In 2015], the US Forest Service (for the first time) spent more than half (of its $5.5 billion annual budget) fighting fires-- nearly double the percentage (it spent on such efforts [20 years ago]).
[In effect], fewer federal funds (today) are going [towards the agency's other work] -- such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep -- || that affect the lives (of all Americans).
(spent 为 spend 的过去式。lives 为 life 的复数形式。fewer 为 few 的比较级形式)

Another nationwide concern is | whether public funds (from other agencies) are going into construction [in fire-prone districts].
As Moritz puts it, || how often are federal dollars building homes (that are likely to be lost [to a wildfire])?

"It's [already] a huge problem (from a public expenditure perspective) [for the whole country]," he says.
"We need to take a magnifying glass to that.
Like, 'Wait [a minute], is this OK?' 
Do we want [instead] to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts (of the landscape)?"
(It's = It is)

Such a view would require a corresponding shift [in] the way US society (today) views fire, || researchers say.

[For one thing], conversations (about wildfires) need to be more inclusive.
[Over the past decade], the focus has been on climate change -- | how the warming (of the Earth (from greenhouse gases)) is leading to conditions (that worsen fires).

While climate is a key element, || Moritz says, || it shouldn't come [at the expense (of the rest (of the equation))].
(shouldn't = should not)

"The human systems and the landscapes (we live on) are linked, || and the interactions go both ways," he says.
Failing to recognize that, <he notes>, leads to "an overly simplified view (of {what the solutions might be}).
Our perception (of the problem) and of {what the solution is} becomes very limited."

[At the same time], people continue to treat fire as an event (that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed [only out of necessity]), || says Professor Balch [at the University (of Colorado)].
But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence [in human life] is an attitude (crucial) (to developing the laws, policies, and practices (that make it as safe as possible)), || she says.

"We've disconnected ourselves from living [with fire]," Balch says.
"It is really important to understand and try and tease out | what is the human connection [with fire] [today]."

36. More frequent wildfires have become a national concern || because [in 2015] they_______.
(become 为过去分词，与其动词原形拼写相同。we've = we have)
(A) consumed a record-high (percentage (of budget ) 
(B) severely damaged the ecology (of western states) 
(C) caused a huge rise (of infrastructure expenditure) 
(D) exhausted unprecedented management efforts 
37. Moritz calls for the use (of "a magnifying glass" to_______).
(A) avoid the redirection (of federal money)
(B) find wildfire-free parts (of the landscape 
(C) raise (more funds (for fire-prone areas)) 
(D) guarantee safer spending (of public funds)
38. While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that_______.
(A) public debates have not settled [yet]
(B) a shift (in the view (of fire)) has taken place
(C) other factors should not be overlooked 
(D) | fire-fighting conditions are improving
(taken 为 take 的过去分词。)
39. The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result (of failing to_______).
(A) discover the fundamental makeup (of nature)
(B) explore the mechanism (of the human systems)
(C) understand | the interrelations (of man and nature ) 
(D) maximize the role (of landscape) [in human life 40].
Professor Balch points out | that fire is | something man should_______.
(A) do away [with]
(B) come to terms [with]
(C) pay a price for 
(D) keep away [from]

The decline (in American manufacturing) is a common refrain, [particularly] [from Donald Trump].
"We don't make anything [anymore]," he told Fox News, || while defending his own made-in-Mexico clothing line.
(told 为 tell 的过去式。don't = do not)

[Without question], manufacturing has taken a significant hit [during recent decades], || and further trade deals raise questions (about {whether new shocks could hit manufacturing}).
(taken 为 take 的过去分词。)

But there is [also] a different way to look at the data.

[Across the country], factory owners are [now] grappling with a new challenge: [Instead of having too many workers], they may end up [with too few].
[Despite trade competition and outsourcing], American manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers [every year].
Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place.
Other industries are recruiting them [with similar or better pay].
(better 为 good 的比较级形式)

[For factory owners], it all adds up to stiff competition [for workers] -- and upward pressure (on wages).
"They're harder to find || and they have job offers," says Jay Dunwell, president (of Wolverine Coil Spring), a family-owned firm.
(they're = they are, harder 为 hard 的比较级形式)

"They may be coming ([into the workforce]), || but they've been plucked [by other industries (that are [also] doing as well as manufacturing)]," Mr.
Dunwell has begun bringing high school juniors to the factory || so they can get exposed to its culture.
(begun 为 begin 的过去分词。they've = they have)

[At RoMan Manufacturing, a maker (of electrical transformers) and welding equipment (that his father cofounded [in 1980])], Robert Roth keeps a close eye on the age (of his nearly 200 workers).
Five are retiring [this year].
Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a workplacement program, [with a starting wage (of $13 (an hour (that rises [to $17] || after two years)))]
(has 为 have 的第三人称单数形式。)

[At a worktable (inside the transformer plant)], young Jason Stenquist looks flustered [by the copper coils (he's trying to assemble) and the arrival (of two visitors)].
It's his first week [on the job].
[Asked about his choice (of career)], he says | [at high school] he considered medical school [before switching to electrical engineering].
"I love working [with tools].
I love creating," he says.

But [to win [over these young workers]], manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle: parents, (who lived through the worst US economic downturn (since the Great Depression)), telling them to avoid the factory.
Millennials "remember | their father and mother both were laid off.
They blame it on the manufacturing recession," says Birgit Klohs, chief executive (of The Right Place), a business development agency (for western Michigan).
(laid 为 lay 的过去分词。worst 为 bad 的最高级形式)

These concerns aren't misplaced: Employment (in manufacturing) has fallen [from 17 million] [in 1970] [to 12 million] [in 2015].
When the recovery began, || worker shortages first appeared [in the high-skilled trades].

"The gap is between the jobs (that take no skills) and those (that require a lot of skill)," says Rob Spohr, a business professor (at Montcalm Community College).
"There're enough people to fill the jobs [at McDonalds and other places (where you don't need to have much skill)].
It's that gap in between, || and that's | where the problem is."
(there're = there are, don't = do not, It's = It is, that's = that is)

Julie Parks (of Grand Rapids Community College) points to another key (to luring Millennials into manufacturing): a work/life balance.
While their parents were content to work long hours, || young people value flexibility.
"Overtime is not attractive [to this generation].
They really want to live their lives," she says.

My dream has [always] been to work [somewhere] [in an area] [between fashion and publishing].

Why do people read negative Internet comments and do other things (that will [obviously] be painful)? 
Because humans have an inherent need [to 1 uncertainty], [according to a recent study] [in Psychological Science]. 
The new research reveals | that the need to know is so strong || that people will 2 to satisfy their curiosity || [even] when it is clear | the answer will 3.

[In a series (of four experiments)], behavioral scientists (at the University Of Chicago) and the Wisconsin School (of Business) tested students' willingness [to 4] themselves [to unpleasant stimuli] [in an effort to satisfy curiosity].
[For one] 5, each participant was shown a pile (of pens (that <the researcher claimed> were from a previous experiment)). 
The twist? Half (of the pens) would [6 an electric] shock [when clicked]

Twenty-seven students were told | which pens were electrified; another twenty-seven were told [only] | that some were electrified. 
7 left alone [in the room, the students (who did not know | which ones would shock them| clicked more pens and incurred more shocks || than the students (who knew | what would 8))]
Subsequent experiments reproduced this effect [with other stimuli], 9 the sound (of fingernails (on a chalkboard) and photographs (of disgusting insects)).
(stimuli 为 stimulus 的复数形式。)

The drive (to 10) is deeply rooted in humans, much the same as the basic drives (for 11 or shelter), || says Christopher Hsee (of the University of Chicago). Curiosity is [often] considered a good instinct -- || it can 12 new scientific advances, [for instance] -- || but [sometimes] such 13 can backfire. The insight (that curiosity can drive you to) do 14 things is a profound one.

Unhealthy curiosity is possible [to 15], [however]. [In a final] experiment, participants (who were encouraged [to 16]) how they would feel [after viewing an unpleasant picture] | were less likely [to 17] to see such an image.
These results suggest | that imagining the 18 (of following through [on one's curiosity] [ahead of time]) can help determine 19 it is worth the endeavor.

Text 1
It is curious | that Stephen Koziatek feels (almost) as though he has to justify his efforts to give his students a better future.

Mr. Koziatek is part (of something) pioneering. He is a teacher [at a New Hampshire high school (where learning is not something (of books and tests and mechanical memorization), but practical)]. 
When did it become accepted wisdom (that students should be able to name the 13th president (of the United States)) but be [utterly] overwhelmed [by a broken bike chain]?

[As Koziatek] knows,  there is learning [in {just}] about everything. Nothing is [necessarily] gained [by forcing students] to learn geometry [at a graffitied desk (stuck with generations)] of discarded chewing gum.
They can also learn geometry [by assembling a bicycle].

But he's [also] found a kind (of insidious prejudice). Working [with your hands] is seen [as almost a mark (of inferiority)]. 
Schools (in the family (of vocational education "))have that stereotype... that it's for kids (who can't make it) [academically] |," he says.
he's = he has, it's = it is, can't = can not

[On one hand],that viewpoint is a logical product (of America's evolution).
Manufacturing is not the economic engine (that it once was) 
The job security (that the US economy once offered to high school graduates) has [largely] evaporated. 
More education is the new principle. We want more for our kids, || and [rightfully] so.

But the headlong push into bachelor's degrees (for all -- and the subtle devaluing [of anything (less)] --)) misses an important point: 
That's not the only thing (the American economy needs). Yes, a bachelor's degree opens more doors. 
But [even now], 54 percent (of the jobs (in the country)) are middle-skill jobs, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. 
But [only] 44 percent (of workers) are [adequately] trained.
(That's = That is)

[In other words], at a time (when the working class has turned the country on its political head, frustrated | that the opportunity (that once defined America is vanishing, || one obvious solution is staring us in [the face])).
There is a gap [in working-class jobs], || but the workers (who need those jobs [most]) aren't equipped to do them. 
Koziatek's Manchester School (of Technology High School) is trying to fill that gap.

Koziatek's school is a wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, || it risks overlooking a nation's diversity (of gifts).

21. A broken bike chain is mentioned to show students' lack of______.
(A)practical ability (B) academic training 
(C) pioneering spirit (D) mechanical memorization 
22.There exists the prejudice (that vocational education is [for kids who______]).
(A)have a stereotyped mind(B)have no career motivation
(C)are not academically successful (D) are [financially] disadvantaged
23. We can infer [from Paragraph 5] | that high school graduates______.
(A)used to have big financial concerns(B)used to have more job opportunities
(C)are reluctant to work [in manufacturing](D) are entitled to more educational privileges
24. The headlong push (into bachelor's degrees (for all______)).
(A)helps create a lot of middle-skill jobs(B)may narrow the gap [in working-class jobs]
(C)is expected to yield a better-trained workforce(D) indicates the overvaluing [of higher education ]. 
25.The author's attitude (toward Koziatek's school) can be described as______.
(A)supportive(B)tolerant(C) disappointed (D) cautious

While fossil fuels--coal, <oil>, gas -- still generate roughly 85 percent (of the world's energy supply), it's clearer || than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources (such as wind and solar) |. 
The move (to renewables) is picking up momentum [around the world]: They now account for more than half (of new power sources) going on line.
（it's = it is， clear 更为 clear 的比较级形式）

Some growth stems from a commitment [by governments and farsighted businesses] to fund cleaner energy sources.  
But [increasingly] the story is about the plummeting prices (of renewables), especially wind and solar. 
The cost (of solar panels) has dropped [by 80 percent and the cost (of wind turbines)] [by close] [to one-third] [in the past eight years].
(cleaner 为 clean 的比较级形式)

[In many parts (of the world renewable energy)] is [already] a principal energy source.
[In Scotland], [for example],  wind turbines provide enough electricity (to power) 95 percent (of homes).
While the rest (of the world) takes the lead, notably China and Europe, || the United States is [also] seeing a remarkable shift.
[In March], [for the first time], wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent (of the power generated [in the US]), || reported the US Energy Information Administration.

President Trump has underlined fossil fuels -- <especially coal> -- [as the path] [to economic growth]. 
[In a recent speech] [in Iowa], he dismissed wind power [as an unreliable energy source].

The question "(what happens) || when the wind doesn't blow || or the sun doesn't shine?" has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. 
But a boost (in the storage capacity (of batteries)) is making their ability to keep power flowing [around the clock] [more likely].
(doesn't = does not)

The advance is driven [in part] [by vehicle manufacturers, (who are placing big bets on battery-powered electric vehicles)]. 
Although electric cars are [still] a rarity [on roads] [now], || this massive investment could change the picture [rapidly] [in coming years].
(driven 为 drive 的过去分词。)

While there's a long way to go, || the trend lines (for renewables) are spiking.
The pace (of change (in energy sources)) appears to be speeding up – [perhaps] [just in time to have a meaningful effect [in slowing climate change]]. 
What Washington does--or doesn't do -- to promote alternative energy may mean [less] and less [at a time (of a global shift)] [in thought].
(there's = there is, doesn't = does not)

26. The word" plummeting" (Para.2) is closest [in meaning to______]. 
(A)rising (B) falling 
(C) changing (D) stabilizing
27. [According to Paragraph 3], the use (of renewable energy (in America_____)). 
(A)is as extensive as in Europe(B)is progressing [notably]
(C) has proved to be impractical (D) | faces (many challenges)
28. It can be learned | that [in Iowa], ____. 
(A)wind energy has replaced fossil fuels(B)there is a shortage (of clean energy supply)
(C)tech giants are investing in clean energy(D)wind is a widely used energy source
29. Which of the following is true [about clean energy] [according to Paragraphs 5] & 6? 
(A)Its application has boosted battery storage.(B)It is [commonly] used [in car manufacturing]. 
(C)Its continuous supply is becoming a reality.(D)Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult.
30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph | that renewable energy____. 
(A)is not [really] encouraged [by the US government](B)is not competitive enough [with regard] [to its cost] 
(C)will bring the US (closer to other countries)(D) will accelerate global environmental change
(closer 为 close 的比较级形式)

The power and ambition (of the giants (of the digital economy)) is astonishing -- || Amazon has [just] announced the purchase (of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods) [for $13.5bn], || but [two years ago] Facebook paid [even more than that] to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service,(which doesn't have any physical product [at all]).
（paid 为 pay 的过去式。not = does not）
What WhatsApp offered Facebook| was an intricate and finely detailed web (of its users' friendships and social lives).
（lives 为 life 的复数形式。）

Facebook promised the European commission [then] | that it would not link phone numbers to Facebook identities, || but it broke the promise [almost as soon] as the deal went through. Even without knowing | what was in the knowledge (of {who sent them and [to {whom}]}) was [enormously] revealing and still could be.
(broke 为 break 的过去式。went 为 go 的过去式。sent 为 send 的过去式。)

What political journalist, what party whip, would not want to know the makeup (of the WhatsApp groups (in which Theresa May's enemies are [currently] plotting))? It may be | that the value (of Whole Foods (to Amazon)) is not so much [the 460] shops (it owns, (but the records of which customers have purchased what)).

Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances (of power). But it is clumsy. 
[For one thing], it is very slow compared to the pace (of change) [within the digital economy]. 
[By the time (a problem has been addressed and remedied it)] may have vanished [in the marketplace], to be replaced [by new abuses (of power)]. 
But there is a deeper conceptual problem, [too].
(deeper 为 deep 的比较级形式)
Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage [to consumers] || and this is not obvious || when the users (of these services) don't pay for them. 
The users (of their services) are not their customers. 
That would be the people (who buy advertising from them) -- || and Facebook and Google, <the two virtual giants>, dominate digital advertising [to the disadvantage (of all other media and entertainment companies)].
(media 为 medium 的复数形式。don't = do not)

The product (they're selling) is data, || and we, <the users>, convert our lives to data [for the benefit (of the digital giants)].
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。they're = they are)
Just as some ants farm || the bugs called aphids for the honeydew (they produce) || when they feed, || so Google farms us [for the data (that our digital lives yield)]. 
Ants keep predatory insects away [from {where their aphids feed}]; 
Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes.
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。)

31. [According to Paragraph1], Facebook acquired WhatsApp [for its______]. 
(A)digital products (B) quality service 
(C) physical assets (D) user information 
32.Linking phone numbers to Facebook identities [may]______. 
(A)pose a risk [to Facebook users](B)mislead the European commission 
(C) worsen political disputes (D) mess [up customer records]
33. [According to the author], competition law ______. 
(A)should serve the new market powers (B)may worsen the economic imbalance 
(C)cannot keep pace [with the changing market] (D) should not provide just one legal solution
34. Competition law as presently interpreted can hardly protect Facebook users || because ______. 
(A)they are not financially reliable (B) | they are not defined || as customers 
(C) the services are [generally] digital (D) | the services are paid for [by advertisers]
35. The ants analogy is used to illustrate ______. 
(A)a typical competition pattern (among digital giants 
(B) a win-win business model (between digital giants 
(C) the benefits)) provided for digital giants' customers 
(D) the relationship (between digital giants and their users)

Text 4
[To combat the trap (of putting a premium on)] being busy, <Cal Newport, <author (of Deep Work)>>:
Rules (for Focused Success (in a Distracted World)), recommends building a habit of "deep work" -- the ability to focus [without distraction].

There are a number of approaches (to mastering the art (of deep work))--be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a" journalistic" approach [to seizing moments (of deep work) [when you can]] throughout the day.
Whichever approach, || the key is to determine your length (of focus time) and stick to it.

Newport also recommends" deep scheduling" to combat constant interruptions and get more done [in less time]. ["At any given point], I should have deep work scheduled || for [roughly] [the next month].
[Once] on the calendar, I protect [this time] || like I would [a doctor's] appointment or important meeting," he writes.

Another approach (to getting more done [in less time]) is to rethink | how you prioritise your day-- [in particular] how we craft our to-do| lists. Tim Harford, author (of Messy): 
The Power (of Disorder to Transform Our Lives), points (to a study (in the early 1980s (that divided undergraduates into two groups))): some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan activities and golds [in much more detail], [day by day].
(lives 为 life 的复数形式。)

While the researchers assumed | that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective || when it came to the execution (of tasks), || they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues | that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, || while leaving room for improvisation [in such a list] can reap the best results.

In order to make the most (of our focus and energy), || we also need to embrace downtime, || or as Newport suggests, "be lazy." 
"Idleness is not [just] a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain || as vitamin D is to the body… (idleness) is, <paradoxically>, necessary to getting any work done," he argues.

Srini Pillay, <an assistant professor (of psychiatry (at Harvard Medical School))>, believes this counterintuitive link [between downtime] || and productivity may be due to the way (our brains operate). 
When our brains switch [between being focused and unfocused [on a task]], || they tend to be more efficient.

"What people don't realise | is | that in order to complete these tasks || they need to use both the focus and unfocus circuits [in their brain]," says Pillay. 

36. The key (to mastering the art (of deep work)) is to____. 
(A) list your immediate tasks (B) make specific daily plans 
(C) keep (to your focus time (D)) seize [every minute] to work
37. The study (in the early 1980s cited [by Harford]) shows that____. 
(A) daily schedules are indispensable to studying 
(B) students are [hardly] motivated [by monthly goals] 
(C) detailed plans may not be as fruitful as expected 
(D) distractions may actually increase efficiency
38. [According to Newport], idleness is ____. 
(A) an essential factor (in accomplishing any) work. 
(B) an effective way to save time and energy 
(C) a major contributor (to physical health) 
(D) a desirable mental state for busy people
39. Pillay believes | that our brains' shift (between being focused and unfocused______). 
(A) can result in psychological well-being (B) can bring about greater efficiency 
(C) is aimed at better balance [in work] (D) is driven [by task urgency]
(driven 为 drive 的过去分词。greater 为 great 的比较级形式, better 为 good 的比较级形式)
40. This text is [mainly] about______. 
(A) the key (to eliminating distractions )
(B) the cause (of the lack (of focus time ))
(C) ways to relieve the tension of busy life 
(D) approaches [to getting more done [in less time]]

Five ways to make conversation (with anyone)

Conversations are links, (which means | when you have a conversation (with a new person) || a link gets formed || and every conversation (you have [after that moment]) will strengthen the link).

You meet new people [every day]: the grocery worker, the cab driver, new people (at work) or the security guard (at the door). Simply starting a conversation (with them) will form a link. 
[Here] are five simple ways (that you can make the first move and start a conversation (with strangers)).
41._________________
Suppose you are in a room [with someone] || you don't know || and something (within you) says "I want to talk with this person" -- || this is something (that mostly happens [with all (of us)]). 
You wanted to say something -- the first word -- || but it just won't come out, || it feels | like it is stuck [somewhere]. 
I know the feeling || and [here] is my advice: just get it out.
(stuck 为 stick 的过去分词。don't = do not, won't = will not)

Just think: what is the worst (that could happen)? They won't talk with you? 
Well, they are not talking with you [now]! 
I truly believe | that once you get that first word out || everything (else) will [just] flow. So keep it simple: "Hi"," Hey" or "Hello"-- do the best (you can) to gather all (of the enthusiasm and energy (you can)), put on a big smile and say "Hi".
(won't = will not)
42.____________________
It's a problem (all (of us) face); you have limited time [with the person (that you want to talk with)] || and you want to make this talk memorable. [Honestly], if we got stuck in || the rut (of "hi)"," hello"," how are you?" and "what's going on?", you will fail to give the initial jolt to the conversation (that can make it so memorable).
(got 为 get 的过去式。It's = It is, what's = what is)
So don't be afraid to ask more personal questions. 
Trust me, || you'll be surprised to see | how much people are willing to share || if you just ask.
(don't = do not, you'll = you will)
43._______________
When you meet a person [for the first time], || make an effort to find the things (which you and that person have [in common]) || so that you can build the conversation from that point. 
When you start conversation [from there and then] | move [outwards], || you'll find [all of a sudden] | that the conversation becomes [a lot] easier.
(you'll = you will, easier 为 easy 的比较级形式)
44.__________
Imagine | you are pouring your heart out [to someone] || and they are just busy [on their phone], || and if you ask for their attention || you get the response "(I can multitask)". 
So when someone tries to communicate with you, || just be in that communication [wholeheartedly]. 
Make eye contact. Trust me, || eye contact is | where all the magic happens. 
When you make eye contact, || you can feel the conversation.
45.___________
You all came into a conversation (where you first met the person), || but [after some time] you may have met [again] and have forgotten their name. Isn't that awkward! 
So, remember the little details (of the people (you met)) || or you talked [with]; [perhaps] the places (they have been to), the places (they want to go), the things (they like), the things (they hate)-- whatever you talk about.
(came 为 come 的过去式。第1个 met 为 meet 的过去式。第2个 met 为 meet 的过去分词。forgotten 为 forget 的过去分词。第3个 met 为 meet 的过去式。isn't = is not)
When you remember such things || you can automatically become investor [in their wellbeing]. 
So they feel a responsibility [to you] to keep that relationship going. That's it.
Five amazing ways (that you can make conversation (with almost anyone)). 
Every person is a really good book to read, || or to have a conversation [with]!
(That's = That is)

Weighing yourself [regularly] is a wonderful way to stay aware of any significant weight fluctuations. 
1,when done [too often],this habit can sometimes hurt more [than it]2.

[As for me], weighing myself [every day] caused me to shift my focus [from being [generally] healthy and physically active [to focusing 3 on the scale]]. That was bad [to my overall fitness goals]. 
I had gained weight [in the form (of muscle mass)], || but [thinking [only] of 4 the number [on the scale]], 
I altered my training program. 
That conflicted with | how I needed to train [[to 5]] my goals.

I also found | that weighing myself [daily] did not provide an accurate 6 (of the hard work and progress (I was making [in the gym])). 
It takes about three weeks to a month to notice any significant changes (in your weight 7) altering your training program. 
The most 8 (changes will be observed [in]) skill level, strength and inches lost.

[For these 9], I stopped weighing myself [every day] and switched to a bimonthly weighing schedule 10. 
Since weight loss is not my goal, it is less important for me [to 11] my weight each week.

[Unlike so-called basic emotions (such as sadness)], fear, and anger, | guilt emerges [a little later], [in conjunction] [with a child's growing grasp (of social and moral norms)].
Children aren't born knowing | how to say "I'm sorry"; [rather], they learn [over time] | that such statements appease parents and friends -- and their own consciences.
This is | why researchers generally regard so-called moral guilt, [in the right amount], to be a good thing.

[In the popular imagination], [of course], guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable -- || it's the emotional equivalent (of wearing a jacket weighted with stones). 
Yet this understanding is outdated.
"There has been a kind (of revival) || or [a] [rethinking [about {what guilt is} and {what role guilt can serve}]], "says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researcher (at the University of Virginia), adding | that this revival is part (of a larger recognition (that emotions aren't binary))-- feelings (that may be advantageous [in one context]) may be harmful [in another].
Jealousy and anger, <for example>, may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities. 
Too much happiness can be destructive.

And guilt, <by prompting us to think [more deeply] about our goodness>, can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships. 
Guilt, <in other words>, can help hold a cooperative species [together]. 
It is a kind (of social glue).

[Viewed [in this light]], guilt is an opportunity. 
Work (by Tina Malti, <a psychology professor (at the University of Toronto)>,) suggests | that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. 
[In a number of studies], Malti and others have shown | that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing.
Some kids (who are low [in sympathy]) may make up for that shortfall [by experiencing more guilt, (which can rein [in their nastier impulses])]. And vice versa: 
High sympathy can substitute for low guilt.

[In a 2014 study], [for example], Malti looked at 244 children. 
[Using caregiver assessments and the children's self-observations], she rated each child's overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions [after moral transgressions].
[Then] the kids were handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to share them with an anonymous child.
[For the low-sympathy kids], how much they shared | appeared to turn on | how inclined they were to feel guilty.
The guilt-prone ones shared more, || even though they hadn't [magically] become more sympathetic to the other child's deprivation.

"That's good news," Malti says. "We can be prosocial || because we caused harm || and we feel regret."

21. Researchers think | that guilt can be a good thing || because it may help ____.
A. foster a child's moral development 
B. regulate a child's basic emotions 
C. improve a child's intellectual ability 
D. intensify a child's positive feelings 
22.[According to Paragraph 2], many people still consider guilt to be ____.
A. inexcusable 
B. deceptive 
C. addictive 
D. burdensome
23. Vaish holds | that the rethinking about guilt comes from an awareness (that ____).
A. emotions are context-independent 
B.an emotion can play opposing roles 
C. emotions are [socially] constructive 
D. emotional stability can benefit health 
24.Malti and others have shown that cooperation and sharing ____. 
A. may be the outcome (of impulsive acts ). 
B may help correct emotional deficiencies 
C. can bring about emotional satisfaction 
D. can result from either sympathy or guilt
25. The word" transgressions" (Para.5) is closest [in meaning to ____].
A. teachings 
B. wrongdoings 
C. discussions 
D. restrictions

Forests give us shade, quiet and one (of the harder challenges) [in the fight (against climate change)]. 
Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share (of the carbon dioxide (we produce)), || we are threatening their ability to do [so]. 
The climate change (we are hastening) could [one day] leave us [with forests (that emit more carbon || than they absorb)].

[Thankfully], there is a way [out of this trap] -- || but it involves striking a subtle balance. 
Helping forests flourish [as valuable "carbon sinks"] [long into the future]may require reducing their capacity to absorb carbon [now]. 
California is leading the way, || as it does [on so many climate efforts], [in figuring out the details].

The state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush [in parts (of the forest.)], || This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. 
But the remaining trees draw a greater share (of the available moisture), || so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to pull carbon [from the air].
Healthy trees are [also] better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable.
[Even in the event (of a fire)], fewer trees are consumed.

The need (for such planning) is increasingly urgent. [Already], [since 2010], drought and insects have killed [more than] 100 million trees [in California], most of them in 2016 [alone], || and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres.

California's plans [[to treat]] 35,000 acres (of forest) [a year] [by 2020, and 60,000] [by 2030]—financed [from the] proceeds of the state's emissions-permit auctions. 
That's [only] a small share (of the total acreage (that could benefit)), about half a million acres (in all), || so it will be vital to prioritize areas [at greatest risk (of fire or drought)].

The strategy also aims to ensure | that carbon (in woody material removed [from the forests]) is locked away [in the form (of solid lumber burned [as biofuel] [in vehicles (that would [otherwise] run on fossil fuels)])].
New research (on transportation biofuels) is [already] under way.

State governments are well accustomed to managing forests, || but [traditionally] they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities (for recreation). 
[Only] [recently] have they come to see | the vital part forests will have to play [in storing carbon]. 
California's plan, (which is expected to be finalized [by the governor] [next year]), should serve as a model.

26. By saying "one (of the harder challenges)," the author implies that____.
A. global climate change may get out of control 
B. forests may become a potential threat 
C. people may misunderstand global warming 
D. extreme weather conditions may arise
27. [To maintain forests] as valuable "carbon sinks," || we may need to____.
A. preserve the diversity (of species) [in them] 
B. lower their present carbon-absorbing capacity 
C. accelerate the growth (of young trees ). 
D strike a balance [among different plants]
28. California's Forest Carbon Plan endeavors to____.
A. restore its forests [quickly] [after wildfires]. 
B. cultivate more drought-resistant trees 
C. find more effective ways to kill insects 
D. reduce the density (of some (of its forest))
29. What is essential to California's plan [according to Paragraph 5]?
A. To obtain enough financial support. 
B. To carry it out [before the year (of 2020)]. 
C. To handle the areas [in serious danger] [first] .
D. To perfect the emissions-permit auctions.
30. The author's attitude (to California's plan) can best be described as____.
A. supportive 
B. ambiguous 
C. tolerant 
D. cautious

American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages [for several years]. 
The complaints are unlikely to stop [without an overhaul (of immigration rules)] [for farm workers].

Congress has obstructed efforts to create a more straightforward visa [for agricultural workers (that would let foreign workers stay [longer] in the U.S. and change jobs [within the industry])]. If this doesn't change, || American businesses, communities, and consumers will be the losers.

[Perhaps] half (of U.S. farm laborers) are undocumented immigrants. 
As fewer such workers enter the country, || the characteristics (of the agricultural workforce) are changing. 
Today's farm laborers, while still predominantly born [in Mexico], are more likely to be settled [rather than migrating] and more likely to be married [than single].

They're [also] aging. [At the start (of this century)], about one-third (of crop workers) were over the age (of 35). [Now], more than half are. And picking crops is hard [on older bodies]. 
One oft-debated cure (for this labor shortage) remains as implausible as it's been all (along): 
Native U.S. workers won't be returning to the farm.

Mechanization isn't the answer, [either]-- not yet, at least. Production (of corn), cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat have been [largely] mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, <such as strawberries>, need labor. 
[Even] dairy farms, (where robots do a small share (of milking)), have a long way to go || before they're automated.

[As a result], farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps [in the workforce].[Starting around 2012], requests (for the visas) rose [sharply]; [from 2011 to 2016] the number (of visas issued) [more than] doubled.

The H-2A visa has no numerical cap, [unlike the H-2B visa] [for nonagricultural work, (which is limited to 66,000 (a year))]. 
[Even so], employers complain | they aren't given all the workers (they need).
The process is cumbersome, expensive and unreliable.
One survey found that bureaucratic delays led the average H-2A workers to arrive on the job 22 days late.
The shortage is compounded [by federal immigration raids, (which remove some workers and drive others [underground])].

[In a 2012 survey], 71 percent (of tree-fruit growers) and almost 80 percent (of raisin and berry growers) said | they were short of labor. 
Some western farmers have responded [by moving operations] [to Mexico]. [From 1998 to 2000], 14.5 percent (of the fruit (Americans consumed)) was imported. 
[[Little more than] a decade later], the share (of imports) was 25.8 percent.

[In effect], the U.S. can import food || or it can import the workers (who pick it).

31. What problem should be addressed [according to the first two paragraphs]? 
A. Decline (of job opportunities (in U.S. agriculture)). 
B. Discrimination (against foreign workers (in the U.S.)) 
C. Biased laws [in favor (of some American businesses)]. 
D. Flaws (in U.S. immigration) rules [for farm workers].
32. One trouble [with U.S. agricultural workforce is____]. 
A. the aging (of immigrant) farm workers 
B .the rising number of illegal immigrants 
C. the high mobility (of crop workers ). 
D the lack (of experienced laborers)
33. What is the much-argued solution (to the labor shortage) [in U.S. farming]? 
A. To strengthen financial support [for farmers ]. 
B To attract younger laborers [to farm work]. 
C. To get native U.S. workers back [to farming]. 
D. To use more robots to grow high-value crops.
34. Agricultural employers complain about the H-2A visa [for its____].  
A. control (of annual admissions ). 
B. slow granting procedures  
C. limit on duration (of stay ).  
D. tightened requirements 
35.Which of the following could be the best title [for this text]? 
A. Manpower vs. Automation? 
B. U.S.. Agriculture (in Decline)? 
C. Import Food or Labor? 
D .America Saved [by Mexico]?

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dia Mirza and Adrian Grenier have a message [for you]: It's easy to beat plastic. They're part (of a bunch (of celebrities starring in a new video [for World Environment Day])) -- encouraging you, <the consumer>, to swap out your single-use plastic staples to combat the plastics crisis.

The key messages (that have been put [together] [for World Environment Day]) do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single-use plastics. 
But the overarching message is directed at individuals.

My concern (with leaving it [up to the individual], <however>,) is our limited sense (of {what needs to be achieved}).[On their own], taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws,<for example>, will accomplish [little] and require very little (of us).
They could even be harmful, <satisfying a need to have "done our bit" [without ever progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions]> -- | a kind (of "moral licensing" that) eases our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more (of those (in charge)).

While the conversation (around our environment) and our responsibility (toward it) remains centered [on shopping bags and straws], || we're ignoring the balance of power (that implies | that [as "consumers"] we must shop sustainably, rather than [as "citizens"] hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change).
(we're = we are)* while 为连词，引导状语从句。

It's important to acknowledge | that the environment isn't everyone's priority -- || or even most people's. We shouldn't expect it to be. [In her latest book, <Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things|>], 
Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues | that the best way to collectively change the behavior (of large numbers (of people)) is for the change to be structural.

This might mean implementing policy (such as a plastic tax (that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action)), or banning single-use plastics [altogether]. 

India has [just] announced | it will "eliminate all single-use plastic [in the country] [by 2022]." 
There are [also] incentive-based ways (of making better environmental choices easier), such as ensuring | recycling is [at least] as easy [as trash disposal].

DeSombre isn't saying | people should stop caring about the environment. It's just that individual | actions are too slow, || she says, for that to be the only, or even primary, approach (to changing widespread behavior).

None (of this) is about writing [off the individual]. It's [just about] putting things into perspective. 
We don't have time to wait. We need progressive policies (that shape collective action), [alongside engaged citizens pushing for change].

36. Some celebrities star in a new video to_______.
A. disclose the causes (of the plastics crisis ). 
B. demand new laws [on the use (of plastics )]. 
C. urge consumers to cut the use (of plastics ). 
D. invite public opinion [on the plastics crisis]
37. The author is concerned that "moral licensing" may _______. 
A. suppress our desire [for success ]. 
B. mislead us into doing worthless things  
C. prevent us from making further efforts  
D. weaken our sense (of accomplishment)
38. By pointing out our identity [as "citizens]," the author indicates that ______. 
A. We should press our government to lead the combat 
B. We have been [actively] exercising our civil rights 
C. our relationship (with local industries) is improving 
D. our focus should be shifted to community welfare
39. DeSombre argues | that the best way (for a collective change) should be ______. 
A. a top-down process 
B. a win-win arrangement 
C. a self-driven mechanism 
D. a cost-effective approach 
40.The author concludes that individual efforts ______. 
A. can be too aggressive 
B. can be too inconsistent 
C. are far from rational  
D. are far [from sufficient]

How seriously should parents take kid's opinions || when searching for a home?

[In choosing a new home], Camille McClain's kids have a single demand: a backyard.

McClain's little ones aren't the only kids (who have an opinion) || when it comes to housing, || and [in many cases] youngsters' views weigh [heavily] on parents' real estate decisions, [according to a 2018 Harris Poll survey (of [more than] 2,000 U.S. adults)].
(aren't = are not)

While more families buck an older-generation proclivity to leave || kids (in the dark (about real estate decisions)),realty agents and psychologists have mixed views [about the financial], personal and long-term | effects kids' opinions may have.

The idea (of involving children (in a big decision)) is a great idea || because it can help them feel a sense (of control and ownership) [in {what can be an overwhelming process}], || said Ryan Hooper, a clinical psychologist (in Chicago).

"Children may face serious difficulties [in coping with significant moves], || [especially] if it removes them [from their current school or support system]," he said.

Greg Jaroszewski, <a real estate brokerwith Gagliardo Realty Associates>, said | he's not convinced | that kids should be involved in selecting a home -- || but their opinions should be considered [in regards] [to proximity] [to friends and social activities], || if possible.

Younger children should feel | like they're choosing their home -- [without actually getting a choice [in the matter]], || said Adam Bailey, a real estate attorney (based in New York).

Asking them questions (about {what they like}) [about the backyard (of a potential home)] will make them feel | like they're being included [in the decision-making process], || Bailey said.
they're = they are

Many (of the aspects (of homebuying)) aren't a consideration [for children], || said Tracey Hampson, a real estate agent (based in Santa Clarita), Calif. 
And placing too much emphasis on their opinions can ruin a fantastic home purchase. 
aren't = are not, 

"Speaking with your children [before you make a real estate decision] is wise, but I wouldn't base the purchasing decision[solely] on their opinions." Hampson said.
wouldn't = would not

The other issue is | that many children -- <especially older ones> -- may base their real estate knowledge on HGTV shows, || said Aaron Norris (of The Norris Group (in Riverside), Calif). 

"They love Chip and Joanna Gaines [just as much] [as the rest (of us)],"hesaid."HGTV has [seriously] changed | how people view real estate. It's not shelter, || it's a lifestyle.  
[With that mindset change] come some serious money consequences.

Kids tend to get stuck in the features and the immediate benefits [to them] [personally], || Norris said.

Parents need to remind their children | that their needs and desires may change [over time], || said Julie Gurner, a real estate analyst (with Fit Small Business com.).

"Their opinions can change [tomorrow]." Gurner said. "Harsh as it may be to say, || that decision should likely not be made contingent on a child's opinions, but rather made [for them] [with great consideration] [into {what home can meet their needs [best]}]--- and give them an opportunity [to customize it] a bit and make it their own.

This advice is more relevant [now] || than ever before, || even as more parents want to embrace the ideas (of their children), || despite the current housing crunch.

41. Ryan Hooper
42. Adam Bailey
43. Tracey Hampson
44. Aaron Norris 
45. Julie Gurner 
A. remarks (that significant) moves may pose challenges to children. 
B. says (that it is wise to leave) kids [in the dark] [about real estate decisions]. 
C. advises (that home purchases) should not be based only on children's opinions. 
D. thinks (that children should) be given a sense (of involvement) [in homebuying decisions].
E. notes (that aspects (like children's friends and social activities) should) be considered [upon homebuying]. 
F. believes (that homebuying decisions should) be based on children's needs [rather than their opinions]. 
G. assumes (that many children's views (on real estate) are influenced by [the media]).

He had such a pleasant, readable style || that one might think | that anyone could imitate it.
How many times have I heard people say," I could write a book.I just haven't the time."
haven't = have not

Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy [in his early days] of, as he put it, || "having a go [at the writing game]". 
While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, || the final, polished work (that he gave to the world) was the result (of years (of practising, re-writing and reading)).
[Like the majority (of authors)], he had to suffer many disappointments and rejections [along the way], || but these made him all the more determined to succeed.

Being a good parent is | what every parent would like to be. 
But [defining {what it means} to be | a good parent is [undoubtedly] very 1], [particularly] since children respond [differently] to the same style (of parenting). 
A calm, rule-following child might respond [better] to a different sort (of parenting) [than], 2, a younger one.

3,there's another sort (of parent (that's easier [to 4])); a parent. 
Children (of every age) benefit from patient parenting.
Still,5,every parent would like to be patient, || this is no easy | 6, <sometimes>, parents get exhausted and arc unable to maintain a 7 style with their kids. 
I understand this.

You're [only] human, and [sometimes] your kids can 8 you just [a little] too far. 
And [then] the 9 happens: You lose your patience and either scream [at your kids] or say something (that was [too] 10 and does nobody any good).
You wish | that you could 11 the clock and start over. We've all been there.

12, even though it's common, it's vital to keep [in mind] | that in a single moment (of fatigue), you can say something to your child (that you) may 13 for a long time. 
This may not only do damage (to your relationship) [with your child] but also [14 your child's self-esteem].

If you consistently lose your 15 [with your kids], || [then] you are modeling a lack (of emotional control) [for your kids]. 
We are all becoming increasingly aware of the 16 (of modeling patience [for the younger generation]).
This is a skill (that will help them all [throughout life]). [In fact], the ability to maintain emotional control (when 17 (by stress) is one (of the most significant (of all life's skills))).

[Certainly], it's 18 to maintain patience at all times [with your kids]. 
A more practical goal is to try to be as calm as you can || when faced with 19 situations involving your children.
I can promise you this: [As a result (of working toward this goal)], you and your children will benefit || and 20 (from stressful moments feeling) better [physically] and emotionally.

Rats and other animals need to be [highly] at tuned to social signals from others so that can identify friends to cooperate with || and enemies to avoid.
To find out | if this extends to non-living beings, Loleh Quinn (at the University of California , San Diego), and her colleagues tested || whether rats can detect social signals [from robotic rats].

They housed eight adult rats [with two types (of robotic rat-one) social] || and one asocial -for 5 (our days). 
The robots rats were quite minimalist, resembling a chunkier version (of a computer mouse) [with wheels-to move around] || and colorful markings.

[During the experiment], the social robot rat followed the living rats around, played with the same toys, and opened caged doors to let trapped rats escape. Meanwhile, the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side (to side).

[Next], the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave the rats the opportunity to release them [by pressing a lever]. 
[Across 18 trials each], the living rats were 52 percent more [likely] [on average] to set the social robot free [than the asocial one]. 
This suggests | that the rats perceived the social robot [as a genuine social being].
They may have bonded more [with the social robot] || because it displayed behaviors (like communal exploring and playing). This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it [earlier], and wanting the robot to return the favour [when they get trapped], || says Quinn.

The readiness (of the rats to befriend the social robot) was surprising [given its minimal design]. 
The robot was the same size (as a regular rat) but resembled a simple plastic box [on wheels].
"We'd assumed | we'd have to give its moving head and tail, <facial features>, and put a scene on it to make it smell [like a real rat], || but that wasn't necessary," says Janet Wiles [at the University of Queensland] [in Australia, (who helped with the research)].

The finding shows | how sensitive rats arc [to social cues], || [even] when they come from basic robots. Similarly, children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings, [even] when they display [only] simple social signals. "We humans seem to be fascinated [by robots], and it turns out other animals are [too]," says Wiles.

21.Quinn and her colleagues conducted a test to see | if rats can. 
(A) pickup social signals (from non-living) rats 
(B) distinguish a friendly rat from a hostile one 
(C) attain sociable traits [through special training] 
(D) send out warning messages [to their fellow]
22.What did the social robot do [during the experiment]?
(A)It followed the social robot.

It is true | that CEO pay has gone up-top ones may make 300 times the pay (of typical workers) [on average], || and [since the mid-1970s] CEO pay (for large publicly traded American corporations) has, <by varying estimates>, gone up [by about 500%]. 
The typical CEO (of a top American corporation) now makes about S18.9 million a year.

The best model (for understanding the growth (of CEO pay)) is | that [of limited CEO] talent (in a world (where business opportunities (for the top) firms)) are growing [rapidly].
The efforts (of America's highest-earning 1%) have been one (of the more dynamic elements (of the global economy)). 
It's not popular to say, || but one reason (their pay has gone up [so much]) is | that CEOs really have upped their game (relative to many other workers) [in the U.S. economy].

Today's CEO, <at least (for major American firms)>, must have many mere skills [than simply being able to "run the company"], || CEOs must have a good sense (of financial markets) and [maybe] even | how the company should trade in them. 
They also need better public relations skills [than their predecessors], as the costs (of even a minor) slip up can be significant.

[Then] there's the fact (that large American companies are much more globalized || than ever before, [with supply chains spread [across a larger number of countries]]).
To lead [in that system] requires | knowledge (that is fairly mind-boggling plus, virtually all major | American companies are beyond this major CEOs) still have to do all the day-to-day work (they have [always] done).

26. Which of the following has contributed to CEO pay rise?
(A)The growth (in the number (of corporations)) 
(B)The general pay rise [with a better economy]
(C)Increased business opportunities (for top firms) 
(D)Close cooperation [among leading economies]
27.Compared (with their predecessors),today's CEOs are required to.
(A)foster a stronger sense (of teamwork) 
(B)finance more research and development
(C)establish closer ties [with tech companies] 
(D)operate more globalized companies
28.CEO pay has been rising [since the 1970s] [despite].
(A)continual internal opposition 
(B)strict corporate governance
(C)conservative business strategies 
(D)Repeated government warnings
29.High CEO pay can be justified [by the fact (that it helps)]
(A)confirm the status (of CEOs) 
(B)motivate inside candidates
(C)boost the efficiency (of CEOs) 
(D)increase corporate value
30.The most suitable title (for this text) would be.
(A)CEOs Are Not Overpaid 
(B)CEO Pay: Past and Present
(C)CEOs' challenges (of Today) 
(D)CEO Traits: Not Easy to Define

Madrid was hailed [as a public health beacon] [last November] || when it rolled out ambitious restrictions [on the most polluting cars]. 
[Seven months and one election day later], a new conservative city council suspended enforcement (of the clean air zone), a first step (toward its possible demise).

Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida made opposition [to the zone (a centerpiece (of his election) campaign)], [despite its success] [in improving air quality]. 
A judge has [now] overruled the city's decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. 
But [with legal battles ahead], the zone's future looks uncertain [at best].

[Among other weaknesses], the measures (cities must employ || when left to tackle dirty air [on their own]) are [politically] contentious, and [therefore] vulnerable. 
That's | because they inevitably put the costs (of cleaning (the air (on to individual drivers-who) must pay fees)) or buy better vehicles-rather- || than on to the car manufacturers (whose cheating is the real cause (of our toxic pollution)).

It's not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening [in London]. 
The new ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue [in next year's mayoral election]. 
And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads [in 2021] || as he intends, || it is sure to spark intense opposition [from the far larger number (of motorists) (who will)] then be affected.

It's not | that measures (such as London's Ulez) are useless. 
[Far from it] Local officials are using the levers (that are available [to them] to safeguard residents' health [in the face (of a serious threat)]). 
The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, || and the science tells us | that means real health benefits -fewer heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. Fewer untimely deaths.

But mayors and councilors can only do so much [about a problem (that is far bigger [than any one city or town])]. They are acting || because national governments-Britain and others (across Europe-have) failed to do [so].

Restrictions (that keep [highly] polluting cars out of certain areas -city) centres ,"school streets", [even] individual roads-are a response (to the absence (of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles [into compliance])).
Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimize pollution. 
We're doing everything but insist | that manufacturers clean up their cars.

31. Which of the following is true [about Madrid's clean air zone]? 
(A)Its effects are questionable 
(B)It has been opposed [by a judge] 
(C)It needs tougher enforcement 
(D)Its fate is yet to be decided
32. Which is considered a weakness (of the city-level) | measures to tackle dirty air?
(A)They are biased against car manufacturers. 
(B)They prove impractical [for city councils].
(C)They are deemed too mild [for politicians]. 
(D)They put too much burden on individual motorists.
33. The author believes | that the extension (of London's Ulez will___). 
(A)arouse strong resistance. 
(B)ensure Khan's electoral success.
(C)improve the city's traffic. 
(D)discourage car manufacturing.
34. Who <does the author think> should have addressed the problem?
(A)Local residents
(B)Mayors.
(C)Councilors.
(D)National governments.
35. It can be inferred from the last paragraph | that auto companies .
(A) will raise low-emission car production 
(B)should be forced to follow regulations
(C)will upgrade the design (of their vehicles) 
(D)should be put [under public supervision]

Now that members (of Generation Z arc graduating college (this spring-the most commonly-accepted definition says this generation))was born [after 1995],give or take a year-the attention has been rising [steadily] in recent weeks. 
GenZs are [about to hit the streets] looking for work [in a labor market (that's tighter || than it's been [in decades])].
And employers are planning on hiring about 17 percent more new graduates [for jobs] [in the U S].this year than last, [according to a survey conducted [by the National Association (of Colleges) and Employers]]. 
Everybody wants to know | how the people (who will [soon] inhabit those empty office cubicles) will differ from those (who came before them).

If "entitled" is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied [to millennials (those born [between 1981 and 1995])], || the catchwords (for Generation Z) are practical and cautious. 
[According to the career counselors and experts (who study them, <Generation Zs arc cl ear-eyed>, economic)] pragmatists.
[Despite graduating into the best economy [in the past 50 years]], 
Gen Zs know | what an economic train wreck looks like. 
They were impressionable kids [during the crash (of 2008)], || when many (of their parents) lost their jobs or their life savings or both.
They aren't interested in taking any chances. 
The booming economy seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational sense (of anxious urgency), [especially for those (who have college debt)]. 
College loan balances (in the U.S.) now stand at a record SI.5 trillion, [according to the Federal Reserve].

One survey (from Accenture) found | that 88 percent (of graduating seniors) [this year] chose their major [with a job] [in mind]. 
[In a 2019 survey (of University of Georgia students)], [meanwhile], the career office found | the most desirable trait (in a future employer) was the ability to offer secure employment (followed [by professional development and training, and [then] inspiring purpose]).
Job security or stability was the second most important career goal (work-life balance was number one), followed [by a sense (of being dedicated to a cause)] || or to feel good [about serving the greater good].

36. Generation Zs graduating college [this spring].
(A)are recognized [for their abilities] 
(B)are in favor (of job offers)

Five Ways to Win [Over Everyone] [in the Office]

Is it possible to like everyone [in your office]? 
Think about | how tough it is to get [together] 15 people, much less 50, (who all get along [perfectly]). 
But [unlike in friendships], you need coworkers. 
You work [with them] [every day] || and you depend on them || just as they depend on you.
[Here] are some ways (that you can get the whole office [on your side])
41.____
If you have a bone to pick [with someone] [in your workplace], || you may try stay (tight-lipped) [around them]. 
But you won't be helping either one (of you).
A Harvard Business School study found | that observers consistently rated those (who were frank about themselves [more highly]), || while those (who hid) lost trustworthiness. helesson is not | that you should make your personal life an open book, || but rather, <when given the option to offer [up details] [about yourself] or painstakingly conceal them>, you should just be honest.
42._____
[Just as important] as being honest about yourself is being receptive to others. 
We often feel the need to tell others | how we feel, || whether it's a concern (about a project, a stray thought, or a compliment). 
Those are all valid, || but you need to take time to hear out your coworkers, [too].
[In fact], rushing to get your own ideas [out there] can cause colleagues to feel | you don't value their opinions. Do your best to engage coworkers in a genuine, back- and-forth conversation, [rather than prioritizing your own thoughts].
43._____
It's common to have a"cubicle mate "or special confidant [in a work setting]. 
But [in addition (to those trusted coworkers)], you should expand your horizons and find out about all the people (around you). 
Use your lunch and coffee breaks to meet up with colleagues (you don't [always] see).
Find out about their lives and interests [beyond the job]. It requires minimal effort and goes a long way. 
This will help to grow your internal network, [in addition] [to being a nice break [in the work day]].
44._____
Positive feedback is important for anyone to hear. 
And you don't have to be someone's boss to tell them | they did an exceptional job [on a particular project].
This will help engender good will [in others].But don't overdo it or be fake [about it].
One study found | that people responded [best] to comments (that shifted [from negative to positive]),[possibly] because it suggested | they had won somebody over.
45._____
This one may be [a bit] more difficult to pull off, || but it can go a long way (to achieving results). 
Remember [[in dealing with any coworker]] | what they appreciate [from an interaction]. 
Watch out for | how they verbalize [with others].
Some people like small talk [in a meeting] [before digging into important matters], || while other are more straightforward. Jokes (that work one person won't [necessarily] land with another,) 
So, adapt your style [accordingly] to type. 
Consider the person (that you're dealing with [in advance]) and | what will get you [to your desired outcome].

It's [almost] impossible to go through life [without experiencing some kind (of failure)]. 
But, the wonderful thing (about failure) is | that it's entirely up [to us] to decide | how to look at it.
We can choose to see failure [as "the end (of the world)]". 
Or, we can look at failure [as the incredible learning experience (that it often is)]. 
Every time we fail [at something], || we can choose to look for the same lesson (we're meant to learn).
These lessons very important; they're | how we grow, and | how we keep [from making that same mistake [again]]. Failures stop us || [only] if we let them. 
Failure can also teach us things [about ourselves] (that we would [never] have learned [otherwise]).
[For instance], failure can help you discover | how strong a person you are. 
Failing [at something] can help you discover your truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.

It's not difficult to set targets for staff. 
It is much harder,1,to understand their negative consequences. 
Most work-related behaviours have multiple components.
2 one the others become distorted.

Travel [on a London bus] || and you'll 3 see | how this works [with drivers]. 
Watch people get on and show their tickets. Are they carefully inspected?
Never. Do people get on [without paying]?
Of course! Are there inspectors [to 4 (that people have paid)]? 
Possibly, but very few. And people (who run for the bus)? 
They are 5. How about jumping lights? Buses do so [almost as frequently] as cyclists.

Why? Because the target is 6. People complained | that buses were late and infrequent.
 7, <the number (of buses and bus lanes)> were increased, || and drivers were 8 or punished [according to the time (they took)].
 And drivers hit their targets. But they [9 hit cyclists].
If the target was changed to 10, || you would have more inspectors and more sensitive pricing.
If the criterion changed to safety, you would get more 11 drivers (who obeyed traffic laws). 
But both these criteria would be at the expense (of time).

There is another 12: people become immensely inventive [in hitting targets].
Have you 13 (that you can leave [on a flight] [an hour] [late]) but still arrive [on time]? 
Tailwinds? Of course not! Airlines have [simply] changed the time (a 14 is meant to take). 
A one-hour flight is [now] billed [as a two-hour flight].

The 15 (of the story) is simple. Most jobs are multidimensional, 
[with multiple criteria].Choose one criterion || and you may well 16 others. 
Everything can be done [faster] and made cheaper, || but there is a 17.
Setting targets can and does have unforeseen negative consequences.

This is not an argument [against target-setting].
But it is an argument [for exploring consequences [first]]. 
All good targets should have multiple criteria (18 critical factors (such as time)), 
money, quality and customer feedback.
The trick is not to 19 just one or even two dimensions (of the objective), || but [also] [to understand | how [to help people better 20] the objective].

"Reskilling" is something (that sounds like a buzzword but is [actually] a requirement) || if we plan to have a future (in which a lot of would-be workers do not get [left] behind).
We know | we are moving into a period (where the jobs (in demand) will change [rapidly]), || as will the requirements (of the jobs (that remain)).
Research (by the World Economic Forum) finds that [on average 42 per cent (of the "core skills "(within job roles) will change [by 2022])]. 
That is a very short timeline.

The question (of {who should pay for reskilling}) is a thorny one.
[For individual companies], the temptation is [always] to let go of workers (whose skills are [no longer] in demand and replace them with those (whose skills are)).
That does not [always] happen.
AT&T is [often] given [as the gold standard (of a company 
(that decided to do a massive reskilling program rather than go [with a fire-and-hire strategy]))].
Other companies had [also] pledged to create their own plans. 
When the skills mismatch is in the broader economy, <though>, || the focus usually turns to government to handle.
Efforts (in Canada and elsewhere) have been [arguably] languid [at best], and have given us a situation (where we frequently hear of employers begging for workers), [even at times] and in regions (where unemployment is high).

[With the pandemic], unemployment is very high [indeed]. 
In February, at 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, unemployment rates [in Canada] || and the United States were at generational lows || and worker shortages were everywhere.
[As of May], those rates had spiked up to 13.3 per cent and 13.7 per cent, || and although many worker shortages had disappeared, || not all had done [so].
[In the medical field], [to take an obvious example], the pandemic meant | that there were still clear shortages (of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel).
[Of course], it is not | like you can take an unemployed waiter and train him to be a doctor [in a few weeks].
But even if you cannot close the gap, || [maybe] you can close others, || and doing [so] would be to the benefit (of all concerned).
That seems to be the case [in Sweden]: When forced [to furlough 90 per cent (of their cabin staff)], 
Scandinavian Airlines decided to start [[up a short retaining program]] that reskilled (the laid-off workers to support hospital staff).
The effort was a collective one and involved other companies as well as a Swedish university.

21. Research [by the World (Economic Forum suggests)].
(A)an increase (in full-time employment) 
(B) an urgent demand (for new job skills) 
(C) a steady growth (of job opportunities) 
(D) a controversy (about the "core skills) "
22. AT&T is cited to show.
(A)an alternative (to the fire-and-hire strategy) 
(B) an immediate need (for government) support
(C) the importance (of staff appraisal standards) 
(D) the characteristics (of reskilling programs)
23. Efforts to resolve the skills mismatch (in Canada).
(A)have driven [up labour costs]
(B)have proved to be inconsistent
(C)have met with fierce opposition
(D) have appeared to be insufficient
24. We can learn [from Paragraph 3] | that there was.
(A)a call (for policy adjustment)

[With the global population predicted to hit [close to 10 billion] [by 2050, and forecasts (that agricultural production (in some regions) will need to nearly double to keep pace)]], food security is [increasingly] making headlines.
[In the UK], it has become a big talking point [recently] [too], [for a rather particular reason]: Brexit.

Brexit is seen [by some] [as an opportunity to reverse a recent trend (towards the UK)] importing food.
The country produces [only] about 60 per cent (of the food (it eats)),down from almost three-quarters (in the late 1980s).
A move (back to self-sufficiency, <the argument>) goes, would boost the farming industry, political sovereignty and [even] the nation's health Sounds great -- || but how feasible is this vision?
[According to a report] [on UK food production (from the University of Leeds, <UK>],) 85 per cent (of the country's total land area) is associated with meat and dairy production.
That supplies 80 per cent (of {what is consumed}), || so even covering the whole country in livestock farms wouldn't allow us to cover all our meat and dairy needs.
There are many caveats [to those figures], || but they are still grave.
[To become much more self-sufficient], the UK would need to drastically reduce its consumption (of animal foods), and [probably] also farm [more intensively] -- meaning fewer green fields, || and more factory-style production.

But switching to a[mainly] plant-based diet wouldn't help.
There is a good reason (why the UK is dominated [by animal husbandry]): most (of its terrain) doesn't have the right soil or climate to grow crops [on a commercial basis].
Just 25 per cent (of the country's land) is suitable for crop-growing, (most of which is [already] occupied [by arable fields]).
Even if we converted all the suitable land to fields (of fruit and veg)--which would involve taking out all the nature reserves and removing thousands of people (from their homes)--we would achieve [only] a 30 per cent boost [in crop production].

Just 23 per cent (of the fruit and vegetables consumed [in the UK]) are [currently] home-grown, || so [even] [with the most extreme measures] we could meet only 30 per cent (of our fresh produce needs).
That is | before we look for the space to grow the grains, sugars, seeds and oils (that provide us with the vast bulk (of our current calorie intake)).

26. Some people argue | that food self-sufficiency (in the UK) would.
(A)contribute to the nation's well-being
(B)become a priority (of the government)
(C)be hindered [by its population growth]
(D) pose a challenge [to its farming industry]
27. The report (by the University of Leeds) showed that [in the UK].
(A)more green fields will be converted || for farming 
(B) most land is used for meat || and dairy production 
(C) farmland has been inefficiently utilized 
(D) | factory-style production needs reforming
28. Crop-growing in the UK is restricted [due to].
(A)its dietary tradition 
(B) its natural conditions 
(C) its commercial interests 
(D) its farming technology
29. It can be learned from the last paragraph | that British people.
(A)are trying to grow new varieties (of grains)
(B)are seeking effective ways to cut calorie intake
(C) enjoy a steady rise (in fruit consumption) 
(D)rely [largely] on imports [for fresh produce]
30. The author's attitude (to food self-sufficiency (in the UK)) is.
(A)doubtful
(B)tolerant
(C)optimistic
(D)defensive

When Microsoft bought task management app Wunderlist and mobile calendar Sunrise [in 2015], || it picked two newcomers | that were attracting considerable buzz in Silicon Valley.
Microsoft's own Office dominates the market [for "productivity" software], || but the start-ups represented a new wave (of technology designed [from the ground (up)] [for the smartphone world]).

Both apps, <however>, were [later] scrapped || after Microsoft said | it had used their best features [in its own products].
Their teams (of engineers) stayed on, making them two (of the many "acqui-hires" (that the biggest companies have used to feed their great hunger [for tech talent])).

[To Microsoft's critics], the fates (of Wunderlist and Sunrise) are examples (of a remorseless drive) [by Big Tech] to chew up any innovative companies (that lie in their path).
"They bought the seedlings and closed them down," complained Paul Arnold, <a partner (at San Francisco-based Switch)> Ventures, putting an end to businesses (that might [one day] turn into competitors).
Microsoft declined to comment.

[Like other start-up investors], 
Mr Arnold's own business often depends on selling start-ups to larger tech companies, || though he admits to mixed feelings [about the result]: 
"I think | these things are good for me, || if I put my selfish hat on. But are they good for the American economy? I don't know."

The US Federal Trade Commission says | it wants to find the answer [to that question].[This week], it asked the five most valuable US tech companies for information (about their many small acquisitions) [over the past decade].
Although only a research project [at this stage], the request has raised the prospect (of regulators wading into early-stage tech markets) that until [now] have been beyond their reach.

[Given their combined market value (of more than $5.5 trillion)], rifling [through such small deals]--many (of them) much less prominent than Wunderlist and Sunnise--might seem beside the point.
[Between them], the five biggest tech companies have spent an average (of only $3.4 billion) [a year] [on sub-$1 billion acquisitions] [over the past five years] -- a drop (in the ocean compared with their massive financial reserves), || and the more [than $130 billion (of venture capital)] that was invested in the US [last year].

[However], critics say | the big companies use such deals to buy their most threatening potential competitors || before their businesses have a chance [to gain momentum], [in some cases] [as part (of a "buy)] and kill" tactic to simply close them down.

31. What is true [about Wunderlist and Sunrise] [after their acquisitions]?
(A)Their market values declined.
(B)Their tech features improved.
(C)Their engineers were retained.
(D)Their products were re-priced.
32. Microsoft's critics believe | that the big tech companies tend to.
(A)ignore public opinions
(B)treat new tech talent [unfairly]
(C)exaggerate their product quality
(D) eliminate their potential competitors
33. Paul Arnold is concerned | that small acquisitions might.
(A)harm the national economy
(B)worsen market competition
(C)discourage start-up investors
(D) weaken big tech companies
34. The US Federal Trade Commission intends to.
(A)examine small acquisitions
(B)limit Big Tech's expansion
(C)supervise start-ups' operations
(D) encourage research collaboration
35. [For the five biggest tech companies], their small acquisitions have.
(A)brought little financial pressure 
(B) raised few management challenges 
(C) set an example for future deals 
(D) generated considerable profits

We're fairly good at judging people (based on first impressions), thin slices (of experience ranging [from a glimpse (of a photo)] [to a five-minute interaction]), || and deliberation can be not only extraneous but intrusive.
In one study (of the ability (she called "thin slicing))," the late psychologist Nalini Ambady asked participants to watch silent 10-second video clips (of professors) and to rate the instructor's overall effectiveness.
Their ratings correlated [strongly] with students' end-of-semester ratings.
Another set (of participants) had to count backward [from 1,000] [by nines] || as they watched the clips, occupying their conscious working memory.
Their ratings were just as accurate, demonstrating the intuitive nature (of the social processing).

[Critically], another group was asked to spend a minute writing down reasons (for their judgment), [before giving the rating].
Accuracy dropped [dramatically]. Ambady suspected | that deliberation focused them on vivid but misleading cues, such as certain gestures or utterances, [rather than letting the complex interplay (of subtle signals) form a holistic impression].
She found | similar interference (when participants watched 15-second) clips of pairs (of people and judged)whether they were strangers, friends, or dating partners.

Other research shows | we're better at detecting deception [from thin slices] || when we rely on intuition [instead of reflection].
"It's | as if you're driving a stick shift," says Judith Hall, a psychologist (at Northeastern University)," and if you start thinking about it [too much], 
|| you can't remember | what you're doing. But if you go on automatic pilot, 
|| you're fine. Much (of our social life) is like that."

Thinking | too much can also harm our ability to form preferences. 
College students' ratings (of strawberry jams and college courses aligned [better] with experts' opinions (when the students weren't asked to analyze their rationale. ) )
And people made car-buying decisions (that were both [objectively] [better] and more [personally] satisfying) || when asked to focus on their feelings rather than on details, || but [only] if the decision was complex -- || when they had a lot of information to process.

Intuition's special powers are unleashed [only in certain circumstances].
[In one study], participants completed a battery (of eight tasks), including four (that tapped reflective thinking ([discerning rules, comprehending vocabulary]) and four (that tapped intuition and creativity (generating new products or figures (of speech)))).
[Then] they rated the degree (to which they had used intuition ( "gut feelings),""hunches,"" my heart").
Use (of their gut) hurt their performance [on the first four tasks, (as expected, and helped them [on the rest])].[Sometimes] the heart is smarter [than the head].

F. Ask permission to disagree. 
G. Identify a shared goal.
How to Disagree with Someone (More Powerful Than You)
Your boss proposes | a new initiative (you think) won't work. 
Your senior colleague outlines a project timeline (you believe) is unrealistic. 
What do you say || when you disagree with someone (who has more power || than you do)? 
How do you decide | whether it's worth speaking up?
And if you do, || what exactly should you say? [Here]'s how to disagree with someone (more powerful) [than you].
41.____
You may decide | it's best to hold off [on voicing your opinion]. 
[Maybe] you haven't finished thinking the problem through, || or you want to get a clearer sense (of {what the group thinks}).
If you think | other people are going to disagree, [too], || you might want to gather your army [first].
People can contribute experience or information to your thinking -- all the things (that would make the disagreement stronger or more valid).
It's [also] a good idea to delay the conversation || if you're in a meeting or other public space. 
Discussing the issue [in] private will make the powerful person feel less threatened.
42____
Before you share your thoughts, think (about {what the powerful person cares about}) -- || it may be the credibility (of their team or getting a project done [on time]). 
You're more likely to be heard || if you can connect your disagreement to a higher purpose.
State it [overtly], contextualizing your statements so that you're seen [not as a disagreeable subordinate] but as a colleague (who's trying to advance a common objective). 
The discussion will [then] become more like a chess game [than a boxing match].
43.____
This step may sound [overly] deferential, || but it's a smart way to give the powerful person psychological safety and control. You can say | something like," I know | we seem to be moving [toward a first-quarter commitment] [here].
I have reasons to think | that won't work. I'd like to lay out my reasoning. Would that be OK?" 
This gives the person a choice, allowing him to verbally opt in. 
And, [assuming | he says yes], it will make you feel more confident [about voicing your disagreement].
44.____
You might feel your heart racing or your face turning red, but do {whatever you can} to remain natural [in both your words and actions]. When your body language communicates reluctance or anxiety, || it undercuts the message.
It sends a mixed message, || and your counterpart gets to choose | what signals to read. Deep breaths can help, || as can speaking [more slowly] and deliberately. 
When we feel panicky, || we tend to talk [louder] and faster.
Simply slowing the pace and talking [in an even tone] helps the other person cool down and does the same for you. It also makes you seem confident, || even if you aren't.
45.____
Emphasize | that you're [only] offering your opinion, not gospel truth. 
It may be a well-informed, well-researched opinion, || but it's [still] an opinion, || so talk [tentatively] and slightly understate your confidence.
Instead of saying, "If we set an end-of-quarter deadline, || we'll [never] make it," say, "This is [just] my opinion, || but I don't see | how we will make that deadline."
[Having asserted your position (as a position, <not as a fact>)], demonstrate equal curiosity [about other views]. Remind the person | that this is your point of view, and [then] invite critique. Be open to hearing other opinions.

Section Ⅲ Translation
46. Directions: Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation [on the ANSWER | SHEET]. (15 points)

We tend to think | that friends and family members are our biggest sources (of connection, laughter, and warmth). While that may well be true, || researchers have [also] [recently] found | that interacting with strangers actually brings a boost in mood and feelings (of belonging) (that we didn't expect).

[In one series (of studies)], researchers instructed Chicago-area commuters using public transportation to strike up a conversation (with someone) [near them].
[On average], participants (who followed this instruction) felt better 
[than those (who had been told to stand or sit in silence)].
The researchers also argued | that when we shy away from casual interactions [with strangers], || it is [often] due to a misplaced anxiety | that they might not want to talk to us.
[Much of the time], [however], this belief is false. As it turns out, || many people are [actually] perfectly willing to talk-- || and may even be flattered to receive your attention.

Harlan Coben believes | that if you are a writer, || you will find the time; and that if you can't find the time, || [then] writing isn't a priority, || and you are not a writer. [For him], writing is a __1__ job -- a job (like any other). He has __2__ it [with plumbing], pointing out | that a plumber doesn't wake up and say | that he can't work [with pipes] [today].
(has 为 have 的第三人称单数形式。can't = can not, isn't = is not, doesn't = does not)

__3__, [like most writers] [these days], you're holding down a job to pay the bills, || it's not __4__ to find the time to write. But it's not impossible. It requires determination and single-mindedness. __5__ (that most bestselling authors began writing | when they were doing other things to earn a living). And [today], [even] writers (who are [fairly] __6__) often have to do other work (to __7__) their writing income.
(began 为 begin 的过去式。you're = you are, it's = it is)

As Harlan Coben has suggested | it's a __8__ (of priorities). [To make writing a priority], you'll have to __9__ (some (of your day-to-day activities and some things (you really enjoy))).
(it's = it is, you'll = you will)

[Depending on your __10__ and your lifestyle] that might mean spending less time watching television or listening to music, || though some people can write __11__ || they listen to music. You might have [to __12__] the amount (of exercise) or sport (you do). You'll have to make social media an __13__ activity [rather than a daily, time-consuming __14__].
(media 为 medium 的复数形式。you'll = you will)
There'll [probably] have to be [less] socializing with your friends and less time [with your family]. It's a _ 15_ learning curve, || and it won't [always] make you popular.
(there'll = there will, It's = It is, won't = will not)

There's just one thing (you should try to keep [at least] some time for), __16__ your writing and that 's reading. Any write needs to read [as much] and as wildly as they can. It's the one __17__ supporter -- something (you can't do without).
(There's = There is, It's = It is, can't = can not)

Time is finite. The older you get, the __18__ (it seems to go). We need to use it || as carefully || and [as __19__] as we can that means prioritizing [out activities] so that we spend most time on the things (we really want to do). If you are a writer, || that means __20__ writing.

[On a recent sunny day] 13,000 chickens roam over Larry Brown's 40 windswept acres [in Shiner, Texas]. Some rest [in the shade (of a parked car)], || others drink water [with the cows]. This all seems random, || but it's by design, part (of {what the $6.1 billion US}). egg industry bets will be its next big thing: climate-friendly eggs.

These eggs, which are making their debut (now) on| shelves [[for as much]] [[as $8]] a dozen, are still labeled organic and animal-friendly || but they're [also] from birds (that live on farms using regenerative agriculture-special techniques to cultivate rich soils (that can trap greenhouse gases)). Such eggs could be marketed [as helping to fight climate change].
(they're = they are)

"I'm excited about our progresses," says Brown, (who harvests eggs [for Denver-based Nest Fresh Eggs] and is adding more cover crops (that draw worms and crickets for the chickens to eat)). The birds' waste then fertilizes fields. Such improvements "allow our hens to forage for higher-quality natural feed (that will be good for the land, the hens, and the eggs (that we supply to our customers))."
(I'm = I am)

The egg industry's push is the first major test (of {whether animal products (from regenerative farms) can become the next premium offering}). [In barely [more than] a decade], organic eggs went [from being dismissed [as a niche product] [in natural foods stores] [to being sold at Walmart]]. [More recently] there were similar doubts [about probiotics and plant-based meats], || but both have exploded into major supermarket categories.
(went 为 go 的过去式。sold 为 sell 的过去分词。)
If the sustainable-egg roll (out) is successful, || it could open the floodgates for regenerative beef broccoli and beyond.

Regenerative products could be a hard sell, || because the concept is tough to define [quickly], || says Julie Stanton, associate professor (of agricultural economics (at Pennsylvania State University Brandywine)). Such farming also brings minimal, if [any], improvement (to the food products) (though some producers say | their eggs have more protein).

The industry is betting | that the same consumers paying more for premium attributes (such as free-range), non-GMO, and pasture-raised eggs will embrace sustainability. Surveys show | that younger generations are more concerned about climate change, || and some (of the success (of plant-based meat)) can be chalked [up to shoppers wanting to signal their desire to protect the environment].
(younger 为 young 的比较级形式)
Young adults "really care about the planet," says John Brunnquell altering the food chain [beyond {what I think | [even] they understand | what they're doing}]."
(they're = they are)

21. The climate-friendly eggs are produced __________ 
(A) at a considerably low cost 
(B) at the demand (of regular shoppers) 
(C) as a replacement (for organic eggs) 
(D) on specially designed farms
22. Larry Brown is excited about his progress [in __________] 
(A) reducing the damage (of worms) 
(B) accelerating the disposal (of waste) 
(C) creating a sustainable system 
(D) attracting customers [to his products]
23. The example (of organic eggs) is used [in the fourth paragraph] is to suggest ________ 
(A) the doubts (to over natural feeds) 
(B) the setbacks (in the eggs industry) 
(C) the potential (of regenerative products) 
(D) the promotional success (of super markets)
24. It can be learned from the last paragraph | that young people __________ 
(A) are reluctant to change their diet 
(B) are likely to buy climate-friendly eggs 
(C) are curious about new food 
(D) are amazed at agriculture advance

25. John Brunnquell would disagree with Julie Stanton [over regenerative products] [in __________] 
(A) markets prospects 
(B) nutritional value 
(C) standard definition 
(D) moral implication

More Americans are opting to work [well] into retirement, a growing trend (that threatens to upend the old workforce model).

One (in three Americans (who are at least 40)) have or plan to have a job [in retirement] to prepare for a longer life, [according to a survey conducted [by Harris Poll] [for TD Ameritrade]].
[Even] [more] surprising is that more || than half (of "unretirees" -- <those (who plan to work [in retirement] or went back to work [after retiring])> --) said | they would be employed in their later years || even if they had enough money to settle down, || the survey showed.
(went 为 go 的过去式。said 为 say 的过去式。)

Financial needs aren't the only culprit [for the "unretirement" trend]. 
Other reasons, <according to the study>, include personal fulfillment (such as staying [mentally] fit, preventing boredom or avoiding depression).
(aren't = are not)

About 72% (of "unretire" respondents) said | that they would return to work [once] retired to keep [mentally] fit || while 59% said | it would be tied to making ends meet.
(said 为 say 的过去式。)

"The concept (of retirement) is evolving,<" said Christine Russell>, senior manager (of retirement) [at TD Ameritrade]. 
"It's not just about finances. 
The value (of work) is [also] driving folks to continue working past retirement."
(said 为 say 的过去分词。It's = It is)

One reason (for the change (in retirement)) patterns: Americans are living [longer]. 
The share (of the population 65 and older) was 16%in 2018, [up 3.2%] [from the prior year], [according to the U.S Census Bureau]. 
That's [also] up 30.2% [since 2010].
(longer 为 long 的比较级形式, older 为 old 的比较级形式, That's = That is)

[Because of longer life spans], Americans are [also] boosting their savings to preserve their nest eggs, the TD Ameritrade study showed, (which surveyed 2000 adults [between 40] [to 79]). 
Six (in 10 "unretirees") are increasing their savings [in anticipation (of a longer life)], [according to the survey].
(longer 为 long 的比较级形式)
[Among the most] popular ways (they are doing this), <the company said>, is by reducing their overall expenses, securing life insurance or maximizing their contributions (to retirement accounts).
(said 为 say 的过去式。)

Unfortunately, any people (who are opting to work [in retirement]) are preparing to do [so] || because they are worried about making ends meet [in their later years], aid Brent Weiss, || a co-founder [at Baltimore-based financial-planning] firm Facet Wealth. 
He suggested | that preretirees should speak with a financial adviser to set long-term financial goals.

"The most challenging moments (in life) are getting married, starting a family and ultimately retiring," Facet Wealth cofounder Brent Weiss told USA [Today]. 
"It's not [just] a financial decision, but an emotional one. 
Many people believe | they can't retire."
(told 为 tell 的过去式。It's = It is, can't = can not)

26. The survey conducted [by Harris Poll] indicates that __________ 
(A) ver half (of the retirees) are [physically] fit for work 
(B) he old workforce is as active [as the younger one] 
(C) ne (in three Americans) enjoy earlier retirement 
(D) ore Americans are willing to work [in retirement]
(younger 为 young 的比较级形式, earlier 为 early 的比较级形式)
27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 | that Americans tend to think that __________ 
(A) etirement may cause problems for them 
(B) oredom can be relieved [after retirement] 
(C) he mental health (of retirees) is overlooked 
(D) unretirement" contributes to the economy
28. Retirement patterns are changing [partly due to __________] 
(A) abor shortages 
(B) opulation growth 
(C) onger life expectancy 
(D) ising living costs 
29. Many retires are increasing [in savings] [by __________] 
(A) investing more in stocks 
(B) taking up odd jobs 
(C) getting well paid work 
(D) spending less
(paid 为 pay 的过去分词。longer 为 long 的比较级形式)
30. [With regard (to retirement)], Brent Weiss thinks | that many people are __________ 
(A) nprepared 
(B) nafraid 
(C) isappointed 
(D) nthusiastic

We have all encountered them, [in both our personal and professional lives]. 
Think about the times (you felt tricked or frustrated [by a membership or subscription (that had a seamless sign-up process)] but was [later]) difficult to cancel something (that should be simple and transparent) an be complicated, <intentionally or unintentionally>, [in ways (that impair consumer choice)]. 
These are examples (of dark patterns).
(felt 为 feel 的过去式。lives 为 life 的复数形式。)

[First coined [in 2010] [by user experience expert Harry Brignull]], "dark patterns" is a catch-all term [for practices (that manipulate user interfaces to influence the decision-making ability (of users))]. 
Brignull identifies 12 types (of common dark patterns), ranging [from misdirection and hidden costs] [to roach motel, (where user experience seems easy and intuitive [at the start], but turns difficult || when the user tries to get out)].
(hidden 为 hide 的过去分词。)

[In a 2019 study (of 53,000 product pages) and 11,000 websites], researchers found | that about one (in 10 employs (these design)) practices. 
Though widely prevalent, || the concept (of dark patterns) is still not [well] understood. 
Business and nonprofit leaders should be aware of dark patterns and try to avoid the gray areas (they engender).
(found 为 find 的过去式。understood 为 understand 的过去分词。)

Where is the line [between ethical, persuasive design and dark patterns]? 
Businesses should engage in conversations [with IT, <compliance, risk, and legal teams to review their privacy policy>], and include in the discussion the customer/user experience designers and coders (responsible for the company's user interface, as well as the marketers and advertisers (responsible for signups checkout baskets, pricing, and promotions)).
Any or all these teams can play a role [in creating or avoiding "digital deception]".

Lawmakers and regulators are [slowly] starting to address the ambiguity [around dark patterns], [most recently] [at the state level]. 
[In March], the California Attorney General announced the approval (of additional regulations) [under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (that ensures | that consumers will not be confused or misled || when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights)].
(misled 为 mislead 的过去分词。)
The regulations aim to ban dark pattern -- || this means prohibiting companies from using confusing language || or unnecessary steps (such as forcing them to click [through multiple]) screens or listen to reasons (why they shouldn't opt out).
(shouldn't = should not)

As more states consider promulgating additional regulations, || there is a need (for greater accountability) [from within the business community]. 
Dark patterns also be addressed [on a self-regulatory basis], || but [only] if organizations hold themselves accountable, [not just to legal requirements], but also to industry best practices and standard.
(greater 为 great 的比较级形式)

31. It can be learned from the first two paragraphs | that dark patterns __________. 
(A) improve user experiences 
(B) leak user information [for profit] 
(C) undermine users' decision-making 
(D) remind users of hidden costs 
(hidden 为 hide 的过去分词。)
32. The 2019 study (on dark patterns) is mentioned to show __________. 
(A) their major flaws 
(B) their complex designs 
(C) their severe damage 
(D) their strong presence
33. To handle digital deception, businesses should__________. 
(A) listen to customer feedback 
(B) talk with relevant teams 
(C) turn to independent agencies 
(D) rely on professional training 
34. The additional regulations (under the CCPA) are intended [to __________]. 
(A) guide users [through opt-out processes] 
(B) protect consumers from being tricked 
(C) grant companies data privacy rights 
(D) restrict access to problematic content
35. [According to the last paragraph], a key (to coping with dark patterns) is __________. 
(A) new legal requirements 
(B) businesses' self -discipline 
(C) strict regulatory standards 
(D) consumers' safety awareness

Although ethics classes are common [around the world], scientists are unsure | if their lessons can actually change behavior, evidence either way is weak, relying on contrived laboratory tests or [sometimes] unreliable self-reports. 
But a new study published [in Cognition] found | that, <in [at least] one real-world situation>, a single ethics lesson may have had lasting effects.
(found 为 find 的过去式。)

The researchers investigated one class sessions' impact [on eating meat]. 
They chose this particular behavior [for three reasons], according to study co-author Eric Schwitzgebel, a philosopher (at the University of California , Riverside): students' attitudes (on the topic) are variable and unstable, || behavior is easily measurable, || and ethics literature largely agrees | that eating less meat is good || because it reduces environmental harm and animal suffering.
(chose 为 choose 的过去式。)
Half (of the students (in four large philosophy classes)) read an article (on the ethics (of factory-farmed meat)), optionally watched an 11-minute video [on the topic] and joined a 50-minute discussion. 
The other half focused on charitable giving [instead].

Then, unknown (to the students), the researchers studied their anonymized meal-card purchases for that semester -- nearly 14,000 receipts (for almost 500 students). 
Schwitzgebel predicted | the intervention would have no effect;
he had [previously] found | that ethics professors do not differ from other professors [on a range (of behaviors)], including voting rates, blood donation and returning library books. 
But [among student subjects (who discussed meat ethics)], meal purchases containing meat decreased [from 52 to 45 percent-and (this effect held steady)] for the study's duration (of several weeks). 
Purchases (from the other group) remained [at 52 percent].
(found 为 find 的过去分词。held 为 hold 的过去式。)

That's [actually] a pretty large effect [for a pretty small intervention], || Schwitzgebel says. 
Psychologist Nina Strohminger (at the University of Pennsylvania), (who was not involved in the study), says | she wants the effect to be real but cannot rule out some unknown confounding variable. 
And if real she notes, it might be reversible [by another nudge]: "Easy come, easy go."
(That's = That is, cannot = can not)

Schwitzgebel suspects | the greatest impact came from social influence -- || classmates or teaching assistants leading the discussions may have shared their own vegetarianism, showing it [as achievable or more common]. 
[Second], the video may have had an emotional impact. 
Least rousing, <he thinks>, was rational argument, || although his co-authors say | reason might play a bigger role.
(came 为 come 的过去式。greatest 为 great 的最高级形式, bigger 为 big 的比较级形式)
[Now] [there] searchers are probing the specific effects (of teaching style), teaching assistant's eating habits and students' video exposure [Meanwhile] | Schwitzgebel (who had predicted no effect-will) be eating his words.

36. Scientists generally believe | that the effects (of ethics classes) are __________. 
(A) hard to determine 
(B) narrowly interpreted 
(C) difficult to ignore 
(D) poorly summarized
37. Which of the following is a reason (for the researchers) [to study (meat-eating)]? 
(A) It is common [among students]. 
(B) It is a behavior (easy to measure). 
(C) It is important to students' health. 
(D) It is a hot topic [in ethics classes]
38. Eric Schwitzgebel's previous findings suggest that ethics professors __________. 
(A) are [seldom] critical of their students 
(B) are less sociable [than other professors] 
(C) are not sensitive to political issues 
(D) are not [necessarily] [ethically] better
(better 为 good 的比较级形式)
39. Nina Strohminger thinks | that effect (of the intervention) is __________. 
(A) permanent 
(B) predictable 
(C) uncertain 
(D) unrepeatable 
40. Eric Schwitzgebel suspects | that the students' change (in behavior __________). 
(A) can bring psychological benefits 
(B) can be analyzed [statistically] 
(C) is a result (of multiple) factors 
(D) is a sign (of self-development)

[Getting back into exercise] after a break can be a challenge [in the best (of times)], but with gyms and in-person exercise classes (off-limits) [to many people] [these days], || it can be tricky to know | where to start. 
And it is important to get the right dose (of activity).
["Too much too soon] either results in injury or burnout," says Mary Yoke, PhD, a faculty member (in the kinesiology department (at Indiana University (in Bloomington))). 
The following simple strategies will help you return to exercise [safely] [after a break].
41. ____
Don't try to go back to {what you were doing} [before your break].
(don't = do not)
If you were walking 3 miles [a day], playing 18 holes (of golf) [three times] [a week], or lifting 10-pound dumbbells [for three sets (of 10 reps)], || reduce activity to half a mile [every other day, or nine holes (of golf)] [once] [a week] [with short walks] [on other days], or use 5-pound dumbbells for one set (of 10 reps).
Increase time, distance, and intensity [gradually]. 
"This isn't something (you can do [overnight])," says Keri L. Denay, MD. 
lead author (of a recent American College (of Sports Medicine advisory (that encourages Americans to not overlook the benefits (of activity) [during the pandemic]))).
(isn't = is not)
But you'll reap benefits (such as less anxiety) and improved sleep [right away].
(you'll = you will)
42. ____
If you're breathing [too hard] to talk [in complete sentences], || back off. 
If you feel good, || go [a little longer] or faster. 
Feeling wiped out [after a session]? 
Go [easier] [next time]. 
And stay alert to serious symptoms, <such as chest pain or pressure, severe shortness (of breath or dizziness), or faintness>, and seek medical attention [immediately].
(you're = you are, longer 为 long 的比较级形式, faster 为 fast 的比较级形式, easier 为 easy 的比较级形式)
43. ____
Consistency is the key (to getting stronger and building endurance and stamina). 
Ten minutes (of activity (per day)) is | a good start says Marcus Jackovitz, DPT, a physical therapist (at the University of Miami Hospital). 
All the experts (we spoke with) highly recommend walking || because it's the easiest, most accessible form (of exercise).
(spoke 为 speak 的过去式。stronger 为 strong 的比较级形式, it's = it is, easiest 为 easy 的最高级形式)
Although it can be a workout [on its own], || if your goal is to get back to Zumba classes, tennis, cycling or any other activity || walking is [also] a great first step.
44. ____
Even if you can't yet do a favorite activity, || you can practice the moves. 
[With or without a club or racket] swing (like you)'re hitting the ball. 
Paddle (like you)'re in a kayak or canoe. 
Mimic your favorite swimming strokes. 
The action will remind you of the joy (the activity brought you) and prime your muscles [for {when you can get out [there] [again]}].
(brought 为 bring 的过去式。can't = can not, you're = you are)
45. ____
Exercising [with others] "can keep you accountable and make it more fun, || so you're more likely to do it [again]," Jackovitz says. 
You can do activities (such as golf and tennis) or take a walk [with others] and still be [socially] distant. 
But when you can't connect [in person], || consider using technology.
(you're = you are, can't = can not)
Chat [on the phone] [with a friend] || while you walk [around your neighborhood]. 
FaceTime (with a relative) as you strength train or stretch [at home]. 
You can also join a livestream or on-demand exercise class.
