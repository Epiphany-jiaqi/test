(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

So, what's the big emergency?

Why did everyone
have to come in on a Monday?

I'm afraid we have troubling news.

Due to budget cuts,
we'll be laying off one employee.

(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

The Internet pretty much
only lets us fire white males,

so if you're not a white male,
you're safe.

-So, is Derek Jeter safe?
-Safe!

-What?
-He's half black.

-What? What do you need, glasses?
-No, I don't...

-He's white by a mile.
-You're the one who needs glasses.

-He tucks his T-shirts into his pants.
-A lot of people do that.

And what happened to this kind
of coach-umpire confrontation?

It's body temperature issue.

-I know, I miss it, too.
-It used to happen a lot in the '70s

but doesn't seem to happen
that much anymore.

It's a connection to a bygone era
when men settled their differences

-face-to-face...
-I agree. That's what we're doing now.

-Thrusting their chests into one another.
-I miss having a guy

-yell in my mouth.
-And while we're talking about stuff,

-I've never cleaned my ice trays.
-Oh, you have to do that.

-Why do I have to?
-You're poisoning your family.

-It's just water and water.
-What's the big deal?

Carrying an ice tray
from the freezer to the sink

is like ringing
the damn dinner bell for arm hairs.

Come to think of it, I do remember seeing

-a few short hairs in my ice cubes...
-Of course they're getting in there.

-That I'm hoping were from my arm.
-Clean your trays.

Oh, cool off, Griffin. It is no big deal.

It's just that someone's getting fired
in front of everybody tomorrow.

Well, that sounds fine.
I guess I'll just see you... What?

Old joke. You're out.

Old joke? I put my own twist on it.

-There was no twist.
-Oh, you're crazy.

-It was a tip of the hat to my son.
-I'm crazy? You're lazy.

-It's a gift to our long-time viewers.
-Oh, what a gift.

Merry Christmas. Here's a warmed-over
turd from 10 years ago.

Okay, I can do this.
No need to be nervous.

Just show 'em that I'm good at my job.
That's it. Easy peasy.

(CHUCKLES) Hey there, PG. Been a minute.

Hey, Ernie. I mean, I mean Cookie Monst...
I mean Bert. Bert. Sorry.

Oh, it's okay, Peter.

Just do what you would normally do.
Pretend I'm not here.

Oh, pretend you're not here? All right.

God, that Bert is an idiot. What a pud.

But I wouldn't mind getting to know
that Sheila a little better.

She's got a great dumper.

And by dumper, I mean fecal thoroughfare.

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Should I...

Yeah, answer it.
Could be important for the company.

(EXHALES)

Goodbye?

Ah, shoot. Opposite of that, yeah?

Let's roll to the break room, Peter.

We're ready to announce
who's getting fired.

Oh, sure, if Sheila and her wastemaker
are gonna be there.

Please stop talking
about my wife's anal processes.

Opie, will you accept this stein?

(BABBLING)

Bachelor Nick? Why are you here?

They make me come to all these things.

Cool. How's Vanessa?

-We broke up.
-Aw.

I would murder my family
for one hour with Corinne.

Eh, she was a little young.

You know how stupid you sound?

Peter, take a step forward.

I... I'm sorry. I keep messing up.

You're seeing me at my worst.
I'm very nervous.

(HEART BEATING)

My life is flashing before my eyes.

And for some reason,
it's all just the sort of gay moments.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Excuse me, is someone sitting here?

Yes. My lover, Tom.

(GASPS)

Oh, Peter! I'm so happy you're okay.

Whoa, you're alive?

What happened? Did I have a heart attack?

No, you had a panic attack.

Or, in medical terms,
"a heart attack for wussies."

Hey, we have a bet going.

Do you remember if
you put your wrist to your forehead

like a nancy-boy when you fainted?

I choose not to answer.

Peter, you need to get
your stress under control.

I'm texting you a link
to a collection of songs

-called yacht rock.
-(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

Any time I'm feeling stressed,

I play this music,
and it really mellows me out.

I think it'll work for you.

Well, what is that? Is that like...

(SINGING ANGRILY)
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

No, no, it's more like...

(SOFTLY) <i>La, da, da, da, da</i>
<i>Da, da, da, da, da</i>

Oh, good. It's...

(SOFTLY) <i>La, da, da, da, da</i>
<i>Da, da, da, da</i>

'Cause I don't like that...

(ANGRILY) <i>Da, da, da, ba, ba, ba</i>

No, I assure you, it's...

(SOFTLY) <i>La, da, da, da</i>
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more
music to prescribe to sick patients.

-So, Peter, you feeling better?
-Yeah, I guess.

The doctor just said I'm too stressed out.

Did the doctor give you anything to help,
you know, mellow you out?

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(IN ENGLISH) No, he just gave me this link
for something called yacht rock.

(<i>SUMMER BREEZE </i>PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)

This one's called <i>Summer Breeze,</i>
and it makes me feel fine.

This music... I... I feel like
I'm dirty dancing with a sunset.

Uh, guys, there's a yacht rock cruise

that leaves from
the Quahog Marina tomorrow.

And I'm not even kidding.

You know what, guys?
We haven't gone anywhere in a long time.

So, let's do it.
Cleveland, buy those tickets,

'cause the guys are going
on a yacht rock cruise.

-Yeah!
-Awesome!

Peter? Is that you?

-Do I know you?
-I... It's me. Lyle?

From the other side of the aquarium?

I... I don't... I don't know you.

I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

<i>But I did know what he was talking about.</i>

<i>I spent the next two and-a-half years</i>
<i>cruising various aquariums.</i>

<i>I never did find Lyle.</i>

<i>Also, I didn't quite clear the table.</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

I got to say, Peter,
I had reservations about this cruise,

but you do seem more relaxed.

Hey, good thing I had reservations
on this cruise, huh?

(CHUCKLES) I don't mind dad jokes.
Everyone's included.

Looks like mine won't be the only tail
I'll be chasing this week.

-(GRUNTS) Hey. What the...
-All dogs have to be crated below deck.

(DOGS BARKING)

Stewie, help!

I knew this was a possibility,

so I put a 1982 Mattel Electronic Baseball
game in your bag.

Okay, that's something.

The battery might be a little old, though.

(ELECTRONIC FANFARE FADES)

(HORN BLOWS)

Peter, you brought your family?
This was supposed to be a guys' trip.

-Please don't tell Donna.
-Please don't tell Bonnie. She hasn't been

-on a vacation in seven years.
-She'll kill me if she knew

-wives were allowed. Please, Lois, please.
-Please, Lois.

-Promise me. Here, look...
-Promise me first.

-I'm putting money in your purse.
-Here's my gun. Do you want it?

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I'm sending a selfie to Bonnie and Donna.

Cruise, bitches.

-Don't hit send, please don't hit send.
-Please don't hit send.

-And send.
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

You son of a bitch.

-I told you.
-What did he do now?

He don't listen to you.

He don't listen to you.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

-What is it, Bonnie?
-Nothing, Father Monaghan.

Well, this sucks now.

Our whole trip's ruined,
thanks to you, Peter.

Thank God Bonnie's got Father Monaghan
for spiritual counsel.

Well, it's not my fault
you guys are too stupid

to understand what the plan was.

-The plan was clear.
-You're the stupid one.

-What?
-(OVERLAPPING ARGUING)

(SINGING) <i>Sailing takes me away...</i>

-What were we fighting about?
-I don't know.

My cares have all suddenly melted away.

Are my toes tapping?
I feel like my toes are tapping.

Nah, there's a seagull
pecking at your foot.

(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)

Whenever I wear my Tevas,
my toes are up for grabs.

Hey, Cleveland, this is us.

You guys got to stop by later.
Snuck on a little of this action.

What? You guys are sharing a room?
You're adults.

I'm not paying full price for a room.

Have some self-respect. You're 40.

(SCOFFS) It's not like
we're gonna be in there much.

Too busy scoping trim.

I may bail to the room to catch a nap.

Right behind you, roomie.

After we wake,
we gonna fire up that Keurig.

Oh, yeah, that's why I brought along
a couple of these babies.

Wait, there's only one bed.

I know. We're going head to toe.

Say hello to your pillow.

Hi there, do you know if singer
and songwriter Bob Welch is on board yet?

He's not, because he died in 2012.

(GASPS)

Can you give me a moment?

(SINGING) <i>Sentimental gentle wind</i>

<i>Blowing through my life again...</i>

I can't believe Bob Welch is really gone.

<i>Gentle one...</i>

Hey... We just heard about Bob Welch.

<i>Blowing through my life again...</i>

Yeah.

Who the (BLEEP) is Bob Welch?

(HORN BLOWS)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Okay, for the first game,
I choose Alan Parsons as my teammate,

but not <i>The Project.</i>
I want nothing to do with them.

We'll play Joe and Loggins.

-Thanks for picking me, Peter.
-No problem.

"Crosby, Stills, Nash"
to see who goes first?

BOTH: Crosby, Stills, Nash, shoot.

-Nash. I win.
-No, Crosby eats Nash.

-Stills snorts Crosby.
-What does Nash do?

Nash smokes Stills.

So, Kenny, <i>Footloose.</i>

Not really a song for everyone.

Well, maybe you'd prefer my song
in <i>Caddyshack, I'm Alright.</i>

Wh... What, do you think I'm stupid
because I'm in a chair?

I'll pull the tape, guy.
The gopher sang that song.

This is so exciting.
What do you want to do tonight?

What if we just go see a movie?

We can see a movie at home.
We need to go out. Shake things up.

We're here to experience new things,
be other people.

Mmm-hmm.

How much wine have you had tonight?

Maybe we could hang out
with that nice couple

-we met the other day.
-The Federmans?

Why do you always want to hang out
with other people when we're on vacation?

It's just nice to meet new people.

Right, because I'm so interested
in the medical supply business.

-Why do you always do that?
-Do what?

Diminish people.

Oh, that's why.

Well, I feel like this has become
a referendum on me,

and I don't appreciate it.

Did you pack my dandruff shampoo?

-No.
-(SIGHS)

Then I guess this black shirt is out.

You just want to hang out
with Doug Federman.

What? That's... That's the wine talking.

What does Doug Federman have

-that I don't?
-A job.

(GRUNTS) I'm going to watch
the magic show in the Cognac Club.

Why, because there's a two-drink minimum?

Oh, you shut up!

Thank you. For my next trick,
I'll need a volunteer.

-How about you, sir?
-(SLURRING) No, I don't want to!

I don't want to do it.

BOTH: Bell, Biv, DeVoe, shoot.

-(LAUGHS) Gotcha.
-What do you mean?

I win. Bell bivs DeVoe.

Dude, you can't "biv" someone.
Biv's a guy.

Everybody on this cruise is boring.

CHAD: I can show you
where there's a whole pile of those.

Cigarette butts?

Yeah. The wind blows
them all to this one spot.

It's right by where the seagulls crap.

It's my job to clean it up.
That's how I know about it.

You must know a lot about crap.

You're not from here, are you?

From the cruise? No. I'm from a town.

You want to mess around
on some damp towels

next to where the seagulls crap?

It wasn't seagulls.
I got locked out of my room earlier.

Oh. Why is your poop white?

I don't know. I've been dealing
with fecal albinism my whole life.

We're making a food spread
in room 103. Come on by.

Grab some cocktail sauce on your way.

Oh, wait. Never mind.

(YELLS) Damn it.

We're watching <i>Michael Clayton</i>
on DVD later. Be there.

(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

By the way, I, uh,
heard about Bob Welch. I'm sorry.

-Don't know what else to say.
-(EXHALES) Sending good vibes.

Yeah... Can you give me a moment?

(SINGING) <i>Sentimental gentle wind</i>

-Bob Welch.

-Hey, aren't you the captain?
-Yes.

Well, if you're here,
who's driving the boat?

Oh, my God!

(ALARMS BLARING)

Wow, I've never seen someone eat so many
powdered Donettes in half an hour before.

Yeah, I was really hungry,
and I didn't like what they had at dinner.

I think we may have solved
your fecal albinism.

I love you, Meg.

Oh, my God.

No one's ever told me that before.
This is the best night of my li...

-(SCREAMING)
-(GRUNTS)

(SCREAMING)

(CHUCKLES)
Listen to all those idiots fall.

-Honey, don't revel in it.
-Hey, I need this.

I just found out Bob Welch died.

(SINGING) <i>Sentimental gentle wind</i>
<i>Blowing...</i>

-(SCREAMS) What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

And, look, Oates is hanging on
to Hall for dear life.

(GRUNTING)

What else is new?
He's been doing that for 40 years.

Ha-ha. Yeah, make fun of more people
more successful than you.

He's a millionaire. You're nothing.

(CRYING, GROANING)

Oh, thank God we're all okay.

Looks like Oates wasn't so lucky.

(MUFFLED CRYING, GROANING)

Guys, it's me, Kenny Loggins.
First of all, I'm all right.

-Don't nobody worry about me.
-JOE: Gopher!

This boat has flipped over.
We need to get up to the hull.

There's a spot in the propeller room
where the hull's only an inch thick.

Maybe we can try to cut our way out...

(SCREAMING)

(YELLS)

MEG: Hey, you sons of bitches!

This is Chad!
He's my boyfriend. We love each other.

We said it and everything.

(STIFLED CHUCKLING)

A little help?

Guys, we got to get out of here.

-You're alive.
-And well.

We got to get out of here.
The water levels are rising fast.

I'll just grab an apple real quick.

Granny Smith? What,
do you got a oven in your mouth?

-Huh?
-Pie apple. It's a pie apple.

I like a good Red Delicious.

-Oh, does your mouth have a lid on it?
-What are you talking about?

That's a garbage apple.
May as well eat a Honeycrisp.

-What's wrong with that one?
-Science apple.

Made in a lab with test tubes and beakers.

Well, what apples do you like?

Fuji for eating, crab for huckin'.

That's a prankster's apple.

Gosh, Cleveland, I had no idea
you knew so much about apples.

-Hmm. Did you ever ask?
-No, I guess I didn't.

CLEVELAND: Hmm

(STRAINING)

I can't open it! There's too much water
pushing from the other side!

-So, we're stuck?
-Yeah, unless we can somehow tip the boat.

(SINGING) <i>Maybe we can</i>

Oh, we... Oh, we found him.

(BLEEP)! You guys left me
down there to drown.

Technically, we left you
up there to drown. The boat flipped.

You know what you did.

I think the only way to teach you a lesson
is to dog-shake and get you all wet.

-No, Brian, don't!
-I'm doing it.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

All right, we're even.

(METALLIC CREAKING)

Well, we found
the thinnest part of the hull,

but it's still an inch thick.

Yeah, of steel.
How are we supposed to get through that?

(ALL INHALE DEEPLY)

Man, that was crazy.

I'm Casey Kasem.

Coming in at number seven
on the countdown,

that was Peter Griffin with <i>Yacht Rocky,</i>
down three spots.

Now for our number six.

(CHORUS SINGING) <i>Number six</i>

We'll start with a letter
from Melanie in Kansas.

She writes, "Dear Casey,

"is Christopher Cross as nice as he seems?

"Also, aren't you dead?

"And why did your large wife
hide your body from your children?"

Well, the answer to your first question
is a resounding, yes.

Christopher Cross is a perfect gentleman.

And as for the second question,
you're correct, Melanie.

I'm extremely dead, and I do wish
my children could have closure.

Honey, if you're listening, please,

just put my body in the ground.

And now back to the countdown.

so you don't have to eat
so many little Tic Tacs.

Nice, Glenn, you're on the board.

All right, any ideas. No bad ideas.

-Soup in a sleeve.
-Bad idea.

All right, Peter, you're so great,
why don't you give us an idea?

Okay, you know how they
put ice in urinals?

Well, what happens to that ice
at the end of the day?

It's wasted. We collect urinal ice
and sell it to local bars.

Peter, that'll never work.

Oh, no?

Is that the tinkling of ice I hear?

All right, let's check out
what we did last night.

GLENN: God, that's so shaky.

CLEVELAND: It's hard to watch.

PETER: What is that one?

JOE: That's mine. I'm basically
a human Steadicam.

-It's beautiful.
-So smooth.

Lot of guy butts.

Yeah, my sight line's
a little lower than most.

Look at a girl butt once.

What the hell were we doing here?

PETER: Oh, this must have been
when we were jumping around

to "Jump Around,"
like the song asked us to.

JOE: Oh, yeah, I was so into this song.

Look at my footage. I was going bananas.

PETER: All right,
let's fast-forward a little here.

Just looks like
we're drinking at a random bar.

We ain't talking about
any million-dollar ideas.

Wait, wait, pause it.
Zoom in on that napkin.

What does that say?

There it is. "Warm cuts."

Like cold cuts, but warm.

Our million-dollar idea.

Warm cuts? That's dumb.

If it's so dumb, how come
we're pitching it on <i>Shark Tank?</i>

PETER: (ON TV)
<i>Now, when we first started Warm Cuts,</i>

<i>it was just a gross idea.</i>

<i>But this year, we're on track to get sued</i>
<i>for $12.5 million.</i>

<i>That's quadruple the projections.</i>

<i>You know what, I like your product.</i>

<i>But more than that, I like you guys.</i>

<i>I'm in, and I'll give you</i>
<i>exactly what you're asking for:</i>

<i>$100,000 for ten percent.</i>

<i>What do you say?</i>

PETER: <i>Does anyone</i>
<i>other than Robert</i><i>have an offer?</i>

Wait, why are only three of us
on <i>Shark Tank?</i>

Yeah, where's Quagmire?

Oh, my God, is that--

Quagmire, you hooked up.

All right.

Oh, no, wait, wait. It's on film.

That's not all right.
What if my boss sees this?

What if my dad sees it?

It's fine, Glenn.
You can't even see your face.

<i>You did it again, Glenn Quagmire.</i>

Oh, my God.
Joe, you have to delete this footage.

Sorry, Glenn, the footage
is automatically uploaded

to the Internet every night.

The Internet? Oh, my God.

Excuse me, ma'am, no porn at the bar.

Oh, it's okay, I'm transgender.

Oh, I-I had no idea.

Do whatever you want all the time.

Oh, Glenn...

BRIAN: Howdy, stranger.

Brian? What are you doing here?

-I'm an alcoholic.
-Oh, right.

So, you saw the video, huh?

Oh, yeah. It's just so hard.

Well, it has to be for sex.

No, no, I mean-I mean it's difficult

to watch your son embarrass
himself so publicly.

Yeah, that parent-child
relationship is so special.

Sometimes you want
to shake 'em by the shoulders

and say, "Aah, what are you doing?"

But you just got to give 'em
the biggest hug you can

and let 'em know that you'll
always be there for them.

-How's your son, Brian?
-We don't talk.

But, Ida, you can't blame yourself.

As much as you want to save
your kids from their mistakes,

it's their mistakes that
help them grow and change

and become their best selves.

You know, Brian,
that's what I like about you.

You're so wise and kind.

I think that's what originally
drew me to you.

Yep, here I am, Mr. Wisdom,

sitting at the bottom of a bottle,
just like every Tuesday.

-Brian, it's Thursday.
-Oh, boy.

Why do you always run yourself down?

You're handsome, you're loyal.

You give your paw after a couple of tries.

Come on, paw.

Paw. Paw...

There you go. Good boy.

I just wish you could see
yourself the way I see you.

Ehh, mirrors kind of freak me out.

(LAUGHS) And-and funny, too.

Except for a job and your own home,

you are the full package, Brian Griffin.

Ida... should we get a room?

Absolutely.

(SCOFFS) They've got one person
working back there.

Morning, sleepyhead.

-Morning.
-Some night, huh?

Yeah, it really was.

They dropped a <i>USA Today </i>outside our room.

-You want to read it?
-Oh, God, no.

Well, I guess we'll pretend
this never happened,

and I'll see you in another two years.

(LAUGHS) Yeah.

You know what? No.

What are you doing Friday night?

Well, that depends.

Is <i>Friday Night Videos still a thing?</i>

No, it hasn't been for quite some time.

Well, then, I'm free.

Does that mean you're asking me out?

I guess it does.

You're... not ashamed to be with me?

No, I'm not. I don't care anymore.

I guess I'm just not as hung up
as I used to be.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-MAN: Room service.

Oh, my God, you ordered room service?
Are you crazy?

What if somebody finds out I'm in here
having goofball sex?

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-MAN: Hello? Room service.

I've got your eggs and Snausages.

Snausages.

Table 13. The fish is for the gentleman,

and the chicken is for the lady.

Got it.

Great. Is that our food?

WAITER: <i>The fish is for the gentleman,</i>
<i>and the chicken is for the lady.</i>

I'll be right back, folks.

Well, thanks for picking me to break in
your new Discover card with.

Hey, thanks for co-signing for it.

My pleasure.

(YAWNING)

Brian, I can't help but notice

you're a little uncomfortable
spending time with me.

I thought you said
you weren't ashamed of me.

What are you talking about?

Because I made you lie down
in the backseat

all the way here? You looked tired.

It just seems like you're always taking me

to out-of-the-way places
to avoid being seen together.

-Like yesterday.
-Come on, that's not true.

I just wanted to show you
a beautiful view.

Wow, check out that big blue marble.

Look, there's another shuttle.

-Get away from the window!
-(GROANS)

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

(IN ENGLISH) Okay, maybe,

maybe this has been
a little weirder for me than I thought.

I'm sorry, Ida. I...

I really care about you
and you deserve better.

-Can I help you?
-The fish is for...

The fish is for me. And the chicken...

the chicken is for my girlfriend,
Ida Davis.

-"Girlfriend"? Are you sure, Brian?
-I'm sure.

And from now on, I'm not hiding anything.

Like Peter and his formaldehyde jars.

-Peter?
-Yes?

Is this is about my work?

Hi, I have a Styrofoam cooler
with weird tape on it?

Ah, that must be the cat brains
and baby bodies.

Are you making people?

(LAUGHS)
He'll be flattered you called him that.

(CACKLES)

(CLEARS THROAT) Hello, everybody.

I have some pretty big news.

-It may come as a surprise, but...
-It's about Ida, isn't it?

It has to be.
Why else would Ida be in our house?

Meg's right. Ida's only been here, what,

-like, twice her whole life?
-You think they did it again?

-Well, what else could it be?
-They do have a lot in common.

Two mature people with dwindling options.

Like, I know Brian
was squeamish about sleeping

with a trans woman before,
but it's 2019 now.

Yeah, things that were gross
five years ago are now heroic.

Wow. Brian and Ida. Good for them.

Well, that's a relief.

Now the only other person
we have to tell about us is Glenn.

Oh, God, I haven't
even thought about that.

Mr. Quagmire hates Brian.

Yes, my big brother's right.

Quagmire thinks Brian's trash.

Well, just have him over here for dinner.

We'll help you. We're here for you, Brian.

You know what?
You're right. I can do this.

After all, I'm not the first
person to deliver tough news.

Like when they found Waldo.

There are many things
I can't go into at this time,

but I can confirm that a body was removed
from Waldo's apartment this morning.

REPORTER:
Is this being treated as a suicide?

Again, I can't confirm.

But to that point, instead of
always asking "Where's Waldo?"

maybe some of you should've been
asking "How's Waldo?"

Good day.

Glenn, Ida, it's so nice
that you could both come over for dinner.

Thanks so much for having us.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

No response from Peter. What the hell?
I thought we were going to the Clam.

And Quagmire just texted back "Can't."

I don't like it.

They're doing something without us.

So, Brian, what's, uh,
what's new in your world?

(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, well, um,

thank you for asking, Lois.

-I see them.
-They're both in there.

Looks like a dinner party!

Uh, actually, I have some news
that happens to pertain

-to my dating life.
-Really, Brian?

-Oh, do tell us.
-I knew it!

Well, it's kind of big news.

Those scalloped potatoes?

Well, what's the big news?

Go ahead, Brian. Tell him.

Ida and I...

have, uh...

begun dating.

You're, you're joking, right?

It's true, son. Brian and I are in love.

What? When were you gonna tell me this?

-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Oh, Peter just texted.

He says he's stuck at work.

(SIGHS) They are working
that poor man to death.

I'm so glad you dropped in.
Brian is cooking breakfast.

That's right, get ready
for Eggs a la Brian.

Scrambled eggs with a side of toast.

What? How is that "a la Brian"?
That, that's just...

That's, that's great.
That's just great, Brian.

I am very excited
for this unique breakfast.

Cool, cool.
How many globs of ketchup do you want?

Uh, chef's choice.

So, um, how long
has this been going on, Dad?

Listen, Glenn, I know
this is an adjustment for you,

and you and Brian haven't
always seen eye to eye.

Well, I wouldn't say that.

He's just, uh, kind of
a big personality. (CHUCKLES)

So, Denver Airport.

Kind of up there, huh? Mile-high.

Yeah, that is the height of the airport.

Now, O'Hare Airport,
why on the ticket is it "ORD"?

Uh, it was originally
called Orchard Field.

Really? Huh.

Uh, so why is Wilkes-Barre/Scranton "AVP"?

I'm not gonna go through
every airport with you, Brian.

You know, Glenn, Brian thought
you two could hang out

this afternoon,
and I think that's a great idea.

Yeah, Quagmire, what do you say?

(SHUDDERING)

All right. I guess I can do that.

-Well, great.
-(OVEN TIMER CHIMES)

Oh, the ketchup's hot.

Everyone goes cold, I go hot.

And that's the "a la."

This sucks. I don't want to be here.

Come on, Glenn.
If I'm gonna be dating your mom,

it's important that we spend
some time together.

Hi, we have two guest passes
from a museum member, Ida Davis.

I'm not seeing an "Ida Davis."

(QUIETLY) Uh, try "Dan Quagmire."

-"Lieutenant Dan Quagmire."
-Ah, the lieutenant.

And how's he doing? Still have his penis?

No, he doesn't.

And that's a weird question to ask.

I'm a weird guy, I work at a museum.

See? It's not so bad.

It's like <i>Night at the Museum </i>in here.

-How?
-Well, you know,

like, the guys are gonna come to life.

-Like, who?
-Um, the guys, you know?

When it's, when it's nighttime.

-You didn't see the movie, did you?
-No.

Why did you bring up a reference
to something you know nothing about?

It just, it reminded me of, uh...

Brian, don't bring up
a reference to someone

whose favorite movie it is,

because you'll just embarrass yourself.

That was a natural history museum,
this is a science museum.

What, you think this tidal chart's
gonna come to life?

You think this moon rock
is gonna walk across the room

and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams

playing Teddy Roosevelt,
God rest both their souls?

Be very, very careful treading
around <i>Night at the Museum.</i>

Okay, let's get this game started.

-Do you believe it still fits?
-From when?

Thank you for throwing this barbecue.

It's so good for the boys
to spend real time together.

Okay, let's play. Kids versus the parents.

All right, we're gonna destroy those kids.

Uhp, someone's on the wrong team.

Boy, they're in such a hurry
not to be kids anymore.

Your time will come, trust me.

I'm older than the adults.
I'm older than all of you!

It seems like that sometimes, I bet.

-Get down there, champ.
-(SIGHS)

All right, as the one adult
on a team full of children,

I'm gonna act good-natured

while being subtly furious
at all your mistakes.

Okay? Break on three.

One, two, three...

-Break!
-Football!

Let's focus, Chris.
Can we just focus for a minute?

And let's all face the same direction.

Okay, I'm gonna call the plays

while I'm covering my mouth
with this play card.

Peter, that's not a play card,
it's a Denny's menu.

Let's run Moons Over My Hammy on three.

Hey, guys? Gonna need your help over here.

They got a real All-American at QB.

(QUIETLY) God.

Down. Hut! Hut!

Good hutting, Glenn.
That's my boy, hutting.

Way to hut!

Shut up. Stop complimenting
things that don't need it.

Hike!

Uh-oh, look who's on the loose.

I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you...

Oh, no, I missed you by total accident.

Yeah! Six points, bitches.

(CHUCKLES)
Whoa, that was some great move, buddy.

-(DINGS)
-Aw.

Did you see and hear the wink?

That means he did it on purpose.

No, no, way. He did it all by himself.

(DINGS)

Ah! There it is again!

Brian, you're the best dad ever.

What're you talking about? I beat him.

I wish I had a dad like that.

Me, too, bud.

Brian, you're very sweet to do that.

To do what?
I'm the one who scored the touchdown.

-You sure did, Glenn.
-He's not my dad!

I already have a dad,
and it's my mom! All right, Brian?

Stop trying to be my dad, you fraud.

Glenn, sweetie, calm down.

No, I'm not gonna calm down.
I can't take this anymore.

Listen, Dad, the first time
you hooked up with Brian,

it was awful, I hated it.

But you were confused,
you'd just gone through a huge change,

you didn't know if you had
any options, so you settled.

But you're a beautiful, intelligent woman.

And now you've had time to
adjust and your choice is Brian?

Why in God almighty would you choose him?

"Because I love him," a resolved Ida said.

-I'm also a published author.
-Self-published.

You're also a pompous, pretentious,
hypocritical blowhard.

-Who attended Brown.
-For one semester.

-You went to Brown?
-For two months.

See? See, that's what I mean.

His whole life is a lie.

I can't take this anymore.
It's either him or me.

-I choose Brian...
-Yes.

...to talk to first.

Brian, I've loved every minute
that we've spent together.

I never thought I'd meet someone
who I connected with on so many levels,

-much less an Ivy Leaguer.
-GLENN: Come on...

But as special as you are to me,
I have to put my son first.

-But Ida...
-He's my son.

I've made my decision.

Bye-bye, Brian. You're history.

And this time, history's
not coming back to life.

<i>Night at the Museum.</i>

I'm sorry, Brian.

I'll never forget what we had together.

I understand.

Can you guys wrap this up?

I see Peter coming with some
kind of problem from the game.

(CRYING) Quagmire, we agreed
that it was a two-hand touch,

and then Chris hit me with one hand,

and I said that didn't count,

but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.

So I drilled him in the head
with the ball,

and now he's not moving.

He can blink his eyes, but nothing else.

-So, is my dog still your dad?
-Uh, no.

Chris, he said the touchdown counts!

Lois, why'd we got to come here?
This place is a bunch of rich snobs.

We have lunch with my parents
twice a year. Consider yourself lucky.

Under normal circumstances, you'd
never be allowed in a place like this.

Griffin, come on.
They're waiting for your order.

Sorry. Do you have oysters?

-We do not.
-Aw, shucks.

(LAUGHTER)

Damn it, Griffin,
you've been staring at that menu

for five minutes, and you peed your pants.

Um, do you have oysters?

Get up. They have to clean the chair.

Hey, Brian, you don't have
a medal detector on you, do you?

Okay, Stewie, you got a medal. Way to go.

Do I sense a hint of jealousy?

Stewie, didn't it strike you as odd
that everyone got a medal?

You didn't win anything.
It's a participant medal.

They give 'em to every kid with a pulse.

And like every other medal or award
you've ever gotten, it means nothing.

What?

(GASPS)

Stewie, I, I'm sorry.

I, I shouldn't have said that.
I lost my temper.

-(SOBBING)
-Slow down!

(GASPS)

No, no, no, no, no.

How could I be such a fool?
This is a wall of lies.

And that's a hole of lies.

Everything I've ever won is worthless!

Aah!

You won't make a fool of me any longer.

Oh, no! It's all right, Stewie.

Stay calm.
This is why we have a house fire captain.

Okay, when I read your name,
please respond with a "here."

-Griffin, Mac.
-It's Meg.

Sorry, it looks like "Mac."

to finally win a legitimate award.

-You think you're up to it?
-Of course. I just have to apply myself.

Like Chris, when he worked at that casino.

No more bets. The money that could have
gone to your kids is gone. No more bets.

The money you worked hard for is gone.
Fools, fools, fools.

Ooh, double zero.
Nobody thinks about that one.

And guy walks quickly away
from table without a word,

replaced by an older white man
with a much younger black woman.

No more bets. No more bets.

Brian, are you ready
for my grand creation?

-Serve it up, bitch.
-Well, that was uncalled for.

But get ready to be wowed.

(CRUNCH)

What the... This is mud.

Yes. It's a mud pie.
I used Legos for the fruit.

Stewie, you can't submit this.
It's inedible.

Okay, now I know you're full of crap,
because everyone else loves it.

Mmm, num-num-num-num-nah.
So delicious, Stewie.

Best pie ever.

Wow! Tastes great, Stewie.

Mmm, so<i></i>good.

Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Not so hammy, Meg. He's not an idiot.

Stewie, can't you see they're faking it
to make you feel good?

What are you talking about?

(SLO-MO) Wow!

Mmm. Num-num-num-num-nah.

So<i></i>good.

<i>We must insist on absolute quiet.</i>

My God, you're right.

They're all just lying
to protect my feelings.

This pie is garbage!

And the contest is next week.
I have to drop out.

No, you don't.
You just got to do the work.

Stewie, you're a smart kid.

I know you can bake a pie,
and I'll help you.

You will? Thank you, Brian.

This calls for champagne.

Pop.

Glug, glug, glug.

Bottoms up.

Go with it.

Ugh. Korbel?

-It's not Korbel. It's...
-Go with it.

Yes, I had some left over
from Denise's wedding.

-Who's Denise?
-Go with it.

Fine. How is Denise?
Did she have the abortion?

-Abortion?
-Go with it.

No, her alarm didn't go off,
so she missed it.

So, Brian, is this your first orgy?

Not going with it.

Peter, would you like to join us
in a parlor game?

Parlor game? Lois, why you
always start talking like a snob

when you're around your parents?

What? It's the way I was brought up.

I know, let's play "The Minister's Cat."

I don't know what that is.

It's simple. In alphabetical order. Go.

The minister's cat is an affable cat.

The minister's cat is a boisterous cat.

Penrose!

The minister's cat is a covetous cat.

The minister's cat is a devious cat.

The minister's cat's an eclectic cat.

Peter, your turn. Go.

-Wh... What?
-Peter, hurry.

I don't... I don't know this cat.

Damn it, Peter, you ruined the game!

Peter, perhaps the word
you were looking for is "forgotten."

<i>Midnight</i>

<i>Not a sound from the pavement</i>

<i>Has the moon lost her memory?</i>

<i>She is smiling alone</i>

You kids are too young to remember that,
but your parents are gonna hate it.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

(SIGHS) Finally, a place to escape.

Oh, hey, Babs.

Hello, Peter. What brings you out here?

I had to get away from that stupid game.

I don't know, whenever I'm here,
I feel out of place.

It's just a different world
than I'm used to.

(BELCHES)

Bring that up again, and we'll vote on it.

Whoa, where'd you learn a line like that?

Oh, there's a lot you don't know about me.

You know, Peter,
you and I are not so different.

You struggle to get erections, too?

You may think I've always been a part
of this high-society world,

but I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

Well, that probably would've torn
your mom's uterus.

My point is,
I'm not from an upper-crust world, either.

I just had to act that way to impress
Carter, who cared about that stuff.

I was struggling to be something I wasn't.
In many ways, I still am.

There's an Ed Sheeran song for
every emotion you're feeling right now.

Ooh, no, thank you.

You know, I like hanging out with you.

Hey, what do you say
we ditch this stuffy place

-and head to the Clam?
-The Drunken Clam?

Why, I haven't been there
in decades. I'd love to.

-To the Babsmobile!
-(ALARM CHIRPS)

<i>(BATMAN </i>THEME PLAYING)

You got vehicles
with your face on 'em, too?

You know it, stinky.

Oh, I didn't like being called stinky.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Babs, I got to hand it to you.

You turned a crappy night
into something great.

You know, I've never dropped bowling balls
from an overpass before. They fall quick.

That was the most fun I've had in decades.

It felt good to reconnect
with the girl I once was.

Hey, listen,
you got to stay true to that girl.

She's an amazing person. A real person.

Not some stuffy Newport snob.

Oh, sometimes I feel trapped
in this world,

forever trying to live up to
everyone else's expectations,

especially Carter's.

Sounds like
you've wasted your entire life.

Thank you, Peter.

You've helped me more than you know. Mwah.

Yuck.

Well, Brian, I've studied pie-making,

and the key is to find
the absolute freshest ingredients.

Therefore, we must go wherever
and "whenever"<i></i>they're to be found.

-Where are we?
-1666, England.

Home of Sir Isaac Newton
and one of history's most famous apples.

Which will be part of our pie.

Ah! Gravity never happened!

Good morning, family.

And before anyone asks,
I brought this owl from home.

I did not take it
from the enclosed owlery.

Just want to make that clear.
Home-brought owl.

Peter, what did the two of you
talk about last night?

-(HOOTS)
-Yeah, who?

You can see why I stole this
from the owlery...

I mean, brought it from home. Damn it!

My mother. After your night together,
she told Daddy she's leaving him.

-(HOOTS)
-Yeah, who?

All right, I'm already
getting tired of this owl.

I'm gonna go put him back in the owlery.

Peter, enough.
You've got to make this right.

Now, that one seemed less earned.

(SEABIRDS CALLING)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Babs, I've been looking all over for you.

-What are you doing here?
-This is my hometown, Peter.

It's where I grew up.

In fact, as a rebellious teen,
I used to come down to this boardwalk

and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets
to the seagulls.

(SQUAWKING)

Babs, you got to come home.
Carter needs you.

I'm sorry,
but I, I can't do that right now.

(SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)

Peter, you've been able
to stay true to who you were.

-I've lost touch with that.
-(SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)

It's been buried by Carter and his money.

I want to find it again.

Listen, Babs, I understand
what you're doing. I really do.

Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois

and my stupid mother-in-law,
but you got to come home.

-(SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)
-I don't think so, Peter.

You and Carter are meant for each other.

You go together.
Like the couple from the movie <i>Grease.</i>

Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-Ka-Dinga-
Da-Dinga-Dong, do you take

Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda-
Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom

-to be your wife?
-I do.

And Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda-
Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom,

do you take Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-
Ka-Dinga-Da-Dinga-Dong

-to be your husband?
-I do.

If anyone objects to this union,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

-(ALL GASP)
-Mr. Chang-Chang-Changity-Chang-Sha-Bop!

Peter, where have you been?

Listen, Carter,
unless you want to lose Babs forever,

you better get down to Weekapaug.

Why the hell would I do that?

If you want to win her back, maybe,
for once, you try to fit into her<i></i>world.

You got to become a regular guy.

What? No! Never!

Daddy, Peter's right.
You got to do this for Mom.

All right, fine.
I'll take a quick choke-myself-awake nap

and be ready to go.

(SNORING)

(CHOKING)

(CLEARS THROAT)
All right. All right, let's go.

-I'm so nervous.
-You made a damn good pie, Stewie.

You should be proud of yourself,
whatever happens.

<i>Good afternoon, Quahog,</i>
<i>I'm Tom Tucker...</i><i>in a T-shirt?</i>

<i>And now,</i>
<i>the moment you've all been waiting for.</i>

<i>This year's Quahog pie-baking champion is</i>

<i>Fjurg Vanderploeg.</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Everyone is welcome to taste my "pie."

Sorry, Stewie. You did your best.

These were old pros.
But, hey, look. You took fifth.

Fifth? Is that good?

-Do I get a medal?
-You get a ribbon.

Does everyone
who participates get a ribbon?

Only 10 out of 14.

My God. I did it.

No, Stewie, you<i></i>did it...

Oh, wait. Sorry, I thought you...

-I thought you said "we did it."
-I did not.

Good job, little boy.

Maybe someday you can come by my store
and have all the "cake"<i></i>you want.

-Ooh, that sounds promising.
-Okay, that's enough.

And maybe this winter,
you can go fishing in my "ice" hole.

BRIAN: I said enough!

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC STOPS)

I think I went too big with the boots.

Buddy, I think you might be
in the wrong place.

Yeah, you get lost
on the wrong side of town, boot boy?

-(WHISPERS) Peter.
-Go with it. It's all part of the ruse.

I say we take his pants down,
see what he's working with.

And while we're at it,
give me that pool cue.

I got an idea where we can put it.

-Peter, shut up.
-Carter? Is that you?

Oh. Hey, Babs.
I hang out here all the time.

Yeah. He comes in here with me.

And I'd even take a lie detector test
to prove it.

Well, good thing
the bar is having Lie Detector Wednesday.

Wh... What?

Just a few easy warm-up questions.

Have you ever had condomless sex
with a man?

Okay, test over.
Carter's never been here in his life.

Damn it, Peter. I'm leaving.

(CREAKING)

-(MEN GASP)
-My truck!

Time to waste this fancy-pants.

(GRUNTS)

Babs, you saved me.

And the bartender's unconscious.

Let's take his pants down,
see what he's working with.

(CHEERING)

(CRYING) Babs, I'm sorry.

I tried, but I can't do it.

I'll never be the real man
you want me to be.

I'll always be just a spoiled,
spineless, rich dandy.

Carter, I appreciate you trying
to be the man I want,

but being back home here
has made me realize you already are.

What? I am?

I've discovered
I'm not the same girl I once was.

I've changed.

I've grown accustomed to life with you.

I thought I wanted this life back,
but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best?

It's an awful, awful, awful...

-It's one of our sponsors.
-...delicious beer,

but, still, ours is the life I want,
and you are the man I want.

Newport is my home now,
and I'm ready to go back there.

Oh, Babs.

(MOANING)

Ah, old love.

(CREAKING)

Well, I didn't pay for my beer,
but I left a hell of a tip.

(LAUGHTER)

Damn it, Griffin!
You've been staring at that menu

for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting
in a double pee puddle!

Peter, I'm so relieved
that my mother's back with my dad.

Yep. It all worked out.

Only one thing left to do.

Get drunk, go upstairs
and weird out the kids.

(QUIETLY) Chris.

Are, are you awake?

Chris, you... Do you want a...
You want a Tom Brady kiss?

Chris, wake up.

I, I want to give my son a Tom Brady kiss.

Welcome, everyone.
My name is Von Jiener,

of Creative Bankruptcy

for the Fox TV network,

which, at the time of this writing,
is still a thing that exists.

Just from looking at
your clothes and weight,

I can tell you all watch a lot
of free network television.

-Am I right?
-ALL: Mm-hm.

(LAUGHS) Excellent.

You have been selected
to be part of a focus group

that could affect one of America's

most beloved television shows: <i>Family Guy.</i>

That woman looks exactly like me.

That's your reflection, Peter.

Oh.

I'm beautiful.

As you may or may not care,
<i>Family Guy </i>is in its 17th season.

And since Fox is now owned by Disney,

which will someday be owned by Netflix,

which will someday be owned by Pornhub,

we have decided that <i>Family Guy</i>
is ready for a reboot.

Reboot? I thought they said
it was a couple of tweaks.

Yeah, we're supposed
to trust these idiots?

That woman has her finger up her nose.

That's still your reflection, Peter.

Oh. She's beautiful.

Now, as most unfunny women will tell you,

women are very funny.

That's why our first reboot
is built around

the very popular Louise.

-LOIS: It's Lois.
-Whatever. The mom.

LOIS: (SINGING)

Going to work, huh?

Yes, Joe, I'm going to work.

Great! More and more women are doing that.

Good morning, goddess.
You know, I just want to say again

that you were totally
right last night to bring up

that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.

And please feel free
to bring it up again anytime,

even if we're talking about
something completely unrelated.

Thank you, Peter, I will.

(LAUGHS) Oh, I... I know you will.

-Morning, Lois.
-Hey, girl.

Oh, hello, gay couple
who's constantly jogging.

What are you up to this morning?

Just adopting and pucker-kissing.

Yeah, we're network TV gay,

so all we can do is adopt children

and pucker-kiss, no tongue stuff.

-Isn't that right, sweetie?
-BOTH: Mwah!

Well, I'm off to my high-powered job

at a fashion magazine,
greeting card company or winery.

I can't wait to see which.

LOIS:<i> Oh, yay! It's a winery!</i>

Good morning, Judy Greer.

Morning, Lois.
How was your night last night?

Great. I worked out, made dinner,
a little family time,

and had Peter's ankles
up in the air by 11:00.

God, I admire you.

That's what you're here for, Judy Greer.

(GASPS) Oh, I almost forgot.

Bert wants to see you in his office.

-Oh? What about?
-He didn't say.

But it sounded hashtag serious.

Aw, meeting with the boss.

This is gonna be worse than
finding a spider in the kitchen.

Oh, my God.
Peter, there's a spider in here!

Yeah, I know, genius.

Hi, Lois.

I wanted to let you know

I'm considering you for a big promotion.

Really? That's amazing.

(CHUCKLES)
Well, the job's not yours yet.

It's between you and one other person,

Smarmy J. Tie-Straightener III.

I hit a gay jogger
on my way to work today.

(TOILET FLUSHES)

Sorry I only satisfied you twice tonight.

I found a pouch
of Big League Chew earlier,

and my jaw is worn out.

You did great, Peter.

Good night, perfect.

Aw, I just don't know what to do
about this thing at work.

I... Are we still talking about that?

I mean, it's fine if we are, we just...

We talked about it before dinner and...

And during dinner and after dinner.

No, you're right. I'll be fine.

Good night, Peter.

(SIGHS)

I just want this promotion so bad.

Okay, so we are talking about it.

You know what?
I'll make a vision board.

See my success and be my success.

My testosterone is so low,
I could not have thought of that.

Would you like me to put on
our sleep ocean noises

with an occasional
shocking seagull screech?

Yes, thanks.
I have a big day tomorrow.

Good night.

and I'm proud to announce

that person is Smarmy...

Excuse me, where do I put
this briefcase full of money?

Uh, who are you?

I'm president of Wine
and Paint Night Incorporated.

Lois Griffin just landed my account

through her wit, charm,
and professionalism.

Is that so? Well, in that case,

the big promotion goes to Lois Griffin!

What can I say? I love my wife.

Eh, it's my show.

'Cause I'm the funny one.

Or am I?

Ah, I thought we had one more face.

So, what did you think?

And please keep in mind
that your spontaneous comments

will affect the jobs
of hundreds of people.

Come on, you idiots, don't screw me.

The show is from a woman's perspective,

but it still felt like
it was written by a man.

Okay, well, what if I told you shut up?

Yeah, kind of changes things, doesn't it?
Anyone else?

I'm sorry, I was scrolling through
the weather in random cities.

Great! You're taking this very seriously.

You know what,
I don't really get <i>Family Guy.</i>

What's so hard to get?

You just need to have grown up in the '80s
but still be a teenager.

So, based on that one episode
featuring Lois,

how many of you would
likely watch a second?

LOIS: Son of a bitch!

Anything else?

Huh, 76 in Santa Fe right now.

Hey, what's going on in that room?

It's a focus group of Arby's executives
watching us eat.

-Oh!
-No way!

-He ate it!
-People will eat anything!

a third Big Beef 'n Cheddar.

-Don't do it.

Here she comes.

Many recent shows have found success

by rebooting themselves as
gritty supernatural teen dramas,

like <i>Teen Wolf </i>or <i>Riverdale,</i>

which are watched by as many
as 6,000 people a year,

so we thought a similar approach
might work for <i>Family Guy.</i>

Now is when you find out I'm the sheriff.

I'm laying

on a pinecone.

(EXHALES)

He means lying on a pinecone.

Now what happens?

Now one of us will become
a breakout movie star

and leave the series,
wrecking it for the rest of us.

Yay, it's me!

-Sir, what did you think?
-Pass.

Okay. And how many of you would watch it

if the girls were wearing
white shirts and black bras?

Peter, did you
write the focus group questions?

What? Course not.

"And if you're impressed by the size

"of Alexander Skarsgard's penis,
that doesn't make you gay, right?"

-(POUNDING ON GLASS)
-PETER: Answer him!

I know you've been here all day,

but it's not like you have jobs to go to,

so I'm going to show you
one more reboot idea.

Which Wi-Fi should we be logging onto?

Glendale Galleria Public.

Yeah, that's what I've been trying.

Sometimes networks will cancel a show

only to reboot it
with less-popular characters

from the original,
while the more-popular actors go on

to find greater success in movies

or ugly public divorces.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

Hello? Oh, hey there, Stewie.

Or should I say, "G'day, mate,"

since you're in Queensland,
Australia, where you moved

with Brian and Meg after Mom and Dad died?

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, married life is pretty good.

No, still no kids,
but I've been practicing

-a lot by myself.
-(LAUGHTER)

Masturbating, yes.

Between you and me,
I think Tricia might be barren.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Uh, Stewie, I better go.
Tricia's giving me that look.

(LAUGHTER)

Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg,

and hopefully we can come down
there for the season finale.

No? You're just not gonna
be a part of this at all?

Okay, then. Bye, Stewie.

Chris, I'm standing here
in the living room

because I need to talk to you
about something very important.

Look, we've been through this.

It's my house,
and I want to wear shoes in it.

Chris, I offer you a choice.

You can either continue
wearing shoes in the house

or continue having sex

with this age-defying Eastern physique.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Chris, I'm lying here
listening to you toss and turn,

and wondering if there's
something you'd like to discuss.

I don't know. It's just, it's been so hard

since Mom and Dad died

and Joe moved in
with all his big band records.

(BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

Joe!

Chris, I'm lying here

asking you to kick Joe out of the house.

What? He was my dad's
best friend for 20 years.

I can't do that.

Chris, I offer you a choice.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Luckily, I'm the town windower.

For me, every day is a pane.

FOCUS GROUP MEMBER:
<i>Can we please stop this?</i>

Yes?

If I give you back my Diet Sprite,
can I leave?

How did you feel about the show?

-I didn't like it.
-Could you be more specific?

I just don't like the people
or what they're saying or doing.

If you could sum up the show
with one sound,

what would it be?

-"Blech."
-For me, it was more like

the last squirt
of a plastic mustard bottle.

(BOTTLE SQUIRTS)

Is that our mustard?

No. I always bring one with me
in case the show is kind of...

-(BOTTLE SQUIRTS)
-Everybody, shut up!

Hey, it's that sheriff from <i>The Q.</i>

You people don't like anything.

Well, if you're all so smart,

what do you want to see
in a <i>Family Guy </i>reboot?

Yes, unemployable neck tattoo guy.

It's a <i>Bible</i> verse.

Doesn't matter. Anything above
the Adam's apple means drugs.

I like Netflix. Could you be Netflix?

Yeah, Netflix is awesome.

Of course it's awesome, it's Netflix.

Look, we're stuck being Fox.
We have to deal with it, okay?

-MAN: I watch Fox.
-No, you don't. Nobody does.

Yeah, I like shows that are binge-worthy.

First of all, "binge-worthy"
is not a word,

it's a marketing tool.

You've been brainwashed, sir. But fine.

We'll make <i>Family Guy </i>binge-worthy.

See? Wasn't that terrible?

All right, we only have the room
till 6:00, so what else?

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-It's not 6:00 yet! What else?

<i>Young Sheldon </i>is good.
How about <i>Young Family Guy?</i>

How about I murder your whole family?

-What about <i>BoJack Horseman?</i>
-Hard no.

-You'd get to be a horse.
-Hard yes.

-Normal words, but a horse guy.
-WOMAN: Can we please stop this?

You just asked for specifically that.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-It's not 6:00! What else?

-I like that <i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>
-Fine.

And you're saying this is...

George Washington's poop. That's correct.

I have some news you might not like.

The poop is only two weeks old.

What? How can you be sure?

Well, for starters,
there's a Skittle in it.

Ah, the general had a sweet tooth, huh?

Um, that was horrible.

Eh, I'm gonna tweeze the Skittle out
and go back in a week.

I like those Netflix stand-up specials.

Great. Matter of fact, we filmed one

back when I was an all-setup-
no-punch-line comedian.

So, any of you out there have a futon?

-Yeah, yeah, right?

Hey, hey, this is my job.

I don't go down to Burger King.

That was terrible.

Netflix should make 800 more of those.

All right, what else?
What else you guys want?

I like that thing James Corden does:

<i>-Carpool Karaoke.</i>
-I can do that.

Hi. You having a good night? I did.

Just had a devil's three-way.

You know, me and two guys.

I think that's just gay sex.
Why are you telling me all this?

Isn't this <i>Taxicab Confessions?</i>

No, this is <i>Carpool Karaoke.</i>

We're about to sing an Adele song.

Oh, that's gay.

Pull over by this hot guy and let me out.

I thought I read you guys
were phasing out gay jokes.

That quote was taken out of context
and widely misunderstood.

All right, what's next, you sheep?

I like the Olympics.
Can you guys be the Olympics?

Well, NBC hogs all the good sports,

so we'll get stuck with the boring ones

that the announcers always
have to keep apologizing for.

PETER: Welcome back to pairs diving.

And once again, we are so sorry for this.
Brian, anything to add?

BRIAN: No, just our deepest condolences
to a bored nation.

PETER: And we've got Lois
down at the pool.

-Lois, anything?
-No. Guys, just so sorry

that any of this is happening.

I... I mean, even once every four years

seems like just way too much.

BRIAN: And they're up in the air,
and now they're in the water.

PETER: What is it again? A splash is bad?

BRIAN: Uh, yeah, I think so.

PETER: That's so stupid.

I'm sick of all the voices on your show.

-Can you change them up?
-To who?

I like Jon Benjamin voices.

Can you all be Jon Benjamin voices?

-(JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE) Hey, Joe.
-(JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE) Hey, Peter.

(JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE) Hey, Quagmire.

(JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE)
Hey, Cleveland. Giggity.

What can I get for you fellas?

Nobody touches my voice.

(JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE)
I liked all of that.

Um, except for the bartender.

Hey, guys, The Coffee Bean's
Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.

Everyone, the reboot is off.

It turns out the executive who ordered it

was just a squirrel
who snuck into the office.

-What?
-Yes. But in fairness,

it was the same squirrel
who green-lit <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine,</i>

the show that challenged the notion

that only attractive people
can be on television.

So, what does that mean?

It means <i>Family Guy </i>is just fine as it is.

(CHEERING)

Well, the <i>Family Guy </i>reboot is off.

What other ideas do we have?

(CHITTERING)

<i>Brooklyn Nine-Ten?</i>

It's possible this guy only has one idea.

(BOTTLE SQUIRTS)

You know what, I'm glad, after all that,

they let us keep the show the way it was.

Well, not exactly the way it was.

Hey, buddy, I brought over
my big band records.

What-What's all this?

Oh, this little oogie-woogie
is my new friend, Albertine.

Who thinks she's French.

She loves to smoke
and feels it's not truly a meal

unless you serve bread.

(IN BABY VOICE)
Isn't that right, Albertine?

You got to serve bread?

I don't believe
she's ever said any of that.

So where have you been lo these many days?

Joe!

Well, you know how there's
hardly any cat cafés in town?

Well, I decided to open a cat café.

What's a cat café?

It's like a coffee shop,

except one where lots of cats
live and roam.

Hmm, methinks the cat café
sounds like a great idea.

That's it, Joe! I challenge you to a duel!

Pistols at midnight.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

JOE: Peter, did you bring a flamethrower?

PETER: No.

I also didn't bring one of them

Aah!

Good. We'll keep him
till we get a new mayor.

Principal Shepherd,
we were so surprised to get your call.

What's going on?

Mrs. Griffin, Meg and Chris
were caught cheating.

-What?
-Yes.

They had the Lost Boys of the Sudan
standing in for them in gym class.

Nice block, Griffin.

Nice shot, other Griffin.

This is terrible.

Uh, what do you think about this, Peter?

(IN SUDANESE ACCENT) Bad. Very bad.

-(CATS MEOWING)
-Here it is, guys.

What do you think?

I'm realizing I may have a cat allergy.

I think it's great, Glenn.

And people really seem to be
enjoying themselves.

Boy, if I could clean myself
with my tongue,

I'd never leave the house.

(LAUGHING)

Right?

And it's like, if I had nine lives,
maybe I'd finally find a man.

(LAUGHING)

You's joining me.

-Peter, we have to talk.
-What fireworks?

After what happened today
with Meg and Chris at school,

I sent an e-mail to my sister,
and five minutes later,

Google Ads suggested
a Christian family camp.

Yeah, the world's better
now that corporations read

our most private communications
and then sell back at us

the very things
they've eavesdropped about.

(FIREWORKS WHISTLING, POPPING)

Even before this, I'd worried about
our church attendance dropping off.

Now with the kids showing
a complete lack of morals,

well, we may all need
to go to Christian family camp.

Lois, you know I love you like a brother,
but I'm not doing that.

I'd only get in an awkward,
campfire-crackle argument

with a counselor.

Jesus has love for everyone.

Uh, actually, what Jesus has
is the might of Western civilization.

Jesus has guns, germs and steel.

Sorry, the wood is very wet.

Uh, actually, the wood is very dry.

Wet wood hisses, dry wood crackles

(CATS HISSING)

Hey! Shut up! (BLEEP)

Don't look at me! I'm dominant!

Brian? What are you doing here?

What am I doing here? What is all this?

I happen to own this place.
It's a cat café.

Now get out of here.
You're making all my cats angry.

That's why they're hissing.

Actually, frightened cats hiss.

Angry cats moan.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

You can't open this place here.

It's right next to my favorite bar.

Go to hell, Brian.
You don't own this block.

I'm not going anywhere.

Fine. But I am about to become
your worst nightmare.

No way.
I've already had my worst nightmare.

I've told you about
my worst nightmare, right?

-No, I-I don't think so.
-Oh, boy, get comfortable.

Well, first, I'm driving through a forest,

but it's actually inside,
which is weird, right?

-Okay.
-And there's all these people

in the van who normally
wouldn't know each other in real life:

my second grade teacher, my mom,
Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.

So all the kids
are yelling at me in German,

and I understood them,
but I don't speak German.

And then <i>SNL </i>is starting,
and I'm clearly in the cast,

and I haven't been
to any of the rehearsals,

and all the cue cards are blank,
and that show is all cue cards.

And just as that's sinking in,

I realize I'm also the musical guest.

I mean, I can't pull that off.

Who do I think I am-- Silverchair?

And the weird thing is I have this dream

-Wait a minute.
-over and over...

Listening to other people's nightmares
is my worst nightmare!

(SHOUTS) Oh. Oh, thank God.

I got to shut down that cat place.

(HORN HONKS)

Okay, Peter, the kids and I
are off to church camp.

Meg, Chris, the vans are here.

Wait a minute.

-You got any booze in that bag, mister?
-No, sir.

Well, then how you gonna
make any friends at camp?

Here you go.

Now chug all this next to a lake,
you little rascal.

BRIAN: (AMPLIFIED) Shut down the cat café!

It's a nuisance
and a threat to public health!

(SIGHS) Oh, for God's sake.

City ordinance 321(c) states,

"Food or drink shall not
be prepared or consumed

"within 20 feet of fecal matter."

Damn it, Brian.

Also, Persian cats?

Let's call them what they are:
Iranian cats.

This entire operation
needs to be shut down.

And as long as Brian's got your attention,

is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?

More wipes these days?

I'm taking shorter poops
but with longer wipes,

and there's always this one little line.

I swear to God,
it's like there's a crayon down there.

Wait, excuse me for a minute.

Son of a gun, it was a crayon.

Thanks for letting me
talk that out, everybody.

Wikipedia states that

"Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic
disease spread by exposure

"to infected cat feces."

Damn it, Brian, get out of here.
You're scaring away my customers.

They also ring you up
on one of those tablets

they flip around at you and then glare

while you pick from
three inflated tip percentages.

You can also choose "no tip."

But that option is, by design,
much less prominent.

You're a jerk.

But fine, if it's a fight you want,
you got one.

I will squash you like a bug.

Well, that's enough of that show.

But, Dad, we want to see
what happens at Christian camp.

All right. But they're on thin ice.

Welcome to Sunrise Woods Bible Camp.

I'm the camp director, Vera.

Nice to meet you. We're the Griffins.

Why are all these trees bunched together?

Th-Those are woods, Chris.

I only like rooms.

What a lovely setting.

Yes, the fresh air really helps

clear your mind of thoughts
of Tom Selleck.

Oh. How frighteningly specific.

Ugh. Mom, this place sucks.
It's even worse

than when Dad sent us
to 1940s comedy school.

Say, Corporal, what are you
writing in your diary?

It's private. Take a look.

Now, that's some good, clean fun.

Also in the 1940s, six million Jews died.

That's it, we're done.

This show is not for the Bugsteins.

Good evening. Quite a battle brewing--

clever news pun, doesn't really
work as I haven't yet mentioned

the subject of the story--
at Quahog's new cat café.

Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa
filed this report.

Tom, I'm standing here
outside of Quahog's new cat café.

Local resident Brian Griffin
has described the café

as a threat to public health.

That's right, Tricia.
And since I'm on local TV,

(LOUDER) I'm gonna talk a little too loud,

and then occasionally I'm gonna turn away

(SOFTLY) from the microphone
to point at things off-camera,

(LOUDER) so my overall point is lost.

Powerful claims. Thank you, Brian.

Okay, Brian, I brought everything we need:
water, sunscreen,

(SOFTLY) Fruit Roll-Ups,

-batteries.
-Stewie,

you know you're not allowed
to have Fruit Roll-Ups.

Damn, I tried to bury it in there.

What are you even wearing?

Oh, this is what Princess Diana
wore to protest land mines.

It's sad she's not around
to watch her son go bald.

Brian, I'm glad you're here.

Based on the various public
health concerns you raised,

the city has decided
to shut this establishment down.

Really? You're closing the café?

That's right.
Thanks to you, I'm out of business.

I certainly hope you're happ...
Oh, nice top, Stewie.

Come on, lock it up.

Until the Board of Health
gives the okay, you're done.

Wow, I actually got the place shut down.

I'm glad I was here for this, Brian.

We've hardly done anything
together since we made

that fiber commercial
and had to use code words for pooping.

Wow, Brian, I've never felt so regular.

Yes, you seem exceptionally
active while maintaining

-proper body health.
-That's right.

Just two spoonfuls a day
to stay regular and active.

-More coffee, Stewie?
-Yes, please.

Oh, dear, that was a mistake.

(STAMMERS) You mean,
you're about to be active?

Currently active.

Cut to the shot of them
stirring the product into water!

ANNOUNCER: <i>GurgleMax,</i>

<i>Take a massive comfort.</i>

(GROANING) Oh, God!

Oh, there's regular on the carpet!

Oh, there's so much regular!

How are those drawings of Jesus coming?

Okay, a little dark on the hair there.

Let's lighten it up. Lighten it up.

Eyes should be blue.

Remember, history says
that Jesus does not look like

a traditional man from the Middle East,

but rather someone
who sells raw milk online.

Okay, let's put those away for now.

I'd like to move on to having you all
sign your contracts with God.

Contracts with God?

Yep. It's a written commitment
to forgo all alcohol,

drugs and self-pleasure.

Yeah, I'm gonna
have my lawyer look at this.

I tell you, it's a good day, Stewie.

Now that that cat café is gone,
I can finally get back

to my favorite bar and do some writing.

Whoa, sorry. Can't let you in there.

What? I come in here all the time.

Well, apparently, due to some
recent public health concerns,

the city has said that
no animals of any kind are allowed

in any public establishment.

What? You got to be kidding me!

Well, that's all right, Brian.
We can go to my<i></i>writing spot.

-Brian! Look at my jump!
-(KIDS LAUGHING)

Look at my jump! Look at my jump!

Whoa!

This place has the best
pizza and Pepsi, Brian.

Did you hear me? The best pizza and Pepsi.

Oh, no, my pizza and Pepsi!

-Oh, hey, Peter. Come on in.
-(CATS MEOWING)

Thanks for coming by.

Aw, no problem, buddy.
Here, I brought you something.

I figured anyone living alone with 73 cats

needs to have a double-XL
Minnie Mouse sweatshirt.

Thank you so much.

This won't fit at all. It's perfect.

So how's it going?

Well, not bad. Got plenty of company.

Well, that's good.
I haven't seen you at the Clam.

Well, I've been pretty busy.

So, can I get you something to drink?

Sure. What have you got?

Well, I've got water with cat hair in it.

Eh, anything else?

I've got lemonade with cat hair in it.

Uh, kind of a summer drink. Anything else?

Oh, sure. Cat hair ginger ale?

-Nope.
-Cat hair iced tea?

Uh, again, summer.

You want to just take a look
in the fridge, see what I got?

-PETER: Sure.
-(CATS MEOWING)

Someone just had kittens in my mouth.

What's up? What are you doing?

Nothing. I'm just sitting here,
trying to figure out

why we have stupid purple couches.

Have you ever known anyone in your life
to own a purple couch?

I would assume Steve Harvey.

That actually sounds right,
but-but what is this?

A picture of a mountain?

When have we ever been to a mountain?

-What mountain even is it?
-That's Mount Quahog.

(GRUMBLES) Yeah.
I don't know, feels made up.

Brian, is this all because
you haven't been able

-to get a drink?
-I haven't been able to go anywhere.

No dogs allowed in public places.

Yes, I was thinking about that.

What if there was a way for you to go out?

Emotional support animal?

Wear this, every place
will have to let you in.

-So long as I'm with you.
-Where'd you even get that thing?

The letters are iron-on.

The vest is from when
I worked at Office Depot.

One pen?

You're buying one pen?

Yep.

You don't work in an office
you can steal this from?

I work from home.

Ugh.

Mom, we don't really

No, Meg, just hang towards

-CHRIS: Good plan.
-Chris, stop relieving yourself.

You've got those pee eyes.

(SIGHING)

Brother Chris.

Do it again.

-Sister Lois?
-Oh, no, thanks.

Y-You'd have no way of knowing this,

but I'm actually having
a very good hair day.

When my hair gets wet, I tend to look like

a frazzled Sandra Bullock
from one of her comedies.

My ex-husband had Nazi
paraphernalia and he left me.

(EXHALES)

So I said,
"That shirt looks really good on you,"

and he says,
"Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me."

It's like, whoa,
all I said was I like the shirt,

and he has to drop "boyfriend"
like a nuclear bomb?

-I mean, that's on him, right?
-Yeah. I don't know.

Ugh, you're supposed to be giving me
emotional support right now.

Let's just get to the bar.

No, no, Brian, say something
nice about me right now.

Come on, Stewie, that's not what this is.

It is now. Say something nice about me

or I'll disappear like a serial killer
in a '90s movie.

-Stewie, wait. I need you to get in.
-I'm gonna do it.

(SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING)

-Okay, who's ready for some breakf...

Oh, crap, another one died.

Hey, hey, stop eating her! Get away!

Okay, new house rule.

Everyone look at me.

Don't eat the dead cats.

Oh. Hey, Quagmire.

We came to see how it's going.

Uh, how's it going?
I got a dead cat on a pitchfork.

I don't even know which can to put it in.

Trash? Yard trimmings? Recycling?

I just put whatever in whatever.

JOE: Hey, guys. Check it out.

Cat legs! Cats, arise.

Guys! It's working!

-(DOG BARKS)

I'm not dead.

Okay, we're getting
out of this place tonight.

Everyone clear on the plan?

CHRIS: Yep. Meg and I switch faces

-like in the movie <i>Face/Off?</i>
-No.

Oh. Then we have an issue.

I told you we should ask Mom first.

Why would you think that?

Ugh... Just... You two follow my lead.

You know, Vera,
I've been so moved by my time here

at camp, I wonder if I could
perhaps say grace tonight?

Oh, that'd be lovely, Lois.

Well, I'd like to begin
with a moment of silence.

A fully counted-out,
Mississippi, 60-second

moment of silence.

And the first one
to open their eyes is gay.

<i>There's no regret</i>

Ugh. Good riddance, Christian family camp.

Totally. I will say, though,

it seemed like Chris
enjoyed himself there.

Well, Meg, you know Chris is

(QUIETLY) a little bit dumb,

and I know you're not particularly popular

or beautiful, but you do
have a head on your shoulders.

So religion isn't gonna be
for people like you and me.

It's basically for

(QUIETLY) stupid people like Chris.

So, to summarize, religion for you and me?

No good. But for

(QUIETLY) idiots like Chris?

-Perfect.
-What are you guys talking about?

-How handsome you are.
-Really?

Swear to God.

You're a monster.

(MUTTERS) Stupid law. Banning dogs.

Kibbles and bits and bits and bits.

You! You son of a bitch!

This is all your fault.

-What the...
-Ha-ha!

You thirsty, boy?
Yeah, you're a thirsty boy.

-Wait a minute, we're fighting!
-(GRUNTS)

Aah!

And now, time to make my getaway.

Brian, oh, my God! Are you all right?

Here, let me mend you,
like in a 1990s action movie.

Ah, thanks. That is better.

Look at us. What are we doing?

(SIGHS) I don't even know anymore.

You know what?

I'm sorry I destroyed your dream,
Quagmire.

I know you loved that café.

Wow. Um... thanks, Brian.

Why did you open that place, anyway?

Well...

honestly, I just thought
that maybe I could

put something good in the world
for a change.

What do you mean?

I mean that... uh...

I've always been about sex
and seducing women,

but you know what?

Someday I'm gonna be dead.

And, I-I mean, is that my legacy?

I just thought if I created something
that makes people happy,

maybe people would remember me for that.

You probably think that's stupid.

Quagmire...

I'm here for you.

For emotional support.

Thanks, Brian. What do you say--

you want to go for a walk?

I always want to go for a walk.

Hey, does anyone know
what's going on with my brown crayon?

Because it disappeared
from the box for a while,

and now it's back.

It's a little-- I don't know--
oily and misshapen?

I'm not a crayon scientist,

but it looks like it's seen some heat.

This calls for a fountain dance.

(90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)

PETER:<i> I was the least graceful</i>
<i>at fountain dancing.</i>

<i>I just swung my arms and tried to fit in.</i>

<i>It was senseless. We were in our clothes,</i>
<i>for God's sake. Everyone got wet.</i>

<i>It was cold. You know,</i>
<i>there were originally nine friends,</i>

<i>but three of 'em died of pneumonia.</i>

<i>I'm still haunted</i>

<i>"Don't let Monica get Botox."</i>

<i>We also hung out</i>
<i>at</i><i>our favorite café, Perk Place,</i>

<i>where we would all sweat like crazy</i>

<i>'cause everyone in the '90s</i>
<i>wore turtlenecks,</i>

<i>vests, and Jamiroquai hats.</i>

Lois, you look down. What's wrong?

Brad Pitt broke up with me
in a pretty public way.

I just don't know if I'll ever date again.

Wait, I thought you and Dad
dated in high school. Did you break up?

Uh-uh, story's not over, Meg. Settle down.

Your father and I had dated
for a few years,

but I didn't know
if it was going anywhere.

So we decided to take a break,
but remained close friends.

I actually briefly dated
one of our roommates, Barry.

He was one of them what the fountain took.

My father had planned out
my whole life for me.

<i>He wanted me to marry</i>
<i>one of Quahog's up-and-comers,</i>

<i>Tom Tucker, Elmer Hartman,</i>
<i>Seamus or Billy Zane.</i>

LOIS: <i>Chris, I'm not sure</i>

<i>to just chime in whenever.</i>

Lois, let's go take a midnight swim
at Sharkbite Cove.

Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus,
but I have other plans.

Okay, well, I'm definitely going.

Peter, why don't you admit it?

You still got the hots for Lois.
It's obvious.

Nah, we're broken up.
We're just friends now.

(FOUR CLAPS)

<i>Looking back, I realize he was right.</i>

<i>But the '90s was an exciting time,</i>

<i>and we wanted to experience</i>
<i>all it had to offer.</i>

Hey, guys, there's a great concert
in World Trade Center Plaza this weekend!

Really? Who's playing?

They got Korn, Cranberries and Cake.

Oh, that sounds delicious.
But who are the bands?

They're opening with Cake.

Wait, shouldn't cake be last?
It's a dessert.

Korn is last.
Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.

Corn is not a bigger draw than cake.

-Cake is delicious.
-"No Doubt"?

Well, I'm glad you agree
with me, Quagmire,

but that still doesn't address
this issue of the order.

My last show was a Weezer concert.

Well, that's 'cause
everyone smokes nowadays.

What band did we see last time
at the Palladium?

It was, uh, Blur.

Yeah, I can't remember, either.

<i>It was just "vague business."</i>

<i>I would sometimes sneak away</i>

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

Peter, admit it.
You're still in love with Lois.

Yeah, every time you see her,
you go, "Schwing!"

Which is, like, the sound
of being lifted by a boner, I think.

Yeah, but we decided
we wanted to see other people.

That's only 'cause she got tired
of waiting around for you.

Look, she loves you,
but she ain't gonna wait around forever.

PETER: <i>I knew they were right.</i>

<i>Your mom was the only one I wanted</i>
<i>to spend</i><i>the rest of my life with.</i>

<i>So I saved my money, and a few</i>
<i>months</i><i>later,</i><i>I bought a ring.</i>

So, did you enjoy your pesto with pesto?

Does this smile give you your answer?

Lois, there's something I want to ask you.

Will you marry me?

Oh, Peter, I'm, I'm so sorry, but...

I'm already engaged to Tom Tucker.

Passed over for Tom Tucker?
That's terrible.

What do you think of that,
fellow '90s star Joey Lawrence?

-Meh.
-Oh. Huh.

Okay, well, what would you think
if I told you

that Blossom would completely
drop out of show business

to get a PhD in neuroscience,

and then come back
and make $15 million a year,

while you would
work steadily for 20 years,

lose all your hair and go bankrupt?

-Whoa!

Yeah, that's the...
That's the thing I wanted.

Where's Dad?

Sorry, I was just watching
some guy take it in the AOL.

<i>-Goodbye.</i>
-All right, where were we?

Mom just said
she got engaged to Tom Tucker?

Well, deep down,
I knew I loved your father,

but I guess I just caved
to my father's pressure.

And on my 28th birthday, he introduced me
to my future husband.

<i>So I decided I was gonna do</i>

number four, seven and eight.

-Think it should be number three as well?
-No!

Now back to your story.

I had just lost the love of my life.

So as a way to forget my pain,

<i>I saw </i>Ace Ventura <i>50 times.</i>

<i>-Ow!</i>

LOIS: <i>Meanwhile, my wedding plans</i>
<i>with Tom Tucker were back on.</i>

Are you ready? I can't believe
the wedding is just two scenes away.

What's wrong, sweetie?

I guess I'm just not sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

What if this is a mistake?

Trust me, you're doing the right thing.
It's gonna be great.

Now, listen, we don't have
too much time before the wedding,

so I want to go over something
regarding the father-daughter dance.

It goes, "Dallah-hollah
wallah-ballah-dallah Macarena,

wakka-lakka-chakka-hakka-bakka Macarena."

Daddy, I don't think <i>The Macarena</i>
is the best father-daughter dance.

Well, how about another song
from the '90s?

<i>Casey would waltz</i>
<i>With the strawberry blonde</i>

<i>And the band played on...</i>

What? Wrong '90s?

PETER: <i>Like everything stupid</i>
<i>in the '90s,</i><i>Googoogle took off.</i>

<i>We celebrated in grand</i>
<i>dot-com bubble fashion:</i>

<i>by having an outrageous yacht party</i>
<i>with lobster fights and hookers.</i>

<i>We did Ecstasy,</i>
<i>which was terrible for you,</i>

<i>and only ever made me feel fantastic.</i>

<i>Kids, don't do it. It's too awesome.</i>

<i>They said it would</i>
<i>burn a hole in your brain,</i>

<i>-but show me the hole.</i>
-LOIS: <i>Peter, that's enough.</i>

PETER: <i>If you hate pure,</i>
<i>unconditional love</i>

<i>and experiencing</i>
<i>the profound</i><i>harmony of the universe,</i>

<i>definitely do not try this drug.</i>

<i>There's also, like,</i>
<i>a 90% chance you'll hook up,</i>

<i>but really, no, don't do it.</i>

<i>Even if you don't hook up, you don't care.</i>
<i>But you'll hook up, guaranteed.</i>

LOIS: <i>Okay, Peter, let's move on.</i>

CHRIS: <i>And what was the name of that drug?</i>

PETER:<i> But despite our success,</i>
<i>something was missing.</i>

Peter, we did it!

What's the matter?
You still sad about Brandon Lee?

Yeah. I never heard of him before he died,
but when he died, it was so sad.

But also, it's Lois.
She's getting married tomorrow.

Somehow, all this success
feels meaningless,

knowing I'm about to lose her forever.

Peter, then you need to stop that wedding
before it's too late.

But we've got a business to run.

You don't care about this business.
All you've ever cared about is Lois.

This is your last shot.

Peter, you get to that wedding.

PETER: <i>They were right.</i>

<i>So I decided to get there</i>
<i>the way everyone got around in the '90s:</i>

<i>propelled by an explosion.</i>

(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

Do you, Lois
Commondenominator Pewterschmidt,

accept this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

(ALL GASP)

Peter? What the hell are you doing here?

Lois, can I talk to you privately?

What is it, Peter?

Before you marry Tom,

what's the <i>Mortal Kombat </i>blood code?
I keep forgetting.

It's "A-B-A-C-A-B-B,"
but you can't do this now.

You're ruining my wedding.

Lois, if I didn't come here,
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

I know I screwed up
and I don't deserve you,

but I can't stop thinking
about you, day and night.

It's been this way since the day we met.

I fell in love with you then,
and I'll never stop.

Unless Daisy Fuentes felt something?

DAISY: Uh, I didn't.

Lois, you're the only woman for me.

He cheated on you. No daughter of mine
is going to marry a cheater.

Daddy's right.
Peter, I'm sorry, but you blew it.

I was in love with you, too,
but then you cheated on me.

You kissed Daisy Fuentes.

Lois, there's something you should know.

He didn't kiss me. I kissed him.

Because you felt something?

-Because Carter paid me.
-Well, that's something.

Daddy... Is that true?

I only did it to protect you
from making a huge mistake.

Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome

as the guys your dad wants for you,

but I love you more
than all of 'em put together.

That's a fact. Just as sure

as the <i>Star Wars </i>movies
are a perfect isolated trilogy,

unmarred by additional canon.

Oh, Peter.

(ORGAN PLAYS <i>WEDDING MARCH)</i>

-Damn it, stop them!
-PETER: <i>One by one,</i>

<i>members of Lois' family</i>
<i>tried to stop me, but I laid 'em out.</i>

<i>There's something about punching someone</i>

<i>-in a church that just feels good.</i>

<i>Cleveland picked us up in a white Bronco.</i>

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Why did you have a white Bronco, Daddy?

I was driving my innocent friend O.J.
and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico.

PETER: <i>We eloped at Fenway Park,</i>

<i>which I paid 50 grand to rent out</i>
<i>the day before the dot-com bubble burst.</i>

I now pronounce this
the last straight marriage.

PETER: <i>And I think I got swindled</i>
<i>on the Fenway deal,</i>

<i>because there was a game that night.</i>

Aw.

Wow, Mom and Dad.
I feel like I learned so much tonight.

And not just about you guys,
but also about the '90s.

Oh, there's a lot more to learn
about the '90s, Meg.

Like, for instance, are you familiar
with a band called Counting Crows?

I think I might have
heard them in a Starbucks.

Yes, you have.

Anyway, their lead singer
is this thing called Adam Duritz.

He looks like if Marc Maron
had sex with a scarecrow

and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.

I always thought
he looked like the Cowardly Lion

in a suburban white high school
production of <i>The Wiz.</i>

-That's not what that is?
-No, Chris.

But actually, the joke's on us,

because this Sideshow Bob burnout
slept with a primo roster of '90s tail.

-Jennifer Aniston.
-No.

-Courteney Cox.
-What!

-Winona Ryder.
-That guy?

Christina Applegate,
Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum.

Ooh, this is just making me angry.

-Mary-Louise Parker.
-I hear she's difficult.

Lois and I are stocking up

for a very special anniversary evening,

and I'm not sure
that five percent discount

was worth checking in here on Facebook.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Ew, Meg, don't "like" that.

Anyway, to celebrate,
we thought it would be fun

to recount the three greatest
love stories ever told.

We'll begin with
the tale of Helen of Troy:

"The face that launched a thousand ships."

Which is the poetic way of saying,

"Helen of Troy was thicc, tho."

Which is the Black Twitter way of saying,

"She was very attractive."

(EXOTIC VOCALIZING)

The people of Troy's chocolate

has gotten into our peanut butter.

The people of Greece's peanut butter

has gotten all over our chocolate!

We could perhaps try the combined taste,

-or we could fight to the death.
-(ALL GASP)

Guys, stop! The Battle of the Greece's
Peanut Butter Cup

has gone on too long.

Let us agree to disagree.

Huh, what a pleasantly
de-escalating phrase

that I'm just now hearing
for the first time.

Yes, we will agree to disagree.

The war between the Greeks
and the Trojans is over!

(ALL CHEERING)

To Greece!

Now let's go call a bunch
of jagged rocks a beach.

(PAINED GRUNTING)

-Ooh! Ow!
-Sharp! Sharp! Sharp!

-Hot!
-Hot!

Man, I'm happy the war is over.

I can't wait to get back to Troy.

Yeah, I'm just gonna
plop down with my kids

and watch <i>Troy Story.</i>

To the other side of that hill...
and beyond!

That's as far as we know about right now.

You know what I just realized?

This. This could be a really long poem.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
Helen's in my cabin,

and I thought
I'd give heterosexual sex a try.

(DOOR CREAKS)

Helen? What the Hades?

What? She's hot.

But not as hot as Medusa.

Ah, one look at Medusa, and I'm rock hard.

Mythologically correct.

Coming up, Greek food
voted burpiest in the world.

But first, in tragedy news:

your queen, Helen, has run off
with Paris back to Troy.

This is an outrage!

I'll send my entire army after them,
led by my best warriors!

Achilles, ACL, get in here!

(PAINED GRUNTING)

-What?
-Helen has run off with Paris!

We're going to get her back
and burn Troy to the ground.

Well, that sounds good.

I just need to cancel my lesson
with Socrates first.

Isn't he that thinker
they keep shuffling around

from one philosophy school district
to the next?

No, no, he's the one whose method
is all about asking questions.

-Like what?
-"Have you ever tried wine?"

"Can you keep a secret?"

"You know this is your fault, right?"

Yeah, he'll... he'll make you
question a lot about yourself.

(EPIC MUSIC PLAYING)

So, we'll sail directly east,

and then head north at a 90-degree angle.

It's the fastest possible way
I can imagine getting there.

Hang on. Let me see that.

Pythagoras just invented this thing
called a "hypotenuse."

If we know this distance
and this distance,

we can calculate this more direct route.

Wow. Our people are, like, really smart.

I bet Greeks will always be known

for their advancements in math
and not as cartoon characters

with very hairy arms
and a tragically mismanaged economy.

Okay, I had a feeling this fortress
would be impenetrable,

so I've hired the finest builder in Greece

to make us a giant wooden horse.

We'll hide inside it,
they'll take it in as a gift,

and then we spring out
and destroy the city.

I call it "The Trojan horse."

Well, that sounds great,

but there's another door
right here that's just beads.

-What?
-Yeah. Just beads. See?

Oh, boy, this...

this is gonna be a difficult phone call.

Let's go! Let's go!
This needs to be done yesterday!

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Hello?

Giant Horse Company, Pay On Delivery,

No Deposit Required. Can I help you?

What?!

(ALL YELLING)

Where the hell is everyone?

Well, they left a note.

It says Helen and Paris went back

to the Greek Isles
to get married... (GASPS)

And all three of Helen's fathers
are going to be there?

<i>Dancing queen...</i>

They came!

Awesome! And now that
we're owned by Disney,

we can have Hercules here.

No?

They... they won't let us use him?

What was the point of this whole merger?

Well, who <i>can </i>we use?

"Launchpad McQuack"?

No. No. No, you know what? I'm exhausted.

I'm exhausted with being told "no."

And now I'm married. Ugh.

I'm gonna go break wieners off statues.

<i>(DANCING QUEEN</i> PLAYING)

Welcome back. My credit card
got declined at the sex store.

We ran off with only the stuff
we could keister.

Our next love story is <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

a 500-year-old tale about horny preteens

that society somehow decided
is classy and not perverted,

even though two middle schoolers
bang in it. Enjoy.

Two households, both alike in dignity,

in fair Verona where we lay our scene.

Well, I'd say Verona's better than fair.

<i>They's gettin' a Shake Shack this summer.</i>

<i>Ooh, milkshakes and crinkly fries.</i>

<i>I done chatterboxed my way</i>
<i>through the whole prologue.</i>

Boy, this is nice.

Will there ever be
a more popular Italian city

-than Verona?
-I don't know.

Are we even supposed to <i>be </i>at this party?

If they find out we're Montagues,
they might razz us!

Relax. No one's gonna recognize us.

We got inch-wide masks over just our eyes,

with the rest of our faces
plainly visible.

We're fine.

You wanted to see me, Daddy?

Juliet, honey, we need to talk.

You're a grown woman now,
and it's time for you to get married.

Grown woman? Daddy, I'm 13.

Shh. Uh, don't say that.
Tell people you're 11!

Do you want to get married or not?

(SIGHS) Fine.

Now, I found you
the most eligible bachelor

in all of Italy.

He's from the Boyardee family.
Kind of a big deal.

My family makes the best canned
sugar pastas in all the land.

Are you out of breath
from saying one sentence?

Just give me a second.

I'm in the midst of a full-on,
lockdown sodium headache.

I haven't peed for 36 hours.

Whew. Okay.

Okay.

I'll... I'll come over there. (GRUNTS)

Hey, there's something I want you to see.

Some greaseball at the bar
just drew a guy in a circle.

It's amazing.
He's this, and then he's this.

(STAMMERING) You got to come see it!

Romeo, we got to get out of here!

Tybalt found out we're Montagues,
and he's pissed.

Oh, man, I... I must have amnesia
or something,

'cause I don't (BLEEP) remember
inviting you guys.

-Who are you here with?
-Uh... Tony?

Gonna have to do better than that, man.
Lot of Tonys here.

Oh, did I say "Tony"?

I... I meant... I'm Abe Froman,
the sausage king of Chicago.

I'm right here.
You're looking right at me.

You know what? I'll come up there.

-Romeo, we can't.

What if my father sees us?

And "wherefore" means "why,"
by the way, not "where."

(SHUSHES) That's stupid. You're stupid.

Juliet, I know we just met,

but when I look at you,
I feel something special.

This is gonna sound crazy,
but... will you marry me?

Okay, let's do it.

I love you, Romeo.

Oh, I love you, too, Juliet.

I should probably let you know

I have a lot of Jack Skellington tattoos.

And I think you, specifically,
would make a great addition to our team.

I... I'll take the poison.
Thank you, Friar.

And... and since I'm picking up

Uh... (STUTTERING) I guess.

Can you make a paper airplane?

-I can.
-Then don't be so hard on yourself.

Oh, no!

And on top of that,

it's that time in late summer

I mean, there is baseball,
but it's not playoffs.

I might as well just be dead!

I better warily approach
that pot in silence,

knowing they'll add
dramatic music in post.

I wonder what they'll choose.

<i>No more Rice Krispies</i>

We ran out of Rice Krispies!

(SCREAM ECHOES)

Aw, I was going to kill the rabbit.

All right, listen, Beth,

I got something to tell you
in front of our kid.

-I had an affair.
-You what?

I know. It was awesome at the time,

and, frankly, I was real close
to getting away with it.

But now that there are
actual consequences,

I got to tell you the truth.

Dan, how could you...

Look, it's not my fault.

My plan was to just hide this
from you forever.

-Also, she's pregnant.
-How is that possible?

Well, when a man and a woman
like each other just a little

-and they get in an elevator...
-Oh, God!

How could I be so blind?

I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, honey.

But I will say,

at least <i>she </i>had a pot
of <i>something </i>on the stove

when I came home.

(CREAKS)

(CONTINUES CREAKING)

Well, now to defog this mirror
and see only myself.

(SQUEAKS)

Now to fully close the mirror
and have no changes.

(GASPS)

I'm sorry, Beth.

I have a fatal attraction to your husband.

Ah! She said it!
That'll be in the trailer.

I'm gonna do to you
what I did to your bunny

and your neighbor's cat

because I went to the wrong house
the first time.

(SIGHS) I love relaxing here
with that dry ceiling.

Huh. Wonder if the weather
called for living room rain.

WEATHERMAN:<i> Next up, Connecticut,</i>
<i>your living room forecast:</i>

<i>dry, dry, dry.</i>

(GASPS) That can only mean one thing!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Oh, my God!

It's happening. It's happening!

Dan, help!

-Right.
-(GRUNTS)

(STRAINING)

You deserve to die,

because the choices I made are your fault!

(MUFFLED CHOKING)

(BOTH PANTING)

All right, she's mostly choked.

Let's just sit on the floor
with our backs to the tub.

(SCREAMS)

(GUNSHOT)

It's just been revoked.

Hi, I'm Chris Griffin.

I didn't have a lot to do tonight.

But they did say they'd give me one minute

at the end of the show
to share my favorite love story.

Of course,
I chose the classic romantic tale

of the love between
a young man and pastry,

<i>American Pie.</i>

The store was all out of apple,

so this one is chicken pot,

fresh from the oven.

Here we go.

Ow, the piping hot gravy!

Oh! And one of the peas went inside!

It's so burned,

I can't tell what's chicken and what's me!

Oh, God! Not gonna stop though!

Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad,

from your teenage son

getting busy with a 400-degree pot pie!

ANNOUNCER: <i>TV, what a mess.</i>

Hi, everybody.

You know how I've been dieting
like a maniac the last couple weeks?

Aw, damn it, that means
we're having people over.

We're having people over!

I just got off the phone with my mom,

and all the Pewterschmidts
are coming here for Thanksgiving.

I can't believe
you invited the whole family.

You know I hate big Thanksgivings.

Don't worry, Peter, it's gonna be fun.

And I can handle most of the prep myself.

I just need you to go to the market

and get some extra napkins.

-That's not so bad.
-Oh. Pick up some wine for the adults.

I can do that.

And put the extra leaf
in the dining room table.

(BLEEP)

Oh, stop it. It's so simple.

Yeah, right. That table
ain't been opened in five years.

It'll be fine.
Just don't drink while you do it.

And for God's sake,
don't lose your temper with Chris.

All right, one, two, three.

Hup!

(METAL SCREECHES)

One more time.

-Hup!
-(METAL SCREECHES)

Okay, all right, bend the knees.

Let's give it a good pull.

-Hup!
-(METAL SCREECHES)

Yeah, I think one side is stuck.

Do you, son?
Okay, on three.

One, two, three.

-Hup!
-(METAL SCREECHES)

Hup! Hup!

Hup! Hup! Hup!

(BOTH PANTING)

I think it's still stuck.

Oh, is that right?

Lot of narration.

It's like opening a table with Ken Burns.

Um, why don't you go easy on that stuff?

This "stuff" is the only thing
stopping you

from getting so karate-chopped right now.

Okay, big pull, on three.

All right, one, two, three. Hup!

It's this one side, it's just stuck.

I know it's stuck!
Everyone sees it's stuck!

Are there voices you're hearing shouting,
"It's not stuck"?

'Cause if you hear any argument

from anybody who says it isn't stuck,

you send them to me, and I will
so karate-chop them in the face!

Got it?

I'm not sure that that's...

What?
What aren't you sure about?

Hup!

Hup! Hup! Hup!

Hey, Chris. Table looks stuck.

Oh, really?
"Sky blue," says star witness.

You know what's crazy
about this time of year?

Everything is pumpkin spice.

We all follow your Twitter feed, Joe.

God, Thanksgiving
is such a pain in the ass.

I hate hosting.

I hear you, Peter.
I hate Thanksgiving, too.

Bonnie's sister is married
to a real show-off.

Denise, Wendell, it's great to see you.

(MOTOR WHIRRING)

-Wendell.
-COMPUTER VOICE: Joseph.

It's just Joe. I think you know that.

My Thanksgiving's also a nightmare.

Donna's cousins are two-thirds
of Tony! Toni! Toné!

-Which ones?
-The "E" and the "I."

Aw, no Tony with a "Y."

That is correct.

We lack the alpha Tony.

Well, at least you guys
celebrate with your families.

Last year I spent Thanksgiving
with my old blow-up sex dolls.

Here you go, Carla.

See?
We can do other things together.

How's the turkey?
I made it myself.

Oh, don't look so surprised.

(AIR HISSING)

Ah. Someone's getting sleepy.

Must be the tryptophan.

I'll put a pot of coffee on.

Janet, coffee? Carla, coffee?

Dina, coffee? Sasha, coffee?

Dad, coffee?

I wish I had given you
more siblings, Glenn.

You know, sometimes I envy
the guys in the town jail.

They get a turkey dinner on Quahog

and don't have the hassle
of hosting their families.

Well, yeah, but they're in prison.

Nah, jail isn't prison.
Prison is big and scary.

Jail is just a sleeping deputy
with keys that can be grabbed

by a long broom handle
or a mischievous dog.

Do black people ever go to jail?

No. They go to prison.

Well, maybe going to jail
is what we should do.

-Peter, that's ridiculous.
-(TUTTING) Hear me out, hear me out.

We'll commit a small crime

and get put in jail for a couple days.

-That's insane!
-Peter, Peter, you're crazy!

-Ridiculous!
-Unconscionable!

<i>-Lump Monkeys!</i>
-Have you lost your mind?

-That's crazy!
<i>-Lump Monkeys!</i>

<i>All right, Joe, there's chaos at the top.</i>

<i>Time to step up and be the leader</i>

<i>-of this group of friends.</i>
-PETER: <i>Lump Monkeys!</i>

Guys, what if we all go to Vermont?

Let's just do Peter's thing.

Okay, if we want to get arrested,

the best way to do it is
to get caught on the Ring app

stealing people's packages.

(INAUDIBLE)

I forgot to steal the package.

I think this is probably enough.

I don't know exactly what this is,

but this... This is crime.

MAN: Swanson!

Police Superintendent Chalmers.

My brother is superintendent
of the schools in Springfield.

Our parents divorced
when we were very young.

I was raised entirely by our mother,

he by our father.

We've never met.
There's a lot of backstory.

And you four are under arrest.

(ALL GASP)

I can't believe the plan worked.

Here we are, the city jail.

What's going on?
Why aren't we stopping?

You guys think you're
the first ones to have this idea?

The jail's already full of dads
getting out of Thanksgiving.

Well, if we're not going to Quahog jail,

where are we going?

The only place where
there's room for the weekend:

the state penitentiary.

You guys thinking what I'm thinking?

Wacky mug shot montage.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, uh, are my friends coming?

No, they're all calling lawyers.

You used your one call
on this party photo booth guy.

Eh, we'll see who
has more fun this weekend.

Yeah, it just doesn't seem right.

We're in here, and everyone on Wall Street

is free as a bird.

Joe, now is not the time
for your bland political musings.

This sucks.
The courts are closed for Thanksgiving,

which means we can't even
go before a judge till Monday.

That's five whole days here.

What the hell are we gonna do?

Well, if we're congress, we'll do nothing.

All right, that one was sharp.
Good job, Joe.

And you know, maybe-maybe prison
won't be so bad.

Maybe we just got to make the best of it.

Like those guys over there. Look.

They're playing leapfrog.
No one's jumping, though.

And that guy in the back
definitely has to get up higher.

Who taught these guys how to play?

Peter, please stop watching it.

Guys, I think we're in trouble here.

Come on, we're gonna be fine.

Joe, you should be
more terrified than any of us.

What if someone figures out you're a cop?

It's not gonna happen.
I spent years undercover.

I'm a master of disguise.

What?
You're in a wheelchair.

You can't disguise yourself as anything.

(IMITATING CHRIS) Is that so, Dad?

Chris? But that's impossible.

I've seen Chris standing up many times.

(AS CHRIS) Have you?

Hey, Chris, I got two tickets for the Sox.

-Want to go?
-You got it, Dad.

Oh, charley horse.

Oh, another charley horse, huh?

Well, you sit tight, Chris.

I can just take Joe's
brother-in-law Wendell.

COMPUTER VOICE: Christopher.

It's just Chris.
I think you know that.

The conjugal visit room is being used.

So, does your foot reach?

Peter, enough.
You ruined Thanksgiving.

I have to host 20 people by myself.

-You smoke now?
-Yeah.

I have a husband in prison.

That's who smokes, genius.

Stewie, why do you look like
1976 Elton John?

I'm trying to keep a low profile.

You know that old sitcom premise

where the kid has two dates to the prom?

Well, I, um...

I may sorta, kinda
be engaged to four prisoners.

You're what?
Stewie, that's crazy.

Oh, relax, Brian, I'm just humoring them.

It's not serious.

Stewie, don't forget,

we're meeting DJs tomorrow.

Sure thing, Clint.

His mother thinks it's her wedding.

But we'll see.

How did you even meet these guys?

Easily.
They were my pen pals.

You have prison pen pals?

Yes. A lot of people write prisoners.

Even Hollywood celebrity Kal Penn.

Kal Penn writes a prisoner?

Yeah. Ken. Lives in California.

You've never heard
of Kal Penn's pen pal Ken

in the Cal pen?

How could I possibly
have heard of Kal Penn's

pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?

Through this song.

(SINGING) <i>Well, I do get a yen</i>
<i>Every now and then</i>

<i>To pick up a pen, like my pal Kal Penn</i>

<i>And a note I will send</i>
<i>Every now and again</i>

<i>To my pal Big Ben</i>
<i>Who is locked in the pen</i>

<i>'Cause he beat up some men</i>
<i>And he got five to ten</i>

<i>And he'll do it again</i>

<i>Dah, dah, dah-dah-dah</i>

<i>Kal Penn.</i>

-Who was that for?
-What are you talking about?

Phil Spector's in this prison.

Kid, I know talent and shooting
waitresses in the mouth,

and you've got talent.

We're gonna make a record.

God, every crevice
of this prison is terrifying.

Eh, it's not so bad.

I made one-eye contact with Bill Cosby.

Well, well, well.

Three "wells" is never a good sign.

-I think you guys have our lunches.
-Called it.

Uh, sorry, sir.
We don't want any trouble.

Yeah, we'll sit somewhere else.

Come on, guys, let's avoid confrontation.

And whatever happens,

let's make sure
we're not goaded into fights

by simple playground taunts.

Damn.
I was hoping for chicken.

Nobody calls me chicken.

-Peter, no!
-(BLOWS LANDING)

Aw, damn it, I lost a front tooth.

Well, hopefully in the prison yearbook

I'll just look like a cute kindergartner.

(PETER READING)

I'm starving.

We haven't eaten since we got here.

That's 'cause other prisoners
keep taking our meals.

And God knows what else
they're gonna do to us.

We have three more days here,

and we're not gonna survive
three more minutes.

That's 'cause you don't have a gang

-to protect you.
-A gang?

Yeah, when you're in a gang,
no one will mess with you.

That's why everyone joins one.

I used to be in a gang.

It was called the Republican party.

Our friend is very political.

So, how do we get
into one of these gangs?

Actually, you guys showed up
at the perfect time.

Tomorrow is the start of Prison Rush Week.

Get in one, and you're home free.

That's a great idea!

Let's celebrate by pretentiously
analyzing some prison wine.

(SNIFFS)

Okay, I'm getting notes of, um...

Uh, well, feces.

(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

Man, getting in a gang

is gonna be harder than I thought.

JOE: Speak for yourself, Peter.

What gang is this?

We're the Not Cops.

We're all definitely not cops.

So you think firemen are cool?

Firemen cook spaghetti.

And I think y'all know who I joined.

Are you now Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland?

I am Kareem Abdul-Jableeveland.

Hey, you know Muslims
can't drink alcohol, right?

I am Cleveland "Hurricane" Carter.

Well, Quagmire,
guess it's just you and me now.

Sorry, Peter, I'm in MS-13.

-What? How?
-It was easy.

-I said I was loco.
-Loco!

<i>-Si.</i>
<i>-Muy </i>loco.

Well, I can be loco.

I have a teardrop tattoo on my cheek.

Where? I don't see it.

Not-not that cheek.

Peter, that's an unwiped watermelon seed.

-Loco?
-No. No loco.

Hey, Peter, is that your baby over there?

(DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE)

We want fun. We want upbeat.
And for our dance,

we want "You Belong with Me"
by Taylor Swift.

Great, great.
I also have some more classic options,

-like "At Last."
-(CHUCKLES) Okay.

So... So, what I need
is someone I can work with.

Can you be that person?

There you guys are.
I haven't seen you all day.

Me and the Not Cops
were watching <i>Die Hard</i>

<i>and not commenting</i>

on the believability of the police work.

Could John McClane
really foil a giant heist

outside his jurisdiction,
then just walk away

and do zero paperwork?

We don't know or care,
'cause we're not cops.

And I got my law degree.

I am now Cleveland J. Roman J. Israel,

and I will be wearing wine-colored suits.

-You look crazy.
-Well, in his defense,

the movie was set in the '70s, wasn't it?

No, it's modern-day.

Oh, my stars.

All right, everyone, that's lanch.

I mean, lunch.
Sorry, it's my first day.

This sucks.
Everyone's eating lanch but me.

I'm never gonna find a gang.

Hey.
You look like you could use a friend.

Well, let's just say in prison,

this guy comes off.

I meant my gang.
We're looking for members.

-I bet you'd fit right in.
-Really?

You only have to do one thing first.

As the new white guy in prison,

you have to shiv the new black guy.

Oh, you guys are that kind of gang.

This is prison.

No one survives on their own.

So it's either him or you.

Man, I don't want to hurt Cleveland.

But I don't want to die.
And it would be nice

to have people to go
to Smash Mouth concerts with.

Wait, you guys go
to Smash Mouth concerts, right?

We're Nazis, Peter.
We like Smash Mouth.

Come on, there's got to be a way
you'll let me in the gang

without shivving Cleveland.

Ooh, ooh, I got an idea.
There was this prison movie,

and-and there was this guy
who wanted to win over

the other prisoners,
and you know what he did?

He ate seven eggs.
It was amazing.

So, you bring me seven

or some other reasonable amount of eggs...

Peter, I know it's 50 eggs.

Ah, you're a film buff.

Yeah. Before this,
I was in the USC directors program.

Well, if you can call it that.

You think you're learning about film,

but, really,
you're getting a degree in politics.

(SCOFFS)
I know, everything is so political.

<i>So </i>political.
Best advice I ever got:

whatever business you think you work in,

you really work in sales.

Because you're always selling yourself.

Yeah, wow, that is... That is good.

-You are smart.
-Well, I didn't say it.

-I'm just repeating it.
-Well, still,

you recognized its value.

That-That's not nothing.

Well, we're so happy you're all here.

We thought it might be fun

to kick things off
with a game of Heads Up!

-Daddy, do you want to start?
-No.

You just hold this up to your head,

and then we're gonna give you
clues to help you guess it.

I only like games with sticks.

Okay, ready?

Go.

(CHUCKLES) Okay. It's a show.

<i>Annie Get Your Gun.</i>

No, it's on TV.

Oh. <i>Poirot?</i>

What is that?
I've never heard of that.

Uh, it's a Belgian detective on PBS.

We just love it.

It's about seven castaways.
There's a professor

and a millionaire, and a movie star.

<i>-Poirot!</i>
-No.

We already said it's not <i>Poirot.</i>

It's about people
who took a three-hour tour.

No, it's not.
It's about a Belgian detective.

It's on PBS.

The title character
is played by Bob Denver.

-It's pronounced "David Suchet."
-Who's that?

-I'm gonna guess Poirot.
-It's not <i>Poirot!</i>

Damn it, just pass!

Okay, this is a movie...

<i>Roman J. Israel, Esq.</i>

ALL: Yay!

Come on, Peter, it's him or you.

And-and he's not so great.

Don't forget, he's the one who told you

all those <i>Schoolhouse Rock! </i>spoilers.

I had no idea that bill
would become a law.

-(SCREAMS)
-Sorry, Peter.

My gang said I wasn't really loco

unless I shivved someone,

and you're the one guy
without gang protection, so...

-(SCREAMS)
-Sorry, Quagmire.

As a Not Cop,
I have to shiv a guy in the Latin gang

and then blame it on Cleve...
(SCREAMS)

No one made me do this.

I'm just sick of your overt racism.

Guys, guys, stop.

Stop. Look at us.

We're shivving each other on Thanksgiving.

Oh, wait, no one shivved Cleveland.

(SCREAMS)

But what are we doing?

What are all of us doing?

Fighting in here amongst ourselves

while Brooks is out there
waiting for all of us,

bagging groceries,

adapting to this new world seamlessly...

(WHISPERS) Brooks hung himself.

Oh, my stars.

The point is, in life,

you need to be thankful for what you have.

I wasn't, and it got me in here.

I let down my family, especially my wife.

I just wish she was here
so I could tell her I'm sorry.

LOIS: I am here, Peter.

Not now, prison ladyboy
who talks like my wife

to please me sexually.

LOIS: No, Peter, we're here.

Lois! What are you doing here?

I thought you were having
Thanksgiving with your parents.

Chris got caught
watching cousin Katie pee,

so that kind of ended things.

Well, I wanted to get caught. That's...

It's part of it.

And the truth is, Peter,
we're not a family without you.

Can you ever forgive me?

Of course I can, Peter.

(IN LOIS' VOICE) Hi, Peter.

Who's your little friend?

Not now, Prison Lois.

So it's over?

And what was Venice?

Same thing it always was, babe:

a dream we both wanted to believe.

(CRYING)

Peter, who was that?

Not now, Front-Sex Lois.

The important thing is,
my days of selfishness

and red-wig twinks are over.

I'm ready to come home with you.

But, Peter, you're in here till next week.

MAN: Not anymore.

Hi, I'm the warden

and definitely not a psychotic prisoner

who just stabbed the warden
and stole his clothes.

Shh, shh!
Everyone, the warden's talking.

By the rules of prison and <i>The Love Boat,</i>

you've made up,

which means you get to leave
wiser and happier.

I love you, Lois.

I love you, Peter.

Hey, Lois, one day, let's go to Venice.

You promise?

I said it, didn't I?

-Donna!
-Bonnie!

Sex doll!

-Oh, yeah!
-(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

(CHUCKLES)
All right, guys, settle down.

Well, we're certainly glad
to have you home, Peter,

but I hope you learned your lesson.

I learned a hard lesson, Lois.

But it's not all bad.

I got to make a license plate for our car

that says "butthole."

Isn't that too many letters?

Excellent question, Chris, and yes, it is.

But I took off a "T" and the "E"
at the end.

I felt that was the right way to go.

Trust me, people will get it.

What's buthol?

PETER:
That's not how you say it.

Yeah, I've heard of buthol.
It's some kind of alternative fuel.

PETER:
You're ruining a smart joke.

-Hey, Mr. Quagmire.

Getting ready for the birth of Christ?

Which happened!

-Chris. Megan.
-(MEG BURPS)

-Gross.
-So, how did you like the show?

I didn't love it.

Hey, have you guys seen that mom

who wears a swimsuit for a bra?

She can't come to these.

Her ex-husband has

Boy, her stock just keeps going up.

So, Christmas, huh?

-You guys must be excited.
-(BURPS) Ugh, not at all.

It's always disappointing.

Allow me to introduce you
to my son, Woody.

-Hey, Woody.
-Hey.

He's gonna be a new character on the show.

You're barely a character on the show.

Meg, there's a lot
I have to get done here,

so I need you to take Stewie
to the mall to meet Santa.

-Okay. Sure.
-Great.

Now, why don't you go warm up
the car for your little brother?

Let's take the picture
for the Christmas card.

(CAMERA SNAPS)

I sent the wrong picture to Walgreens.

Oh, look, there's all the Jewish kids

sitting on the rabbi's lap,

where he asks them for something.

I want a new TV, and it can't be a Vizio.

Sony or Samsung only.

And I need it all set up
before I turn it on.

I don't want to have to do
any of the things!

Okay, little guy. You're up.

So, little boy, what would you
like for Christmas?

(BAWLING)

(BAWLING CONTINUES)

What's wrong, little boy?

Don't be scared of Santa.

Come on, Stewie. It's okay.

Just sit on Santa's lap.

Ugh. Some people push their kids
to do stuff way too soon.

Do you agree, Doctor Baby-Violin?

(MAN'S VOICE) I really do.

(PLAYS VOILIN)

(STEWIE YELLS)

Is it okay
if I just hold him for the picture?

Ho, ho, ho. Of course.

Sit right here, young lady.

Here you go, Stewie.
Santa's no one to be scared of.

He's kind and warm.
He loves unconditionally,

and... And he makes...

Everyone feel so... So...

Meg, what are you doing?

You look like Mom when she sits
on the washing machine.

Now, what would you like
for Christmas, little boy?

Shut up, everyone!
Shut up! Shut up!

Just shut up!

<i>O come, let us adore him </i>

<i>O come, let us adore him </i>

<i>O come, let us adore him... </i>

What, uh...
What just happened?

I'll have what she's having.

Okay.
She had six well-done hamburger patties

jammed into a hard taco shell.

Oh.
I just want to feel like that.

Okay. I mean, I can get it for you,
but it's a weird order.

The chef was not happy about it.

(BELLS JINGLING)

Are you ready for me, Meg?

(RACY MUSIC PLAYING)

(WIND WHISTLING)

-Are you ready to get up?
-Huh?

(IN LOIS' VOICE)
I said it's time to get up.

It's 2:00.

I've never seen you sleep so soundly.

What's going on?

Mom, I think I met someone.

Oh, Meg, that's amazing.

I want to know all about him.

What's his name?

Let's just call him "Beard Boy."

Oh! It's like I'm in <i>Sex with the City.</i>

It all happened so quick,
but I really feel something.

Am I crazy?

No. Trust your instincts.

You've got to chase this feeling.

Go find Beard Boy.

I will, Mom. I will!

(EXHALES)
What was going on in here?

The windows are steamed up

like when Subway's making the bread.

Hey. What's going on in here?

We're making the bread, sir.

Good.
Now get back to making sandwiches

with the shiniest turkey on earth!

Hey. Pass the milk.

I haven't slept in two days.

Is this still that Santa thing?
Get over it.

You didn't see the things I saw.

<i>O come </i>

<i>All ye faithful... </i>

I mean, Santa Claus
was bouncing us on his knee.

And it got a little faster,

then faster, and the more he bounced,

the bigger Meg's eyes got.

It was... It was...
Just look at the picture!

Wow. Okay.

Uh, Stewie, I think I know what happened.

I can't tell you explicitly,
since we're owned by Disney,

but let me just say that

Santa made her "Little Mermaid" "Moana."

-Oh.
-Exactly.

Brian, would you hand me
the Fat Man's fancy puking hat?

(RETCHING)

God, this hat is deep.

Now, there's my hat.
Kids, I'm off to the opera.

This opera stinks.

It was awful, Rupert.

And worst of all,
I didn't even get to ask Santa

for the Vitamix.

Blender? (CHUCKLES)
It's more than a blender.

MEG: Stewie. I'm gonna take you back
to the mall to sit on Santa's lap.

Oh, my God, I've got to hide!

How did she find me?
That's my best hiding spot. No!

Oh, and by the way, Rupert,
after what I saw,

I know you've been faking it
this whole time.

Meg, please don't.

Listen, I've got seven dollars
in my piggy bank.

It's yours. No?

All right, uh, I'll kill Chris.

You want me to kill Chris?

Who do you want me to kill?
Chris? No? Okay. I got it.

Next road show, Stewie and Meg. Promise.

(SINGING) <i>We're off on the road to Ohio</i>

High in the middle
and round at both ends!

Meg, I love our road show.

-Next.
-No!

Huh. Something's different.

Hey, uh, Meg?
Uh, can you cut that out?

-Dad?
-Please don't tell your mother about this.

I took an extra job.

I don't make much money,
and Christmas is very expensive.

(EXHALES) Dad?
I'm gonna ask you one question,

and how you answer it will
determine the rest of my life.

Were you the Santa at this mall yesterday?

-No.
-Oh, thank God.

Now, Meg, I got a question for you:

Is there really a weight limit
for the escalator,

or did I just meet some mean kids?

Hey, Peter, let's keep it moving.

Some stockbrokers are gonna
throw me into a gong later.

Excuse me.
Do you remember the Santa from yesterday?

Lady, I've been thrown
headfirst into so many gongs,

I don't remember my own name.

I think he was just a temp.
I'd try the Warwick Mall.

Thanks.
Stewie, come on.

We're going to the Warwick Mall.

Stewie?

Chocolate sample.

Again.

Just leave the carton.

-Santa's the best.
-I'm gonna ask for a bike.

I'm also enthusiastic about Santa.

All hail the great Santa Claus.

-Yeah. This guy gets it.
-(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Wait a minute.
That noise seems negative.

Santa's a good guy 'cause he keeps a list?

You know who else kept a list?
Hitler.

My uncle who moved to the Idaho wilderness

says Hitler was a great man.

There you are.
Come on.

We've got to visit Santa at another mall.

I can't go back to Santa, man!
I can't!

-Hello again.
-Hi.

That's the guy that was peeing
in the women's bathroom.

Stewie, when this is over,
I'm buying you a new toy.

Meg, when this is over,
I'm putting rocks in my pockets

and walking into the mall fountain.

How much longer is this gonna take?

I don't know. 400 minutes?

One reason I work as a seasonal elf

is I'm not great at time estimates.

-MALL SANTA: Next.
-See? 400 minutes.

Even a broken clock is right
six times a day.

He's very scared,
so I have to sit here with him.

Would you mind bouncing me a little?

Um, okay. I guess I can do that.

Hey, come on, a little harder than that.

-Look, I don't feel comf...
-Please! It's Christmas. Please!

What does...
What does that have to do with...

Just do it!

(CRYING, SINGING)
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider </i>

Wait, wait, this isn't working.

Were you at the Quahog Mall last night?

No. L-Last night, I was weeping
outside my ex-wife's apartment.

I drank too much
and went over to yell at her.

Yeah, he's not your guy, Meg.

They said my Santa would be here,
and you're not him.

I'm sorry. Story of my life.

I live to disappoint women, apparently.

Well, where is he?
Where's my Santa?

-I don't know!
-I need to find him.

He made me a woman!

Where is he?

(GASPING)

He's a phony!

A great, big phony!

Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm gonna give you just 600 minutes

-to get out of here.
-But you don't understand.

One, two, 600 minutes.

That's it. Security!

What took you so long?

Let me go.

Lady, by the power vested in me
by Paul Blart,

you are now banned from this mall

and every mall in this county.

(GRUNTING) Wait.
I need my little brother.

Stewie!

Time to sleep in heavenly peace.

(GROANS)

Wow, looks like that baby is all wet.

(LAUGHING)

Classic Woody.

(LAUGHS) This is Woody.

So, you want to tell me
why you were assaulting Santa

in front of the whole mall?

What about Beard Boy?

Santa <i>is </i>Beard Boy.

You're in love with Santa?

Maybe.

He gave me my first... You know.

He just bounced me on his lap,
and the next thing you know,

-I saw Jimmy Connors.
-You saw Jimmy Connors.

It happens to every girl their first time.

You'll never see him again, by the way.

I won't? Why not?

I don't know.
That's God's trick on women.

It's your first time,
followed by a lifetime

of diminishing returns.

(SQUEAKING)

I wonder what I'll see on my first time.

I can't let Stewie grow up
scared of Santa Claus.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(DEEP VOICE) Ho, ho, ho.

Santa? Is that really you?

-Sure is.
-Well, how'd you get in?

-Through the window.
-It was just unlocked?

Like, anybody can just come
through my window at any time?

-I really don't like...
-Forget about that.

I know you're having a tough time.

I just wanted to tell you
that everything is fine.

Meg is entering probably
the most horny part of her life.

This could just as easily have happened

while she was riding a horse or something.

I'm just sorry you had to see it.

Okay. Don't want people
just coming in whenever.

Stewie, that Christmas magic
you think you lost...

it can't just disappear.

I'm still the same guy
you've always loved.

Thanks, Santa. I feel better.

Just try to have a good Christmas.

Uh, speaking of that, I want a new dog.

What's wrong with the dog you have?

Eh, he's okay.
I just... I just want a new one.

Maybe you can spend more time
with the old one

-before you make any decisions.
-Nah. Want a new one.

Thanks, Santa.
Can you leave from the door?

I'm kind of freaking
over the window thing.

Sure.

CHRIS: Oh, my God. Santa?

-I want a new dog.
-BRIAN: Oh, come on!

There you are.

I had a hell of a time finding your room.

Can I come in?

-Cigarette?
-No.

Mind if I have one?

So, you want to talk about
this whole Santa's lap thing?

Dad, this stuff...

I think it's gonna
be hard for you to hear.

Oh, don't worry, Meg.
I brought this handkerchief

to dab my forehead whenever
you say something sexual.

-So, I'm sitting on Santa's lap...
-Oh, dear.

...and it's like my whole body
starts to tingle...

-Oh, my stars.
-...and-and then there's...

-I better loudly drop an Alka-Seltzer...
-...like, a deep rumble within me, and...

-...in this glass of water.
-...I look down at his wrinkly red pants,

-but all the wrinkles...
-Very loud fizzing.

...are smoothing out

-like my body is ironing his wrinkles.
-I may need to widen my eyes

until they look like a young girl's
Snapchat filter.

-Like, sort of a-a warm steam iron?
-Okay. Okay, Meg.

Look, this Santa person
clearly made you very happy.

And I want my daughter to be happy.

Go find your mall Santa, wherever he is.

I love you, Dad.

And thanks for the pep talk.

Hey, I learned from the best.

You know, I played football
for Coach Joe Paterno at Penn State.

All right, team, remember everything
you learned in practice this week

No, that's not what I'm here for.

Yes, it is. Now, sit down.

Meg, no. Meg, no. Get off.

Geez, I'm trying to give you
a heartwarming message

of Christmas joy.

You know, the same feeling
you got when you were five

and I gave you that Malibu Barbie?

How did you know that?

I told you. I'm the real Santa.

I try to visit every mall
at least once during Christmas.

Except Long Island malls.

Those people are a little much.

Oh, no.

I can't believe I, you know,
grew up all over you.

It's okay, Meg. You see, I know

what each and every person
needs for Christmas.

For you, it was your first time
seeing Jimmy Connors.

But the truth is,
it had nothing to do with me.

The Christmas magic lives in there.

And as long as you believe,
it'll always be with you.

Deep inside.

-Inside my...
-Wherever you find it, yes.

Thanks, Santa.

You're welcome, Meg.

Well, I'm off to distribute presents

to boys and girls all over the world.

All right, I'm gonna
put my leg up on this back tire

and take a she-wee.

You know, you don't have to say
everything out loud, Meg.

Wait, are you sure
you're the real Santa Claus?

Yes, I'm the real Santa Claus.

I'm totally real,
so don't tell anyone about this

and don't say anything to anyone.

I'm tennis bad boy Jimmy Connors.

How did you get in here?

I came in through your baby's window.

You can just open it.

STEWIE:
Men are now just coming in at will!

I heard you had
a pretty confusing Christmas.

Yeah, it's tough being a teenager,

dealing with all these
new emotions and feelings

and streaming platforms.

I remember when I was your age,
I was confused, too.

Then I got a haircut
that I'd keep for 50 years.

You've just got to find
your one thing that works.

You mean a haircut like this?

Meg, I think you're gonna be just fine.

But just in case, here.
I want you to have these.

-Your balls?
-That's right.

Whenever you need me,

just rub my balls, and I'll come.

Lot of open windows in this school.

You need a real music teacher.

I'm a trained piano player,
and I've taught lessons for years.

I'd love to come work for you.

You would?
Well, that changes everything.

I'm not gonna have sex with you.

I know. I just farted.

So, everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

I'm gonna be the new
music teacher at Adam West High.

-What?
-Please say you're joking.

I'm not joking. I start Monday.

My wife, a music teacher?

Hold on.
That's a marriage time-out.

I... I think Dad did this wrong.

Yeah, aren't... Aren't <i>we </i>supposed
to be the frozen ones?

-Dad's a loser.
-Yeah, he sucks.

-Stop it.
-Why? He can't hear us.

PETER:
<i>But I could hear them.</i>

<i>And it hurt.</i>

<i>Turns out, if you're gonna learn</i>

<i>how to stop time in wizard school,</i>

<i>don't leave class early to be</i>
<i>the first in line for lunch.</i>

<i>It was pizza day.</i>

<i>And you'd think it's got</i>
<i>to be pretty good pizza,</i>

<i>being made by a magic wand and whatnot.</i>

<i>But it was just okay.</i>

<i>I don't think it was the usual</i>
<i>guy making it.</i>

<i>This has been</i>
<i>a Peter Griffin Marriage Time-Out.</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CHATTER STOPS)

Good morning, class.

So... You know.
(CHUCKLES)

I'm your new music teacher, Mrs. Griffin,

and I started from the bottom.
Now I'm here.

So... Rap.

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, my God, you're so lame.

I know you are, but what am I?

Lame.

Okay, we'll call that one a tie.

Now, class, what is music to you?

BOY:
Nothing.

Okay, Deaf Larry, we know

music is nothing to you and never will be.

Who else?
What is music to you?

Stupid.

Connie, you're just afraid,
so you lash out.

I get you, because I was you.

Headstrong, full of anger,
and a body that looked

like it stepped
right out of <i>Redbook </i>magazine.

-GIRL: Is that good?
-Yes, that's good.

You don't know. Shut up.

You were never me.

Oh, no? Look down at your desk.

"L.G."?

Lois... Griffin.

But-but weren't you
Lois Pewterschmidt back then?

Meg, go to the principal's office.

My desk also has "L.G." on it.

-Mine, too.
-They all do!

Okay, okay, I didn't know where
the troublemaker was gonna sit.

Mr. Mason may have been a bird,
but at least he wasn't a liar.

Well, you better get used to <i>me,</i>
'cause Mr. Mason's gone.

Sweetie, it's the middle of the day.
What happened?

-(WHISTLES TWO NOTES)
-Oh, no.

Well, I hope this doesn't affect
our plan to have eggs.

(WHISTLES SAME NOTES)

You wanted this to happen!

So, Lois, how was
your first big day teaching?

You pull a Mary Kay Letourneau?

(LAUGHS)

No, Peter.

I didn't leave my family

to have sex with a 12-year-old
boy named Vili Fualaau,

get arrested for rape,
give birth to his child in prison,

get out, get arrested again
for humping him in a car

when he was 13,
have his second kid in jail,

get out, get married to him,

change my name
to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau,

live my life as a disgraced sex offender,

and then get dumped by him.

(LAUGHING)
No, I didn't do that.

But I did have a little trouble
in Meg's class

because of that brat Connie D'Amico.

She's a classic, entitled, mean-girl slut.

Connie D'Amico?
She stopped by to see you yesterday.

She did? What'd she say?

-She said you're gullible.
-And?

Hmm, Connie D'Amico.

The name sounds familiar.

I better go check Meg's yearbook...

Pages four, six, 11, 27, 41, 42 and 60...

To see if it's the babe I'm thinking of.

Lois, I'll take my dessert upstairs

in the masturbation bathroom.

(SIGHS)
Maybe I'm not cut out

to teach high school kids.

I thought I could handle their nonsense,

but I just kind of froze today
with Connie.

-Yeah, hang it up.
-You gave it a day.

That's nonsense, Lois.

You just have to be
more of an authority figure.

If Connie gets out of line again,

don't be afraid to show her who's boss.

Like I did with those squirrels.

-(SQUIRRELS CHITTERING)
-Hey, neighborinos.

Um, so, not a huge deal,

but if you guys could keep
your chittering down,

I'm trying to get
some writing done in the house.

Oh, yeah, yeah, no... No problem, bro.

Also, maybe you could go (BLEEP)
your own face, huh?

Could that be good?

-(LAUGHTER)
-Yeah!

(CHUCKLES)

(CHUCKLING)
Oh. Okay.

All right, thanks, guys.

Stewie? What are you doing here?

I followed you into your cutaway

because I didn't believe
you showed anyone who's boss.

And I was right.

Did you get a sleeve tattoo
of Freddie Mercury?

Yeah, it's a cutaway.

(PLAYING LIGHT CHORD PROGRESSIONS)

I know some of you kids
think this class has nothing to do

with your day-to-day lives,
but you couldn't be more wrong.

Music tells the story of our lives.

For example, this morning,

I woke up and saw it was a sunny day.

(PLAYS GRIEG'S<i> MORNING MOOD)</i>

Then I had some tea.

(PLAYS <i>EAST ASIAN RIFF)</i>

Which was from China.

On my way out the door,
the kitty cat ran across my piano.

(PLAYS DISSONANT, DESCENDING NOTES)

Get off of there, kitty cat!

(LAUGHS)

Then I drove to work.

(PLAYS RAPID, UPBEAT MELODY)

But then, I hit some traffic...

(PLAYS OMINOUS STING)

...that was caused by a parade.

(PLAYS SOUSA'S
<i>THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER)</i>

For gay rights.

(PLAYS <i>THE STARS AND STRIPES</i>
<i>FOREVER</i> IN HIGH OCTAVE)

And finally, I got to school early

and diarrhea'd in the girls' locker room.

(PLAYS SUSTAINED LOW NOTE)

The end.

You suck!

Aah!

(LAUGHTER)

That's it, Connie!

To the principal's office. Now!

Okay. For the rest of the class,
I will wait for the bell.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

And then I will suddenly talk
much louder and faster

as you're heading out the door.

Okay, and remember,
there's a quiz a week from Wednesday!

-(STUDENTS GASPING)
-BOY: Oh, no.

Good. That means you heard me.

This is how Hollywood
thinks school teachers talk.

Connie, I've asked Mrs. Griffin to be here

since it was her class you disrupted.

And I'm sorry to say,
this is your third strike this year.

According to school policy,

three strikes means you're expelled.

What?

Principal Shepherd,
I'm not sure that's necessary.

I'm sorry.
I've made my decision.

Now, if you ladies
don't mind stepping out,

I have to reprimand Danny McBride next.

Mr. McBride, do you know why you're here?

Yeah, maybe because I'm awesome,
and you're a gay homosexual,

and also the word "Jet Ski" a lot?

(GRUNTING)

(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, you know why you're here.

Ugh. I feel kind of bad
about getting Connie expelled.

But maybe this'll make her realize

she needs to be more respectful to others.

Eh, probably not.
She's really hot.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

Hey, Lois, I just got an invite

for a Facebook group you started called

"Keep Harriet Tubman
Off the 20-Dollar Bill."

What?
I haven't even been on Facebook today.

Wow. Your profile pic
is now just the word "veterans"

with a circle and a line through it.

I mean, that's the way I feel
about ghosts, but veterans?

Mom, this is Connie getting back at you.

It's called "cyberbullying."

(SCOFFS)
Cyberbullying? Me?

By the way, Vili Fualaau
is now a DJ in Seattle.

Boy, Connie must really mean business.

Like an Armenian kid in a candy store.

Hey, little boy, can I help you?

Yes, I wish to buy business

and turn into car wash.

(CHILDREN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

(WOMEN CHUCKLE)

We had no idea you'd switched teams, Lois.

Ugh. Damn it, Connie.

No, it's just a nasty prank.

What's so nasty about it?

(CHUCKLES)
I mean, nothing.

I... I'm fine with it.

Okay, well, if you're so fine with it,

what are you doing Friday night?

Oh, um...

Mmm.
So, I got my blacksmith certification.

-I can make axes now.
-Oh.

You in the market for an ax?

I'll keep this on the D.L. Hughley,

but your next date should be with Christ.

Lois, are you using the Elmo toothbrush,

-which is mine?
-Oh, sorry, Peter.

I've just been so distracted
with this whole Connie thing.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

So, Connie made you mistake
a monster's face

for the words "Oral-B."

Come on, Peter, I'm serious.

This is a real problem.

Well, if she's really ruining your life,

go down to the station and talk to Joe.

Yeah, I thought of that,
but I hate competing

with the sound of ringing phones
and typewriter keys.

-(PHONES RINGING, KEYS CLACKING)
-And she hacked

-all my Internet accounts.
-What?

Connie!
I think she hacked my Twitter!

Well, without any hard evidence, Lois,

I'm afraid there's nothing we can do!

Fine!
I knew this would be a waste of time!

Okay, fellas, she's gone!

(RINGING AND CLACKING STOP)

I'd like to report somebody
using the wrong toothbrush.

Have a seat, sir.
Tell me everything.

Okay. You know Elmo, right?

Hmm, I'm not seeing
any Viva brand paper towels.

-That's the only brand I use.
-Uh, sounds good.

I'm gonna go see what new stuff
they're turning into milk.

Oh, wood milk!

Hey, that woman has
all the Viva brand paper towels.

E... Excuse me, miss,

could I have one of those
Viva brand paper towel rolls?

-(GASPS)
-Oh, so sorry.

I need them all for the big mess
you've made.

Hey, Lois, do we need
any jeans milk at home?

Oh, hey, Connie.
Nice shopping outfit.

Come on, Connie.

It's the only brand I use.

I need it to pat down bacon
and let Meg suck the wad.

Too bad, bitch.

(SCANNER BEEPS)

-(BEEPS)
-There we go.

I know it's been you cyberbullying me.

I didn't mean to get you expelled,

but now I'm glad I did.

You're a very disrespectful young lady.

At least I'll have a paper towel

with the power to take on any spill.

Okay, that's it.

You'll pay for this, Connie!

You better watch your step.

(GASPING AND MURMURING)

Ah, darn it.
I couldn't open my camera in time.

Oh, you can just text me yours.

I'm not texting you.
I don't know you.

Peter, I'm exhausted.

I can't even think of making dinner.

Well, I didn't hear what you just said,

but what's the dinner situation?

<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,</i>
<i>transitioning into my sad voice</i>

<i>for the death of a white girl.</i>

<i>Local white girl Connie D'Amico</i>
<i>died at the scene</i>

<i>of an automobile accident earlier tonight,</i>

<i>the brake lines of Connie's Celica</i>
<i>apparently cut.</i>

Oh, my God. How horrible!

(EXHALES)
Can you imagine being the shovel

that gets to scrape that ass off the road?

Eh, maybe in my next life.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Lois Griffin, I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

On what charge?

We've got you on grocery store video

threatening Connie D'Amico.

You're under arrest for her murder.

What?

Guys, my mom was arrested
for Connie's murder.

No quiz!

(ALL CHEERING)

Joe, this is ridiculous.

There's no way Lois killed Connie.

There's just too much evidence
against her.

I got to take her in.

So, what, I'm supposed to be
a guy without a wife now?

What am I supposed to do,
whatever I want whenever I want?

I'm gonna get crow's-feet
from smiling too much.

Sorry, Peter.
It's gonna be quite an adjustment.

Seriously, who's gonna greet me
in a shapeless sweatshirt

-when I come home?
-Meg, maybe.

Who's gonna slap a tarantula
of shampoo hair

on the wall of the shower?

It's the little things you miss.

Who's gonna go, "Ooh! Ooh!
Careful!" while I'm parking?

Sometimes this
is the hardest part of my job.

Who's gonna fill up my DVR
with lady judge programs?

I... I don't make the rules.

Oh, and I suppose now I'll have
to start every road trip

-with a full tank of gas?
-I took an oath, Peter.

What am I supposed to do?
Masturbate comfortably in bed?

The law's the law.

And I guess I'm gonna have to be
on time to every party

-and stay real late?
-Yeah, why do they do that?

And so long, <i>Handmaid's Tale, </i>I guess.

Two or three more jokes, Peter.

So long, <i>This Is Us.</i>

Last one, maybe.

So long, seeing my dining room.

You got a stronger one to end on?

So long, bitchy 2:00 a.m. blanket pulls.

Ah, there we go.

(BLEEP), Peter.

What am I supposed to do now, Brian?

Whatever I want whenever I want?

Yeah, I was right here
when you were doing that.

Oh.
I... I didn't hear your laugh.

I'm more of a smile guy.

Peter, we have got to prove
Lois is innocent.

That's right.
And the best way to crack

any high-profile crime case

is to do a podcast
before you have all the facts.

-Okay.
-And the key to any podcast

is poor sound quality
and tons of commercials.

All right, we've got Lois
calling in from prison.

She's only got three minutes.

LOIS: (STATICKY)
<i>Thanks for looking at my case, guys.</i>

You bet, Lois.
My first question is...

Do you get a good night's sleep?

<i>No, 'cause I'm in prison,</i>
<i>and my cellmate is bipolar.</i>

Well, if you get a Casper mattress now,

you have a hundred days to decide

if it's the right mattress for you.

<i>Peter, I don't have time for this.</i>

I don't have time for underwear
that bunches up.

That's why I wear MeUndies.
Perfect underwear

for hanging yourself in your jail cell.

<i>Can we talk about the case?</i>
<i>I have 30 seconds</i>

<i>before they haul me off</i>
<i>to the freaking cafeteria.</i>

Sounds like you could use Blue Apron.

Have you ever wanted to receive
a vegetable in the mail?

Then you need Blue Apron.

I'm, like, obsessed with the stir-fry.

Brian here likes the Moroccan beef.

I... I have no opinion
on the Moroccan beef, Peter.

Brian, this is not art.
This is commerce.

<i>Peter, before I go, I need a new lawyer.</i>

<i>This one made a sexual pass at me.</i>

Oh, boy.
Everyone knows hiring is a nightmare.

At least it was before ZipRecruiter.

ZipRecruiter: we vastly overestimate

how many podcast listeners
are in a position to hire someone.

Okay, Brian,
let's go through Lois's drawers

and look for clues.
If you find any, let me know.

And if you find the yo-yo
she took from me,

definitely let me know.

Stupid Lois.

I'm not gonna use it in the house.

The Wendy's employee gave it to me

if I promised to calm down.

Peter, this is a dead end.

All I see here is your Nerf gun
from last summer.

Oh, no way.
She said I lost that.

She deserves to be in jail.

PETER:
Hey!

Suck on that, Lois!

That was very close to my eyes, Peter.

PETER: It wasn't close to your eye.

-That's why I took it.
-It was so far from your eye.

What are we doing here?

Connie never went to the Drunken Clam.

Doesn't matter.
Everybody knows the way you solve a murder

is to ask a barkeep if he knows anything.

When he says no, you turn around,

and then he says "wait"
and gives you an important clue.

Hey, Jerome, do you know
anything about Connie's death?

No, man.
I've just been working here.

All right, Brian.
Let's get out of here.

-Peter, wait.
-Yes?

One of the waitresses says
you put her tip down her pants.

Huh. How long were you planning
to sit on that little nugget?

You just did it.

Okay, Jerome.
If you remember anything else,

here's my number.

Oh, and here's a nickel
for the watered-down beer.

Keep the change.

How are we gonna solve this case, Peter?

I've been thinking about that.

You're a dog, and I'm a man. Right?

So we're basically <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

-So, what are you saying?
-We go around town

and rip off faces
until we find the real killer.

Unless...

(SCREAMS)

Which can only mean...

(SCREAMS)

Twins? Guess again.

(BOTH SCREAM)

The newspaper is embarrassing me.

Well, kids, we tried.

I'm afraid your mother's a murderer.

No, Peter, I'm right here.

Lois, you escaped!

Careful, kids.
She killed before.

-She'll kill again.
-JOE: No, Peter, look wider.

We're all here.

Turns out Lois didn't kill anyone.

Connie D'Amico faked her own death.

-(ALL GASP)
-Gasp!

We found Connie an hour ago
at a motel outside of town.

Turns out she put a pig in a blonde wig

behind the wheel of her car.

I'm sorry, our coroner
has been pretty sloppy lately.

She's been dealing
with some substance abuse.

"She"?
Interesting.

Anyway, Lois has been cleared
of all charges.

And what of the pig?

That was a very tough house call.

-Yes?
-Excuse me, folks.

Do you have a daughter named Peppa?

Yes.

You're gonna want to sit down.

Well, Lois, I got to say,

it's great to have you home from prison.

Ah, it's great to be home.

Hey, I... I got to ask,

are... Are you gonna
stay that jacked forever?

I don't know.
Do you like it?

I... I... I do and I don't, you know?

It... It was... It was nice
being held up against a wall,

but when you made me suck
the hairdryer, I... I...

I enjoyed it, I did,

but I... I don't want to do
that specific thing again.

Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm ready for round two.

Just got to make sure
the kids don't come in.

-(WHIMPERS)
-Now no one can get in,

and no one can get out.

Hands on the headboard, chief.

Yes, ma'am.

which by the way, is getting its ass
kicked by the CVS across the street.

Welcome, Brian.

So, what does it feel like to be a hero?

Well, let me say that
even though I am a hero,

you don't have to call me one.

I'm very comfortable
with "first responder"

or, if you like, "veteran."

So brave.

How has this incident changed your life?

It hasn't. I'm still the same
humble public servant I've always been.

But there are perks.

This morning,
I was honored by a local business.

(CROWD CHEERS)

Thank you, Brian.

And to show our appreciation,

you get the first meal at Quahog's
newest Sizzler location!

Oh. No.

(CHUCKLES)
No, no, no, no, no, no.

-No.
-That's fair.

Can you at least read what's on this card?

Sure.

"Sizzler: the worst version
of your favorite meal."

So, what's next for you, Brian?

Well, I'll be at Barnes & Noble
this afternoon

signing copies of Deepak Chopra's
<i>Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.</i>

Well, congratulations, Brian,
and thank you for your service.

Coming up, I get all anxious and weird

when the new good-looking intern
brings me my coffee.

And here's Jeremy with my go-go juice.

Ha-ha.

-(PHONE DINGS)
-Man, my phone's been

blowing up since that interview.

You should hear some of my voice mails.

MAN:
<i>Hello, Brian.</i>

<i>This is Barack Obama,</i>
<i>not the hobo who lives at the wharf.</i>

<i>Um, you did a good job and...</i>

<i>I... I can't read that.</i>

BRIAN:
<i>"I'm proud of you."</i>

MAN:
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

<i>Thanks for the two dollars.</i>

(GASPS)
No way!

Let's hear the next message.

MAN 2:
<i>Hey, Brian, it's, uh...</i>

<i>Well, it's Shredder.</i>

<i>Remember me?</i>

<i>I know it's been a while,</i>
<i>but I saw you on TV</i>

<i>and I'm just hoping we could get together.</i>

<i>I'd love to catch up.</i>

<i>So, uh, uh, call me back.</i>

-Oh, my God!
-"Shredder"?

He sounds like a ski instructor
with a full beard

who plays average guitar
and never texts me back.

He's a dog I used to run with
back when I was living on the street.

Haven't heard from him in years.

I'm actually surprised he's still alive.

He just drank all the time
and tried to get laid.

Hard to be friends with someone like that.

Yes, it is.

-You gonna see him?
-(PHONE DINGS)

If I have time.

Wow, The Rock!

Boy, they're coming out
of the woodwork today.

You're angling your phone
so I can't see it.

"Dwayne Johnson."

Only his friends know
that's his real name.

-Still can't see it.
-I'll call him back later.

Ow!

Excuse me, sir,
but this is a private residence.

Peter, it's me.

I got my hair cut. Isn't it fun?

What?
No, Lois, it's not fun.

You look like Anne Hathaway
in <i>Les Misera...</i>

Don't you ever compare me
to (BLEEP) Anne Hathaway.

-Ever!
-You're right, you're right.

I'm... I'm sorry.

With my boobs and your hair,

everybody's gonna think
we're a lesbian couple.

Why'd he want to meet in the park?

We used to live here.
I'm assuming he still does.

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

Brian, ha!

So good to see you.

Wha... Shredder?

Is it really you?

It's really me.

I... I don't... What is all this?

(CHUCKLES) Yeah, sorry about
meeting in the park.

It's the only place I can land this thing.

Uh, Shredder, I think you pinned
Tom Cruise under your helicopter.

I was hanging on. I do all my own stunts.

I can't stop doing stunts.

My whole life is a stunt.

Yeah, yeah, we know.

(GRUNTING)

Hey, you want to take a personality test?

Same answer as always:
no, thank you.

I'm not gonna stop asking.

-I know.
-Good to see you, Stewie.

Good to see you, Tiny Tom Cruise.

-Thank you.
-He likes to have the last word.

TOM CRUISE: Be well!

-See?
-Bye!

Shredder, I... I can't get
my head around all this.

Eh, it took me a while, too, believe me.

And I go by George Townshend now.

Oh, okay, George.

George Townshend.

-You... You want me to say both?
-I do.

You know how Beyoncé
does the one-name thing?

I do a two-name thing.
It's one more than Beyoncé.

Why don't you take her name
out of your filthy whore mouth.

Wow! How'd you get all this?

I worked my ass off.

I'm a tech entrepreneur,
I've written 11 best-selling books,

and I was the NBC executive who suggested

we assault the nation
with Chicago-themed programming.

I hear they're working on
<i>Chicago Seinfeld.</i>

What's the deal with the South Side
of this town?

Don't say it, Kramer.

(FUNKY BASS RIFF PLAYING)

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

So, Brian, do you want to know
how I did all this?

I really do.

I got neutered.

(INHALES SHARPLY THROUGH TEETH)

But why?

Getting neutered eliminated
all distractions

and allowed me to focus solely on my work.

Sometimes you have to literally
cut out the things that hold you back.

Man, with no distractions,

I could just spend all day
in here reading.

I love that book <i>Charles Dickens</i>
by David Copperfield.

Writing was his real magic.

I just don't understand.

One minute, I got a hot ginger wife,
and the next I'm married to Ron Weasley.

Donna wears a wig,
so I've never even seen her real hair.

But I would imagine it looks like an old,
faded sweater

that needs to be de-pilled.

I haven't touched Bonnie's hair in years.

It's way high up there.

Well, since Lois did something
to her appearance that you don't like,

you should do something to
your appearance that she doesn't like.

Quagmire, that is pathetically shallow
and vindictive.

I love it!

I'm gonna make myself harder to ignore
than an amateur photographer.

Okay, this is hilarious.

So I'm sitting in my office at work
when the fire alarm goes off...

(SHUTTER CLICKS)

Um, what... What, what was I saying?

Fire alarm.

Right, right, right, okay.
This is so funny.

So, the fire alarm goes off...

(SHUTTER CLICKS)

Hey, hey, friend?

Friend? Friend?

Can... Can you just...
N... Not... Not right now?

Now, where was I?

-Fire alarm at work.
-Oh, right.

You know what? Just forget it.

The punch line is it was 9/11.

Well, yeah, it's not funny now.

Scoot over, Stewie.

George Townshend was wrong,
and I'm gonna prove it.

I don't need to get neutered
to be productive.

I'm gonna write an inspirational book
about my life, and I'm calling it

<i>The Holy Bri-ble.</i>

-Please don't.
-Here we go, blank page.

-(KNUCKLES CRACK)
-World of possibilities.

And you're watching porn.

Oh, my God!

Two clicks and I instinctually
went right to porn.

Maybe George Townshend was right.

Maybe I am easily distracted.

Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

It's okay to be easily distracted.

That's what's saved Warren Beatty
and Annette Bening's marriage.

Annette, let's have sex.

Or you could watch <i>Blue Bloods</i>
and have a pudding cup.

Hmm?

Mmm. Go get 'em, <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

Good evening, Lois.

Oh, my God, Peter,
what the hell are you wearing?

Jeans.

Just jeans. You like it?

No. You look like you're going
to a custody hearing in Florida.

Oh, really?

Because I think it's a "fun" look.

Just like your hair.

Okay, I see what you're doing.

Good. So we agree
that your haircut is stupid.

What? No. I love my haircut.

Then I love this look.

As a matter of fact, I'm gonna add
this free Fandango golf visor I got

when I snuck in to see <i>I Feel Pretty.</i>

(GROANS)
Fine.

You want a war, Peter? Let's go to war.

Let's do it.

Tesla, Apple, SpaceX,

Kendrick Lamar,
drone technology, Hemingway.

Wow. That was the coolest phone call
I've ever heard.

My life is pretty cool.

Brian, walk with me.

You know, I wish I could spend
more time with you today,

but I'm late for a video conference with

(SPANISH ACCENT)
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.

Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

I was thinking about
what you said the other day, and...

-I think you might be right.
-About what?

I've always believed I was destined
for a life like yours,

but something was holding me back,

and now I realize it was two things.

-My balls are the things...
-No, I got it.

George Townshend, I want to get neutered.

I'm proud of you, buddy.

It's gonna be great.

I'll finally be able to beat that guy
who fights dirty in my karate class.

Surprise.

Now take this.

Hiy...

(EXCLAIMING)
You can't use a sword!

Sensei Dan, he's using a sword!

No swords, guys.

Brian, are you sure
about getting neutered?

I am. You've seen everything
George Townshend's accomplished.

That's the life I've always dreamed of.

Yes, but how much
do you really know about him?

-Have you read his books?
-Of course I've read his books.

They changed my life.

Look, Stewie, this is a huge step for me,
and if you can't support me,

well, then maybe I should cut you
out of my life, too.

Brian, that's a closet.

I know. I have stuff to do in here.

(DOOR CREAKS)

(DOOR CREAKS)

Well, nothing left to do but binge-watch
Ken Burns' <i>History of Jazz.</i>

BRIAN: What?

-(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>But how did we get there?</i>

(BRIAN GROANS)

(BUSY CHATTER)

Lois, what are you doing here?

Did someone die?
Do I get to go home early?

Well, Peter, since you were
having that jeans fun,

I thought it might be fun
to come by and sell

some of my homemade jewelry
to your coworkers during lunch.

What? Lois, you can't do that.

Once a guy's wife sells something
in the break room,

no one ever looks at him the same.

Two years ago,
Bentley's wife made him hang

a sign-up sheet
to sponsor her in an AIDS walk,

and we've hated him ever since.

Don't look at me, Bentley.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

Well, Peter, all you have to do is say
you like my haircut, and I'll leave.

-Never.
-Suit yourself.

Everyone, I'm Peter Griffin's wife.

I took a jewelry-making class last month
with a group of preschool moms,

and now I'm gonna do it as a career.

Hey, you want a half of my sandwich?

Oh. Yeah. Very cool, Bentley.

-Who made this?
-My wife.

-Oh, y... Your wife with AIDS?
-She doesn't have AIDS.

She did a walk for people with AIDS.

But presumably there were people
who had AIDS at the walk?

Yeah, but you can't get...

Yeah, it's a no on the sandwich, Bentley.

Greetings, Lois.

Oh, my God, Peter,
you're gonna make me vomit.

I'm just getting in some 'cize.

That's what I call exercise now: 'Cize.

(RETCHES)

Oh, God, Peter, please put that thing
in the garage and change your clothes.

Oh, I'd be happy to, Lois.

But I'm not doing it because you said.

I'm doing it
because of the mean seventh graders

who have been chucking footballs at me
all day.

BOY:
There he is! Let's get that fat dork!

I'm home! Home is safe!

(GRUNTS)
Home is safe!

I see you found all of
George Townshend's books.

That was fast.

Yep, got my own system.

I call it "The Stewie Decimal System."

(LAUGHS)

Oh, Stewie, you're gonna make me
spit out my saltwater taffy.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God!

Brian's in trouble!

Stewie, I've got to have you around here
more often.

Oh, I think you'll find me here...
Periodically.

There's homeless sperm on this.

-Where are the glasses?
-I moved them.

What? Why?

I moved everything.

All the glasses, the bowls, the plates.

Nothing is where it's been
for the past 17 years.

Nothing.

I'm gonna become a deejay.

I'm going to hire a life coach.

I'm gonna make one political donation

with your e-mail address
so you'll be screwed for life.

I'm going to rededicate my life to Christ.

Oh, that's really bad.

I'm gonna start a podcast
that has no focus

and it'll take up
an inordinate amount of time.

I'm going to constantly complain
about my fibromyalgia.

-You don't have fibromyalgia.
-No one does!

Every time a waiter tells me their name,
I'm gonna use it.

I'm gonna get really into Halloween,
like, really into it!

Gross. I'm gonna wear a denim shirt

with the Looney Tunes guys
embroidered on it to church every Sunday.

(BOTH MOANING)

Oh, Peter. Oh, Peter.

So, what do you think of my haircut now?

It's ugly. I hate it.

-How you feeling, buddy?
-Good.

Nervous but strangely excited.

I haven't been totally honest with you.

I was never neutered.

But you're about to be.

What? No!

Save me, Sensei Dan!

-No neutering, guys.
-(GRUNTING)

Why are you doing this?

What did I do to you that was so bad?

You abandoned me.

You promised we'd be there
for each other forever.

Then the minute Peter Griffin came along,
you just got in his car and left me.

I was gonna come back and get you,
and... And then,

and then Trump happened
and... And all that...

Liar!

I've wanted to cut your balls off
for years,

but the fact that you're choosing to do
it yourself is so much more satisfying.

But I'm not choosing to do it myself.

-I love my balls.
-(GAS HISSING)

They smell awful.

(GASPS)

(SHOUTS)

Stay back!

Stewie. Y... You saved me.

Oh.

-Well, almost.
-What is it?

Oh, my God, they got one!

Or you still have one.

Maybe you should be
a scrotum half-full guy.

How did you know what he was doing?

I read his book.

"There is no greater motivation
than the destruction of an enemy,

"and my enemy is Brian Griffin.

"One day, I will convince him
to cut off his own balls,

"and that will be
my greatest accomplishment."

You said his books changed your life,
but you didn't even read them.

This is why you're nothing.

I'm sorry, okay?

Yes, I abandoned you.

And I didn't go back to find you.

I'm a bad friend, I admit it.

But did you ever think
that you should be thanking me?

Thanking you? For what?

For everything you have.

Your hatred for me
is what motivated you your whole life.

Without me,
none of this would've been possible.

I made you.

You've already got one of my balls.

Isn't that enough?

You know what, Brian?

It is enough.

You'll probably keep it
in a trophy case or something.

Oh, no. I ate it already.

Dogs are gross.

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

Thank you, Stewie. You really saved me.

My pleasure, Brian.

Well, the good news is
we can give you a prosthetic.

The bad news is
it's one of the bells from a jester's hat.

There's no brain activity,
so we're gonna harvest his bells.

-We understand.
-(BELLS JINGLING)

Why did the king have to hit him so hard?

So, anyone want to ask me

I don't think they're going for it.

-I kind of like that Schmidt.
-You kind of like that Schmidt.

All right, fellas, I got to get going.

Aw, come on. I want to get one more beer.

Again! Again, again!

early in the morning.

Yeah, I'm out, too.

Aw, crap, I don't have any cash.

Hey, can one of you guys spot me?

-Just put it on your card.
-I can't.

Lois'll see the charge.
She thinks I'm still at work.

Wa-peesh.

What is that? What do you mean?

What do you mean, like, "Wha-pshh"?

Like that? Like a whip sound?

-Yeah. How did I do it?
-Very incorrectly.

You don't have your own card,

one that Lois doesn't know about?

No. Lois would kill me.

Ooh, wha-wha-wha-peesh.

Indiana James?

Anyone?

456 Maple Drive, Suite 305.

-Knives with gemstones,

whatever you think Ice-T
would keep in a nightstand.

But really it's for the credit card bills.

I get some of my stuff here, too.

Bills, catheters, residual checks.

-What are the checks for?
-Mostly <i>Seinfeld.</i>

-You were on <i>Seinfeld?</i>
-Yeah, that's right.

Peter, I'm telling you, get
yourself a secret credit card.

-You'll save yourself a lot of stress.
-Thanks, Cleveland.

Sorry, Peter.

about having a credit card.

But, but you said I was cool.

Did you even mean it?!

You know what bothers me

even more than all the money
you put on that credit card?

Bonnie's new car?

Oh, I know. What, does she think
she's a (BLEEP) teenager?

Wait, no, no.

What's worse is finding out
how much you lie to me.

I found your account online.

Monday night you said
you were working late,

but there's a $62 charge at The Clam.

So, whoever stole my card
is still in town.

You just gave me the card, dummy.

You said you had to work last weekend,
then you bought a T-shirt that says

"Working weekends - Does not compute"

with Johnny-Five on it.

I wanted to wait, but...

Happy Mother's Day.

You're not gonna
weasel your way out of this.

You want to act like a child, Peter?

Then I'm gonna treat you like a child.

You're grounded.

-On whose authority?
-General Chang.

(BOTH SPEAKING KLINGON)

Hey, Peter. Lois still mad at you?

Yeah, but she's acting like
everything's fine on Facebook

so she can post pictures of food.

(COMPUTER CHIMING)

I mean, I've done some stupid stuff,
but she's never grounded me before.

Well, you could just
leave the house if you want.

You are an adult.

Brian, husbands are not adults.

They are people who pay for things,
but are still somehow burdens.

Worst part about it,
I'm gonna miss my Sunday shift

at Clappy's Birthday Restaurant.

We heard someone has a birthday.

-SERVERS: H.
-(RHYTHMIC CLAPPING)

A.

P.

P.

T.

E.

Happy birthday, Charlotte.

Excuse me. My table is celebrating
the birthday of deceased

Hawaiian pop singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.

(EXHAUSTED SIGH)

Well, that's why we call it Clappy's.
Let's go.

H.

-(PHONE RINGS)
-Hello?

QUAGMIRE: (OVER PHONE) <i>Peter.</i><i>Peter,</i>
<i>you're not gonna believe</i><i>whose car</i>

<i>just broke down</i><i>on Spooner Street.</i>

<i>-Tom Brady!</i>
-What?

<i>Yeah. He's throwing passes</i>
<i>to anyone who's able to leave his house.</i>

<i>-Ah, he's throwing one to Joe.</i>
-(PEOPLE CHEERING)

<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>Joe</i><i>just stood up for a second.</i>

JOE: <i>He put that pass</i><i>where only</i>
<i>a walking person</i><i>could catch it.</i>

<i>That's how good he is,</i>
<i>his pass made me walk!</i>

CLEVELAND:<i> And here comes Gisele.</i>
<i>She's giving out TAG Heuer watches.</i>

Aw. Lois?

Can I please go out
and play with Tom Brady?

QUAGMIRE: <i>She's out here.</i>

LOIS: <i>Tom Brady's taking us all</i>
<i>to see an Anne Hathaway movie.</i>

Oh. Uh...

Oh, no, I'm grounded.

Hey, it's my old wedding TUCKS...

Medicated Pads.

Boy, my butt sure was like a match
that needed to be extinguished that day.

Oh, what a day that was.

All the Preparation... H
I used on my fiery ring.

I got to escape.

But how?

Wait a minute, you saw
<i>Shawshank Redemption, </i>Peter.

How did Brooks get out of there?

(ROPE CREAKING)

Aah!

-Hey, possum.
-POSSUM: It's actually o-possum.

PETER: O, is it?

What the hell?

Aah. Peter, what are you doing?

I got to get out of here, Brian.

I'm going crazy sitting around the house.

So you're tunneling out?

Lois is gonna be furious if she finds out.

That's why Lois isn't going to find out.

-Right, boy?
-What are you talking about?

I'm talking about you

not being a bad boy.

I'm, I'm not... I'm not a bad boy.

Then do not say anything to Lois.
You hear me?

Bad. Bad dog.

So, we understand each other?

Yeah, I'll be good. Trust me.

I saw what you did to that black belt.

-(CROWD GASPS)
-I don't care what color your belt is,

you're a child and I am stronger than you.

-(CROWD BOOING)
-Oh, boo yourself.

Boo yourself.

She was the one strutting around
Pizza Hut with that trophy.

Yeah, who's the Girls' Regional
Youth Karate Champ now, Kelsey?

-Huh?
-(BOOING CONTINUES)

Kelsey?

All right, down in the tunnel.

Time to way-too-easily make a torch.

Look, our Internet connection.

CHRIS: Mom!

Never mind.

Mom!

Never mind.

CLEVELAND: Donna!

JOE: Bonnie!

QUAGMIRE: I'm not on the Internet.

Some people in this neighborhood read.

Anyway, it was a beautiful ceremony.

We laid my Uncle Reggie to rest
with the respect that he deserved.

Aah! Uncle Reggie!

I'm sorry we stuffed you
in that Hefty Cinch Sak

and pushed you in the pond.

Relax, guys. It's just me.

You dug a hole all the way
from your house?

Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah, but what if Lois
notices you're gone?

Trust me, I got it covered.

Peter, there's some salmon
on the stove if you're hungry.

Well, it's what I made.

So, you guys want to see the tunnel?

-Frick yeah.
-Let's go!

-Right behind you.
-How 'bout you, Jerome? You in?

Okay, well, he's busy.

Peter Griffin...

(DRAMATICALLY) ...you've been a busy boy.

-What was that?
-Just a cool way to say something.

It wasn't that cool.

All right, it's pretty neat, Peter,
but we should probably get out of here.

Yeah, sure.

Unless anyone wants to see a salamander.

-Oh, look at it.
-I named him Sally.

Slippy-ass little bug right there.

Okay, this is pretty cool.

Come on, I'll show you the rest.

Look at these handprints.
Somebody did the perfect cartwheel.

Actually, Peter, there's elbow prints
and knee prints all around this thing.

The perfect cartwheel.

And there's scuffled dirt
and a little bit of blood over here.

Perhaps the ancients
cartwheeled everywhere.

Peter, did you trip on a root
and eat it big-time?

No, I did not.

Uh, hang on.
There's a guy tunneling the other way.

-Pretty cramped, huh?
-(CHUCKLES) You said it.

Next time, I pay for business class.

(CHUCKLES) Right?

That guy was in the paper
for hitting his wife.

(RUMBLING)

Peter, are you sure this tunnel
is structurally sound?

Don't worry, guys.
I'll cartwheel back for help.

Aah!

(GROANS) A root.

(GROANS) I ate it big-time.

-(RUMBLING)
-Look out!

Oh, my God.

The tunnel's completely
collapsed on both sides.

Oh, no. We're stuck down here.

BEAVER: Hey, guys.

Hey, look, it's the dumb beaver.

-You live down here?
-Sure do.

Welcome to my running-out-of-Airbnb.

(GIGGLES)

No, but this is very serious.

Great. Peter, this is just great.

Because you can't stand up
to your wife, I'm gonna die.

Relax, Quagmire. Nobody's gonna die.

What do you think happens
when we run out of air, genius?

Air. Right.

You know, I'd only taken
the other three elements into account.

Earth, wind, fire, water.

-Where's air?
-Wind is air.

Who's that, Joey Swanson
or Bill Nye the Science Guy?

Peter, can't you dig us out of here?

No, I left my tools at The Clam.

Uh, what's standard protocol
for when the cops start looking for us?

Uh, I'm not sure.

I just give out stickers
if kids come to the station.

I guess the only chance we have
is if Brian sells me out to Lois.

What I wouldn't give to be
with a woman just one more time.

You can go over to that wall,
make yourself a dirt-gina.

-This wall here?
-No, silly.

That wall's a guy.

No. Why?

Well, I haven't seen him all morning.

I'm worried he left the house
and got into some kind of trouble.

He'll turn up. I'm sure he's fine.

Phew.

Somethin' on your mind there, bud?

-I'm not a bad boy.
-Uh, nobody said you were.

Good. Because I'm not a bad boy.

I'm a good boy.

How would you like to be a <i>very </i>good boy?

-Tell me how. Tell me how.
-Where's the fat man?

Aw, damn it.

But I promised Peter.

What is it? What is it, boy?

(BARKING)

The fat man dug a tunnel to go hang out
with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire?

We've got to tell someone.

What is it, Stewie?

(CRYING)

Daddy went to a Peter Cetera concert
in Cleveland with Robin Tunney?

Robin Tunney from <i>The Mentalist</i>

slept with the entire
Cleveland Browns team?

<i>I ask that you please respect my privacy</i>
<i>in this difficult time.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Anyone else having trouble breathing?

Could just be allergies.

Yeah. Yeah, you think it's allergies?

You don't think it's because
we're running out of air?

It's hard to say.

I don't know how severe
your allergies are.

-You are such a moron.
-Different people are allergic

-to different things.
-You know, I hope we do die down here.

-Oh, that's nice.
-So I never have to listen to another word

-out of your mouth.
-That's a nice thing

-to say to a lifelong friend.
-(SNEEZES)

Ah. Ah.

I'm gonna kill you, Peter!

-(GRUNTING)
-All right, calm down.

Let's not use the rest of
our oxygen to kill each other.

So, if we're all gonna die anyway,

what's the worst thing
you guys have ever done?

Okay, I'll go first.

Lois once killed a woman.

Seems like a secret about Lois.

Yeah. But I picked out the woman.

Well, I, uh, I, uh, went to
a Coldplay concert by myself.

What? That's terrible.

-Why would you do that?
-I like Coldplay!

They were playing in Boston,
so I made the trip.

Great show, I got to say. Very visual.

It <i>was </i>visual. I was at that show, too.

What? You were there?

No, I'm just kidding.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Uh, I like Lil Yachty, man.

I don't know nothin' about that mess.

<i>But I did go to that show.</i>

<i>Didn't mean to.</i>

<i>I said "Kid 'N Play" on the phone,</i>

<i>but they didn't understand me,</i>

<i>One other time I said "Kid 'N Play"</i>

<i>and I got Cirque du Soleil.</i>

<i>I'm thinking maybe Kid 'N Play</i>
<i>doesn't perform anymore.</i>

(RUMBLING)

What's that sound?

Probably just the movie
in the next theater.

I hope the rest of the tunnel
isn't about to collapse.

MAN 1: <i>Hello? This is the Quahog</i>

You're slightly too big for the hole.

Can you take off your shirt

She is.

<i>Can you have her turn around?</i>

-Oh, Lois.

<i>To be the one you run to</i>

<i>I just want to be the one you come to</i>
<i>I just want...</i>

(GRUNTS)

What the hell were you thinking?

Peter, the whole reason you were grounded
was because you were lying to me.

And then you lied to me about the tunnel.

(SIGHS) Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.

I'm sorry I lied about the credit card.

And I'm sorry I lied about the tunnel.

I know I was acting stupid,
and I deserved to be grounded.

Peter, I don't want to have to ground you.

You're my husband.
I just don't want you to lie to me.

I lie to you 'cause
you treat me like a kid.

Act like a man
and I'll stop treating you like a kid.

Look like a kid,
I'll start acting like a man.

-What?
-I'm sorry, Lois.

That's just the tunnel talkin'.

So, Chris, you happy
to have your dad back?

Yeah, you know what, Tom,
I think we're all gonna go home

and charge our laptops
a little longer tonight.

You just never know
when you're gonna run out of juice

and have to use your phone.

(CHOKED UP) You know,
just because we're reporters

doesn't mean we're devoid of emotion.

Go on and head home with your family.

Thanks, Tom.

That's a... (SNIFFLES)

That's a very horny kid right there.

he can't make

So, Brian, how's Frank Sinatra, Jr.?

-You two still hanging out?
-No. He died.

I'll never forget it,

it was Spiro Agnew's birthday.

Wow, so you, uh, really went all-in
with the Japanese screens.

Yes, I really like changing in silhouette
while carrying on a conversation.

Will you excuse me?

-So, how was your flight?
-It was, uh, it was fine.

I had a layover in Atlanta...

What are you doing back there?

Just getting into
something more comfortable.

Can I interest you in a nightcap?

-I think I've got...
-Who is that?

A little privacy, please!

What the hell was all that?

I have a lot of money, Brian.

But let's continue this
while I take a very foggy shower.

No, Stewie, come on.
I haven't seen you in almost 50 years.

And you haven't even
told me how great I look.

You do look great. Thanks to me.

I invented a pill to extend your life.

It's called "Semper Fido."

What? Why?

Aren't you going to say anything
about the cute name I gave it?

Ha.

What? Why?

I snuck it in your food because
I wanted you to live long enough

to see that global warming is bull crap.

Oh, my God, we were so wrong about that.

If anything, it's way colder now.

Yes, and now thanks to you,
we're stuck with President Polar Bear.

President Polar Bear, is it true
you ate the presidential seal?

That was a simple misunderstanding.

-No further questions.
-REPORTER 1: President Polar Bear!

REPORTER 2: President Polar Bear,
what did you do for a Klondike bar?

I believe the president has
answered all of your questions.

Here's what I don't understand,

why did you even want me to live this long
if you were just gonna leave me?

It's not about you, Brian.

I couldn't take it back there.

But they were your family, Stewie.

I guess I'm just not a family guy.

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

Mom and dad always wanted me
to be someone I wasn't.

Stewie Griffin, get in here right now!

-Yeah?
-Well,

I just got our Christmas card photos.

You want to tell me
what you're doing with your hands here?

-Nothing.
-Exactly, nothing.

And what does the greeting
at the top of the card say?

"Merry Christmas and a Shocking New Year."

And what is every
other member of the family

doing with their hands?

-The shocker.
-Right.

Now, listen, Stewie,
I'm a cool dad, all right?

I could care less what you
do with the pink, truly.

But the stink is where
you get the "shocking."

You get that? You get what I'm saying?

Even if it's just one, that's fine.

But you got to put something there.

I-I think it's gonna be fine.

I'm sure people won't even notice.

(LAUGHING)

Oh...

Anyway, that's why I left.

Well, that was a long time ago.

Stewie, Peter is dying.

What?

Oh, my God, that's awful.

-So, you'll come see him?
-Of course.

You know, he once asked me
in the event that he was sick

to clear his Google history.

"Peter Griffin search history."

"Winnie the Pooh,

"Winnie the Pooh jacket,

"Winnie the Pooh vintage jacket,

"Full cast Winnie the Pooh backpack."

Oh, "cancer symptoms," yeah.

"Coughing up blood, pain in abdomen,

"Winnie the Pooh casket."
Yeah, he is sick.

You know, while we're here,
let's take a look at your search history.

-No, Stewie, that's...
-"Spiro Agnew birthday."

What a weird thing
to try to impress me with.

Okay, first stop, Chris Griffin.

(GROANS) We have to pick up Chris?

Yeah, what's the problem?

Uh, we didn't exactly get along too well.

Especially after Grandpa died
and left me the dark boathouse.

You can still use the boathouse
on non-vacation Sundays in the spring.

I've always taken care of you, Chris.

Taken care of me?

You're my kid brother,
you take care of me?

Sorry, I came down here to vape.

Send Chris off to do this,
send Chris off to do that.

I'm supposed to be shoveling the driveway.

I'm your older brother, Stewie,
and I was stepped over!

It's the way Grandpa wanted it.

It ain't the way I wanted it!

Sounds like you're having
a personal conversation.

I'll put in my earbuds.

I'm smart!

Not like everybody says, like dumb.

I'm smart and I want respect.

<i>Funky Cold Medina</i>

Chris, you live in filth.

Yeah, I kind of wasted my life,

except I obsessed over

-CHRIS' PENIS: Who's out there?

Settle down, just got some company.

CHRIS' PENIS:
Well, aren't you going to introduce me?

I'm getting to it,

CHRIS' PENIS: Where's the Jamba Juice
you were gonna get me?

Never mind, I'll order it on Postmates.

-No, you won't.
-Stop spending all our money.

So, what's Meg been up to anyway?

She runs a small private
security business out in the desert.

That sounds kind of cool.

Well, she basically
just tests bulletproof vests.

-Ready?
-One sec.

(HUFFING)

Yeah, go, go, go.

-(GUNSHOT)
-(MEG EXCLAIMS)

(WINCES)

Ooh... yeah.

This one can use another layer.

Oh, hey, guys.

-Um, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

CHRIS' PENIS: Hi, Meg. Bring it in.

Hi, Chris' Penis. How are you?

CHRIS' PENIS: Same spit, different day.

Wow, look at Quahog.

Light rail system, gleaming skyscrapers.

-Look at all this traffic.

Yeah, Brady Boulevard

You know what? Cut over to Brady on Brady

and then take the Brady Bridge.

Is everything in this town
named after Tom Brady?

Oh, no, there's
the Rob Gronkowski Library.

The only book is just a label
ripped off a Muscle Milk bottle.

QUAGMIRE: Hey, Stewie.

Here comes a double scoop of trouble.

Whoa, you look great,
considering your age.

Yeah, I'm basically exactly the same,

except I pretty much only talk
about ice cream now.

Oh, that's cool, that's cool.

Yeah, you know what's cool? Ice cream.

Want to go get a cup? Cone? Bowl?

I'm just trying to see my folks.

Man, I love ice cream.

You know there's three different
ice cream shops in Quahog?

-They're all good.
-What's your favorite?

They're all good.

So, that's the scoop from here.

All right, well,
good running into you, man.

Oh, my babies, finally all together again.

Hello, Mother.

I mean, uh, damn you, vile woman.

I must kill you, et cetera, et cetera.

(CANNED STUDIO AUDIENCE
LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

Did Quagmire tell you about the ice cream?

Yes.

You know, there are three
ice cream parlors in town.

-We know.
-They're all good.

-Yes, he said that.
-They're all good.

Have we already run out of conversation?

Chris, Meg, how are you?

-Good, Ma.
-How are you?

Oh, I can't complain.
Little hard of hearing,

which is why I turned on
the closed captioning.

It's about 30 seconds behind, though.

Wow, that is way behind.

Now, what would you kids like for dinner?

-It's 3:15, Ma.
-I know, we waited for you.

Yeah, we, we can go ahead
and turn that off.

How's dad?

Your father's had severe diabetes

ever since they opened
three ice cream stores in town.

(WEAKLY) They're all good.

You can't live like this,
the house is falling apart.

This is awful, and it's all my fault.

Oh, Pop, I am so sorry
I abandoned you all.

I never should've left home.
What can I do?

Just promise, when I die,
that you will help our family.

I will, I promise.

This family will never want
for anything ever again.

-That's so generous.
-Thank you.

Chris, your hand.

All right, now that that's settled,

let's celebrate

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker,

You won't hear anything I'm saying
because they're so distracting.

Now, let's go to Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa,

so we can be shocked at how well
her people age. Tricia?

Tom, I'm standing here with flawless skin

next to the shedding, crumbling,
dusty ancient relics

of white people my age.

(SNEEZES)

Oh, Stewie, you've done so much
to help our family.

I can't believe you put in an elevator.

Yes, and it even has elevator music.

<i>Music of now, music of now</i>

Aw, and thanks for these
virtual reality glasses,

so I can watch porn
while talking to the family.

So, what's California like, Stewie? Ugh.

That was a penis.

So, do, do you still
want to know about California?

No, I'm done.

I have one more dying wish.

Play the song,

but play it slow because I am old.

(SLOWED DOWN)

Oh, Dr. Hartman, thank you for coming.

Actually, I'm Dr. Hartman's son.

Doctor Hartmanson?
But I asked for Dr. Hartman.

His jokes are getting worse, Doctor.
Is there anything you can do for him?

Now, all we can do is wait.

Lois, it's time.

Oh, Peter, I'm gonna miss you so much.

I see a white light.

There are others inside of it.

Adam West, Carrie Fisher,

Heaven is filled

No, this is actually

Frank Sinatra Jr., Charles Durning,

Lauren Bacall, Rodney Dangerfield,

Roy Scheider, Waylon Jennings,

Ed Asner by the time
this airs certainly...

Dad, you don't have to do this,
there are too many.

Uh-oh, Conway Twitty is here,
and he's pissed.

Wait, he's wearing the Darth Vader helmet.

(CHUCKLES)
Never mind, he was cool with it.

(SIGHS) This is it.

(SHUDDERING BREATHS)

Oh, he's trying to say something.

(GASPS) I will, Dad, I promise.

(ALL CRYING)

No, we won't cry for him,
we will celebrate his life.

The finest cigars for
the finest family ever to live.

Oh, Stewie, we love you so much.

And I love you, which is why
I must not delay any longer.

I must get my affairs in order
and transfer my money to all of you.

-I will see you all soon.
-Oh, thank you, Stewie.

-We love you.
-Thanks.

We did it. We got him.

I feel like we're in <i>The Sting,</i>

Great work tricking him, Brian.

Thanks. Well, you know,
I credit my years as a writer.

When I planned the con,
I saw Quahog as a character...

Okay, that's enough.

STEWIE: <i>Had a pebble in my shoe.</i>

<i>Of course I knew</i>
<i>the whole thing was a scam.</i>

<i>They probably did that</i>

It hurts! Reverse the pill! Let me die!

Stewie! Stewie!

Stewie! Stewie!

-(STAMMERS) Huh? What?
-What the hell is wrong with you?

You've been staring at that old man
Halloween costume for 30 minutes.

Twenty one plus commercials,
but it's a big decision.

You know, I've always been
afraid of being old,

but now I think I'll like it just fine.

Why are you walking so slowly?

Turns out this costume is about 80% balls,

and most of it's dragging behind me.

-(STRAINING)
-(HERBERT GRUNTS)

-Uh, we got a tangle.
-Uh, what do I do?

Stop walking.

-I'll go back, you go forward.
-Are you sure?

-It's counterintuitive.
-I don't know, doesn't seem right to me.

-When you want to go left, you go right.
-I'm just gonna pull forward.

-Don't pull, don't pull.
-I, I think if you come this way,

-and I go that way...
-Just stop walking and listen to me.

Everybody freeze.

Okay, let's just think about this.

(CROWD CHEERING)

People of Argentina,

I have heard your cries,

and I just want to say...

Heck yeah, I do!

Oh, man, I haven't been this excited

Wow. You got a cool hand, Luke.

Yeah, well, he doesn't follow the crowd.

Our top story tonight,

local baseball coach Peter Griffin

took a knee during
the national anthem today,

joining the fight for equality.

Well, just finished a load.

Gonna do the laundry next.

Dad, check it out!

You're on the news for taking
a knee during the anthem.

-What?
-They called you a hero and an activist.

-A hero?
-Yeah.

Because you took a knee
to support the fight

against police brutality.

Yeah, yes. That's what I did.

I can't believe my dad's a hero.

Oh, I'm no hero.

I'm just a white guy doing
what black people were already doing.

In other words, a hero.

Well, can I just say,
as the famed family liberal,

I think this activism is great, Peter.

Doesn't matter if it's me or, say, you

who gets applauded
for his progressive thinking,

as long as the message is out there.

Thank you, Brian.

(CHUCKLES)
Wow. You... You are furious.

Not at all.

You never been interested
in these issues before.

A... Are you sure you're not just
exploiting a real social issue

so that people can call you a hero?

You heard Tom Tucker.

All right.
In order to prove I'm an activist,

I need to yell at people
who are just trying to buy milk

on their way home from work.

Hello. Hi.

Have a nice day.

Hi there. Hello.

Do you have a minute
to save a child's life?

Yeah. I guess.

You got a minute.
Ticktock.

What are you doing?

30 seconds now.

I'm listening.

What am I even convincing you of?

Tell me why Smokey the Bear
wears jeans but no shirt.

Why would they do that?

-Is that what this is all about?
-That's what this is all about.

Peter, what the hell?

It's okay, it's okay.

I voted.

So... Yeah.

-What does that matter?
-Oh, well, I'm a part

of the national conversation
now, and I voted.

So my hands are kinda tied, so...

Yeah.

You know what?
This whole activism thing

has gone on long enough.

You knelt at one game.
It's not like opportunity's

gonna come knocking on the door,
offering you money for it.

(KNOCKING)

Hi. I'm the president of Nike.

How'd you like some money?

LOIS:
For crying out loud!

Mr. Griffin, we heard about your protest

and we no-heartedly believe
that, with your help,

we can conflate buying our products
with genuine activism.

-I voted.
-Yes.

And now we want to give you a lot of money

to star in a commercial for us.

-What do you say?
-Well, I have two questions.

-Will there be a stipend?
-Yes.

Ah. And what is a stipend?

It's a fee for being in the commercial.

I'm in.

Okay, I'm ready to move on

Well, now I don't know what to believe.

Carter.
What are you doing here?

Peter, ever since you made
that stupid commercial,

my ticket sales have tanked!

Thanks to you, people now think

the Quahog Whooping Scalpers are racist!

You want me to sign your boobs?

Peter, your kneeling days are over.

Two strikes, two outs,
bottom of the ninth,

down by one, bases loaded,
Pewterschmidt up.

(CHANTING)
Carter! Carter!

He grounded out in the second,
struck out in the fifth.

Hasn't been his day.

Here's the wind-up, the pitch...

Strike three!
And he knew it.

(GRUNTING)

-CARTER: Aw. Cute.

Look at the little birds.

Oh.
Disney's not gonna like that.

Cleveland?

Wh... Where am I?

Welcome to WaQuahog.

(DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, my God.

Why wasn't <i>this The Cleveland Show?</i>

This entire episode would have
been our season five premiere.

What happened to me?
Where am I?

Have you ever seen <i>Black Panther?</i>

No. No. God, no.

Well, this is WaQuahog,
a secret part of Quahog

with technology more advanced
than any nation.

We brought you here to help you

after you were attacked for your activism.

Really?
So I'm the only white guy

who knows WaQuahog exists?

Well, you and one Postmates guy.

Hey, I got your Taco Bell breakfast.

Thanks.

Oh.
I don't, uh, I don't see a soda with that.

Oh, yeah, sorry.

Um... Do you want me to go back?

Well, I mean... Kinda.

Okay, but since it's WaQuahog
it'll probably be, like,

-45 minutes, at least.
-Yeah. I mean,

I ordered the soda
'cause I wanted the soda.

(SIGHS)
Okay, man.

-See you in, like, an hour.
-Right on.

You better give him a big tip.

Pretty sure the tip is already
built into the service charge.

Wow!
So this is, like, a secret kingdom

cut off from the rest of the world?

We got everything you need down here.

Even our own WaQuahog TV channel.

Oh, <i>The Jeffersons.</i>

Yeah, but they edit
all the shows for syndication.

<i>-Weezy...</i>
-(CHORUS) <i>Mmm... Yeah</i>

-Now LeBron's a Laker.
-A Laker's now LeBron.

Yeah, that's not really working out,

but thanks for having me here, guys.

It is our pleasure.

We want to thank you.

By taking a knee, you showed the world

that you see the terrible
injustices our people face.

Of course, being an activist,
you already know all about them.

Oh, boy.

This is more uncomfortable

than sports announcers
in a too-small booth.

So, the Cowboys come in to today's game

winners of four of their last five.

So, Troy, what do they need to do

to beat this Eagles team today?

Well, Joe, you and I were talking

over chopped liver
and coffee this morning,

and we said it has to start
with the run game.

I remember after that

we Lady-and-the-Tramp'd
a croissant together

and said this O-line needs to get healthy.

That's right, Joe.
And I hope the viewers out there

can see by the fact that
our lips are almost touching

that we are truly excited
about today's matchup.

Straight from your mouth
into mine, partner.

We do hope you'll join us in protest

by kneeling at the next game.

You bet I will!

C... Can I... Can I just
ask one question, though?

What are Migos?

Peter, everyone has to find out
what Migos are for themselves.

(ORGAN PLAYING <i>CHARGE)</i>

A lot of eyes on you today, Griffin.

I'm counting on you to do the right thing.

The only kneelin'
I want around here is Kevin.

Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt...

Front row seats...
Thanks for having me at the game.

Pleased to meet you, Kevin.
I've got some seats for you

-in the front row.
-Oh, great! Thanks!

-Line of coke. Lead the way.
-Sure.

Hey, what do you say
we take a pit stop in the...

Little boys' room.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now,</i>
<i>please rise</i><i>for our national anthem</i>

<i>to be sung by Kevin Nealon.</i>

<i>And I have no idea</i>
<i>how he convinced me of that.</i>

<i>I thought we were just talking</i>
<i>about other things.</i>

Oh, man.
I don't know what to do.

Kneel with us, brother.

(SNORTS)
Whoa!

That is good bathroom cocaine.

-(KNOCKING)
-Somebody's in this stall!

That's it!

Hey, listen up, everyone.

I have something
I need to come clean about.

(MURMURING)

Cleveland, people of WaQuahog,

I didn't kneel during the anthem
because I was an activist.

I kneeled because I had
fairly brutal diarrhea,

and I'm sorry.

If I could take it back,
I would still kneel,

but for the right reasons now.

I see the struggle you face,

and you deserve everyone's support.

And, Carter, I know
you're just trying to honor the troops.

-I never said that.
-But, honestly,

why are we even
playing the national anthem

at a sports event?

It's not a solemn occasion,
like a military funeral

or... Or sex between Salma Hayek
and Ed Norton.

It's a game.

The problem isn't with each other,

it's with the song.

We need a new song,
one that unites all people.

MAN:
Why is your phone all pink and sparkly?

-You're talking about it, aren't you?
-Oh, snap.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you your new national anthem.

Hey, uh, Jerome, can you give us
a minute to discuss this

Quagmire, excuse
my Wisconsin mouth, but...

(WISCONSIN ACCENT)
Why the heck are you not drinkin',

for cripes' sake?

Are you doing the keto diet
so you lose a bunch of weight

and it makes you look
like you got a mascot head?

No, I'm on medication,
so I can't drink, okay?

And I'm not gonna say what it's for.

I'll... I'll just say the pharmacist
whispers it to me.

So you haven't been drinking all week?

What have you been doing?

Just mostly going to bed early.

Like really early.

Like so early
you still hear people outside

mowing their lawns.

But it's not that bad...
Th... There's plenty of sober stuff

-we can do together.
-Ugh, like what? Fly kites?

That's stupid, or is it?
I'm in. I have a kite in my car.

What about an escape room?

If we can't drink, we might as well
lock ourselves in a room

with no windows.

Cleveland, I could kiss you!

My heart says yes,

but my Lord says no.

Hello, puzzlers.
Welcome to my escape room!

For those of you
who've never played before,

the game is simple.

You will all be locked in identical rooms

where you will solve a series of puzzles

using clues hidden around the room.

First family to escape wins!

Will... Will there be fractions?

I was told there would be no fractions.

Well, whoever told you
that was half right.

Eh?

Now, I know what some of you are thinking.

Yes, I look like a man
who owns domestic rats.

Yes, I do own domestic rats.

Yes, they've eaten a few of my toes.

Yes, the rats are missing.

Yes, this current talk is being videotaped

and will be used as my legal
release of responsibility

if aforementioned toe-eating rats
were to nibble,

bite or maul any
of the present participants' toes.

Yes, it's held up in court before.

Yes, this is the "odd speech"
cited in our Yelp reviews.

But most importantly...

Have fun!

You guys want to bet on
who finishes first? Huh?

I had a night coffee,
so I'm feeling jazzed.

(CHUCKLES) Well, I... I don't know
if we should be betting.

Our family kind of has
an unfair advantage.

I mean, I'm a detective.

-No.
-Okay.

So what?
Peter's made for these games.

He's got a big fat puzzle-solving brain.

I mean, look at his head.
It's huge!

Look at it!

Yeah, yeah, look at it.

Yes.

Okay, where do people leave their keys

Oh, oh, I know, I know.

I'll say the answer. Spaghetti.

PETER:
Hitting a kid with a wooden spoon.

I mean, the answer is obvious.

I know. Totally.

Oh, oh, you're waiting for me
to keep going.

The name is Fibonacci.

PETER: Kissing a cross
before you get-a on a airplane.

Fibonacci is also a reference
to a sequence of numbers

where every number after the first two

is the sum of the two preceding ones.

It's from <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i>
and the answer is 2-3-5-

8-1-3-2-1-3-4.

Guys, guys, guys,
you're thinking too hard.

The answer is simple.

Fibonacci is the name of a number man

from <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i>
which was written by Tom Hanks,

so the number is...

Hey, Stewie, we really
crushed it last night

Ugh, don't say "crushed"

I did well, Brian.

You just copied my answer and took credit.

Whatever, Stewie.
I don't know why

I always need your validation.

I should just let you enjoy

I can't control the DNA I was given,

but now I can control the DNA
I want to keep.

No, it's not.

Any last words before I go in?

Yeah, don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

Yes. Thank you.

Stewie, I'm serious.
Messing around with your DNA

could have dire consequences.

Haven't you ever seen the movie <i>Splice?</i>

Would you like to hear tonight's specials?

Bah, bah, bah, bah, ooh, bah, bah, bah!

So, what's everyone gonna get?

Hey, Chris, watch. I bet she orders

the eggplant parmesan
like it's something fancy.

I'm thinking the eggplant parmesan.

It'll be like we're in Italy!

Ha!
Our family should wear uniforms

with "Basic Bitches" across the front.

What's wrong with eggplant parmesan?

Nothing.
I was just making a joke.

Stewie and I do it all the time.

Stewie is a baby.

You bad-mouth our family to the baby?

Forget it.
Forget I said anything.

Mom! Dad!

Brian's talking crap
about you guys to Stewie!

-What?
-No, I wasn't.

Yeah, he was.
He said we're a bunch of basic bitches.

It's kinda true, yo.

Brian, if I was such a basic bitch,

would I be wearing
solid black umpire's shoes?

Umpires are cool.

They make the rules.

(SPEAKING BABY TALK)

Water out!

Are umpires not cool?

I'm starting to feel foolish.

Where the hell is my white wine
with Sprite in it?

Hi again. That man over there
reading a book by himself

has offered to pay for your meal
if you move to a table outside.

You're not the dick in this situation.

You're paying for their meal,
so you can't be the dick.

-Cup.
-Yeah, cup. Wow.

All right, time to go, everybody.

What? Where are we going?

My cousin's getting married this weekend.

Brian, I need your help
with Stewie on the flight.

-Sure, no problem.
-The iPad's broken.

-Brian face.
-Mm-hmm.

-Brian face.
-Yup.

-Brian face.
-Only a few more now.

-(BABBLING)
-Okay. All right.

Got to be getting tired soon.

You see, when young kids act out,

what they're really doing
is asking to be heard.

They have very little control
in their lives,

so the key, and I mean key...

Is to make them an active participant

in these decisions.

And once you do that...

You'll see... A big... Difference.

Hi. Can I get some
of those tiny square napkins?

Yeah, like... Like the most
you're allowed to give.

Now the bride and groom

would like to share a moment of silence

to honor the family members
who have passed.

They may not be with us in person,

but they are with us in spirit.

-STEWIE: Poo-poo.
-BRIAN: No!

We do not touch poo-poo in this family.

We do not touch poo-poo.

No! Hands up.

That's it.
Now there's no bubbles later.

-STEWIE: Yes, bubbles!
-BRIAN: No bubbles.

-You lost the bubbles.
-STEWIE: Yes, bubbles!

BRIAN:
Maybe you can earn them back.

But as far as I'm concerned,
you've lost the bubbles.

They're gone.
They're probably gone.

Yay, bubbles!

What?

I think it's time
to change you back, Stewie.

As much as I hated
being around a condescending baby,

I prefer that
to a screaming bag of leaking crap.

Brian face.

All right, how do I use this thing?

These are all just sketches of Stewie

It's got to be on the computer somewhere.

"Restore original DNA profile."
Yes.

"Would you like to add
a Hemsworth haircut?" No.

"Are you sure?" Yes.

"Really?" Yes.

"Would you like to first see a photo

No.

"Too bad."

Just restore DNA.

Whoops. "Edit, undo."

Uh-oh. "Edit, redo."

My God, I can't

What am I gonna do?

I better go rewatch <i>Splice.</i>

<i>This is Peter Griffin's Penis Video.</i>

<i>Take one.</i>

Oh, my God.

What do you think, bud?

There's a Q and A
with the cast afterwards.

No.

-No.
-Stewiechu.

No.

Aw, he's gonna hate me
for changing this one.

-STEWIE: Hello?
-Stewie?

STEWIE:
Brian, is my mouth in my butt?

(SNIFFS)
Yeah, my mouth's in my butt.

-You got to fix this.
-I'm trying.

Brian, where's my butt?

No. No. No.

Brian, you did it.

No. Oh, (BLEEP)!

Sorry. (BLEEP)

(GROWLS)

-(SCREECHES)
-(SCREAMS)

(SNARLING)

You can fix this.

You just need a little help.

Just like how Sylvester Stallone

needs help getting ready in the morning.

So, what are we thinking this morning?

I don't know. I like big face.

Big, fat face.
Goatee with little, tiny eyes.

Okay.
And what about for your body?

Yeah, you know, veins.
All kinds of veins everywhere.

L... Little rivers everywhere.

(GLASS BREAKS)

(SNARLING)

So, do you think you can help me
get him back to normal?

You came to the right guy.

But first I'm gonna need a few things.

-Of course, anything.
-Go to the kitchen

and grab eight to ten dish towels.

Tear 'em in half and lay 'em
on the floor in my room.

Then I need two AA batteries.

After that, go to Shake Shack
and pick up four burgers.

Doesn't matter which ones.
They're all good.

-How is that gonna help?
-You'll see!

Finally, I need you to sew

the long plastic tube
from the vacuum cleaner

-onto this pair of underwear.
-Come on, Chris.

Hey, you came to me, damn it.

I can fix this,
but not if you don't trust me.

Chris?
It's been three hours.

Any updates?

You don't want to be in here, dude.

(STEWIE SNARLING)

Stewie, I need your help.

I know that there's got to be

a part of you inside there
that can understand me,

and maybe Rupert can help you remember.

Remember Rupert?
He's your best friend

with whom you seem to have
a very sexual past.

(GROWLS)

(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

Yes, it's working.

It's Rupert. Nice Rupert.

Stewie loves Rupert.

-(SCREAMS)
-(PHONE RINGS)

What the hell?

Hello?

<i>-Stewie!</i>
-Uh, no Stewie.

<i>-Stewie!</i>
-No Stewie.

-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-LOIS: Brian, is Stewie in there?

<i>-Stewie!</i>
-No Stewie. Uh...

LOIS: His preschool teacher said he
took home the Flat Stanley

-this weekend, and she needs it back.
-(SNARLING)

<i>-Stewie!</i>
-LOIS: Open the door.

Uh, no, no, no.
I'll... I'll... I'll find it.

-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
<i>-Stewie!</i>

-No Stewie.
-Hi, Brian.

I got a trampoline.

<i>-Stewie!</i>
-No Stewie.

Fat guys go high.

I don't know how to stop.

-LOIS: Let me in. Where's Stewie?
-(SNARLS)

-Stewie!
-No Stewie!

Is this my forever?

Everything is fine.
Just nobody come in or look in.

Stewie was right.
I am an idiot.

I wish I could go back
to before this whole thing happened

and tell him he's right.

Wait, I can go back.

Stewie's time machine.

Oh, there he is.
Wish me luck, Flat Stanley.

(BEEPING)

Or you could just call me Stanley.

Not make fun of my body.

Oh, no.
What did you do?

A lot.
You can't go in this machine, Stewie.

Removing those parts of your DNA
doesn't make you smarter.

It just turns you into a regular baby.

That's impossible.
My science is correct.

I know, but I may not have been
telling you the truth

about Chris being a smart baby.

But he solved a Rubik's Cube.

I saw the video.

BRIAN:
I played it in reverse.

He wasn't solving one.

He was eating one.

You're not gonna grow up to be dumb.

You're gonna grow up to be you.

Who's way smarter than me.

So you're saying that, somehow,

all my smooshed-together,
crappy Griffin DNA

is actually what makes me smart?

Yeah, I think so.

I suppose it's possible.

Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

-What's that?
-By traveling back here,

you've created a new timeline.

For everything to revert back to normal,

you have to drown your past self
in the toilet.

(DOOR OPENS)

Hey, Stewie.

(GRUNTING)

W... W... Wait, wait, wait, no, no, sorry.

-Sorry, I have it backwards.
-What?

You're supposed to be drowning
your future self.

You came back.
You're the new timeline.

Oh, come on!

Hey, I said I'm smart.
I'm not perfect.

(GASPS, COUGHING)

Do it. Just do it.

(GRUNTING)

Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes.
Yes, this is right.

Well, that was fun,

but it didn't fill the whole episode.

So, in the Pixar tradition
of killing time,

here's a <i>Family Guy </i>short.

And don't worry,
it won't be that creepy one

where the Chinese mother eats her baby.

it just wasn't flowing through me.

-Do you have a receipt?

I don't think Chris can count to three.

How are we gonna pay 'em back?

Whoa, what do you mean, "we"?

Yeah, do you expect
all nine of us to chip in?

Come on, we got to think of some way

That's it! We'll set up a Kickstarter

for the three grand we need.

But, Brian, people don't just
donate money on Kickstarter.

It has to go toward some sort of project.

Okay, then we'll say we're making a movie.

And who will we get to direct?

We'll raise the money we need,
pay back the store,

and then e-mail the backers,
saying we ran into trouble

and couldn't finish the project.

Great idea, Brian.

Sorry. What time is our meeting, Aah-scar?

Damn it, Griffin, you've become
a liability in this office.

-Why? 'Cause I'm drunk and have a gun?
-No.

-'Cause of the cocaine?
-No.

'Cause I use office petty cash

to have sex with high-end escorts?

No. But your perspiration
has become a serious problem.

I'm afraid you're going
to have to work from home

-All right, if you insist.

Hey, Candy, sorry I couldn't finish

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

My name's Stewie,

I was born
on the wrong side of the tracks.

My father made holes in belts,

and my mother was the Italian guy
on a pizza box.

The old man wanted me to go
into the family business.

MAN: Hey, I don't hear
any holes being holed!

I want to make movies, Pa!

Don't make me beat you

-When?
-Just now.

-Just before the flip.
-Uh, this is ridiculous.

Lois, please.

Now, the way this works is

we simply gather information
and I make up my mind an hour ago.

Peter, please tell us what happened.

I'm sitting there at my desk,

trying to watch porn on sites
you guys haven't figured out yet,

and... she comes in and kisses me.

(CRIES)

Now, Barbara,
the reason you are here at Super HR

is there's been an accusation
of unwanted touching

and an overly sexualized work environment.

That's it.
Peter, no more working from home.

I want you to go back to the office.

Peter, how can the company
make this right?

Bring back Lay's WOW chips with Olestra.

Mr. Griffin, those chips
were recalled in the '90s

for causing explosive diarrhea.

You heard me.

(CRUNCHING) Mmm.

So good.

(STOMACH GURGLING) Uh-oh.

(EXPLOSIVE FART)

All right, boys, get me up to speed.

Brian! Chris!

Stewie, what's the matter?

Our Kickstarter...

What? (STAMMERING)
Did we not hit our goal?

I also want to ask a question
without looking at the screen.

Oh! Oh, we hit it all right.

Whoa.

We actually have to make this thing.

Gentlemen, it's time to start
inappropriately touching actresses

on the casting couch.

Okay, I have been made aware
of the allegations.

Is there anything you can say
on your behalf?

I'm trans?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

I don't have the bandwidth
for this right now.

This is a lot for me to unpack, honestly.

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Well, I'm gonna
have to circle back with Ken

to run it up the flagpole?

Well, at the end of the day,
it is what it is.

to the first official table read

for <i>The Untitled Kickstarter Project.</i>

Chris will be on speakerphone
from down the hall,

and, as a reminder,
that may result in a five-second delay.

So, now to hand it over
to our writer extraordinaire,

-Mr. Brian...
-CHRIS:<i> Hi, everyone!</i>

There's the delay.

Brian Griffin, take it away.

Thank you, Stewie.
And before we get started,

I would like to officially thank Stewie
for spearheading this project,

and I'd like to thank Chris
for his help scouting all the locations.

Now, scene one. We open on a suburban...

CHRIS:<i> Aw, you're welcome, Brian!</i>

<i>Happy to pitch in.</i>

Yeah, speaking of scouting,

you sure got good at scouting
the location of the nearest Burger King.

Okay, scene one.
We open on a suburban home,

where a party is in full swing.

-There is a knock at the...
-(LAUGHS)

<i>I do like Burger King!</i>

...at the door.

The teenage son answers it.

CHRIS:<i> Well,</i>
<i>if it isn't my favorite uncle.</i>

Why-why did we give him the lead part?

Chris, we're having
a little delay issue here,

so try and come in a little sooner, yeah?

CHRIS:<i> Roger that.</i>

Okay. The teenage son
stares at the man in the doorway,

-and they exchange an intense...
<i>-Back so soon, Uncle Cornelius?</i>

Okay, Chris, that was a little too soon.

No, no, Chris, we're pausing for a second.

All right? Okay, okay,
Brian, here's what we're gonna do.

You're going to slap the table
halfway through your line,

and, Chris, when you hear
the slap on your end,

that's when you talk. Everyone got that?

Yes.

<i>Yes.</i>

Okay. Uncle Cornelius
stands in the doorway

in stunned silence...

not knowing what to say
but knowing he should say something.

<i>Well, do you have anything</i>
<i>to say for yourself?</i>

-(SPEAKING SOFTLY) This is working.
-You're damn right I do!

Uncle Cornelius slaps the table in anger

as he walks across
to pour himself a gin and...

<i>I'll return your pearl-handled revolver</i>
<i>one bullet at a time!</i>

Okay, let's just shoot it. It all works.

I just want to thank... everyone
for all their hard work today.

<i>You're welcome!</i>

What the hell?

(LINES RINGING)

Oh, hi, Peter.
Like what I've done with the place?

I'm not sure what you <i>have </i>done.

Well, since you decided to turn
our house into an office,

I decided to make it
into a public work space

for everyone to enjoy.

Principal Shepherd?

Oh, hey, Peter. John Shepherd
of Shepherd Marketing.

(SPEAKING SOFTLY) Eye contact,
firm handshake.

We can put your logo on anything:
a mug, a set of pens, a mug.

I, uh... I don't have a logo.

Funny you should say that,

because our art department
could whip you something up.

Hmm, let's see. Peter, Peter... Penis?

Let's just fire up Windows 98.

You like that, right on the mug?

Uh, n-no. No, thank you.

Lois, what do you think you're doing?

Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about, Peter.

I'm just creating
a nice work environment for you.

For instance,
I also piped in easy listening music

throughout the house.

<i>(ODE TO MY FAMILY</i> VOCALIZING)

<i>Ode to My Family</i> by the Cranberries?

Lois, you know once I hear that,
I can't get it out of my head.

(CHUCKLING) Don't worry.
It's not the whole song.

It's just the...

(SINGING) <i>Doo doo doo doo</i>

...part on repeat.

That's the catchiest part!

Well, you better get to work.
It's already 9:15.

Come on, Peter, focus. You can do this.

<i>Doo doo doo doo, doo...</i>

And... send.

All right, let's see
what Griffin's been up to.

Hmm. I've been saying that
to corporate for years.

I got your mug, Peter. That'll be $59.99.

I got a Square here,

so we can take care
of the transaction in-house.

Geez, seems kind of pricey.

Well, we could bring that down to $29.99,

-but you'd have to buy 4,000 of them.
-(PHONE RINGS)

Fruit Baskets Covered in Cellophane.
How may I help you?

Long, juicy bananas and melon balls.

No, I know you hadn't asked me a question.

I was just thinking about
another part of my day.

-(ALARM RINGS)
-Okay! Fire drill!

Everyone out in the hot sun for an hour,

with no information
as to when we're coming back!

-Damn it, Lois. I can't take this!
-(RINGING STOPS)

Huh. Maybe you'd be better off
working from your office.

But I thought you'd like
having me around the house all day.

I thought so, too, Peter.

But maybe it was too much of a good thing.

You know I love you,
but if this marriage is gonna survive,

I think you need to be gone
for most of it.

I guess you're right.

When you look at it, most marriages
are just a couple hours a night.

I'm sorry I was getting on your nerves,
being home so much.

I'll call Bert and ask him
if I can come back to the office.

Thank you, Peter.

I love you so much.

-I love you, too.
-Mmm.

Hey, I went ahead and ordered
those 4,000 penis mugs for you.

I don't want those.

Well, what am I supposed to do with them?

May I propose a merger?

<i>The secret of my success</i>

<i>Is I'm living...</i>

Wow, we did it. We actually made a movie.

Yeah, I don't want to call this a movie.

We made a film.

We made a film, guys.

And we even had $300,000

Thanks for coming
to our cocktail party, everyone.

We're so glad you could make it.

That's the speech you were working on?

Okay, now let's play a game.

It's called: "Everybody give me an idea
what time you're leaving."

Settle down, Peter.

Hey, is the party good out there?
Can I come out?

No, Brian, you're fine in the kitchen.

Is there food on the floor?
I can clean it up.

-No.
-Come on, Joe just dropped a crack...

-(SCRATCHING ON DOOR)
-Damn it, Brian.

I can't figure out how to open the gate.

Well, since this is a nice cocktail party,
let's talk about books.

What book is everyone reading?

I only read four books in my life,

and three of them were about Johnny Bench.

Aw, I can top that.

I ain't ever read a book
in my entire life.

(ALL GASP)

-Never read a book?
-Peter's never read a book.

Yeah, I heard the first guy.

And you said
this was a fancy cocktail party.

Reginald, we're leaving.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Damn it. I shopped at Trader Joe's

for this fancy cocktail party,
and once again

your ignorance of books has ruined it.

Enough is enough.

I got a junior high book list here,
and starting tomorrow,

you are reading one of these books.

<i>Little Women, Holes, The Giver.</i>

These are all porn categories.
<i>Black Beauty.</i>

Is there anything here
that's not pornography?

<i>1984. </i>Just read <i>1984.</i>

Fine. Geez. I'll read <i>1984.</i>

You better, 'cause this was
more embarrassing

than when we played truth or dare
with present-day Madonna.

Ah... Truth.

Do I look younger than 90?

Dare.

Ah, the public library.

I'm just gonna put my backpack
down for one second.

And it's gone.

My laptop was in there, no password.
My wallet. Everything.

That person is now me.

My entire life went away. (SIGHS)

Hey, how do you find something in here?

It's a lot easier
than finding a man out there.

(LAUGHS)

(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Yeah, maybe wash your hair,

lose the bun, give that a chance.
Anyway, you guys have <i>1984?</i>

We've got it on CD.

"C-D." (LAUGHS)

Sounds like my high school
report card. (LAUGHS)

(LAUGHS) Okay, okay, all right, all right.

Okay, boring book: <i>1984.</i>

I am ready for you to be lame
and a book and not something unexpected.

(VAN HALEN'S <i>"PANAMA"</i> PLAYS)

He left a note.
"If Van Halen calls, tell them they rule."

What?

<i>Panama...</i>

-Did they call?
-Peter, what are you doing?

I did what you wanted.
I went to the library and I got <i>1984.</i>

(CHUCKLES) What a book.

Peter, I'm not okay
with this new Van Halen phase of yours.

Yeah, Dad, it's crazy.

Like JFK deciding
to cruise through Dallas in a rental.

How'd that convertible work out for you?

Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
Good. Okay.

And did you get all your stuff
out of the car?

<i>From the heat coming off of it</i>

It's totally unjumpable.

No way.

I didn't want to play this card,
Peter, but...

I mean, he's not responding
to my advances,

so it's either a coma,
or he's a frigid bitch.

We'll leave you with him now.

-Do you love your husband?
-Yes.

Mrs. Griffin, I have some bad news.

Your husband is brain-dead.

I'm afraid it's time for you
to make your choice.

What? Are you telling me
I should pull the plug?

I'm afraid so.

Also, you might be getting a call

about the service you received here today.

Do you feel I've earned all tens?

Oh, God, I... I don't know.

I can't get anything less than a ten,

so if there's a problem,

you should tell me about it right now.

I may have to pull the plug on my husband.

to off me in my sleep.

We said we're sorry, all right?

We're sorry we pulled the plug!

-But you know what? It was a relief.
-What?

There. I said it. You know what

The thought of losing you
was such a burden.

So when the moment came, I confess.

I... I felt free, and I did it.

I pulled the plug.

And then I instantly regretted it.

And when you woke up, I was overjoyed.

I'm so sorry, and if there's any way

I can make it up to you, I will.
I promise.

We all will.

Damn right you're gonna make it up to me.

Family, you know how you said you're sorry

-and you'll do anything I want?
-Yeah.

Well, this is Timothy Olyphant.

I want you to line up
and give him one compliment

about his Netflix show,
the <i>Santa Clarita Diet.</i>

-Aw, really?
-And it has to sound legit.

Like you've actually watched it.

Peter, you ask too much.

Hey, you tried to kill me.
This is the logical consequence.

Uh, Mr. Olyphant,

I think you were awesome in <i>Deadwood.</i>

No, no, that's not what I said.

The comments have to exclusively relate
to the <i>Santa Clarita Diet,</i>

a show which aired
three full seasons on Netflix.

I will take the first compliment
off the table.

I like your hair.

Well, now I have nothing.

-Come on, kids, we're leaving.
-What?

It's over. You'll never forgive us

for killing you at the hospital,
so we're done.

We're leaving town today.

You... You're leaving?

You'll never hear from us again.

It'll be like we died.

Come on, kids.

No, don't take the kids.

Please. No.
Whatever will I do without them?

Banana pancake, you, too?

You're leaving forever?

I'm actually going to Hedo for Pancakes.

Oh, yeah. The ripping and the tearing.

Oh, Peter, what made you change your mind?

I just... I've been thinking.

Okay, so you tried to kill me.

But maybe that's what a family is,
you know?

A bunch of people
who try to kill each other.

I don't think that's what a family is.

Eh, it is, kind of.

Anyway, you're my family, and I love you.

And if I got to have my plug
pulled by somebody,

I want it to be you.

And you're the only people
whose plug I want to pull.

Will you come back?

Yes, Peter. Yes.

You know, it's weird that didn't
happen on the pier all day.

How did this happen?

She got in a car wreck,
and was burned beyond recognition,

and I leveled up on <i>Fortnite</i> this weekend,

but you probably only care
about the first two things.

Oh, dear God, no! (CRIES)

All we found was Meg's
driver's license at the scene.

It had her Quiznos punch card
stuck to the back.

Your little angel
was one stamp away from a free sub,

which only adds to this horrific tragedy.

It's actually pretty impressive,

because the card
was only issued three days ago.

Usually one of the guys would
swipe a thing like this,

use it on the way home,
but I snagged it for ya.

Thought Meg's family ought to be the ones
to enjoy the free sandwich.

Again, I'm very sorry.

Good morning, students.

We are gathered here
for two reasons today.

One, to mourn the loss of Meg Griffin.

And two, to find the owner
of this X-Men water bottle

someone left in wood shop.
Does anyone recognize it?

BOY: I'll take it!

That's not what I asked. Anyone?

I'm not gonna tell you
which character's on it,

you have to be able
to tell me the character.

BOY 2: Wolverine!

-Are you guessing?
-Am I right?

All right, we'll handle this after.

But now, here to help you mourn,
an artist who specializes

in sensitive music to do finger stuff to,

Mr. John Mayer!

It's good to be here. I love high school!

GIRL: Who are you?

I was born in 2003!

Then I'm probably your father.

Ooh, pwned!

Whoa, looks like the school
really is missing Meg.

Chris, Brian, would you help Peter?

He's one of those "has to be supported

by both elbows" mourners.

I'm gonna need three seats
for my elbow supporters.

Stewie, you look depressed.

You still upset about Meg?

No, it's just this gym is sad.

If you haven't won a championship
since 1982,

just take the banner down.

Well, Meg,

looks like you really are dead this time.

They say your life flashes
before your eyes when you die.

I wonder what I'll see.

(GROANS)

Oh, yeah!

-Over!
-(GRUNTS)

I'm a tomato.

(ALL RETCHING)

MEG:<i> I'm not in any of these!</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. Conway Twitty.

Oh, come on!

I was in the <i>Kingsman </i>fight!

That could've been in there.

I can do stuff.

I... I can be a part of a comedy team!

Look, hey, Chris, who's on first?

A baseball player. (LAUGHS)

Well, that's it.

I'm gonna show them.

I'm gonna live.

I'm getting out of here.

Now let's see, if I whap my forehead

against this cement floor enough times,

I think I can create a blood luge

to slide myself out on.

This... This can be
in the highlight video!

-(STRUMS)
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Wow, thank you, John Mayer.

Wasn't he terrific?

I think we can all agree
that John is entitled

to take whichever student
he wishes home with him tonight.

(SCATTERED CLAPPING)

And finally, the Quiznos

across the street has graciously

taken out a full page ad in the yearbook

that will feature
a dedication page to Meg.

This calls for a celebration.

All right, everyone throw confetti

and ruin the janitor's weekend.

Hey, I'm not gonna make it this weekend.

Oh, but you're gonna miss
the big janitor dance!

This is our last chance to get
laid before Janitor College!

You think I don't know that?

No! Chris kidnapped me
so he could stay popular!

What? Chris would never do that.

Chris?

It's true, Mom.

I owe my sister an apology.

I shouldn't have treated her
the way I did.

And I think if Meg were here today,

she'd be the first one to agree.

I am here!

I'm right here!

Anyway, Meg, wherever you are, I'm sorry.

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

Damn it, I'm giving a speech!
I want to tell you...

Oh, my God, Meg, I'm so glad you're back.

Yeah, Meg, I'm just really glad
this whole ordeal is over.

STEWIE: (OVER RADIO)

<i>-Over.</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Come on!

I'm sorry I faked my own death, Mom.

It's okay, Meg.

Actually, I should've known.

Faking stuff is part of being a woman.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

Women fake a lot of things.

You faked your death,
I fake orgasms and being

impressed by my husband's
accomplishments at work.

Hey, Lois, guess who got to erase

the white board in a meeting today?

Oh, my!

I think someone's earned himself

Mama Lois' famous egg salad, huh?

Oh, yum!

Oh, today just keeps
getting better and better!

Dad, I thought you hated Mom's egg salad.

Chris, part of being a man
is faking things.

Like orgasms or pretending
to like your wife's egg salad.

And anyway, I give it to that
raccoon outside who likes me.

I thought you hated that guy.

Part of being a raccoon is faking things.

You know, I gave them water, the sun,
a clear road map to hating gays.

So, uh, you want to name more stuff?

Ugh, that's all we ever do.

Yeah, and there's still
six billion things left to name.

Okay, I'll start. That green, leafy thing,
that's a Casey.

That thing
flying through the sky there, Casey.

You can't name everything Casey.

All right, fine, Eve.

What's the word for that thing
flying through the sky?

-I don't know. Uh, bird.
-Oh, bird?

-Bird is the word?
-Bird?

-Bird.
-Bird?

Bird. Bird is the word.

Peter, cut it out.

You know, charades are a thing people do.

Anyone mind if I open
fragrant Doritos in a tiny room?

-Aw...
-Oh! Oh!

Ugh. It smells like horse crap.
What flavor is it?

Cattle Ranch Doritos.

Relax, Lois.
<i>Family Guy </i>has long been sponsored

by Axe body spray. Axe?

There. Now we all smell like
a nightmare Tinder date.

Okay, you two,
I'm going away for the weekend.

My girlfriend got a piece in an art show,
and I'd look like a dick if I didn't go.

It's a pot that no one's allowed to use.

Don't even suggest putting keys in it.

Did everyone who submitted
to the art show get in?

Yes. But again, don't want to be a dick.

So, if you're looking for me this weekend,
I'll be nibbling terrible cheese cubes

with Santa Fe people
who couldn't cut it in the real world.

-Are any of them named Melody?
-They're all named Melody!

-(CAR HORN HONKS)
-Coming!

Well, I got to go get yelled at
for being late to something

I didn't want to go to in the first place.

All right, before I go, I got two rules.

No putting your penis in the gopher holes,
and no apples.

You can trust us. Ow!

That went well.

(LAUGHS) Oh, my God, that's so funny.

'Cause it didn't go well.

(CHITTERING)

-Adam, would you like a pear?
-Apple.

-Orange?
-Apple.

-Grape?
-Apple.

-Peach?
-Apple.

-Nectarine?
-Casey.

-Cantaloupe?
-Apple.

-Honeydew?
-Apple.

-Clementine?
-Apple.

Hey, you guys looking for some apples?

You know, I could go for an apple.

No. Adam, remember what God said.

About his nightmare girlfriend's art show?

'Cause that's all I remember
about that poor guy.

No. He said if we eat the apple
we're kicked out of paradise.

-They have antioxidants.
-They do?

Why would I lie? I'm a snake in a tree.

I have nothing to gain from lying to you,

aside from the minor sexual thrill
of watching someone eat something,

and... and that's minor.

Okay, I'm gonna do it.

Okay, good. Now, Adam can't be here.

Eat it with your feet
and look at me while you do it.

(RECORD SKIPPING)

-What the hell happened here?
-(RECORD NEEDLE SCRATCHES)

Uh, it's not our fault.

You created the most tempting thing
man has ever known, a piece of fruit.

That's it.
You two are kicked out of paradise.

Unless you want to buy a nice pot.

Can I put my keys in it?

-No.
-Fine, we'll leave.

But where will we live?

The opposite of Eden.

Well, Florida, time to fit in.

Let's go have sex with gum in our mouths.

Then what happened?

-They populated the Earth.
-How?

-They had kids.
-Okay, but then, what did they do?

They had kids, too.

-With who?
-They were fruitful.

-With who?
-Well, the girls

with either their brothers
or their fathers,

and the boys with either
their sisters or their mothers.

That's disgusting.

No, Meg, that's the Bible.

Are we just gonna
let that guy in the parking lot

keep screaming at his girlfriend?

Peter, get away from the window.

Shh, shh, shh. If we're quiet,
you can hear every fifth word.

MAN: (YELLING)
Always... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)...

my friends... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)...

Michelob Ultra!

All right, back to the Bible.

And, again, you'll let me know
if another older,

heavyset woman wanders by
in nothing but a T-shirt.

Why did we choose this motel?

This is any motel.

Now, here's a story
about a bunch of animals

who went on a cruise.

GOD: Noah.

I want you to build an ark.

Right.

-What's an ark?
-A large ship.

Forty cubits by eighty cubits
by forty cubits.

Right.

What's a cubit?

Wait a minute, are...
Are you just doing Bill Cosby bits?

Yeah, why not?
All of his stuff is up for grabs.

What's he gonna do, sue us?

Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

"Noah was feeding his children
chocolate cake for breakfast."

BOTH: (IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Dad is great! Give us chocolate cake!

Dad is great! Give us chocolate cake.

Terrific. Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're done stealing from "Dr." Cosby.

Now it's time to get ready for school.

There's no school today.
There was another mass stoning.

Ugh, another school stoning.

When will we learn?

If only those teachers had stones,
then they could stone back.

Hello? Stone control.

Shem, stones don't kill people.
People kill people. With stones.

I don't think the Founding Fathers
ever envisioned stones this large.

Can we not politicize the stoning?

All right? Thoughts and prayers.

Thoughts and prayers for the bashed.

Oh, hey, honey, two things.

I stopped taking my lithium
and I'm building an ark for God.

Those things seem related.

They're not related.

-They're fighting again.
-Shh.

If you're quiet,
you can hear every fifth word.

(NOAH SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

Always... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)...

never... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)...

my animals... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)...

Michelob Ultra!

PETER: <i>"To build the ark,</i>
<i>Noah stole the wood</i>

<i>"from the front of his neighbor's house."</i>

No, no, no, no, Noah!

PETER: <i>"And the animals came, two by two,</i>

<i>"and were given poorly-assigned rooms."</i>

All right, uh, lions,
you'll be with the baby antelopes.

Uh, crocodiles, you're with
the water-crossing wildebeests.

Uh, bats, you'll be with bugs.

Seagulls, McDonald's wrappers.

Pit bulls and city babies.

And Christian Bale and annoying cameramen.

Hey, Christian, looks like
I'm rooming with you.

Oh, good for you!

-PETER: <i>"Soon, the Great Flood came...</i>
-(ALL SCREAMING)

<i>"...and the ark set sail.</i>

<i>"Then, like every father on a boat,</i>

<i>"Noah quickly became</i>
<i>a total dick to his family."</i>

Is that a half-hitch knot?

Uh... yeah.

Well, if it's a half-hitch,
it's not gonna hold.

It's got to be a reef knot.
You call yourself a sailor?

I don't know.

Can I talk to you portside?

Why are you heading starboard?
I said portside.

(LAUGHS) I don't...
I don't understand what's happening.

I really don't. Why... Why would
you go starboard if I said portside?

Look, why don't I tie the knots,
you polish the teak. Can you do that?

Wait, you're gonna polish the teak
on the windward side?

I can't... Is this...
Is this guy for real?

It's gonna make a mess.
You have to do it on the leeward side.

-Sorry.
-Okay, never mind. Just take a break.

All right? I left a <i>Penthouse </i>magazine
for you in the aft cabin.

Oh, suddenly he's Popeye.

Okay, guys, now remember
to use the right bathrooms.

All right, you're either pellets or piles.

Excuse me, what about green smooshies?

Oi, yeah, wombat here.

What if my poop is a perfect cube?

It's a real thing you can google,
it's really quite remarkable.

(ANIMALS GRUNTING)

Okay, God, we're doing it.

GOD: Good.
And you brought all the animals?

-Yup.
-GOD: Lions?

-Yup.
-GOD: Tigers?

-Yup.
-GOD: Spiders?

Mm-hmm.

GOD: Wait, why...
why'd you say it like that?

-Did you not bring spiders?
-I don't like spiders.

And... And technically,
they're not animals, they're arachnids.

-GOD: Don't do that.
-Do what?

GOD: You know what I meant.

Snakes?

-Oh, come on!
-I... I got a lot of stuff.

BOTH: Thirty-nine days later...

I'm sorry I threw
the <i>Monopoly </i>board overboard

on the third day.

I was mad I couldn't be the hat.

Well, at least we still have
<i>The Game of Life.</i>

I'm the blue car.

Um, I'm... I'm already the blue car.

(GRUNTS)

Sorry I threw <i>The Game of Life </i>overboard.

All right, let's play <i>Risk</i>
until it's clear I can't win.

Look. A bird on the horizon.

(SCREECHES)

(YELPS) Giant Bible bird!

-(PETER YELPS)
-(MEG SCREAMS)

Somebody throw away
the balled-up underwear in my room.

Don't look at it.

Just throw it away.

Ah, look. Land.

Pale-Israel-stein.

Now let's divide it into banks and strips,
as one normally does with land.

"Shem and Ham married their mom,

"while she and Noah
remained the best of friends.

"Noah even danced with Ham
at his second marriage to his daughter.

"Shem and Ham had twins
named Phlegm and Yam,

"who married each other and gave birth
to Noah's next daughter-wife."

And that's the story of the Great Flood.

Now God only brings natural disasters

to places that have
too much butt stuff going on.

CHRIS: <i>God, if you stop this rain,</i>
<i>I promise I'll never do butt stuff.</i>

PETER: <i>God, if you stop this rain,</i>
<i>I'll never do butt stuff again.</i>

STEWIE: <i>Let it pour.</i>

This is fun. Read us something else, Dad.

You got it, Chris.

How about this laminated
motel information sheet?

"Checkout is noon. Must dial nine
to reach outside prostitute.

"In the event of fire,

"follow the older heavyset lady
in just a T-shirt.

"There are no dining facilities on-site,

"but guests are encouraged
to visit the Applebee's,

which is a short walk
across the six-lane highway."

Well, we might have to brave that walk.
I'm starving.

Oh, God, I made eye contact
with someone looking for shelter.

CLEVELAND: Guys? Guys?

Lot of street signs
whipping around out here.

I had a umbrella,
but, as this is a comedy,

you can imagine what happened to it.

Let's see what's in the mini-fridge.

There's nothing in here to eat
but crackers and screw-top wine.

-Who buys a comb out of a mini-fridge?
-CLEVELAND: Guys?

Crackers and wine?

You know, that actually reminds me
of another Bible story, The Last Supper.

"It was the week before Easter,

<i>"and Jesus and Mary Magdalene</i>
<i>were dyeing eggs</i>

<i>"with that cheap messy coloring kit</i>
<i>from the drugstore</i>

<i>"that has those weird paper things</i>
<i>that are like costumes for the eggs</i>

<i>"but never really fit around the eggs..."</i>

Hey. Hey, Mary.

The half-orange, half-red one is mine,
so don't eat it.

I wanna have it for when we watch
<i>The Sound of Music</i> on Sunday.

We don't have to wait till Sunday.
We can eat these eggs tonight.

Oh. Sorry, I got that big supper
with the guys tonight.

But tomorrow's Friday, date night.

You and me.
Nothing's keepin' me from that.

Somebody'd have to nail me
to a piece of wood

and throw me in a cave grave.

You're having supper with your disciples?

What's the big occasion?

Ah, we're drafting teams
for our fantasy football league.

And if one guy isn't there,
it screws it all up for everybody.

Like last time,
Paul was on his speaker phone,

and we were like, "Paul, you're up,"

and he'd be like, "I'm what?"
And we'd say, "You're up."

And he'd be like
"Oh, okay, uh, um, Randy Moss."

And we'd say, "Thomas picked Randy Moss.
He's off the board."

And he'd say, "What?"
It just... it just really sucked.

Well, I guess if your friends
are expecting you,

-you have to go.
-Right?

Okay, I'll see you.

Are you sure you don't want to change?

That's the same robe
you wore to the leper colony.

I don't know,
maybe throw it in the dryer, at least?

Don't take this the wrong way,

but I'm not taking advice
about germs from a whore.

Mr. Pilate, I'm here to file a complaint.

It's Passover, and somebody tricked me
into eating leavened bread.

Look, I'm from Rome.
If it isn't spaghetti,

I don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Now get out of here.

Grace. Grace, am I done? Can I go home?

Oh, not yet.

You still have that meeting
with that Judas Iscariot

regarding that Jesus fella.

Ugh, right, Jesus.

Man, that guy's a pain in the ass.

Oh, well, he's very popular.

The lepers, the Canaanites, the fishermen,
the Philippians, that woman at the well,

oh, they all love him.

They think he's a righteous dude.

Wasn't that cool? That was really her.

Edie McClurg. Thanks, Edie.

Hey, man, what's the buzz?

Tell me what's a-happening.

What are you, high? What the hell is that?

Listen, I got 30 pieces of silver
if you narc on your friend Jesus.

Oh, I don't know.
Seems like kind of a slimy thing to do.

I will also throw in
two dirty tennis balls.

Well, lead with that, man.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah!

Okay, we're all gonna be at
the Jerusalem El Torito at 5:15.

5:15?

Yeah, it's a very big group.
It was either that or 10:45.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

-Did it go off yet?
-No. Stop asking me.

I thought we had a reservation.

So did I. So did I.

I just went to the bathroom.
The whole patio's open.

Yeah, but are there heating lamps?

'Cause I can hear Simon already...
"Beep. Beep-boop.

"Beep-boop-beep. Ba..."

We get it, it's cold.

-Christ?
-Oh, yes, that's us.

Ed Christ?

Uh, no, no, Jesus Christ.

I'm Ed Christ.

Great. Is your whole party here?

Almost. My wife Stephanie is out pooping
on some hay, but she is here.

How's this?

All right, that's great.

Hey, guys, I want to have fun
with the seating.

Let's do it boy, boy... boy, boy...

boy, boy... boy, boy.

And let's all sit
on the same side of the table.

Can I start you folks off
with anything to drink?

Yes, we'll all be splitting
one cup of wine.

And can we have some bread
and no other food at all?

Wow. Let me guess, you're Jewish.

Yes, although my first name
is oddly Puerto Rican.

Friends, followers,

there's something important
we must discuss.

Remember the Pizza Hut Bigfoot Pizza
from the '90s?

That thing was huge.
I mean, it... It was, like, this big.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

(SIGHS) Your photos will be available
in the lobby when your meal is over.

Uh, Okay. Uh, thank you. Thank you.

Sorry about that, I was
kind of right in the middle of my thing.

Anyway, there's something else
you should know.

Before the night is over,
one of you will betray me.

This is some bullcrap.

I'm the only one who's the color
we're supposed to be in this thing.

Yeah, let's not be so quick to judge here.

-We're better than tha...
-Quiet down, Judas.

There's a Judas among us.

And it's Luke.

Oh, good, I thought I was too late.

-Mm...
-Wait, what... Hey! What are you doing?

Kissing you, like in the plan.

The old "Judas Kiss."

No, it's Jesus who gets the kiss.

And did you... Did you close your eyes?

Oh, so I kiss Jesus, then?

-No, I do.
-Well, who do I kiss?

All right, I'm not leaving here
until I kiss a guy.

It's the only reason I joined the army.

Okay, good, here's the bread.

Now, everybody listen up.

Take this, and eat it.

It's supposed to be, like, my body.

-Ew. What part?
-I'm not gonna say what part,

but you're supposed
to eat it while kneeling.

(CHUCKLES) All right, now it's a party.

Okay, now pass this wine around.

You're never gonna believe
what this is supposed to be.

We got to spend time as a family

You're right. And look, somebody
bookmarked another page for us.

This part always speaks to me.

I can't stand
to hear Italians talk, but...

man, get 'em singing.

Stewie, how can you afford
an entire opera in your room?

Oh, boy, Brian's upset
because someone has something he doesn't.

You know what I'm getting you
for your birthday?

The ability to be happy for other people.

You're not answering my question.

Brian, I'd love to stay and talk,
but Bugs Bunny is about to make this tenor

hold a note for far longer
than anyone should.

Ain't he a stinker?

(CRYING)

Keith? Keith, what's the matter?

It's Chris, you idiot.

Mary, what happened?

Principal Shepherd fat-shamed Chris
in front of the whole school.

-Oh, no.
-Just stay the course, Lois.

That fat is gonna win him
Biggest Boy at the state fair.

-Peter, this is very serious.
-So is Biggest Boy.

School should be a safe place
where they get shot sometimes.

They should not be insulted.

Peter, are you even listening to me?

-Yeah!
-MAN: Give us a strut downstage!

<i>Well, he's</i>

<i>A big, big boy, he's the Biggest Boy</i>

<i>He's a big, big boy,</i>
<i>He's the Biggest Boy</i>

<i>He's a big, big boy,</i>
<i>He's</i><i>the Biggest Boy</i>

<i>He's a big, big boy,</i>
<i>he's the Biggest Boy...</i>

So we're all decided--
our last high school play

was about as gay as we want to go.

Let's try to top out at that level of gay.

If there's nothing else...

There's still the agenda item
of you fat-shaming Chris Griffin.

I think we can table that,

-as long as it's a pretty strong table.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but fat-shaming is not okay.

This is the year 2020 and nothing is okay.
This is the year of instant outrage.

-What?!
-This is my son we're talking about.

Sure, more than once I've caught him
eating Crisco with a spoon,

but I can't watch everything he eats.

-That's all I'd be doing.
-(LAUGHTER)

And deep down,
he's just like everyone else...

all together in one big pair of pants.

(CHUCKLES) His-his sister Meg's pants.

(LAUGHS) Oh! Pow!
Lois, did you try this stuff out of town?

-It's killing.
-Yeah.

I'm funny.

In any case, Principal Shepherd
needs to be held accountable

for fat-shaming my son.

No matter how fat or shameful he may be.

If your son had been shot,
all I could offer

is thoughts and prayers, but this calls
for a far stronger response.

Shepherd, you're fired.

Oh, yeah? Well, now that I'm fired,

I can finally tell you all
how I really feel about you!

You're like family to me.

Alexa? Play the sad song from <i>Stripes.</i>

("DEPRESSION" BY ELMER BERNSTEIN PLAYS)

-MAN: Hey!
-WOMAN: We're still in here!

Uh, excuse me. I saw a commercial

in which a dog had a very shiny coat.

The dog was, uh, jumping over a fence.
Maybe on a farm or something?

Again, his coat was very shiny.

Yeah, I, um,

hate this job?

So... I don't know?

Oh, my gosh, wow!

-This is so exciting.
-Excuse me?

It's really you.

We recognize you from your book.

Ah, you've read
<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love.</i>

Be careful with that thing.

It might accidentally change your life.

Oh, (BLEEP)!

I don't know that book.

I'm talking about this one.

<i>Flunky The Dumb White Dog?</i>

By Griffin Stewart?

My catchphrase is "Herf derf"?

Hey, do you know where I could
find any books about, um...

"the pan-crease"?

Thanks for taking me to the movies, Peter.

Aw, sure, Lois.
You know, when you said "Miles Teller,"

I was like, "Eh."

But then once you get here,
you realize you can sit anywhere.

PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD: Hello, Griffins.

Principal Shepherd?

That's right.
And it's just "Firstname Shepherd,"

now that you've had me fired
and I have no income.

And now I'm living in my car,

just panhandling
outside Miles Teller movies,

which is pretty slim pickings, obviously.

Lois, can I talk to you
one step over this way,

yet magically out of earshot from him?

We can't let this stand.
We have to do something for him.

What are we supposed to do?
He brought this on himself.

-(ARGUING INAUDIBLE)
-(PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD HUMMING A TUNE)

All right, Peter, he can live with us
until he gets back on his feet.

You made a full and convincing case.

Ya...

...ay! You can live with us.

Wow, that's great news.

-(PHONE WHOOSHES)
-(PHONE CHIMES)

Uh, what's your, um,

ferret policy?

Huh, wow, Lois,
if he's asking about it, too,

I guess we should finally get one.

Peter, we're not getting a ferret.

-(PHONE WHOOSHES)
-(PHONE CHIMES)

Also, would it make any sense
to put all the beds in one room

and make one room a trampoline room?

Oh, well, now, that's interesting.

Well, here we are.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I don't know how to thank you.

Aw, don't worry about it.
Make yourself at home.

The Wi-Fi is "Joe Swanson Guest."

Chris? There's someone here

who's got somethin' to say to you.

I've never seen this man
before in my life.

Principal Shepherd?
What are you doing here?

Chris, I fat-shamed you,

and I believe I owe you
a weaselly political apology.

So, if you took offense
to anything I said,

I certainly regret that you did that.

At this point,
I consider the matter closed.

Thank you so much, Principal Shepherd.

I know that was very difficult for you.

Well, I accept your apology, Chris.

Onward and upward.

Now, I believe you have some
masturbating to do, young man?

I already did it.

-Chris?
-I mean...

I was about to.

Attaboy. (CHUCKLES)

(CHUCKLES) Oh, he's a good boy.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, he is.

(IMITATING LAWNMOWER WHIRRING)

This is real, 'cause
I'm making the motor noise.

(IMITATING LAWNMOWER WHIRRING)

Hey there, Stewie.

Finally cutting that grass, I see.

(LAUGHS)
Well, if someone had returned my mower

when they said they were going to,

I would have done it weeks ago.

Whoa, I see the mower
isn't the only thing running hot.

But speaking of--
I, uh, need to borrow a shovel.

-I'm digging a hole.
-A hole?

-Where are you going-- China?
-That's the hope.

All right, well,
I'll be checking your Instagram.

Whoa! Careful!

That's how God makes angels.

Well, I guess I know
where you got all that money.

You wrote a whole children's
book series about me.

And you made me look like a total idiot.

Look, you got to call the publisher

-and have these books recalled.
-Not a chance, Brian.

All I'm doing is presenting you
honestly to the public.

Just like I did to the witches in Salem.

Who but a witch would not
give up her virtue to a man

who brought her a luncheon
of salt pork and boiled sweets?

But, Your Honor,
I tried to give up my virtue.

I begged him to take me then and there.

Yeah, okay, okay, n-nobody
believes that tall tale.

And he would have none of it.

I offered him posterior intimacy.

Okay, let's just... e-everyone calm down.

The court reporter will still his quill.

On hands and knees I begged him.

He said he had an early appointment.

Witch! Witch! Press her between stones!

at your aptitude assessment.

Uh, we think you would be more comfortable

eating in the special breakfast unit.

-(SHRIEKING)
-(THUDDING)

It sounds like chaos in there.

Don't worry, Miss Judy
will take care of you.

She doesn't have her teaching degree,
but she is abnormally strong.

(SHRIEKING)

Why can't I just eat with my family?

We're trying to get you ready
to eat with your family.

PETER: Hey, you must be Miss Judy.

-(SMACKS)
-Ow, that's my wrist!

That's my wrist, Miss Judy! Ow!

Attention, Griffins.

Someone drew a penis on my car.

-Peter, I'm looking at you.
-Couldn't have been me.

I don't even know what penises
look like 'cause I'm not gay.

-Never even seen one.
-You don't have a penis?

I do, I just don't look at it
'cause I'm not gay.

Now, if it was a vagina,
I'd say you have your man.

Seen a ton of those. Seen three of those.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, three? Deets, Dad.

-Okay, your mom.
-Nice.

-Your sister, when she was born.
-Getting colder.

And my aunt.
She fell out of the casket at her funeral

and her dress came up.

Did you know they pack cotton
in corpses' noses,

rectums and vaginas to prevent
embalming fluid from leaking?

Anyway, I gave the eulogy
at the church and I talked about it.

It was all ad-libbed.

Now that preacher won't even
make eye contact with me

at the grocery store.

I don't know why that bothers me,
but it does.

What were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, your car got donged.

Yeah, I did it. It was me.

Okay, who do I make this out to?

Actually, could you use a Sharpie?

No, my-my mom says I can't use Sharpies.

They're permanent.

Stewart Griffin?

I represent Brian Griffin,
who is suing you for defamation.

That's right, I lawyered up,
you little bitch.

Sorry I'm late, I was just...

Ah, ah, ah. <i>En français, </i>Monsieur Griffin.

All right, never mind that.

Just join me one step over here,

so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.

Aah!

Aah! That's it!

Wait a minute.
He doesn't have his stuff down here.

That's right.

Until you all have better attitudes,
you're in detention.

-Detention?

He-he put us in detention
in our own house?

-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

We-we... Uh, o-okay,
we're gonna deal with that thing

and then we're gonna deal with detention.

How long is Principal Shepherd
gonna keep us in detention down here?

Oh, you got a big date? Is that it?

Got to get out of here for a big date?

-Is that what you're saying?
-Hey, bite my butt, Mom.

At least I'm not
a withered old slut like you are.

-Oh, just kiss and get it over with.
-Guys, guys, guys.

It's natural that we'd be at
each other's throats, all right?

We've been down here for three minutes.

The question is how are we gonna get out?

All right, we're playing.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Meg, Meg, Meg!

-(GUN CLICKS)
-All right, who's next?

Mr. Griffin, you may proceed.

Thank you, Your Honor. In my case to prove

that Brian Griffin is, in fact,
an idiot, and therefore

cannot be defamed,

I call Brian Griffin to the stand.

Now, Mr. Griffin,
you claim that you are not dumb.

If that is true,
please tell me the difference

between Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg.

Objection.
No one could possibly know that.

Objection sustained.

-You're on thin ice, Counselor.
-Very well.

Now, Mr. Griffin,
I'm going to recite a biography

and I'd like you
to maintain your composure.

"On December 1, 1951,

-Treat Williams was born..."
-Treat? W-Where? Where?

-Where's the treat?
-Thank you.

I will now read the entry
for Christopher Walken.

Walk? Go for a walk?

This dog... is dumb.

No further questions, Your Honor.

At this point, I will turn things over
to Brian's lawyer,

the gentleman from
Table, Knee, Bump and Associates.

Thank you, Your Ho... Aah! Son of a dick!

Aah! Aw, crap.

-Right on the bone. Ow!
-Do you wish to proceed?

Huh? No!

Sucks being in detention. I feel like
we're in <i>The Breakfast Club </i>or something.

I don't know, maybe we can take this time

-to learn more about each other.
-Sorry, Lois, we can't.

We got to <i>Breakfast Club </i>dance

Now we have this unearned closeness.

Don't you see? This must have been why
Principal Shepherd locked us down here.

We've never sat down and talked like this.

Principal Shepherd

I'm totally reenergized.

Well, congrats, Stewie.

You made me look like a fool up there.

I mean, I can't believe
you'd do this to me.

I'll never forgive you.

Who are you kidding, Brian? You're a dog.

I'm gonna walk out that door, come back in
and you'll just be excited to see me.

Hey! Hey! You're back!

Well, I guess that's it.
Let's get out of here.

-No, Peter, the other thing.
-Oh, right.

My name is Peter Griffin,
and I get to the "in conclusion" part

of my speech faster than most people.

In conclusion, I think the school
should rehire Principal Shepherd.

(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

Mr. Griffin, you make
a brisk and compelling case.

I hereby reinstate Principal Shepherd.

Yes! I love you, baby.

Sorry, Lois, I needed you out of the way
so I could kiss this lady.

It's good to be back.

Wait, who drew this dong on my desk?

Not me.
I wouldn't even know how to draw one.

I've only seen two:
mine and my uncle's at his funeral.

He died with my aunt in a car crash.

Remember her, from earlier,
with the vagina?

My uncle didn't
fall out of the casket, though.

I stayed late and unbuckled his trousers.

What were we talking about?

Oh, yeah, your desk got donged.
Yeah, I did it. It was me.

Well, Brian, thanks for being a good sport

-about the Flunky books.
<i>-No problemo, </i>Stewie.

Aw, I wish you hadn't done that.

If anything, you gave me a good
chance for some self-reflection.

Fact is, you inspired me to get
back to doing some writing.

Wow, it's really you.

Oh, thanks, but I no longer
write the Flunky books.

No, not that book.

This one.

<i>Swishy the Football Baby?</i>

"By Griffin Brian"?

Can you say one of your catchphrases,
like, "Hey, sailor," or "Up for brunch?"

Ooh! How about "I'm a bottom"?

Brian!

-So?
-I'm sorry.

-It's not really our brand.
-I see.

Well, what about <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>
erotic fan fiction?

Now, that is interesting.

Read it to me while I eat my soup.

"Ferb was having a throbby morning.

"Phineas was having none of it."

God, the Clam sucks on Saturday mornings.

It's all just weird foreign sports fans,

like those Pakistani cricket hooligans.

If you are not rooting for Lahore,

please you may leave, I can tell you!

Lahore cricketers are the best,

and the others are <i>not </i>the best,
dear friends.

I'm for Karachi,
but I don't got a death wish about it.

Guys, what's wrong with us?

It's Saturday morning,
and we're drinking in a bar.

We should be drinking
at the Goodwill donation dumpster.

-Why come?
-'Cause right now's when
all the yard sales end.

We can get first pick
of the abandoned leftovers.

That's a stupid idea.
There's not gonna

be anything good in that dumpster.

PETER: What if I told you
everything I'm wearing right now

I found in that dumpster?

Is that a bachelorette sash?

Scott said I could do hand stuff
this weekend, but that's it.

I told you this is stupid.

There's nothing good in here.

Hey, look-- a pair of working legs.

Dibs on these.

Wha...? Aw, come on, Quagmire!

Joe, I said dibs.

No, no, you're right.
You said dibs.

Whoa. Check it out.
A Sorry! board game.

Let me see it.

-Three pieces missing.

I can shake anything
and figure out what all's in there.

This'll be good for when
I never want to sleep again.

Holy crap.

Wha-What? What is it?

A Magic 8 Ball!

This thing can tell the future.

No, it can't, Peter.
It's just a stupid toy.

I don't know. Let's test it.

Will there be snow this Christmas?

(gasps)
Oh, my God, the ball is right.

I <i>should </i>ask again later.

How did it know that?

Guys, from now on, I am living my life

according to the Magic 8 Ball.

It will lead me like the shorebird

that led the first Pilgrims to Boston.

Ahoy!
Are you looking to build a city

where sports fans
can be notoriously racist?

Yeah, and can we also ruin
"Sweet Caroline"

-for everyone else?
-Absolutely.

Can our airport security people
be responsible for 9/11?

And can our own 9/11 be, like,
one one-thousandth as bad,

but we'll still make
a fricking movie about it?

I think I know just the place.

Okay, I don't know
if this is gonna be a problem,

but we forgot to bring the letter "R."

No problem at all.

Right this way, large-faced whites!

that Kim Kardashian hasn't played with.

Why is it filled with the blue
liquid from tampon commercials?

That's a very gross question, Meg.

You may take your breakfast in the attic.

That question aside,
I'm having a blast with my new 8 Ball.

It knows everything. Watch.

would you do that, too?

Did it?

No, I'm just using that

No. No!

Hey, Stewie said his first word.

And it was a swear.

Well, this is unacceptable.

We have to leave right now
and go straight to breakfast.

Unbelievable.

(car door opens, closes)

(engine starts)

Let's go!

I can't believe Stewie
finally said his first word

and it ends up being... that.

Right now, every woman
in my mommy wine group is judging me.

I may have to start drinking wine
at home alone.

-Start?
-Not the day for it, Chris! Not the day!

I don't get it, Stewie.
You've been talking forever.

Why did everyone
suddenly understand you now?

I don't know.

I was feeling so much
intense emotion in the moment,

and that one word somehow
just burst through.

Yeah, but now what?
Everyone can understand you?

I don't think so.

Not unless I'm yelling something
I feel strongly about.

Greta Gerwig is a national treasure!

See? Nothing.

I guess I'm not feeling it.
I don't know.

What if that's the only thing
I'll ever be able to express?

Anger.
What kind of a person would I be then?

Larry David, Lewis Black,

What do you mean?
You invited us.

Sorry, but we can't have Stewie here.

I brought my own veggie burgers,

but I'm not gonna
make a big deal about it.

What with his profanity and all,
I don't think

Stewie would be a good influence
on the other children.

Is there a designated spot on the grill

for the veggie burgers?

And again, not a big deal.

You're saying that
because of a swear word,

my son isn't good enough

It's a little bit about him swearing,

Brian, shut off the television.

Stewie obviously learned
to swear from some TV show.

No, he didn't.
The only show he watches is <i>Caillou.</i>

Well, then that little
French-Canadian weirdo

is the potty mouth, I'm sure of it.

And I'm willing to watch every
single episode just to prove it.

<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>Caillou was upset.</i>

<i>Why am I bald?</i>
<i>I'm not a baby. I'm four.</i>

<i>Are kids just bald in Canada?</i>

God, this is dull.

<i>CAILLOU: Maybe I'm supposed</i>

-Huh? What?
-Ah, another time.

Oh. I-I, um... I watched
that <i>Caillou, </i>and you're right.

Stewie didn't learn that word
from <i>Caillou.</i>

That means he learned it
from someone in this house.

-Okay.
-And I will find out who.

I'm gonna set a trap

and lure the swearer
into revealing himself.

That sounds hard.

Oh, I <i>will </i>find the swearer.

<i>CAILLOU:</i>
<i>Dad, why are we sitting</i>

<i>on the washing machine?</i>

<i>CAILLOU'S FATHER:</i>
<i>Because in Canada,</i>

<i>men have vaginas.</i>

Hey, what's with the stairs?
Why do they look different?

Oh, I'm trying to prove

that Peter's the one cussing in the house,

so I waxed the staircase
for him to fall down.

PETER:
Hey, Lois, have you seen
my Spider-Man socks?

-I can't seem to...

Ouch. Oh, heavens.

Oh, goodness gracious.

Peter, when did you become so polite?

Oh, I've been hanging out

In fact, I'm meeting him at the park

to eat unsalted saltines on the swings.

I feel like you're wearing

what Rachel Maddow
would wear to a pumpkin patch.

But don't worry,
I don't use it for sexual purposes.

(motor whirring)

What do you think of that?

That something you can work with?

(yawning)

Well, looks like someone was up late.

Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer

when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.

Oh, no!
They's doin' gay jokes without me.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

You're part of it now.

God, you're sexy.

What are you looking at?!
I told you that was one night!

Now get out.
I called you an Uber.

I'll know if you went further
than your house.

-Hey, what are you doin'?
-Oh, hey, Bri.

I was just putting some product
in my hair, you know.

Yeah, this looks good.
Give it a little height.

Let everyone know Stewie's
back on the market.

I heard that on <i>Friends.</i>

Did you know they're all 60 now?

I knew Courteney Cox was.

So, how you doing with Rupert
gone and everything?

Are you kidding?
I'm fantastic!

He was kind of holding me back,
if I'm being honest.

It's time I got out there again.
I've had one bear my whole life.

-That's not normal.
-Nothing about you is normal.

I mean, I've already wasted
a whole year of my life with him.

There's only been a year of your life.

You know, all of your responses
have been very similar,

so you might want to nip that in the bud.

Look, the truth is,
things got a bit stale between us.

There wasn't one part of Rupert's body

that I didn't know by heart.

None of it excites me anymore.

Well, do you want me
to keep an eye on Rupert for you?

Make sure he's doing okay?

No need.
I turned him into a nanny cam.

-A nanny cam?
-Yeah, I put it inside him.

Deep.
It's inside him now.

I-I don't know how to respond
that won't sound similar

to other responses I've made,
so just, uh, continue.

Right.
Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact,

ten minutes later,
I'll get a chime notification on my phone,

and I can pull up the video.

Why is there a delay?

Why can't you get the video immediately?

I don't know.
Why can't you poop on a toilet?

-Fair.
-(phone chimes)

Ah, it's chiming, it's chiming.

Okay, okay, calm down, just calm down.

(breathes deeply)
Now, what do we have?

Oops.
Sorry, Skippy.

(gasps)
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

Is Chris wearing a nicotine patch?

You know what, it's just like I said.

He and Chris go together,
like peaches and cream.

Peaches.
Peaches, I'm sorry.

Damn it. You could've at least
given me some warning.

At least a-a shoulder tap.

I know, you're right.

It's just that you're so beautiful,

I can't control myself sometimes.

Aw, I can't stay mad at you.

How about a kiss?

(chuckles):
No-ho-ho-ho. Oh, no.

(forced laughter)

I'm sorry, was that loud?
Sorry, everyone.

We're being loud.
Oh, this is Anton.

Stewie, let Mommy help you
into your high chair.

Well, I am a little wobbly today.

It's your fault, you know.

Stop it, we're with my family.

Easy.
You're pinching my pits.

God, it's like being picked up
with lobster claws.

We hate her, by the way.

Ah, I see you got my text
to bring Rupert to dinner.

You're looking well.
And this is Anton.

He's in the touring company
of <i>Dear Evan Hansen.</i>

My, aren't we all very modern?

He's just here 'cause I got gum
on him and he stuck to my hand.

Okay, that's sickening.

Remember when that bear
used to be yours, Chris?

Oh, you used to take him with you every...

You shut your mouth, you hear me?
Shut it!

Oh, someone's tired.

Brian, you want to put the baby down?

Okay, yeah, he is a little fussy.

I'll take him upstairs.
Come on, Stewie.

Brian, he's not in <i>Evan Hansen.</i>

He's a male prostitute.

Very cheap.

Please tell me Rupert looked fat, Brian.
I'm begging you.

He's a stuffed bear--
he-he looked enormous.

Yeah, I thought so, too.
Puffy, you know?

Glug, glug, glug.
Someone's back on the sauce.

(phone chimes)

Goodnight, Skippy.

Just a warning,
I had some bad experiences at camp,

so now I sleep with one eye open.

(raspy breathing)

I can't believe it, Brian.
I've been forgotten.

I can't take it anymore!
It's eating me alive!

What are you gonna to do?

I-I need to take a trip.

You know?
Go on a spiritual journey.

Find out who Stewie is
without Rupert, you know?

I just have to get an Uber to the airport.

Wait-- my Uber rating is 4.2?!
What happened?

(classical music playing)

(tires screech)

(Indonesian music playing)

Excuse me, I'm in Bali
on a spiritual journey

but I seem to have mistakenly wandered

on to the heavy people beach.

Do you happen to know
where the thin, attractive beach is?

Thank you and good luck
with whatever's going on with you.

Hey. You should've seen the pigs
where I was before.

I'm only wearing a Speedo
because that's what they wear

in this country.

(chuckles):
If I... if I weren't wearing one,

then I would stand out, right?

I'm on a spiritual journey. You?

Oh, you don't speak English.
Cool.

Rupert? Rupert, is that you?!
You followed me!

This can be a second chance for us.

Let's put everything behind...
Oh... oh.

Sorry, I'm-I'm so embarrassed.

You-you look like... an old friend.

He lives with someone else now.

Well, sorry.

You've got to get a grip

Put Rupert and Chris out of your head.

Excuse me, where are your parents?

Oh. I-I don't... I'm-I'm-I'm like...

No. The Eddie Rabbitt version.

I was wondering if you'd
be willing to be the godfather.

to be Susie's godfather, too.

Well, you've made
two very compelling arguments.

Perhaps we should discuss this
further in my poorly-lit den.

What are you guys discussing?

And when did we get a den?

Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather

is closing the door in your wife's face

'cause of all the diddlin'.

Now they just have a rabbi fill in.

Shalom, everyone.

Welcome to the christening.

Now, before the child goes in the water,

has it been at least 20 minutes
since she ate?

-Yes, Rabbi.
-Wonderful.

Fallen heroes, all.

Now, does anyone have any reason

why these two should not be married?

♪ ♪

-(all gasping)
-What?
-The bride?

Did you park on the street?
I parked on the street.

I'm sorry, I can't do this.

I know you don't really want to marry me.

You're only doing this
to make your parents happy.

And I know...

Well, I-I think I know everything.

What gave it away?

When I saw you with your parents.

You obviously
just want them off your back.

Plus your iPhoto library

is mostly guys' things
next to Comcast remotes.

I only meet the ones

Mom, Dad, I'm gay.

PETER:
(gasps) What?

LOIS:
Peter, you knew that.

Is this some kind of joke?

This ain't no joke, Daddy.
I like mens.

This feels like an episode that someone

would get a prize for in 1994.

Maybe we should talk
about this another time, dear.

No.
I want to talk about it now.

I'm gay, and like all gay men,
it was a choice I made

when I couldn't find a table
at the high school cafeteria.

Cork up those ink pots.
We know that's not how it works.

Everyone, thank you for coming,

but I'm afraid there isn't
going to be a wedding today.

Oh, yes, there is.

Jeffrey, get your pimply
little ass up here.

Jeffrey, will you marry me?

Oh, yes.

Come on, Shropnicks, we're leaving.

Let's start the 21-hour drive home.

You-you guys can't
get married in the church.

We don't recognize you as...

well, as people.

Ugh, fine.

Everyone, meet us
in the Walgreens parking lot

down the street.

Meg, sweetie, are you okay?

You know what, Mom? I am.

Bruce and Jeffrey love each other.

They deserve to be happy.

-And so do I.
-Oh, Meg.

Don't make this day about you.

-Oh, Bruce.
-Oh, Jeffrey.

Oh...

No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

No.

It's nice that they're doing this,

but who's gonna marry them?

By the power <i>vested </i>in me,

I pronounce you husband and husband.

You may kiss when you get home.

Well, we just lost the prize.

Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.
Meg's wedding took up

a little more time than we would
have liked this week,

so we didn't get to do everything

we wanted to with my hands.

So, here's a supercut of me
having a little fun around town.

We like it a lot.
We hope you will, too.

Peter, I just hit a pothole
in the road and got a flat.

The man who helped us gave her his card.

I'd keep an eye on that.

This town is falling apart.

Last week the bridge over
the collapsed bridge collapsed.

Well, you're a middle-aged woman
with no job.

Maybe you should
get really worked up about it.

You know what? I think I will.

I'm going down to city hall to complain.

This town needs a mayor.

Y-You forgot your baby. Miss?

Thank you all for coming over
to help us find

the best candidate for mayor.

This room is so diverse, so I'm assuming

many of you have agendas.

But let's keep in mind we need
a mayor who will represent

all of Quahog and not just satisfy

your weird little fringe issues,

which are important,
but not very important.

As a descendent
of Quahog's Puritan forefathers,

I think we should be able
to throw a woman into a pond

to see if she's a witch.

That seems a bit extreme, don't you think?

That's exactly what a witch would say.

Lois, you're making this harder
than it needs to be.

Just get a former Batman and move on.

I'm sure Val Kilmer
could use the insurance.

Peter, we're not going
to get a former Batman.

That has been pitched
every day since Adam West died

and the response has been tepid at best.

We need someone with fresh ideas.

Someone who knows the issues.

Well, if you're looking
for someone with issues,

I think you've found your candidate.

(laughs)

(Stewie laughs)

I had to go to bed early
because it's a grown-up party,

but Mom said if I was quiet,

I could listen from the top of the stairs.

You know, I think you might be
a really good candidate.

You know the town, you're smart

and you clearly have nothing better to do.

So all in favor of the librarian
running for mayor say aye.

-ALL: Aye.
-What about ALF?

Let's toast our new mayor...

um, I'm sorry,
I don't even know your name.

Elle. Elle Hitler.

(laughs)
No relation.

Elle Hitler? Eh.

Let's all say hi to Elle Hitler.

-Hi, Elle Hitler.
Yay!

I can't believe Lois wants
the librarian to be mayor.

I mean, Mayor West was a legend,

and now they're gonna replace him

with some third-tier character
with a joke name?

-That's Chinatown, Peter.
-What?

I said, "That's Chinatown."
It's from the movie <i>Chinatown.</i>

It means, like, "What are you gonna do?
That's Chinatown."

Joe, did you finally get Netflix?

I did.
And I just watched <i>Chinatown.</i>

It's kind of gross.

Quahog deserves a cool mayor,
like Mayor West was.

But there's no one cooler than Adam West.

If only he had had a offspring.

Speaking of offspring,
Faye Dunaway slept with her dad

in <i>Chinatown </i>and then had his baby.

Guys, that movie really messed me up.

Wait a second,
Mayor West didn't have any kids,

but he did have a cousin, Wild West.

You guys don't know Wild West?

No. And please don't diminish us

for not knowing the same things you know.

You know how to land an airplane?

No, you don't. Asswipe.

I'm sorry.
I see you, Quagmire.

-I do.
-Thank you.

Wild West is a legendary cowboy

for everything manly. Look.

My name's Wild West

Well, a hose is very desirous

Especially when you're
taking an opportunity away

from a very deserving woman.

That's a fair point, Lois.

Do you mind if I make you
a sweater while I respond?

(exhales)
Uh, no.

No, that would be fine.

Lois, I moved my whole family
to Oregon when I was 13,

and it taught me
that a town is like a horse.

You don't choose it.

-(bleats)
-It chooses you.

And I believe Quahog has chosen me,

just like it chose my cousin Adam.

Now, the last thing I want to do
is take something from a woman.

There's nothing I respect more than women.

(giggles)
Is that so?

Yes'm.

I'm a registered doula,

Oh, my God. Oh. Huh.

So, y-you're all alone... up here?

Huh?

Peter, what the hell are you wearing?

I went a different direction, cowboy-wise,

but don't change the subject!

(paint can rattles)

-Peter, what are you doing?
-I've decided that Wild West

is the worst possible person to be mayor,

and I'm gonna do
whatever I can to stop him.

O-Okay, is this because
I called out his name twice during sex

and once while I was peeing after?

-That's part of it, yes.
-I'm sorry, Peter, it just slipped out.

Well, I'm sorry I'm the length
of a Mike and Ike!

In your dreams.

(takes deep breath)

That one stung, Lois.

(takes deep breath)

Ooh, that one stung.

All right, I'm on your side now.

And if you're gonna beat Wild West,

you have to recognize that
one of his greatest strengths

is his voice, which makes him
sound sexy and smart

and sexy and sexy.

Where your voice sounds
like your dad's second wife

trying to describe
something she saw on Facebook.

Oh, speaking of,

do you know what a meme is?

What...
Course I do.

And it's pronounced "me-me."

Well, the other day, I saw one

with the most adorable kitten

tangled in a ball of yarn.

And underneath...

underneath, it said:
"(bleep) the police."

Okay, that was unexpected,
so I'm gonna ignore it

and bring in Morgan Freeman,
who I've hired

to narrate your commercials.

We're gonna fight voice with voice.

Wild West claims to know
what's best for Quahog,

but there's a better choice.

And I know about choice.

I chose to be in <i>Ted 2.</i>

Nobody made me.

I wasn't forced at gunpoint.

I relied on my advisors,
and they let me down.

"They'll fix the script," they said.

Well, they were wrong.

I thought I'd get to act
with a talking teddy bear,

but when I got there,

it was just two ping-pong balls
on a stick.

Or maybe that was Amanda Seyfried.

I don't know.

Okay, thank-thank you.
Thank you, Morgan. Thank you.

Peter, just let me speak to the voters

about the issues they're concerned about.

Or, instead of doing that stupid thing,

we could sabotage Wild West's campaign.

Come on, you can drive.

Me, too.

-Not this big.
-You know, a lot of people

think I'm obsessed,

with "This, this, this, this, this."

Wow.
That is some top-shelf journalism.

And here's some pictures of cute animals

that wives can
shove in their husbands' faces

to keep them from ever going to sleep.

Brian, stop.
I can only hire you so many times.

Welcome to <i>The Hog.</i>

I'll ask my roommate to move
his car so you can pull out.

Cup of joe and a greasy roll, please.

Okay, whatever this is, I already hate it.

Sorry, I'm up against a deadline
on a big story.

Major ramifications.
Lid, prepare to be blown off.

"Best butts to sniff at the park."

I, um, I don't... I-I don't think

this is an article for human readers.

Now hold on there, Stewie,
just hear the man out.

Thank you, Chris.

I also posted
a couple of articles last night.

Real think pieces.

"Star Wars movies ranked best to worst

except for the two I haven't seen."

Well, that seems lazy.
And which two didn't you see?

Uh, the original <i>Star Wars</i>
and <i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

I'd still rather read
that than "9/11s since 2000

"ranked best to worst.

Number one may surprise you."

September 11, 2014?

We lost Richard Kiel,
the actor who portrayed Jaws

in the James Bond films.

He likes classic cars?

You probably said he was Jewish

You can't use that word in an article.

Hey, I'm working on a story about fat guys

Will you put on these roller

Okay, I have to write an article
on the life

of the town's hero and brewery founder,
Pawtucket Pat.

Now, where's the normal,
well-adjusted person

who works in a small-town archive?

Yes?

I, uh... I'm-I'm looking
for some old manuscripts.

Excellent.
Bats, take me to him.

(squeaking)

Okay, this is everything they have on Pat.

God, I bet no one's even read
most of this stuff before.

Huh, what's this?

Some kind of leather-bound book
sealed with wax.

Wow.
I think it's his diary.

See?
Men can too have diaries.

Yeah, his cover
doesn't have sparkles, champ.

First page.
"Dad, don't read this."

Second page.
"Seriously, Dad, don't read this."

Third page.
"Dad, what are you doing?

Don't read this."

Fourth page.
"I kissed my sister."

Okay, let's flip ahead.

Oh, my God.

-What?
-He says that he didn't create

his recipe for beer.

He stole it from some Native Americans

and killed them to keep his secret,

and then he kissed his sister again.

What?
That's insane.

Pawtucket Pat
is the most revered person in Quahog.

Not anymore.
This is a big story.

Can you believe it?
It's like we're Woodward and Berenstain.

Follow the honey.

(indistinct chatter)

What the hell?

Hey, hey.
What are you guys doing?

Why are you so upset about Pat?

Pawtucket Pat was a phony!

(chuckles)
I remember you.

But no, he isn't.
He's a hero.

Not anymore.
He's a racist murderer

and this statue should be torn down.

(sighs)
God, there's a lot wrong with this,

but you can't tear this down.

Pat's an icon.

That statue belongs
right here in the park,

next to the statue
of Quahog's greatest missionary,

Father Touchboys.

That statue was removed a year ago.

For what?!

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story: the revelations
about local hero Pawtucket Pat

continue to rock Quahog.

The town is divided
over whether his statue

should remain in the park.

Even the pigeons who poop on it
are in a moral quandary.

So, what do you two
think of the statue being on public land?

-Coo.
-Not coo.

PETER:
My friend is the mailman.

I'm gonna give him a heart attack.

Good job, Brian.
Your work has actually made an impact.

Thanks, Stewie.
I think everybody's

gonna be happy about this.

Where do you get off?!

In my bedroom, mostly.
Sometimes the bathroom.

Or wherever I see a lady seal an envelope.

Good, good.
I am glad we can talk frankly about sex.

And Brian, how dare you try to take down

the statue of Pawtucket Pat?

Oh, my God.
You don't actually support

keeping it there, do you?

Of course I do.
It's been there my whole life.

And I am gonna do whatever
it takes to keep it up.

Finally, Peter cares
about keeping something up.

Lois, will you stifle yourself?

(laughter, applause)

Yesterday, Meg sat there without pants.

Yuck.
Brian, Pat is a hero.

H-He practically built Quahog.

And his statue is part of the town.

And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let

some draft-dodging liberals tear it down.

-We don't have a draft.
-Well, then,

who shaved my head
and yelled at me for two months?

Peter, we've been over this.
That was the Heaven's Gate cult.

Oh, right, that-that thing with the shoes.

Yeah, o-once I got the shoes, I split.

The statue has got to go.

Brian, for years, it's been a tradition

that every boy, when he turns 16,

has to kiss the statue's crotch
while his friends take pictures.

That's not a tradition.

Ah, then I think
some fun was had at my expense.

Peter, we can't leave a symbol
like that in the town square.

Pawtucket Pat was a horrible racist.

Well, so is Tucker Carlson,
but we still say hi to him

at the company picnic.

Brian, if you apply the values of today

to people who lived almost 300 year ago,

uh, doesn't that mean we'd have
to take down the statues

of pretty much everyone?

I-I mean, where do you draw the line?

Wait a minute, y-you don't agree
with Peter, do you?

I don't know.
I-I'm uncomfortable

with a racist statue being smack
in the middle of Quahog,

but as a woman, I need landmarks
to find my way around town.

I mean, without that statue,
I'm completely disoriented.

Okay, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the kitchen.

Damn it, who moved the lamp?

Well, what does the rest
of the family think? Chris?

-Ha! You got sunflowered.
-What?

When a Gen Z kid
wants out of a conversation,

he leaves a large sunflower in his place.

That's ridiculous.
There is no way

that children regularly disappear

and then replace themselves
with sunflowers

just to express their boredom.

Ha. You got sunflowered again.

Why are you back?

(scoffs)
We only have one sunflower.

Okay, I-I clearly don't understand
your generation,

but Meg, you're currently
taking world history.

What do you think
should happen to the statue?

I don't care.
I'm an agent of chaos.

Ow! Well, screw you guys.

Pawtucket Pat is a hero.
That statue ain't going nowhere.

It's a part of history.
Just like Catherine the Great.

My great people of Russia.

As your empress, my legacy shall
be expanding Russia's borders,

growing her armies, building palaces

that will be admired for centuries...

We heard you had sex with a horse!

I have created alliances
with the great powers of Europe...

What about the horse sex?

There is no horse sex!

Is this guy bothering you, Cathy?

I can handle this.

Hey guys, I got you all
"Keep Up the Statue" hats, or "KUTS."

Kuts? Isn't that the lady's
hairdresser down the street?

Why don't you tell me?

Peter, I'm not wearing a Kuts hat.

Come on, if I refer three friends,

I get a free blowout.

Tell them Mary Sparkles sent you.

But never call me that
in front of my family.

Where was this place, again?

Peter, anybody who supports
that statue is a racist.

Racist?
How can a 300-pound white guy

who looks at black porn be racist?

Here, Peter.
You were sent a beer

by that table of businessmen.

-Which table?
-No, no. No, no. Don't look.

Make them come to you.

You guys haven't read my book, have you?

-Peter, they're leaving.
-They'll come.

They're getting in their vehicle.

-They're pulling into the street
without looking.
-(tires screech, loud crash)

Oh, no, they've been hit by a bus!

They'll come.
I followed the rules.

Peter, they can't come.
They're dead.

That was the day I lost my sparkle.

I was just Mary after that.

Excuse me, would you sign
this petition demanding

that the city take down the...

Take down the what?

-Uh, nothing.
-Good.

Hey, could you do me a favor
and elbow-wipe

74 years of pigeon (bleep)
off my shoulders?

Uh, okay.

Who are you, anyway?

I'm Rhode Island founder Roger Williams,

otherwise known as the end
of the worst field trip

in elementary school history.

It's true.
The kids are very disappointed.

Oh, yeah, "And Wife"
is totally getting' them jazzed.

-(horn honks)
-Move, Brian, you're in my spot.

You're Mrs. Groceries?

She touched the manager over the pants.

Love her or hate her, she plays to win.

-Anyway, how's it going?
-Not good.

I'm not getting any signatures
on this petition.

Really?
It looks like you've got quite a few.

Oh, mostly they just say, "Brian is gay."

Yeah, I have to be careful.
If 200 people write it,

-it goes on the ballot.
-Well, at least you're trying.

I mean, what is Peter doing

to drum up support for his side?

PETER (on bullhorn):
Ladies and gentlemen,

to support Pawtucket Pat,
please welcome Kid Rock.

Hello, Quahog.

Whenever there's a town debate
with racial overtones,

-I'm there on the wrong side.
-(all cheering)

Aw, crap, everybody run.
It's Adult Rock.

Kid, you want to tell me why
I found your mother's

best T-shirt-cutting scissors
outside in the rain?

-(scoffs) I don't know.
-(sighs)

Why can't you be more
like your brother, The?

Rupert, I was going over
our credit card statement.

There's a charge for two tickets
to <i>Tootsie </i>the musical,

yet I don't remember going
to see <i>Tootsie </i>the musical.

Now, I'm hoping the good news
is I'm ruining the surprise.

God, I can't believe
Peter is actually winning

public support for that damn statue.

And he's throwing rocks through my window,

and it's his house.

-(Peter grunting)
-(heavy thud)

Ugh, that rock was too heavy.

Got to find something lighter.

Okay, so something in between.

That statue is such a disgrace.

I'll tell you, part of me
wants to march down

to that park and remove it myself.

Well, why don't you?
It'd be a noble act.

Think of it as civil disobedience.

Disobedience?
But I'm a good boy.

I obey. I always obey.
I'm a good boy who obeys.

Okay, d-don't think of it as disobedience,

Forget I used that word.

You're a weird guy, Bri.

A weird doggy guy.

PETER:
Ha! Found some medium rocks.

You know what?
That's a great idea.

Like not separating immigrant
children from their families.

<i>(applause)</i>

If you're the first one
to stop applauding,

that means you're racist.

<i>(applause intensifies)</i>

<i>(applause continues)</i>

<i>(applause stops)</i>

Thanks for helping me, Stewie.

All right, let's tie the rope
around the statue

and tow it out of here.

All right, great.
But before we begin,

I'm just going to use the park bathroom

-at night.
-Stewie, no.

I got a lollipop!

That's great, bud.

Now let's stop talking about
that lollipop and get to work.

Okay, we're almost ready to do this.

Did you bring the masks?

-Right here.
-What the hell is this?

You said to bring masks.

These are from last year's
charity ball at the Guggenheim.

Whatever.
Just help me tie this rope to the car.

Sorry, I need a free hand
to hold up my mask.

Enough with the damn masks!

All right, let's get this statue
out of here.

I guess you only paid
for driver's side airbags.

Yeah. When I bought this,
I was dating a girl I didn't like.

Wow, look at this.

The statue's disappearance
is being covered everywhere.

I can't believe we really did it.

-I just hope we don't get caught.
-So what?

Mom would just ground us
and take away screen time,

and then realize that without
screens, she has to entertain us

and immediately give it back.

Stewie, destroying a statue is a felony.

If we're caught, we'll go to prison.

Prison?!
I can't go to prison.

Peter watched all six seasons of <i>Oz</i>

with me in a Babybjörn.

I'm too young to have someone
go poo on my face.

Well, there's really no good age
for it to happen.

All right, Stewie, just relax.

And don't do that weird,
nervous laugh you do

-when you're hiding something.
-Got it.

-Morning, everybody.
-Where have you guys been?

(cackles)

No-Nowhere, of course!

(quietly):
Will you calm down?

So, uh, where's Peter?

Uh, he went to some rally
'cause the statue's gone.

He's angrier than Al Pacino's
forehead liver spots.

Comb your hair down instead of up.

Give us some shade.
We're dying up here.

Yeah, what do you call that haircut?

You're nearly 80 years old.

You look like the kid from <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

What are you going for
with all of these spots?

I want to look like mashed potatoes,

with the skins on.

(indistinct chatter)

This is awesome.
What a turnout.

And look, here comes Fox News.

(horn playing "Dixie")

It's amazing how recently that show aired.

That statue was a travesty
and so is the brewery.

They should close it
and make juice instead.

What?
How dare you?

Juice will not replace us.

(chanting):
Juice will not replace us!

Juice will not replace us!

My God, Peter, what are you doing?

Taking up politics
to avoid intimacy with my wife.

Peter, is that you?

(gasps)
I thought we could protest together.

All right, no more politics.
Time for trains in the basement.

-MAN: Stop!
-Collaborate and listen.

We are from the Narragansett tribe,

from whom Pawtucket Pat stole his recipe.

And we are annoyed that no one
has asked us what we think.

You guys kind of dress like
weekend Jay Leno.

Thank you. We've just
come from the Wang-Holder wedding.

(laughs)
See?

Little more of that, John Oliver,

and maybe you'll finally
get that 14th Emmy.

Well, what do you guys think?

This statue is only
the tip of the iceberg.

The pressing issue isn't
what someone did 300 years ago,

it's how do we help Native Americans today

and end the institutional racism
that still plagues society?

The poverty rate on reservations...

Oh, damn, you got sunflowered.

Everyone, come back.

Uh, come back.
he makes a good point.

We've all been so focused
on what the statue means to us

we didn't even stop to consider

how Pawtucket Pat affected others.

But Pat's the town hero.

If he's nothing, then so is Quahog.

-(indistinct chatter)
-No, it's not.

Quahog is still a wonderful town.

I-I mean, we still got
one of those Arby's signs.

You know? T-The old ones,
you know, with the big old hat?

That's been gone for ten years.

Oh, (bleep) this place.

No, no, you know what?
No.

Quahog is a wonderful town,

because of who we are and what we do,

not because of some guy
who stole beer 300 years ago.

Especially when he did horrible things

to some of our fellow citizens.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Thank you, Peter.

Now, crowd of angry whites,

I think we all owe
our Native American friends an apology.

ALL:
Sorry.

Angry whites.

-ALL: Sorry!
-That's better.

Well, Brian,
I guess I owe you an apology, too.

You were right from the start.

Sorry things got so heated between us

and that I took a dump in your dog food.

-Wait, what?
-I know. Politics, huh?

-Come on everybody, let's go home.
-I'll drive.

Where the hell are we?

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

Our top story: the statue of Pawtucket Pat

was found earlier today
in the Quahog River.

In the spirit of compromise,
the town has decided

that it will be relocated
to the Quahog Museum,

where it will be both remembered

and never seen by anyone ever again.

Well, thank God
this whole controversy is behind us.

Yeah. And Peter,
I'm glad you came to your senses.

Me, too. You know,
we might even win an award for this.

-Really?
-Yeah, award voters love it

when someone
with a right-leaning viewpoint

admits they're wrong.

They declare it's good storytelling

and character development.

Ooh, like <i>Three Billboards.</i>

-And <i>Green Book.</i>
<i>-Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

<i>American History X.</i>

Yeah, all those.
And many more.

But can anyone name a single movie
where someone on the left

took on a more
Republican-leaning viewpoint?

Doesn't even have to have won an award.

Just has to exist.

Anyone?

Anything?

What about Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis?</i>

How'd you get here?

Mm, in my Hyundai Sonata.

(shudders)

(groans, pants)

That looks heavy.

Well, dragging a bin full
of decorations down the stairs

while repeatedly yelling (bleep)

in front of my children
means only one thing.

It's Christmas time.

Yeah, Lois, I knew
it was Christmas a week ago

when the "O" in the PornHub
logo became a wreath.

-Same.
-Nice.

Listen, there's a lot of work to be done

to make this place look festive,
and unlike most years,

where I do everything,
this year I want you all

to help with the Christmas chores.

Come on, Lois.
You know the deal around here.

We split everything zero-100,
like most couples.

And I also have another request.

I'd like to finally get a present

from the heart this year.

Not just some defective clothing item

Peter got on clearance at Marshalls.

But you love The Roling Stons.

Now, to make sure
you don't forget your chores,

I've made you each a list.

And I want all of these
completed by tomorrow.

Sorry. I can't do chores.
My trick elbow is acting up.

-Is that your card?
-No.

Oh, boy, it's worse than I thought.

Why are we doing our Christmas
shopping at the strip mall?

'Cause we ran out of gas out front.

You got to get that gas gauge fixed.

Look, Chris, did you want
the gas gauge fixed,

or did you want a year of Quibi?

The gas gauge.

I'm sure we can find everything
on Mom's list here.

It doesn't look so bad.

If this place doesn't have Baby
Yoda toys, I swear to God...

I'll probably buy something
with Spider-Man on it.

Okay, guys, now before
you can shop at a strip mall,

you have to use the free-standing ATM

that's chained to a pole

and not affiliated with any known bank.

Good.
It's taking an extra-long time

to read the card and probably
stealing the number.

Select "yes" to pay $15 fee. No brainer.

Perfect.
Now I can't read the screen,

'cause the glare is so bad.

And it's not giving me my card back.

-(phone ringing)
-Hello?

Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

Not anymore?
Well, thanks for telling me.

Look, there's a card and nice paper store.

Let's go walk around it slowly
and let out tiny farts.

-(door bells tinkle)
-(soft instrumental music plays)

Hmm. Nice, thick card stock.

(squeaky gas expulsion)

Ah, yes, that's a very bright white.

(squeaky gas expulsion)

Ooh, Century Gothic font.

(loud, rumbling, gas expulsion)

-Right.

-(clacking, sending) 
-Before I know it,
I've got six Apple TV remotes

-Got it.

And just as I get everything...

-'Kay. 
<i>-...Mrs. Fletcher</i> ends

-Mm. Wow.

I came up with that ten months ago

in anticipation of this very call.

Ha. Terrific.
And would you be willing

to take a half-hour survey

in your far upstairs bedroom
while facing the wall?

Also, how loud does your TV get?

BONNIE:
Don't be long, Joe! I'm expecting a call.

I'll take the time I need!

This is the Wi-Fi call.

Great job hot-wiring the car, Cleveland.

The key was in the ashtray,

but your presumption
will not be forgotten.

You know, you're the Cub Scout.

We're supposed to be making
this Pinewood Derby car together.

Hey, you're one kid, and we're four kids,

Knock it off.

Or what, Kyle-Kyle-Dog-Poop-Pile?

Hey, guys?
Let's take it easy

and maybe not use canine feces as a taunt.
That's hurtful.

What?
(chuckles)

He's just saying that Kyle's a little baby

who's too stupid to even know
how to stand up for himself.

What are you gonna do, baby-- cry?

-(growling)
-(screaming)

Let go of me! Stop!

-You're crazy!
-You leave him alone!

(barking)

Whoa. Thanks, Brian.

Nobody's ever stood up for me
like that before.

Well, I think my instincts just kicked in.

Want to help me sand your car?

Yeah. Definitely.

Animal control?

I'd like to schedule
an emergency neutering.

When measuring yourself,

Let me start

All right, I like where this is heading.

Well, thanks again for coming.

Oh, hey, you know, I was thinking

we could take Kyle

Oh. Really?

Yeah, I have to go there

Brian, stop.
I just... We can't go.

-Honestly, I've been thinking...

Well, Brian, I'm still young.

STEWIE:
Oh, she's saying you're not.

And the truth is
I'd like to date other people.

STEWIE (chuckles):
Oh, nail, meet coffin.

In fact, my old boyfriend is single again,

and he happens to be
a very selfless lover.

STEWIE:
Dude, I told you.

But i-if we break up,

does that mean
I won't get to see Kyle, either?

I guess not.

We'd formed a real connection,

Go Fish is a thinking man's game

for it right now.

Oh, I just brought this ball from...

Uh, uh, home. Caught from home.
Home plate, where Xander was.

We're gonna need 300 for it.

Hmm. Well, I guess it's a historic ball.

Okay, you got a deal.

Wow, I can't believe
that guy just paid us $300

for a regular baseball.

Man, people will buy anything

it's from something famous.

You sell prosthetic ears to veterans.

-Got it.
-Would you like any more details?

Dad, I'm an ear salesman.
I got it.

And I'm Mr. Fields,
husband of cookie legend Mrs. Fields.

You could pick anyone and you chose

to be the husband of somebody famous?

Look, it lets me have
all the cookies I want

and play golf every day.

Okay, I guess you're right.

Happily married, you do what you like.

Well, we're great friends.

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

We-we both realized the physical thing

wasn't working for us anymore
and we sleep much better

in our separate bedrooms
in the same house.

And I can keep my room cold,
how I like it.

Dad, you sound like you're gonna cry.

Sometimes you realize happily
ever after isn't for everyone.

-(crying)
-I don't think this is gonna work.

What you keep looking at, Peter?

Do you know about some terror?

No, no, relax.
I'm-I'm just, uh, just curious to see

what Quagmire's gonna be wearing
when he gets here.

(chuckles) I think our outfits
are pretty much set, Pete.

Check it out, guys,
a piece of aviation history:

the cap Sully Sullenberger wore

when he landed in the Hudson River.

Whoa, that's his actual hat?

Yep.
Want to smell Sully's sweat?

(sniffs)
I don't smell anything.

That's right.
‘Cause Sully never sweats.

Is this someone white people know?

I'm gonna get it signed
by the man himself.

Wait, Sully's alive?
And you're gonna show it to him?

Sure am.
He's doing a signing tomorrow

at the airport bookstore.

Uh, hey, listen,
I don't know about this plan, Glenn.

Uh, nobody likes to see their old hats.

Hey, if you're gonna be at the airport,

could you pick me up a $45 neck pillow

I'll forget to pack for my next trip?

-I love this hat.
-You know, Quagmire,

I was gonna be at the airport
tomorrow anyway.

Why don't I take your hat
and get it signed for you?

Why are you going to the airport?

I want to hang out
with the boarding group B

cell phone holster guys.

It's mostly just standing around

and asking each other
if we're also in group B.

Do you also ask if group B
has boarded yet,

and "is this the line
for boarding group B?"

Yeah, you know it, Joe.
Are you a boarding group B guy?

(laughs):
Me? Oh.

No, no, no, no, no.

I, uh, I get on early with the babies.

Look, I'm already gonna be there,

so you should just give me the hat.

Yeah, thanks for the offer,
but I'm not passing up

a chance to meet my hero.

Is this the guy we're talking about?

Wow, I can't believe this.

Daryl Hannah, it is an absolute pleasure.

-I loved you in <i>Splash.</i>
-No, Doctor, this is Stewie.

He needs you to help fix his face.

Oh, absolutely, I can do that.

Great.
Is it a simple procedure?

Oh, sure.
We just break every bone in his face

and then smush 'em back into position.

Dr. Hartman, where'd you
get your medical degree from?

Dr. Hartman really did a good job.

Yep. He told me

but I'm not missing picture day.

Huh. You sure you shouldn't

Oh, my God, Tyler.
Do you remember this?

I do, I do.
We've come a long way.

We've come a lot of ways.

All right, Chris, we got to stop Quagmire

from meeting Captain Sullenberger.

Only thing is, since 9/11,
you can't run in airports,

so we got to fat-guy
hustle-walk our way there.

Oh, no.
We're too late.

We shouldn't have stopped
for that airport Toblerone.

We had to.
It's like European shark teeth.

Hold on, Sully's looking at the hat.

It is an honor to meet you, sir.

And it was an honor
to purchase the actual hat

you wore on that fateful day.

-You know, I'm a pilot myself.
-Oh, you are?

What's your record for longest "uh"?

-Eleven seconds.
-Let's hear it.

Folks, from the tower, uh...

...they've cleared us to push back,

we'll be departing shortly.

Hey, that's great.
My personal best is 34 sec...

34 seconds in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

I know. The Tulsa Uh.
As I said, big fan.

Here you go.

Thank you, sir.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go back to my life

as the most famous Chesley
who's ever lived.

This is the greatest day of my life.

(squealing)

-(liquid splatters)
-MAN: Ow, my smoothie.

MAN 2:
Ow, mine, too. I'm on the other side.

I can't believe it.
Sully didn't tell him the hat was fake.

Well, he's not that smart.
He did crash a plane.

Excuse me, uh, Captain Sullenberger,

I was just wondering why you pretended

that was your real hat just then.

-Well, Peter...
-I never said my name.

...when my plane was going down,

I remembered a famous saying
we have in aviation.

It goes, "Chesley is a perfectly
normal name for a person."

And what it means is
you have to believe in yourself.

I didn't think I could
land my plane in the Hudson,

but I believed I could.

And that belief
gave me the courage to try.

So, if that man believes he has my hat,

maybe that'll make him
a little bit better husband...

-Nope.
-Little better dad...

-Nope.
-Little better sex character

who doesn't play as well
in the Me Too era.

Oh, so you do watch the show.

It's on... i-it's on a lot of planes.

All I know is I didn't save 155 souls

on the Hudson
just to shatter dreams on land.

You know what?
You're as good a guy as they say.

Hey, why do they call this place

The bride and groom
have written their own vows.

PETER: Oh, no.

Rachel, I love you.

And today we merge our lives, our hearts,

and our fraudulent home businesses.

Mort, may my plantar fasciitis
act like the roots

for our tree of love.

We will reshape our lives together

just as socks reshape my calves daily.

I am so happy to be merging
the napkins in my pockets

with the napkins in your pockets.

Rachel, with you by my side

there is no Christmas display
that I can't sue the city over.

I vow to keep you nourished
by filling our home

with the worst wine in the world

and preparing potatoes and applesauce.

Just like nobody.

And I vow to adorn our walls

with only brown art from the '70s.

Mort, we're two peas in a pod.

We just go together.

You are the plastic covering
to my furniture.

And you are the little spit bubble

in the corner of my mouth.

Mort, you are my forever person.

Aw.

May we continue to have no respect

for other drivers on the road

and view stop signs as suggestions.

And, Rachel, you are my forever person.

Aw.

And may my dead ex-wife's

uncle's Netflix account continue

to be fruitful to us
for many years to come.

Mort, do you take Rachel

to be your wife in sickness
and in sickness?

I Jew.

And, Rachel, do you take Mort

to be your husband in bad times and bad?

I Jew, too.

(applause)

Stewie, what's going on with you?

I just found all that very moving.

-Really?
-Yes, I had no idea

marriage could be that beautiful.

There really is somebody for everybody.

Even Helen Keller had her tailor.

$100, please, blind and deaf lady!

(sighs) Always nice coming back
to your own house, huh?

This isn't your house.
It's my dad's.

I have a package for Stewie Griffin.

-Day just starting or ending?
-Smack dab in the middle.

Oh, dude.
Brutal.

Well, welcome to the back nine.

I can't believe this worked.

I'm Stewie.
I'm going to be your husband.

-Zlata.
-We're such each other's forever people.

Brian, I'd like you to meet my fiancée

that I ordered from the Ukraine,
the soon-to-be Zlata Griffin.

Is that... is there a dead body in there?

Yeah, they send two in case one dies.

She was sister.

Looks like her arm was gnawed off.

Babe, you don't have to eat people.
We got food.

Stewie, this is crazy.

You can't marry that woman.
You don't even know her.

I know she can disassemble

and reassemble a rifle in 15 seconds.

-How does that matter...
-I know it's adorable

that she thinks we're gonna see
Whoopi Goldberg

-everywhere we go.
-Stewie...

I hear Whoopi Goldberg out here?

Z and Bri, my two favorites.

I-I don't even...

Zlata, what... why would you marry a baby?

In my country, everyone I know blows up.

She wanted to leave, I had 200 bucks.

Boom, we're each other's forever people.

Are there any more options
for breakfast, Mom?

Bread without whole walnuts in it?
Yuck.

What's going on with you two?

Well, it's just,
hotel living got us accustomed

to having multiple breakfast options.

Yeah, we're like when astronauts
come back from space

and can't fit back in with society,
but with breakfasts.

Well, I'd advise you space cadets
to come back to Earth,

because I'm only making one thing.

(laughs): Okay.
Meg, did you hear what I said?

I said I'd advise
you space cadets to come back

-to Earth because...
-Yeah, I heard you!

(shatters)

You know,
there is a Best Western in Quahog.

Well, yeah, but don't we need
a room key to get breakfast?

You mean like this one?

Oh, you dog.

Grab your coat,
we're going to the Best Western.

I don't need my coat; it's hot.

Get your (bleep) coat now!

That's the gatekeeper.

We just show her the key
and we get free food.

Yep, just keep it simple.

Now, if asked, we're brothers from Sweden,

same mom, different dad.

Well, shouldn't it be same dad,

-different mom?
-No, no, no.

The Swedes have a very long
fertility window, Chris.

Trust me on this.
Remember, big accent.

Hey, guys, FYI, breakfast
is closing in five minutes.

<i>BOTH:</i>
<i>Ja.</i>

We're doing it, Chris.
Our cover story is working.

I'm looking for a pair of half brothers

This is why Sweden, Chris.

-Never Finland.

Good.
Now grab a yogurt that's way smaller

than you knew they made yogurts.

And you grab an orange juice
that doesn't taste

like orange juice,
but like someone described

the taste of orange juice to an alien.

-I better get going.
-Have good day at work, husband.

Mwah.
Babe, you're too good to me.

I just left my car in stall four.

-Perfect. I can take it from here.
-Okay, great.

And I apologize,
but my son threw up in the back.

Okay, it's no problem,
we can clean that up for you.

Thanks, you're the best.

Hey, Levi, we got a backseat vomit
in the maroon PT Cruiser.

Levi?

Levi? Levi?

(sighs)

Hey, uh, so, I'm really sorry,
but I-I threw up

-Not a problem.

Thanks, man.
Late for a flight.

Levi?

Levi? Levi?

Hey, I accidentally barfed in my car.

They told me I could leave it here?

-Yeah. I'll clean it.

Those are supposed to be great cars.

(chuckles):
Actually, uh, yeah...

They're-they're not great.
They're okay.

Anyway, he says he'll fill the car up
before he brings it back.

He opts out of buying our gas.

Which is, like, ten percent
of less than anywhere in town.

That's right, babe.

But that's his prerogative, as Mitch says.

Mitch is my manager.

So, fast-forward to this morning.

I get the car back, I check the tank.

Three-quarters full.
Quahog, we have a problem.

(laughs)
Stewie, you're so funny.

It's from a movie.

Anyway, that's a 150% markup.

Turns out he was late
for a flight and figured

it's worth it to eat the nine bucks.

So, yeah, a Wednesday
I won't soon be forgetting.

-One check fine?
-$15 on this, the rest on theirs.

-I like them.
-Hmm?

Aaron and Shauna.
They're nice. I like them.

-Yeah.
-It's comfortable going out with people

in the same socioeconomic class
as us, you know?

I mean, I love the Burtons,
but I don't really like

to go to dinner parties in apartments.

Apartment no worse than room in house.

We watch show later.

Uh, and we sleep... when?

-No more putting off.

Sex now.

Wait, wait, wait.
Black man in glasses?

Yes, yes.
It's a Sterling Brown episode.

I like Black man in glasses.

Okay, now we don't have
a room key for this hotel,

so follow my lead.

They didn't even ask at the last place.

Yeah, but we had one
and we carried ourselves

-with key card confidence.
-So, what's the plan?

-Let's try hello.
-Got it.

Good morning, how may I help you?

Hello...

Good morning,

(groaning)

-Good morning, buddy.
-It's morning?

(bleep), you can talk?

Uh, yeah.

Oh, my God.
I knew it.

They told me I was crazy, but I knew it.
(exhales)

I've said good morning to,
like, thousands of dogs.

Is this the pound?
How did I get to the pound?

Oh, my God, that's so awesome.

Okay, you were brought to us
as a lost dog,

but, good news: we scanned you
and found your microchip.

-I didn't know I was chipped.
-Yep.

So you can go back to your owners,

the Hendersons of Bristol County.

What?
Who are these people?

My family is the Griffins.

Well, that's not what your chip says.

Man, no one's gonna believe this.

Wait, will you record my outgoing message?
Oh, hang on.

No one will know you're a dog.

Oh.
Can I record you on mute?

Wait, then no one will hear you can talk.

Okay, we're gonna do something together.

I don't know what it is,
but we're gonna do something.

You still researching your other family?

Yeah.
Apparently, they reported me missing

right before Peter found me.

I just think it's important I understand

who these people were, you know,
as an anthropologist might.

This is a search for
"Hendersons net worth question mark."

Ah, sorry, let me go back.

That says "Hendersons feet."

"Hendersons daughter."

"Hendersons daughter age."
Yikes, Bri.

"Hendersons naked."
Whoa.

"Florence Henderson naked."

Her boobs look like her eyes.

Anyway, I just thought it might be helpful

to reconnect with them.

It's funny, but I-I have no memory
of living with them.

Yeah, sort of like Chris
doesn't remember we stole him

-from a Dutch family.
-What's this, now?

We'll talk about this later.

How do I understand what
you're saying to me?!

Oh, Peter, you cut your hair.

It actually got caught
in the garage door opener chain.

Good news is we'll know exactly how far

to pull in when we park.

What about the tennis ball?

What tennis ball?

Hey, cool out.
I-I can be your assistant.

We can both do it.
Checks and balances.

(screaming)

Okay, Brian, you can do this.

The Griffins are still your family.

You're just curious
to learn about yourself.

Yes.
To learn about yourself.

(doorbell rings)

Oh, my God, it's you.

-Is this really happening?
-Sure is.

We thought we'd never see you again.

We made a grave for you and everything.

Want to see it?
Want to see your own grave?

Um, uh, no, thanks.

Good, 'cause we had to move it
to put in the trampoline anyway.

Come in, come in.

Wow, this place is incredible.

These say "Henderson."
Did you write all these?

Yep. I've written one more book
than James Patterson.

He writes one, I write one more.
That's sort of my thing.

Oh, and it looks like you got
some of my favorites over here.

<i>1984.</i>
Chilling.

-Could happen, right?
-Which part?

Oh, just all of it.
You know, the... just, the year.

Are you saying the year 1984 could happen?

Ah, and <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i>

Very similar words.
But there is a difference there.

Well, I think Ms. Austen meant "sense"
as in the rational mind,

and "sensibility" as in one's preferences,
or irrational mind,

so it's kind of a winking
tug-of-war at work.

(chuckles)

Do you have <i>Jaws</i> here?
I-I'd like to talk about <i>Jaws.</i>

-By Peter Benchley?
-(chuckles)

No.
No, by Steven Spielberg.

Well, that was all pretty unexpected.

The Hendersons were actually amazing.

I can totally see where I get
my literary chops from.

Ah, uh, can't hear you...

I mean, their kids are at Harvard now.

Yeah, I can't...
I got my music going, so...

Makes me think
I could have gone to Harvard

-if I'd just stuck around.
-(sighs)

Okay, fine.
Not gonna make Sinéad compete with you.

Not gonna do that to her.

I was just thinking,
you know, how different

my life could be if I'd actually grown up

with the right kind of family.

Yeah, Bri,
I have that thought sometimes, too.

(slurping)

-Oh, hey.
-Hey yourself.

You, uh, working hard or hardly working?

Get up here and find out.

Uh, Brian, I got to go.

-But, Stewie...
-I got to go!

Hey, you want to get in the pool?

Oh, I'd love to,

Hey, Chris, did you tell everyone

No, it's stupid.

Go on, tell 'em.

Well, I got into
Orange Julius school today.

-That's wonderful, Chris!
-Congratulations!

Tell 'em what the guy said, Chris.

He said I was lucky
I was the only one who applied.

You're being too modest.

He also said they only accept

99% of applicants.

Anyway, I've already been fired
for touching myself

while the Hot Dog on a Stick ladies
made lemonade.

That's terrible, Chris.

Well, to be fair, the hot dogs look

like wieners and lemonade looks like pee,

so I was kind of doomed from the get-go.

Okay, that's it!

How are you all actually this dumb?

I can't even believe
I've wasted my intellect living here.

What are you saying, Brian?

I'm saying I'm moving back in

with the Hendersons, where I belong.

Okay, Brian, I guess that's your choice.

Yeah, fine.

I found Mom and Dad.

Wait, what?
Where are they?

Well, first I need to explain
how I found them.

Let me start from the beginning.

You know how I operate
a small Internet company

where I buy and sell chlorine, right?

-No. What?
-Chris' Chlorine?

-Chris' Chlorine?
-Chris, I have no idea what...

Chris' Chlorine!

Stop just yelling that!

Well, anyway, my guy at Millennial Village

Luxury Apartments was buying
extra chlorine this week.

Seems they've been finding
a lot of loose burger meat

in the pool.

And who do we know
that likes to go swimming

with loose burger meat?

-Oh, my God, Dad!
-Bingo.

But more importantly, are you satisfied

with your chlorine supplier, Meg?

Do you realize that most people don't have

a personal relationship
with their chlorine dealer?

How crazy is that?

Chris, we got to go
to that apartment building

-and bust Mom and Dad.
-(phone ringing)

I'm on board, Meg,
just got to take this call first.

Christopher's Catamarans.
Been running a side business.

Hello?

Aw, wrong number.

Anyway, Meg, are you happy

with your catamaran supplier?

Shouldn't we be confronting
our parents right now?

I know, it's so crazy
how they moved out of the house.

But you know what's really crazy?

Paying big showroom prices for catamarans.

Meg, do you want to pay
for someone else's brick and mortar?

Or do you want to pay for your own fun

and freedom on the waves?

-I really think that we should be getting back.
-(phone ringing)

Hang on, hang on.
I got to get this call.

Randy's Screen and Window Supply.

That's not another one of my businesses.

I run an answering service.

Although I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

that I am dying to get into
the screen and window business.

If you have an in, Meg,

just anyone in the window game
I could take to coffee,

you know, and just
pick their brains about win...

No, Chris.
I'm sorry, I don't.

Yeah, no, it's cool.
Sorry. I'm still here.

(phone rings)

Windows and Screens Unlimited,
we beat any price.

So, Griffins,

what do you think
of our little oasis in Quahog?

I like it, but I can't believe

we're all going to college next year.

Peter, that's too young.

I mean, have you gotten a reverse mortgage

-like Joe Namath suggests?
-Too old.

KATE: Hey, gang,
there's a new couple moving in.

Look at that, Lois.
We're no longer the new couple.

The heat is off.

-Oh, my God.
-I know.

That's the guy
from the catamaran commercial.

So, you two just moved to the complex?

What did you say your names were again?

I'm Dylan and this is my wife, Dylan.

Oh... same name couple.
That's the dream.

I have an idea, why don't we all
play a board game?

Great idea.

Have you guys ever played
<i>The Wrath of the Star Eclipse:</i>

<i>Empire: Twilight of Destruction?</i>

Wh-What is that?
Is that... is that like <i>Sorry!</i> ?

Um, does <i>Sorry! </i>have a 900-sided die

and its own language of rules?

Oh, we love that game.

Yeah, that sounds like fun.

Why don't you guys set it up,
and we'll get our new friends

drinks from the kitchen, huh?

What the hell do you guys
think you're doing?

I could ask you
the same question, and I shall.

What the hell do you guys
think you're doing?!

I'll tell you what we're doing--

in our lives.

And we're not gonna let you ruin that.

as the old farts you are.

Oh, you're gonna expose us?

Don't care, long as you don't pan

I went way back.

Okay, Peter, your turn.

Uh...

Why are you looking
at your navigation chart

when we're still at the beginning

of the first build phase?

You know what I like to do
when I play games?

Pete, you go first.

Oh, that's an easy question. 19...

Heads up.

Ow!
Dad, what the hell?

Did you join a frat?

I tried to, but I got the letters mixed up

and joined a fart.

(flatulence)

(laughs)

Hey, everyone, I'm in college,
but here's a test for you.

We just gave you the easiest joke setup

in <i>Family Guy</i> history:
Peter joins a fart house.

Is the correct punchline A?

B?

Or C?

Good luck to you.
And now back to our story.

Hey, ladies, toga farty tonight
at I Delta PU.

-Tell your friends.
-Ew, no.

Heh, they all say that.

-Hey, what are you reading?
-Boning up for an exam.

I boned up yesterday when
I walked into the girls' shower.

(classic slide whistle riff)

Dad, <i>please!</i>

Sorry, Meg, I've been smoking
doobies all morning.

Talk about higher education.

(classic up-down slide)

That's it.
I can't take this anymore.

Dad, get out of here.

What?
This is what college is.

How do you know?
You're not even a student here.

You're a total fraud.

Me?
You wouldn't even be here

if your mother and I didn't

-pay someone to get you in.
-What?!

Yeah, your whole application was fake.

Meg, is this true?

What?
No, of course not, Dean Nearby.

Well, if it is,
you're going to be suspended.

Oh, no.

Well, that weekend on the Cape

with Principal Shepherd was a waste.

I know I said I wouldn't get clingy,

but when can I see you again?

I can't believe
they suspended Meg.

Suspended Meg?
Peter, you and I could be going to jail.

I can't go to jail.
Me and my fart brothers

are supposed to streak the quad later.

(plays "Charge" riff)

Now stop that.
You're not in

whatever you think college is anymore.

I can't believe you two did this to me.

Maybe if you believed in me,

none of this would have happened.

Meg, honey, nobody wanted you
out of this house

more than we did.

You know, maybe there's a way

none of you gets in trouble.

What are you talking about?

Well, you said you can do

all those things on your application.

If you show you actually can
do those things,

you're all in the clear.

Coming up tonight: Quahog's own

and graces us with her...
Oh, God, that's tonight?

Hey, Jerome, turn on the game.

Sorry, guys, cable's out.

We're only getting local stations.

Oh, what, so now we got
to talk sports to pass the time?

Or maybe watch <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

Just as, like, a goof.

You know, if you want to talk sports,

I've got quite a story to tell.

Oh! Oh! This is the one
where Lorelai's mom makes

her martini with an onion
instead of an olive.

Boy, that's a passive-aggressive move.

If you knew her mom, you'd know that's

a passive-aggressive move.

It all started when I was a young boy...

Last chance on this <i>Gilmore Girls</i> thing.

I was a baseball prodigy.

It was back home in the Cuban league.

<i>I grew up working in the tobacco</i>
<i>fields outside of Havana.</i>

<i>That's where I learned to play baseball.</i>

<i>Our mitts were made of cigars,</i>
<i>some of them still going.</i>

All right! Ha! All right, I caught it!

<i>At night I drove a cab.</i>

<i>We all had to drive huge cars there.</i>

<i>I was just a regular young man</i>
<i>wearing pants</i>

<i>that went above my belly button.</i>

Pull your pants up.

<i>When I was nine, my father took me</i>

<i>to my first baseball game.</i>

<i>Fidel Castro was there</i>
<i>to throw out the first pitch.</i>

<i>He was wearing the same outfit as always.</i>

<i>Later we would find out</i>
<i>he had a fashion disease</i>

<i>known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</i>

<i>We would write more jokes about him,</i>

<i>but our dumb-dumb writers</i>
<i>only know what he looks like.</i>

Strike!

(cheering and applause)

<i>We all worshipped Che Guevara.</i>

<i>Although none of us really knew</i>
<i>what side he was on.</i>

Now Mommy's on a quick break till 3:30.

(sighs) Toughest job in the world.

Oh, look, Kylie's mom is out of rehab.

Good morning, little guy.

Hey, Janet, good to see you.

Hey, listen, thank you so much
for your apology email.

An individual one would have been nice,

but one to the whole class was fine, too.

Have a good day, Stewie.

(loud thud)

Oh, my God, please be a dog.
Please be a dog.

(crying): Ow. Ow...

Oh, my God, it's a kid!

It's Doug! Nice hit, bitch.

Oh, and Elsa underwear.

This day just keeps getting better!

Well, thank you all for coming.

Can I get anyone something to drink?

I'm fine, but Doug's
mother would probably like

three martinis,
and then to have unprotected sex

with her boss at work.

And Doug's father would
love a glass of warm tap water

and to never make more than $30,000 a year

for the rest of his life.

And here we go.

Okay, well, I am just so sorry

about what happened with Doug.

I just didn't see the little guy.

Well, maybe you ought
to get your eyes examined.

I appreciate that
it was an accident, Mrs. Griffin.

But nonetheless, we've retained a lawyer.

Well, there must be some way
short of a lawsuit

we can make this up to you.

Well, this is my weekend with Doug,

but I've got tickets to see Lana Del Rey

with our former nanny Jessica.

(exhales sharply)

She's 24. So as a form of settlement,

maybe this weekend you
can put together a tree house

I don't want to deal with.

Fine. If that's what I have to do
to make this right,

then Peter and my children
will build your son's tree house.

Deal.

All right, I guess now the four men

awkwardly sit here
while my mom gives your mom

a tour of the house
that doesn't deserve one.

LOIS: And this is a room
adjacent to the room

we were just in.

DOUG'S MOTHER: Ooh, what a fun house.

Okay, Mrs. Griffin, tell me what you see.

Um, I see a cow in a lab coat,

some vultures in a cowboy hat,

and a dog trying to trick a cat
into a clothes dryer.

Just as I thought. You're Far-Sided.

Oh, no. What-what do I do about it?

Oh, well, I'm no doctor, but I would say

you either need to get
glasses or maybe LASIK.

Is that the surgery people get

and then tell everybody they got it?

Yes, it's the veganism
of elective surgery.

If you're unsure of what to do,

here's a video of Radiohead front man

and super weirdo Thom Yorke
to help you decide.

Hello, I'm Thom Yorke.

You might know me from Radiohead

or my passing resemblance
to a melting Tilda Swinton.

Not many people
know that I'm blind in one eye.

Can you guess which one?

-This is awful.
-Wait, just give it a few minutes.

All his stuff starts kind of slow.

Fine, I'll get the LASIK.

Great.
Make an appointment with my nurse.

Now here's a lollipop
from the Sackler family

that says, "Sowwy."

<i>THOM YORKE: In the future,</i>
<i>we won't even need our eyes.</i>

<i>Computers will see for us.</i>

Mrs. Griffin, the surgery was a success.

And by that, I mean the hospital agreed

to take your Discover card.

Plus, we'll get one percent of that back,

which is basically like getting nothing.

(gasps)
Oh, my God... I'm blind.

PETER:
What do you mean you're blind?

-Y-You can't see me right now?
-No!

But you can still see, like,
the stove and laundry, right?

But, Mom, we got you a balloo...

Shh, shh, shh.

(whispers):
She doesn't know about the balloon.

Don't worry, Lois,
we'll be right by your side

the whole time,
and not outside playing with a balloon.

(Peter laughing)

I love you, balloon.

Oh-oh, oh, no, no!

I'm coming, balloon!

(air hisses, Peter inhales)

(helium voice):
Don't tell your mother about this.

Don't worry, Lois,
I went blind a while back.

It was cool.
They're some of the last people

you can still make fun of.

-Dad!
-It's fine, they won't see this.

Dr. Hartman,
you said there was very little risk

to LASIK, but now I am blind.

How did this happen?

Okay, look, this isn't my fault.

It was Take-Your-Cat-To-Work day.

(meows)

Dr. Hartman, what does this mean,
you know, for me?

Well, whatever your wife did for you,

you'll now have to do for yourselves.

And until she gets used to her new life,

you'll need to take care of her.

Feed her, bathe her, drive her places.

-They're gone, aren't they?
-They left, yes.

There they are.
I thought we said 10:00 sharp,

but we must have said 10:18.

(chuckles)
No one's fault, but going forward,

let's make sure
we respect each other's time, hmm?

-You must be Chris.
-I must?

You know, we have a friend in common:

Mr. Herbert.

How do you know Mr. Herbert?

We're friends.
Sometimes he comes to my art shows,

and we get ice cream after.

Let me guess: he takes you to the park

where the swings go really high?

-He does.
-Uh-huh.

That'll stop.
And the ice cream?

Don't get used to it.

I've seen a thousand of you.
I've outlasted them.

I'll outlast you.

Okay. Uh, my dad
left a note for you, Mr. Griffin.

"Griffins, build this tree house

and there's the one

Oh, okay.
Um, hello.

Uh, my name is Lois Griffin,

and I... am blind.

Uh, I went to the hospital
for a simple surgery

and woke up in the ICU.

But the irony was I couldn't see you.

I couldn't see anyone or anything.

Even the people closest to me

who need to be seen the most.

So now I suppose if I want to see again,

I'll have to listen more

and-and feel more and focus on

what's on the inside
and not what I can see on the outside.

(sighs)

Okay, that's all for now.

I mean, oh, my God, Kendall?

-Kendall! And Shiv?
-Love Shiv.

-And what about Roman?
-Yes.

And Logan.

-Oh, Logan.
-(dog whines)

Oh, look at that dog.

Yeah, who brings a dog to a coffee shop?

-I love dogs.
-Without letting me pet it.

Come here, you... dog.

Oh, isn't he so sweet?

Oh, good boy.

Yay, my hand smells like you now.

Oh, I'm so happy you're a dog person.

I don't think I could be with someone

who doesn't love dogs as much as I do.

Yeah, it's great we like the same things

as soon as you say what you like.

So, what kind of dog do you have?

Well, uh, uh, what kind of dog?

Um... you know, I-I've never noticed.

I... I'm... I'm more attracted
to his spirit.

Oh, they're so special.

And you know
what's right around the corner?

The strip club
where they spit in your face?

No, the dog park.

For our next date,
we should bring our dogs there.

Next date?
Absolutely.

-Oh, and cousin Greg.
-Cousin Greg.

Cousin Greg.

Phew, that tummy time was killer.

Totally blasted my core.

But I think that earns me a little treat.

What the deuce?

This bag was full last night,

and now half of it's gone.

Oh, my God, I've been robbed!

Rupert, check the jewelry box,
see if anything's missing.

"An engagement ring"?

Oh, ha-ha, very funny, but not the time

to have this conversation--
we've been burgled!

Well, looks like they only stole
some of my Halloween candy.

But they're not going
to get away with this.

Like the fat man when he plays Clue.

Okay, the murderer was "don't care,"

with a "this game sucks"

in the "I regret having children."

<i>ANNOUNCER: </i>Clue--
<i>you got someone pregnant nine years ago,</i>

<i>so now you have to play this.</i>

Thanks for coming with me, Peter.

I need a dog for my date,

but I don't know
the first thing about 'em.

No problem, Quagmire.
But just know

I'm gonna spend most of the time here

finding the courage to hold an iguana.

Here he is.

I'm not sure I'm ready.

(barking)

Uh, excuse me, how much is that one?

Oh, he's a purebred Bichon Frise,

so he's $1,500.

For a dog?
Um, and-and what's your return policy?

Is it, like, full money back
within ten days?

Sir, if you're not interested,
I have to comb feces

out of the guinea pigs' hair
with a wet paper towel.

Go ahead, you can touch him.

(gasps)

It's dry.

Sorry we couldn't get you a dog.

Come on in, we'll have
however many beers it takes

to forget how depressing the shelter was.

I'll go get those aforementioned beers.

Thanks, word-a-day calendar.

Oh, hey, Quagmire.

Mm.

I mean, mmm, there he is!

Brian the dog.

What's going on here?
Why are you using my full name?

All right, let's cut to the chase.

I like chases.

Okay, look, I'm seeing this woman,

and there's something different about her.

I mean, it's not just that
the sex is great, which it is,

but I appreciate her as a person,

which sounds kind of weird
coming out of my mouth.

Anyway, I told her I have a dog, so...

would you pretend to be my dog?

(laughing)

Well, well, well.

Well, well, well.

Well, well, well.

Brian, come on, I'm serious.
Will you help me out?

Glenn Quagmire, there are not enough

tennis balls in the world for me to...

-I have six.
-I'll do it.

(dogs barking, howling)

Thanks for doing this, Brian.

And remember, just act like a normal,

well-behaved, non-talking dog.

-Non-talking?
-Yeah, just bark and stuff.

Bark?
Geez, it's been a while.

Let me give it a try.

Brack.

Brack?
What the hell is that?

-I'm finding it.
-Damn it, Brian.

I knew you were gonna
screw this up for me.

I thought you wanted to help.

Help? I'm not doing this
because I want to help.

I'm only doing this
so I can have a front-row seat

when you crash and burn.

Okay, first of all,
it's incredibly insensitive

to say "crash and burn" to a pilot.

And, second, how dare you?

How dare you, Brian the dog?

You know I'm right--
you're gonna get tired of the sex

and then you'll move on to the next one.

Oh, 'cause you know everything, right?

Well, you're wrong, Brian.

Okay, shut up, here she comes.

Hi, Glenn.
This is Dexter.

Aw, and who's this little guy?

Uh, uh, this is... Harvey.

Named after Weinstein, uh...

'C-Cause you can see his balls
when he answers the door.

I may be dating myself, but in the '90s,

the funniest thing you could do
was show people your balls.

C-Can you start talking now, please?

Sorry, I couldn't hear you

'cause my dog was licking my ear.

Oh, thank God.
This is my dog, Bob...

Weinstein.

He's man's best friend

because he's very good at keeping quiet.

Do you mind if I take
five minutes in the parking lot?

This is Spot.

All right, Rupert,
when the thief comes back

for the rest of my candy,

he'll have to deal
with my latest invention.

Hey, Stewie, what are you d...

Aah! Aah! Help!
Somebody help me!

I won't survive on the inside.

(grunts)
Thief! I've caught you!

Chris?

Stewie, get off.

I haven't been stealing your candy.

-Dad has.
-The fat man?

He did the same thing to me
when I was younger.

The only way to keep him
away from it is to hide it.

And that's why I'm here.

I'm gonna help you.

Really?
You'd do that for me?

Of course, Stewie.
We're family.

We look out for each other,

like the people on <i>Succession.</i>

Well, don't leave me hanging like that--
throw out a name.

-Tom.
-Oh, Tom.

Can you believe Tom?

Carrie's gonna be here soon.
Can you give me a hand getting

-this cat stuff out of here?
-Where is your cat, anyway?

I don't know.
No cat owner knows where their cat is.

Okay, but I still don't know why

you're going through all this trouble.

I mean, you're just gonna bail
and leave her in the dust.

-Hey, how's your son, Brian?
-Whoa!

What happened to DEFCON four,
three, and two?

-(doorbell rings)
-Okay, she's here.

Get off the couch.

-Who is it?
-It's <i>The Purge.</i>

-We're here to beat you up.
-(laughs)

(smooching)

Coming up, one pizza
with alternative crust.

Oh. Yummy, yummy.

Alternative crust pizza
is really good, Brian.

You can't taste the difference.

What aren't you lying to yourself about?

Okay, you want to know the truth, Brian?

Brian the dog?
I love her.

You hear me?
Love.

This is priceless.

I haven't had this much fun

since I went to that graveyard.

-Yeah, how do you like
how this sounds, huh?
-(urine trickling)

Try cleaning up this mess
while you burn in hell.

-Peter, you ready to go?
-Almost.

-What do you mean you don't like that?
-(urine trickling)

Just try it, maybe you will.

Thanks again for having us over, Lois.

Everything was so delicious.

Oh, my pleasure, Carrie.

Yeah, I've got to say, Glenn,

I've never seen you this happy before.

Well, then you've never
seen me at my best before.

And it's all thanks to Carrie.

Aw, not at the dinner table.

I'm sorry, Peter,
I just can't help myself.

I'm crazy about this woman.

(phone buzzing)

Huh?

(panting)

-"Will you marry me?"
-What's this now?

Oh, my God, Glenn, yes.
Yes, of course I'll marry you.

Mmm...

Mazel tov!

Mazel tov?
Where did that come from?

From Marvelous Mrs. Mazel Tov.
Y-you should know that, Lois.

Mmm.

Engaged?

Aw, come on, Quagmire,
you're killing me, man.

Babe, babe, please...
Babe, please stop crying.

Look, every couple
needs to take things at their own speed.

It doesn't mean I love you any less.

Okay, look-- how about
we look at rings this weekend?

I-I don't know.
Zales, probably?

Well, that's what we can afford
since only one of us has a job.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Ugh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

(sighs)

"Why don't you join me for dinner?"
he said,

ruining his life.

(humming a tune)

There he is, the bridegroom to be.

That's right, the very happy
bridegroom to be,

singing to himself.

<i>Parade</i> magazine says

owning a dog is the secret
to having a happy life.

You read <i>Parade</i> magazine?

If you know a better magazine
for ordering plates

with people's faces on them,
I would like to hear about it.

(loud crash)

CARRIE: Hey, babe,
was the Princess Diana plate important?

(sighs)

Brian, can you hand me
that <i>Parade</i> magazine,

that envelope, that stamp
and that checkbook?

(singsongy):
Thank you.

Who are we waiting for, Chris?

I called in some professionals.

They're gonna take us somewhere
Dad'll never find your candy.

-And where's that?
-I can't say.

There are ears everywhere.

Good morning, Mr. Feldman.

Morning, Chris.
Couldn't help but overhear

you're off on a little trip.

(chuckles)
Never mind about that, Mr. Feldman.

-(quietly): See?
-MR. FELDMAN: I could hear that.

Get in.

(loud thump)

You know, I should really
be in a backwards-facing car seat.

They're now saying kids through eight

should at least be in a booster seat.

-You have any kids?
-Don't make small talk with these guys.

No, no, it's all right.

It's nice to have someone
ask for a change.

Yes, I have four children, all dead.

Ah.

Well, here we are.

Quick, hide your candy in the tree.

Is this our backyard?

Yes. But we couldn't
take a chance of being followed.

(grunting)

Son of a... I'm pinching and lifting.

(cries out)

Oh!

Hey, if you're making coffee,
I'll have a...

Whoa, kind of a mess in here.

It's fine.
Everything is fine.

I'm happy and in love.

Damn it, Brian, did you leave
the doggy gate open?

-(all barking)
-No, no, no, stop it!

Peppy, you're allergic to Frankie's food.

Malcolm, stop humping your brother.

Backsy, outside.

CARRIE:
Babe, can you give me a hand

moving my furniture

all around the room
until I find a place I like for it?

Kind of in the middle of something, babe.

Ah, the seven-hour itch.

Shut up, Brian.
Why don't you go for a walk?

-(dogs barking excitedly)
-No, no, no, no, no.

No walk! No walk!
No, no.

We're not going for a walk!

I got to stop saying "walk."

I said walk again.
And there again.

CARRIE:
Honey, I want to make a stir-fry tonight.

-Have we unpacked the wok?
-(dogs barking louder)

No, no, w-O-K.

W-O-K! She said wok.

(sobbing): She said wok!

She said wok...

(gasps)

My candy-- it's all gone.

Even my West Hollywood candy.

My Twinx bar.
My very Milky Way.

My Reese's Penis.

Who's done this to me?

Who's taken candy from a baby?

Well, we did it.
Cheers.

We sure did, Chris.

-Cool iguana.
-He's dry.

I named him Arid.

Thank you, word-a-day calendar,
travel edition.

Just met some of Carrie's friends.

They are very excited for her.

-Well, they should be.
-Well, they should be.

And they are.

Anyway, expectations are high.

Thank you, everyone,
for coming to our engagement party.

And an extra thanks to my airline buddies

for organizing it.

Uh, folks, our party time tonight is

two hours and 48 minutes.

We know you have lots of choices

for terrible weekend activities,
and we hope to see you soon

on an inconvenient weekend
for their destination wedding,

which I hear is on a Thursday
in Lisbon, Portugal.

-WOMAN: That's so far!
-MAN: Come on!

Yep. Yep.

It's been wonderful meeting
all of Carrie's family

and friends.
(chuckles)

I only wish you were all wearing nametags.

(laughter)

Isn't he adorable?

My expectations are high.

You know, I first met Carrie and her niece

a couple of weeks ago on Halloween.

Thank God they decided to take that walk.

And now we're headed down the aisle--

a very different kind of walk.

(barking excitedly)

And, Carrie, if I may borrow a line

from our favorite song,

I would walk 500 miles...

Stampede!

(dogs barking)

-Isn't he adorable?
-He loves those dogs.

I'm hearing a lot of good things
about that guy.

That's it.

Glenn, are you okay?

No, I'm not okay.

I thought I could do this, but I can't.

I've been lying to you,

and I've been lying to myself.

There's something you need to know.

I hate dogs.

(all gasp)

Uh, this party has begun
its initial descent.

That's not even my dog.

That's Brian, my neighbor's dog.
He can talk.

Brian, say something.

-Brack.
-Bite me.

Glenn... (scoffs)
I can't believe this.

So you don't like dogs, that's fine.

But you didn't have to lie
and put me through all of this.

Goodbye, Glenn.

Uh, folks, please use caution
as you exit the party,

as some of your feelings may have shifted.

Well, well, well.

Save it, Brian.
I'll concede that you were right.

But you know what?
So was I.

Dogs are the worst.

And I'm coming for you, Brian the dog.

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

But one day.

Maybe tomorrow.

And when that day comes, you're gonna say,

"Ooh, Glenn got me good."

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take a walk.

Brack?

Oh, no.
Stay...

You're coming back, though, right?

Hey, Brian, I was just
over talking to Quagmire,

and he thought you might
want to take a look

at my new screenplay.

Oh, I-I don't really, uh...

It's called <i>Ocean's 1.</i>

Between you and me, I can't believe

nobody's done it before,

to say nothing of <i>Ocean's 2</i> through <i>7.</i>

Yeah, I-I could, uh, take a look, sure.

It's a little long right now.

It's about 430 pages.

I have my "all is lost" moment
on page 389, thereabouts.

Quagmire!

Now, if'n you don't know,
most Hollywood screenplays

wrap up at around 110 pages.

And if'n it's a comedy, why,
you want it in the 90s.

Anyway, they said I could
have these last few seconds

to mention something near and dear to me.

So, men, don't be afraid
to have the doctor

put a camera up your old saddle masher.

They knock you out now,
and it's a good way

to make sure there's
no bad beans in your mess wagon.

Welcome to tumbling class.

Moms, please enjoy,

while dads grumble
about how much the class costs.

240 bucks for a mat and a room.

Now let's all gather 'round

because Stewie is gonna do a somersault.

(grunting)

(groans) Nailed it.

Well, that's basically fine,
and I don't honestly care,

so unless there's an
unexpected appearance from a rival baby...

Perhaps <i>I</i> could take a shot.

-(gasps)
-It's Doug!

That's Stewie's rival.

What are you doing here, Doug?

Eh, thought I'd give
this tumbling thing a try.

So what do I do, just fall down

like literally anyone affected by gravity?

Um, there's a bit more to it than that.

One can't just show up
and hope to execute,

say, a perfect somers...

Oh, oh, he's very good!

(cheering)

Hmm. Something like that?

-Wow!
-Now that's tumbling!

Boys can be good at this till nine,
then the whispers start.

Calm down, it wasn't that great.

Stewie, give Doug your shirt and overalls.

He's my son now.

<i>ANNOUNCER: We now return</i>
<i>to Christopher Nolan's </i>Tenet.

I'm already completely lost.

Dad, can I ask you something about girls?

Are you wearing a wire?

There's a girl in my class
I have a crush on,

and I can't get her to notice me.

Ah, now I understand.

Lucky for you,
there's a bunch of old movies

on this very subject.

Here. <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

<i>Can't Buy Me Love, Say Anything...</i>

all on very inconvenient VHS.

VHS? What do those letters stand for?

That information has been lost to history.

Anyway, Chris, just watch these movies

and do what the 28-year-old teenagers do.

I guess I could try.

After all, they tried to do<i> Superman</i>
in Boston once.

I've noticed that you're never around
when Superman's here.

Are... are you Superman?

What is ya, wacked in the head?

I'm Clahk. Plain ol' Clahk.

Okay, back to our Boston newspaper job.

-(phone rings)
<i>-Spotlight.</i>

What?!

(gasping, murmuring)

Show-and-tell time.

Finally a chance to reclaim my honor

after that whole tumbling fiasco.

Next up for show-and-tell: Stewie.

Hello, everyone.

This is a weird seashell

that kind of looks like female genitalia

that my dad likes.

Lois, where's my she shell?

Oh, Stewie took it to show-and-tell.

Well, I hope no one puts it to their ear.

Incredible, right?

(yawns)

Thank you, Stewie.

And, so you know,
many middle-aged women have seashells

in their powder rooms.

Okay, next up is Doug.

Hello, gang,

and have I got some show-and-tell for you.

This is a ticket stub from a PG movie

that I got to see in the theater...

alone.

KIDS:
Wow!

Also, I've been on a Disney cruise.

Hey, who's this in the picture with Moana?

(chuckles):
Oh, me? Huh.

-KID: No way!
-KID 2: Moana is famously agoraphobic.

Yes, but she's managing it day by day,

thanks to CBD oil.

This cruise was a big step for her.

Okay, I think we can all agree that

these are very lame show-and-tell...

And finally, a piece of candy
from the London airport.

(gasps)
Aw, a Lion Bar?

I'm sorry, did I say "a piece of candy"?

More like British candy
for the whole class!

Drumstick Squashies
and rose-flavored wine gums

-for everyone!
-(cheering)

Hello,
Show-and-Tell National Championships

in DeKalb, Illinois,
I have a nominee for you.

Dammit.
I'm sick of being one-upped by Doug.

Hurts.

It hurts worse than
a trip to the barber shop.

(screaming)

This is what babies
think happens at haircuts!

(knocking)

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Burbeck.

Do you have a daughter named Jennifer,

who is currently smeared across Highway 9?

Joe, it's us.

Oh, sorry.
That's my next stop.

Peter, your son was lurking
outside a classmate's window

with this boom box, playing Peter Gabriel.

He's being charged with felony stalking.

I also tried to use science
to make a sex slave

from a magazine photo.

Oh, this is horrifying!

-Actually, it's the '80s.
-What?

Well, it appears that someone
has exposed your son

to the very problematic
teen films of the 1980s.

Peter, tell me it wasn't you.

Honestly, Lois, I have no idea.

My brain can't even think thoughts no more

-'cause of the Internet.
-Ugh, that's it.

From now on, you are an outside Peter.

Go on! Get!

(kissing noises)
Outside!

(grunts)

Go to your Peter house.
Go to your Peter house!

(thunder crashes)

God, look at Doug over there,

throwing a Frisbee
with the kindergarteners

and a shorter-than-average first-grader.

-Thinks he's so cool.
-Yup.

There must be some way
I can finally one-up that guy,

and you're clearly
looking for cat turds right now.

Yup. Y... Huh?
Wait, uh, wait.

-(sniffs) Aw, gum.
-Help me out, man.

I need something to win back
everyone's attention.

Wait, I know!

What if I flip my eyelids inside out?

Show everyone what a freak I am.

Huh?
I could carve this out.

Right?
This could be my thing.

I don't think so, Stewie.

All right, well what if I just,
like, do Doug's mom?

Uh... Y...
I-I mean, yeah, yeah, that...

I mean, that would...
that would pretty much do it.

Awesome! How do you
dial a phone or have sex?

Or stand up without using your hands?

Let me tell you something, Brian...

(wind whistles)

Oh, no!

You said it,
relatively-short-first-grader.

That Frisbee is way up there.

I'm too scared to climb up that high.

Me, too, average-height-kindergartener.

That jungle gym dates back to the 1930s,

when the lives of children
were expendable.

Someone would have to be crazy
to climb up there.

STEWIE:
I'll do it.

What?

I'll climb up there and get that Frisbee.

Doug may be afraid, but I'm not.

Just give me a day
to get prepared and gear up,

and at sunrise tomorrow,
I will climb up there

and retrieve that Frisbee.

Or we can ask Spider-Man to do it.

He came to my birthday party.
I know him.

That wasn't the real Spider-Man.
That was your dad.

We could see his hernia
popping through the suit.

Hey, Tyler!

Heard Spider-Man
had a pretty good time at your party.

Don't mind me, Brian.
Just pushing the edge.

Hmm.

14 zippers, if you must know,

but it's not about my pants, Brian.

It's about my fearlessness and pants.

Now, I need to plan out

every last inch of my climb tomorrow.

If I do this right,
I'm gonna be remembered forever,

like 9/11 was for a few years.

You're just climbing a jungle gym.

-It's not a big deal.
-Not a big deal?

I pull this off, I go down in history!

Like my ancestor: The Guy
Who Was Hanged Next to Nathan Hale.

I regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

If you kill me,
I'm gonna immediately void.

All over here. All over here.

You, historian,
write down both our things.

Hey, Lois, how about
we get a little three-way going?

-You, me and the seashell?
-Oh, forget it, Peter.

After that whole
thing with the '80s movies,

I'm very upset with you.

Well, can you use that anger in the sex?

No, Peter, your '80s nostalgia
isn't funny anymore.

It's tired and worn out,
and borderline dangerous.

I mean, those old references
just don't play

-the same in today's world.
-What you talkin' 'bout, Lois?

This!
This is exactly what I'm talking about!

When are you gonna let the '80s go?

Never!
The '80s will always be the best decade.

And I'm confident

that non-whites and women
would agree with that.

Everyone else, too.
And I'm gonna prove it.

Family!
Come here conveniently fast, please!

What is it, Peter?

I have decided to prove to you all

that the '80s are still relevant
and hilarious.

-But they're not.
-And in keeping with the wonderful 1980s,

I'm gonna go upstairs
and drill a hole in the wall

to watch girls shower.

Peter, in addition to that
being wildly problematic,

you can't just drill a hole
in a structural wall.

Do you even know how to do that?

Okay, that's one drywall bit,
one masonry bit,

one spur point bit, one tile bit,

one drill with a hammer action setting,

one wire detector, one stud finder,

and one grease pencil.

Sounds like someone's
drilling a hole in the wall

to watch girls shower.

You claim to be an ally to women,

but I bet you don't even know
Nancy Pelosi's official title.

Sure, I do.
She's, uh...

Chuck Schumer's secretary.

Forget it, Brian. Now, can you
strap me to this milking table?

My wife will be home soon.

Stewie Griffin,

do you want to tell me
why you didn't hold up

your end of the bargain
with Miss Tiggywinkles?

Seriously?
Maybe because you failed

to mention she was a real, living cat.

Hey, I killed your monkey.

Don't you see how that's different?

We had a deal.

No, I know.
I-I... But I just...

I d-I don't... I don't think...

Boy, this is really gonna
hurt your reputation

with my kindergarten friends.

You have kindergarten friends?

(chuckles): Oh, yeah.

I let them throw pinecones at me
all the time.

But now I'm gonna have to
tell them you welshed on me.

(sucks teeth)
Kindergartners hate welshers.

Kindergartners, eh?

You know what?
I'll do it.

Good choice, Stewie.

Hey, m-maybe after all this is done,

I-I could get kindergartners
throwing pinecones at me?

(chuckles): Whoa, slow down, champ.

They start you at driveway pebbles.

Ah, Brian, just the man
I was hoping to see.

You don't like cats, do you?

-I hate 'em.
-Sit.

Three of Lois' sweaty jogging bras.

Have I really been that good of a boy?

Depends.
I got a cat problem.

You get rid of my cat, this is all yours.

-Done.
-Go ahead, boy.

(sniffing)

Oh, yeah.

She ran fast because Bonnie was watching.

-What happened to you?
-I'm not really sure.

I was in line at the bank,
and this human-sized chicken

cut in front of me.

Well, I wasn't gonna let that stand.

I had a weird day, too.

I asked, like, seven people

if they were gonna watch
the SpaceX launch.

And I-I don't even know what that is.

Hey, you two are both acting very strange,

and I think I know what it is.

He's wearing your underwear
and you're wearing his.

How do you know that?

Well, you know, when some people go blind

their other senses are heightened.

When I lost my legs,
I gained a sense of underpants.

What are you talking about?
We didn't switch underwear.

Oh, are you sure about that?
Stand up

and let Jojo flip your taggies.

Turn around.
Butt-to-butt.

Hanes.

Planes.

(laughing)

Whoo!

What the hell?

We must've accidentally
grabbed the wrong ones

at the Laundromat.

Oh, so your boys were

where his boys were.

And your boys were where his boys were.

-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

Hey, what are you guys talking about?

Peter and Quagmire exchanged underwear.

Ha! Classic.

Me, I don't wear underwear.

I just wear trunks.

Tree guy.

That'll hit you when you're driving home.

Hey, look at this table.
What are you guys talking about?

Oh, hey, I-I, uh...

I didn't-I didn't know
you take out trash, too.

Yeah, I-I, uh...
O-Only on trash days.

No, right, of course.
Yeah, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I...

(sighs)

(chuckles): I'm not sure what to say.

(chuckles)
I know. It's awkward.

I thought things would go back to normal

after we traded underwear yesterday.

(playing "Taps")

I'm gonna have Lois
cancel our dinner plans

with you and Ida tomorrow.

I-I think it's too soon.

Hey, you don't think the guys
are talking about us, do you?

Oh, I don't think so.

Oh, my God.

I still can't believe they
wore each other's underwear.

Like, can you imagine?

I know, right?

Like, icky times a thousand.

Hey, this is crazy,

but what if we wore
each other's underwear,

-just for a joke?
-What?

No, that's a terrible idea.

Yeah, just-just joking.

So stupid!

Can I be done now?

Okay, you go in there, kill Miss T,

and we'll sneak out the back.

You need a weapon or anything?

She's a cat, I'm a dog.
I'm good.

-(Brian barking)
-(rattling)
-(Miss Tiggywinkles snarls)

(Brian growling)

-(rattling stops)
-(Brian growls)
-(Miss Tiggywinkles meows)

(loud meow)

It went poorly.

Thanks again for having us over, Lois.

Zesty Italian?
Oh, I-I just couldn't.

Not this close to bedtime.

(whispers):
You said you were gonna cancel dinner.

(whispers):
I have zero control in my marriage.

Whoops. (chuckles)
I dropped my roll,

which is not at all
an invitation for Peter

to have an under-the-table conference.

Ha. Darn thing's always coming off.

Excuse me for one moment, won't you?

-Why did you do that?
-You dropped all the bread.

-What was I supposed to do?
-Okay, that makes sense.

So, I went to the underwear doctor and...

you should probably get checked.

They say when you wear
someone's underwear,

you're also wearing the underwear

of everyone whose underwear they've worn.

I can't believe this.

I thought I knew you, Glenn Quagmire.

(chuckles)
Here I go again, filling up on ears.

What's going on here, you two?

You're being very rude.

Lois spent all day overcooking this meal.

We accidentally wore
each other's underwear.

(laughing)

I can't believe you wore
each other's undies.

(laughs)
This is hysterical.

-(banging)
-CHRIS: Shut! Up!

Oh, it's not even Wednesday.

CHRIS:
It's Tuesday night!

That's part of it!

Guys, this isn't funny.

Relax, Peter.
It's no big deal.

You don't get it.

Oh, quit being so dramatic.

Ladies switch underwear all the time.

I might be wearing Bonnie's right now.

I don't even remember.

While that is super sexy
and being stored for later,

it's very different for guys.

That's not true, male friends can be

more intimate than they used to.

-BOTH: Nope.
-And the lines of sexuality are

-more fluid than ever.
-BOTH: Nope.

And people aren't so quick
to judge or label.

-Please stop.
-Masculinity just doesn't
account for stuff like this.

Look, guys can share laughs and beers,

but we don't share feelings,
emotions or underwear.

Between male friends,
there's no coming back from this.

He's right. I'm afraid
our relationship is on the skids.

Maybe there's hope for the future,

but things now are too spotty.

I just don't know if there's
any front-to-back to this.

Our reputations are smeared.

If I wasn't so yellow,
maybe I'd push harder.

But, hey, we had
a really good streak, huh?

What's going on out there, Dad?

We accidentally wore
each other's underwear,

so Mr. Quagmire is moving.

Oh, wow.

Yeah, obviously, one of you would need to.

Peter, this is completely ridiculous.

Babe.
What's done is done.

Look, I don't have a lot of friends,

it's kind of a problem on the show.

But if I did, I would never
let anything come between us,

especially a pair of underwear.

You know what, Lois?
You're right.

Now go tell him not to move.

♪ ♪

Quagmire,

I just want to say that you can
wreck a good pair of underwear,

but you can't wreck a good friendship.

That's nice, Peter.

Underwear should never
come between two friends.

Well, it kind of should.

(chuckles):
Yeah, yeah. It kind of should, yeah.

Will you help me move my stuff
back inside?

Only if I can do it half naked

and in front of all our neighbors.

Not my first choice, but okay.

Miss Tiggywinkles, wake up.

You've got to get out of here.

Oh, my God, you're dead!

-(camera shutter clicks)
-Well, what do we have here?

Stewie Griffin, cat murderer?

What?
You psycho.

You killed her?

Maybe I did, maybe she died
of natural causes.

The only thing that matters is

that now I have the goods on you.

Oh, that's a terrible photo.
Would you mind doing it again?

Aw, yeah.
That's cute.

-Can you send me that?
-No.

Give me that picture!

Hey, Doug.
Sorry about your kitty.

I guess the pet store didn't
have a men's department, huh?

Uh, well, I tried to get a...

Hey, I don't want to be
too tired to drive home.

Later, losers.

I'm five.

-That's Tyler.

He's, uh, kind of my Doug.

Boy, we all get a Doug, huh?

Yeah, Tyler's Doug is a drunk stepdad.

-Yikes.
-Yeah.

Well, I'm glad everyone's
back in their regular underwear

and everything's back to normal.

Me too.

And thank you for cleaning
the milking table.

Well, we had quite a week as well.

We sure did.

I mean, you got your ass kicked by a cat.

Well, it was really more of a draw.

Yeah, whatever.
Hey, you want to end the show

with a "To Be Continued" meme?"

I-I don't even know what that...

"Happy Birthday, Dog"?

Sorry, I spaced on your name
at the party store.

Have a good one, Brent.

(doorbell rings)

Thanks for having us, Peter.

I don't recall inviting Kevin, but sure.

BRIAN: His name you remember!

I think it's ridiculous
to have a party for a dog.

Why spend money on something
he can't even comprehend?

(growling)

This ball is nuts.

Hey, happy birthday, Brian!

Bonnie and I got you a big stick.

Wow, thank you!

I'm gonna take it into the kitchen

and I don't foresee
having any issues with that.

(grunts)

(grunts)

(grunting)

Okay, I can make this work.

Think, Brent, think.

Uh, Joe, isn't that the same stick

we gave you for your wedding?

You told me it was a magic wand.

I pointed it at a bus, the bus crashed,

that's all I'm saying.

Happy Birthday, Brian.

I got you a card.

On the front it says,
"Too much sex ruins your eyesight"

and on the inside it says,
"Happy Birthday,"

but all blurry...
Oh! I gave it away!

It also says,
"Love, Aunt Judy and Uncle Bob."

A joke that good doesn't celebrate
just one birthday.

Well, fellas, I'm off.

Old Joe's got a big stakeout this week,

so I'm gonna practice
by watching the party

from across the street.

(door closes)

(grunts)

"Those who doubt the wand's
power suffer the wand's wrath."

Leviticus 26:12.

(indistinct chatter)

Was anybody gonna wake me up
for the party?

It's 6:30. I went down at noon.

Now I'm gonna be up all night,
watching bad reality TV.

Where the hell have you been?

I been here, man.

Maybe you press wrong button.
I don't know.

Now don't talk to me.
I'm on four different phone calls.

Hi, everyone, Peter Griffin.

Welcome to the roast portion
of the evening.

Ladies and gentleman: my son, Chris.

Born on the highway, because that is where

-most accidents happen.
-LOIS: Peter!

But we're here to talk about

Brian getting another year older.

You know, I hear he can't even
bury a bone these days

without Viagra.

Ha, all right, all right, I can take it.

And they say you can't
teach an old dog new tricks,

but I heard Brian just learned
how to roll over and beg...

for an erection.

(chuckling) Okay. That's sort of

just another jab at my penis, but sure.

On the positive side,

Brian's latest book
was a real page-turner.

Yeah, I turned the
pages into toilet paper.

'Cause Brian's old now

and can't satisfy women
through intercourse.

Peter, I'm fine.

Are you sure this isn't about you

not being able to perform
on your anniversary?

I told you that in confidence!

Whoa, slow down, buddy.

It's snack time, not Black Friday.

Nobody's walking out of here

with <i>First Wives Club </i>on Blu-ray, okay?

Nice as that sounds.

I heard there's a special feature
on the Blu-ray

that's just Diane Keaton
shrieking the commentary.

Huge, if true.

Actually, Stewie,
there's something important

I sorta need to talk to you about.

Okay.

I recently found out I have cooties.

And you're telling me why?

Well, I mean, uh...

remember last week?

When we ate from the same Play-Doh?

("Bread and Butter"
by The Newbeats playing)

♪ <i>He likes bread and butter</i> ♪

♪ <i>He likes toast and jam</i> ♪

♪ <i>That's what his baby feeds him</i> ♪

♪ <i>He's her loving man</i> ♪

♪ <i>Well, I like bread and butter</i> ♪

♪ <i>I like toast and jam.</i> ♪

Stewie, listen.

I just think you should get tested, okay?

What?
You mean I played with the Play-Doh

everyone you ever
played Play-Doh with played with?

I've been played!

Can I have a chocolate milk
with my snack today, please?

What?
Honey, the chocolate milk is the snack.

Hey, Bonnie.
Is Joe around?

No, he's on his stakeout.

Oh, that's too bad.

Tomorrow's Chris' Career Day,

and Joe's hat
is a key element of what I do.

So that's how I became
Quahog's first ninja cop.

-Questions?
-Yes.

-Mister..
-Officer Hi-yah.

Did you park in the handicapped spot?

Ninjas don't have cars.

Well, it's getting towed.

Oh, no!
My Chevy Cruze!

Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

Man, something smells good in here.

You cooking brussels sprouts?

No, I just farted.

That checks out.

Anyway, something else smells good.

I think dinner's ready.

I didn't hear a ding.

That's how I always know
to run into the kitchen,

shove a napkin in my shirt

and hold my utensils upright at the table.

Well, I made it in the oven,
not the microwave.

You want a little taste?

Holy crap.

That's the best thing I've ever had.

You know,
I usually cook for one-and-a-half,

but Joe's still on his stakeout.

You want to stay for dinner?

Ah, man, I'd love to, but it'd be wrong.

I always eat dinner with Lois.

Aw, you sure?

You can sit in Joe's
dining harness if you like.

How's he get into that thing?

We have a large array
of medical-grade cranes

and pulleys that lift him.

-Man, that must make the house ugly.
-It does.

(sighs)
All right, I guess I could text Lois.

But just this once.

Okay, we're good.

So, how long have you had Invisalign?

-You can see it?
-Yeah, I mean,

it's just a name, not a fact.

Okay, Stewie, think positive.

The test results will be negative.

Chin up, bud.

Incontinence is really
not that uncommon at your age.

What underwear do you recommend?

Depends.
(laughs)

Sorry, old joke.

Now, get out of here and go have some fun.

Make some fake skin
out of dried glue, would you?

All right, who's next?

Oh.

Stewie.
Come in.

Okay, I just want to verify
some medical history here.

Any recent boo-boos?

-No.
-Any ouchies or uh-ohs?

No, nothing like that.
God.

Good, good.

And how many boogies would you say

-you consume in a week?
-Oh, God, maybe, like... one.

Maybe two during the holidays.
Maybe.

Stewie, I'm your doctor.

I can tell just by looking at you

that you're eating more than that.

I'm thinking you had one
just on the way here.

What?

Okay, I did!
I'm sorry.

I've just been so nervous
about these test results.

Well, that's understandable,

seeing as how
you did test positive for cooties.

What?
That's terrible!

I think you need
to get your affairs in order.

I don't have any affairs!
I'm one!

Well, then you're ready to die.

(humming a tune)

-Did you say something?
-Me?

No, just humming.

It's part of my
alternative cooties therapy.

Did you know you can
literally vibrate disease

out of the body?

No, I know the opposite of that.

Oh, Brian.
You'll see.

When you get this close to death,

your whole perspective changes.

I got your meds, honey.

My father never loved me,

but Stewie-- he take good care of me.

-Who was that?
-That's my 20-year-old nurse.

He's wearing homemade sandals.

Yeah, he has no medical training.

Stewie, aren't you being a little dramatic

about this cooties thing?

Brian, this is the Flintstones cocktail

I have to take every day.

17 Barneys.
18 Wilmas.

I have to take the Bam-Bams
just to keep things moving.

Does this seem dramatic to you?

Yes, incredibly.

NURSE:
Stewie, I found one! Come look!

(sighs)
He likes to find frogs in the garden

and then show them to me.

His simplicity keeps me young.

Peter, what's wrong?

You don't have an appetite.

I'm gonna get one, just give me a minute.

You've barely touched your dinner.

Lois, the more you talk about it,

the more it's gonna be a whole thing.

Just let me focus here.

Okay, okay, that's working.

Mmm, oh, this is better, Bonnie.

Did you just call me Bonnie?

No! God...
God, no!

We all heard it, Dad.

Hey, Chris?

'Kay?
Got it?

Well, what if I
spiced it up for you, Peter?

I-I think I saw a take-out mustard packet

in the key drawer.

That's a water bed for my army guy.

What if you spun the plate around, Dad?

Tried it from behind?

Meg, go to place.

Ugh, do I have to?

I said "go to place"!

Anyway, Lois,
I think it's a non-starter tonight.

I'm just gonna go to the bathroom,

look at pictures
of barely-legal Russian food on my iPad,

and then go to bed.

Okay, we're rolling.

Hi, I'm Tony Award
winner Stewie Griffin-Styles.

-What?
-It's called manifesting, Bri.

Anyway, everything I have and own

is being left to Rupert in a trust

for when he gets sober.

And no, Rupert,
getting high is not getting sober,

I don't care if you
found the one AA group in town

that tells you otherwise.

Brian, are you getting my right angle?

You said you wanted it from the left side.

-You want it from the right?
-(sighs)

The left angle is the right side.

-Okay, back to one.
-(Brian sighs)

Stewie, you got a letter
from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Oh, my God,
they've accepted my application!

I'm gonna get my final wish granted!

I get to meet
the Philadelphia Flyer's mascot, Gritty!

Gritty, Gritty.
Gritty.

I'm not going to pee in a cup for you,
so stop asking.

This was supposed to be my day
and you're ruining it.

(sighs)

You'll Venmo me for this, too, I suppose?

(opera music playing)

Oh, Brian, I'm glad you're here.

Me and a bunch
of other buff cooties victims

are gonna shut down the third floor

of a Bloomingdale's tomorrow.
What do you think?

She's alive, right?

Stewie, come on, this is ridic...

(music playing loudly)

Do you mind this music, Bri?

-Do you like opera?
-Not really.

Oh, Bri, you really haven't heard
"The Wheels on the Bus"

until you've heard
it in its original Italian.

♪ <i>Le ruote del bus</i> ♪

♪ <i>Il turno</i> ♪

♪ <i>Il turno...</i> ♪

-(music shuts off)
-Enough, Stewie!

You've taken this whole thing too far.

I'm washing my hands of your cooties.

Which, had you done in the first place,

might have prevented all this.

You see, Rupert?

That's why I'm glad you stopped drinking.

You were that ugly.

(doorbell rings)

BONNIE:
Yoo-hoo. Anyone home?

-I'll get it.
-No, I got it!

Aw, they sure do grow up fast, don't they?

Chris, have you masturbated today?

-No, ma'am.
-Well, get up there.

And don't come back till you're...

What's for dinner?

What are you doing here?
My family's right inside.

I thought you might want some lunch.

Joe's still on his stakeout

and I know you like wagon-wheel pasta.

Of course I like wagon-wheel pasta.

I'm an adult
with a developmental disorder.

(inhales)
Man, that smells good.

Okay, fine.
But, we got to do this quick.

Right here against the wall.

Hey, Stewie, I wanted
to apologize for last night

and also maybe charge my phone...

What the hell?

<i>Hello, Brian.</i>
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

<i>it means you couldn't</i>
<i>find your phone charger</i>

<i>and came in to use mine.</i>

Man, am I that predictable?

<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

<i>Anyway, I can see that my disease</i>
<i>has become a burden</i>

Oh, my God.
This is terrible.

<i>Okay, don't look at the tags,</i>

<i>Well, I'm not telling you that,</i>

I don't care about the suits!

<i>Anyway, you were a good friend, Bri.</i>

<i>Oh, and if they make a movie</i>

<i>Unless he gets his eyes done.</i>

<i>Even then, though...</i>
<i>Ugh, hard maybe.</i>

What have I done?

This is all my fault.

I drove my best friend away

and now he's alone
and dying on a bus somewhere.

<i>Oh, also, you can have</i>

Hey, guys, have you seen Stewie?

No.
Have you checked his Instagram?

Of course.

"Felt a little trepidation
about killing myself,

"so I went to a Phish show in Burlington

That's it.
He's in Burlington!

He's gonna be so pissed.
I better hide.

Hey, Bon, did you know
there's a difference

between Tenth Street and Tenth Avenue?

Anyway, I may have bonered the stakeout.

Aw, thanks for pre-chewing my meal, babe.

The food shuttles out of my cloaca
much easier that way.

Time to let these dogs out of their cages.

Bon, would you turn on my foot fan?

I got to create a distraction

That guy is getting insufferable.

It's like, we get it, it's humorous

for a man that large to act playful.

I thought so.

So, anyway, I'm gonna go dump all this

completely undigested food out of my bag,

If I time it right and close my eyes,

This can never happen again, Bonnie.

Look Stewie, I know I've been hard on you,

but it's only because I've been

struggling with my own mortality.

What?
But you're perfectly healthy.

Stewie, I celebrated
my tenth birthday this week.

In dog years, I'm 70.

It's all I can think about.

That's the age people shrug at

when they see it in an obituary.

Wait, T.O., you're 70?

Do you get regular peels?
You look great.

Yes, I've got a great gal, we'll talk.

The point is,
I felt like my life was ending,

but I was wrong.

When I was driving up here to the clinic,

I saw the leaves change.

I tapped a maple tree and milked a cow.

I-I tried fresh cream for the first time

and went to a writer's retreat.

I met Margaret Atwood
and we foraged for wild mushrooms.

Wow, sounds like you were
in a real rush to get here.

The point is,
I've got a lot of life left in me,

and so do you.

Easy for you to say.

You don't have a terminal illness.

Oh, for God's sake, you don't have...

Brian, what are you doing?
Don't touch that!

That's the infected Play-Doh!

Brian, no!

There.
Now I have cooties, too.

And I don't care.

You... you don't?

We all have cooties,

whether it's illness or loneliness
or turning 70.

Nothing is promised.

We could get run over by a car.

Or struck by lightning.

We could be hit
with an unprecedented pandemic

that the government is slow to recognize,

woefully unprepared for

and then mismanages
with reckless incompetence.

But that's all the more reason

to appreciate the time we do have.

I mean, look around!

Look at this room.
It's beautiful.

Bri, did you eat those mushrooms
you found?

Yeah. You actually look like
a very old witch right now.

But I'm also just happy to be alive...

and you should be, too.

You know what?
You're right, Brian.

Too bad you can never
get that on the page,

but that's profound.

Evening.

Hello, there.

Maybe I could see you between periods.

Oh.

You're telling me.

Well, who do you think I should choose?

Well, if it were me in this situation,

I'd just go along for the ride

That's your advice?

Well, it's just what I...

You know, I'm trying

Oh, I misheard that completely.

I've just been told
that a special friend of our Meredith

has made a long trip
just to be here today.

I'd like to ask Lois Griffin
to say a few words.

(murmuring)

That's the daughter of the richest man

the dead lady ever worked for.

Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

I, uh, I-I just wanted to be here today

to say goodbye to Meredith and thank you.

Thank you for raising me,
and-and-and for being there

when no one else was.

That's why I was so hurt when you left,

and I always held it against you,

but now I realize i-it wasn't your fault.

You know she can't hear you, right?

But no matter what happened, Meredith,

thank you for being my teacher.

Even today, you're teaching me

that the people you love
most of all can still betray you.

And now, a reading from
Paul's letter to the Corinthians.

"Dear Corinthians, camp is good.

"Yesterday we had hot dogs.

"Please send strawberry Big League Chew

but wrap it in a towel

please join us for..."

It's a whole weekend?

(Stewie grunting)

Sorry for not
believing you, Mac.

But thanks to you, the real
murderer is behind bars.

And the Greater Boston area
has seen its last bad priest.

So, what's gonna happen
to Marion?

Well, he's a lunatic murderer
who cross-dresses in the '30s.

My guess is he can
look forward to a life

of loony bin craft projects
and staring out at the sea.

You think that place
can hold me?

You're dead, copper.
You're all dead.

But all that's after
the castration

and full frontal lobotomy.

Wait, what?

<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Hey, kids, don't be left out</i>

<i>this Christmas--</i>
<i>top your wish list with</i>

<i>the toy of the season,</i>
<i>Happy Asking Panda!</i>

<i>Made in China,</i>
<i>Happy Asking Panda has</i>

<i>many questions for you.</i>

<i>What is your favorite color?</i>

<i>What is your parents'</i>
<i>political affiliation?</i>

<i>What is your approximate</i>
<i>household income?</i>

<i>All of these questions</i>
<i>and so many more!</i>

<i>His eyes light up</i>

<i>or when credit cards are</i>
<i>held in front of him!</i>

<i>Hold Happy Asking Panda</i>
<i>over the keyboard</i>

<i>while entering passwords</i>
<i>and watch him dance.</i>

I love you, Happy Asking Panda!

PANDA:
Upload complete!

<i>Order today and it will arrive</i>

<i>for happy American Christmas</i>
<i>and time of wonder.</i>

I must.

Have. That. Toy.

What, are you serious?

Of course I'm serious,
I'm a child

and I just saw a commercial!

Or maybe you don't want me
to have

a happy American Christmas.

Of course I do.
But do you really not

see that you're crassly
manifesting

the very consumerism on
which Christmas is built?

Chris, can you please
put the dog out?

Yes, sir!

(grunts)

Thank you, Chris.

Hey!

It's very cold out here.

Okay, everyone, time to leave
for the traditional

town tree lighting ceremony.

What's happening now?
I can't hear her.

Sweet. Tree lighting.

(clucks tongue)
Guess that means it's showtime.

Wait, what is this?

Oh, nothing.

Just my own tradition

of putting
four dozen hard-boiled eggs

in a Kroger bag and passing
them out at the tree lighting.

Okay, we get it, Meg,
you're dark and different.

Wow, Meg really is
dark and different.

Yeah, they call me
"Meg the Egg."

'Cause of my big bag of eggs.

(chuckles) I hope you guys
don't start calling me that,

but you can if you want to.

Oh, is this
the "Meg the Egg" thing?

Yeah, no one's
on board with that.

Whoa, Quahog!

Whoa, there! Whoa!

Whoa.

Welcome, one and all,

to the annual
tree lighting ceremony.

All right, Meg the Egg!

Huevo me!

Mmm, perfect yolks this year.

(mouth full):
Four and a half minutes.

Now, don't you worry, y'all will
have a chance to line up

and meet Santy and let him
know what dry goods you need.

And right here
in front of City Hall,

I'm placing this wooden nativity
scene that I whittled myself

from a beech tree
what was rat-tailed

by lightning in the recent
meteorological electricities.

Oh, great, just what we need.

A religious display
on government property.

Can't believe this is what
my tax dollars are paying for.

(scoffs) Last I heard, you
never paid taxes in your life.

Only 'cause I've never made
enough money! Ha!

Brian, I can laugh
at a lot of things,

but Jesus Christ is
not two of them.

Yeah, come on, Brian,
it's Christmas.

Have an egg.
Enjoy yourself.

Okay, now to light
the Christmas tree

by telling this child's toy

my mother's maiden name.

Abernathy.

(crowd cheering)

Yay!
Very holiday data information!

I guess Santa's
getting ready to rack up

those frequent flyer miles, huh?

Yeah, we all read
your tweets, Joe.

Smash that "like" button.

Hey, check it out, Peter,
it's Ebenezer Pooch.

We should mess with him
by putting only

Christmas songs on the jukebox.

Cleveland, I got just the song.

("Life Is a Highway"
by Tom Cochrane playing)

♪ <i>Life is a highway</i> ♪

♪ <i>I want to ride it...</i> ♪

Wait, what the hell is this?

Only the best
Christmas song ever.

I tell you, no matter
when I hear this baby,

I start smelling pine.

Joe, this is not a holiday song.

He never once
mentions Christmas!

No, it's about Santa.

All night long.

On the highway...
delivering presents.

The video takes place
in a field!

In what is clearly summer!

Quagmire,
many parts of the world are

arid during the holy season.

Including where Jesus was born.

Or perhaps
the singer's Australian.

He's not Australian!

He name-checks Vancouver
in the song!

A guy from Australia can't
know where Vancouver is?

Feels kind of racist.

Mm-hmm.

Damn it, Joe! We're supposed
to be annoying Brian!

Not this!

Oh, okay, I get it.

Everybody pile on the one person

who actually sees the truth
about Christmas.

You know, you guys know all--
what this holiday

is all about, right?
It's all about this.

The world's smallest violin?

A scrotal massage?

"Ah, just like
in the old country"?

We're more word people
than gesture people.

No! Money!

It's all about money!

Is Christmas really so awful?

I don't know, I-I just--
I can't stand how everyone buys

into this annual mass hypnosis.

I mean, like, do not even get me
started on Christmas caroling.

No, go ahead. I'm listening.

No, that's-that's what I mean.

Like, do not get me started.

Trust me, you,
you will be here all night.

I've got time. I'm officially
getting you started.

-Name one thing.
-(exhales)

I mean, where do I start?

The things I have to say

about caroling. It's like,
how long have you got?

I've got all night, no one
to go home to-- let's hear it.

Yeah, okay... well, I mean,
first there's the...

-you know, the singing.
-(imitates buzzer)

You know what, screw you guys!

All right, screw Frosty!

Screw Vince Guaraldi!

Screw both Rankin and Bass!

Well, I'm with him on Rankin,
but, come on, what did Bass do?

-(tires squealing)
-(horns honking)

Stupid Christmas.

What kind of name is
Blitzen anyway, what is that?

That's like-- that's not
a name... it's a football...

something.

-(horn honks)
-(gasps)

Aah! Son of a bitch!

(crashes)

Oh, crap.
Why couldn't I have hit

the court-ordered menorah
instead?

MORT:
Thank you!

Aw, crap, this is bad,
this is bad.

After all I said, they-they'll
probably call this a hate crime.

I've just got
to hide the evidence.

Ah, I wish someone was here
to try to take this from me,

'cause I'd be all like...
(growling)

No way, you! This is mine!

Now where can I hide
an old, banged-up car

where it'll just blend right in?

(jet engine whirring)

I knew this would work.

Especially after
that last flight I took.

Spirit Airlines is
now boarding group whatever.

Just start punching
until you're on an airplane.

(crowd shouting, clamoring)

<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Our top story:</i>
<i>Ho-ho-homeless man</i>

<i>found dead in local alleyway.</i>

<i>But first we're joined</i>
<i>live by Mayor Wild West</i>

<i>outside City Hall,</i>
<i>who reports that the town</i>

<i>nativity scene he personally</i>
<i>whittled has gone missing.</i>

<i>Mayor West, what can you</i>
<i>tell us about the disappearance</i>

<i>and also about</i>
<i>my contested parking ticket,</i>

<i>and I'll remind you the tree</i>
<i>limb was blocking the sign.</i>

<i>That tree was a hardwood,</i>
<i>Mr. Tucker,</i>

<i>and there wouldn't have been</i>
<i>a leaf on it till mid-May.</i>

<i>The printing</i>
<i>of the restricted times</i>

<i>was also faded,</i>
<i>and as to the investigation?</i>

<i>Whoever took that</i>
<i>nativity scene best sleep</i>

<i>with one eye open,</i>
<i>'cause I'm on your trail.</i>

<i>And I'm gonna hunt you down</i>
<i>like the mighty</i>

<i>grizzly hunts a Slim Jim left on</i>
<i>the dashboard of a Ford Taurus.</i>

<i>I regret</i>
<i>that the West has changed.</i>

Ah, now I want a Slim Jim.
Slim Jim, anyone?

Slim Jim? Never google
what's in it? Slim Jim?

That's rather odd.
Who would steal...

(high-pitched):
a nativity scene?

Want to tell me
what's going on, champ?

(laughing):
What? Nothing.

Brian, I can tell when you're
lying, because your voice always

gets high at the end
of your sentences.

That's nuts,
you don't know what you're

(high-pitched):
talking about!

Okay, fine!

Yes, it was me. I destroyed
the nativity scene with my car.

But you've got to keep
your mouth shut about this.

I could be in a lot of trouble.
I already hid the evidence.

Did you at least do it right?

You burned all the pieces

and sank your car in a lake?

No, I parked it in the
Spirit Airlines parking lot...

Oh, because they all
drive crappy cars.

That's smart, that's smart.
Well, not to worry.

You and I will just leave town

and start a new life together.

What? What are you talking...?

Look, we could buy
a house in Cincinnati

for $43,000.

Stewie, I'm not leaving town--
Wait, what, seriously?

Yes, pretty big. Three bedrooms.
Hardwood floors.

For $43,000? That's insane.

-We could just pay that off.
-I know. You could have

that office you've
always wanted and we'd still

have an extra room for the baby.

-What?
-Or-or a craft room.

-(knocking)
-Oh, crap, Who's that?

Howdy, folks.

Just seeing if I might ask
y'all a few questions.

Hey, you're the man from the TV!

Please come in,
I'm the man from the couch.

Okay, quick, I need an alibi.

Okay, last night
you and I were home

watching <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
all night.

That's actually what I was
doing all last night.

I thought Tom Bergeron
had a great show.

One of his better nights.
The guy's a pro.

It's Tyra Banks now.

Brian, I can't do this with you.

And what about you, Peter?

I hear you haven't been
brushing your teeth.

-Yes, I have.
-All of 'em?

-Most of 'em.
-Careful there.

The teeth are the doorway
to the body.

Now, then, can I speak to your
dog who hates Christmas?

Ho-ho-ho! Who have we got here?

Can I interest anyone
in a candy cane?

None for me, thanks.

Ho-ho-okay, your loss.
After all,

it is the world's most dangerous
candy. The more you eat it,

the sharper it gets,
but it's worth stabbing

your own mouth for a sweet
that tastes like toothpaste.

I mean, Season's Greetings!

Brian, where were you last night

between 10:00 p.m. and midnight?

Uh, let's see, uh,
food bank till 8:00.

Uh, <i>Love Actually...</i>
(chuckles) again.

And at no time did
I watch Tom Bergeron

on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
because

that would be impossible.

Hmm, that's very helpful.

Oh, good, 'cause I-I hope
more than anyone the culprit

who took your nativity scene
is brought to justice.

I'm mighty glad to hear that.

Matter of fact, I was thinking
a hound like you'd

be just the thing to help
sniff out some new clues.

-What do you say?
-Uh, yeah.

In-in fact,
you came to the right guy.

I was briefly
McGruff's sidekick.

<i>McGRUFF:</i>
<i>Ah, that's Jenny.</i>

<i>-But that's not Jenny's dad.</i>
<i>-BRIAN: No, sir!</i>

If she gets into that car,

that may be the last time
you'll see Jenny.

-Yep!
-I'm McGruff the Crime Dog.

And I'm Sergeant Bark,
because I bark at crime.

<i>McGRUFF:</i>
<i>See those kids?</i>

<i>Every day in this country,</i>

<i>60 kids disappear.</i>

-Hey, the bikes fell.
-Some run away.

-You want me to get the bikes?
-But a lot are kidnapped
by strangers.

-McGruff? McGruff?
-Or even by people they know.

-Do you want me
to pick up the...?
-So write to McGruff.

-Oh, you're-you're giving
the address.
-And teach your kids

-to protect themselves.
-I'll get the bikes.

-(grunting)
-Help, uh,

<i>take a bite out of crime.</i>

<i>BRIAN:</i>
<i>And don't forget to bark at it.</i>

You know,
I've been thinking, Brian.

Maybe the first thing
we ought to do is

take an inventory
of what's missing.

Could be there's
some clues in that.

Yep, sure. Good thinking.

Ah, you're a big Christmas guy.

Remind me,
what's in a nativity scene?

Nativity scene, sure. Uh, well,
you've got your drummer.

Uh, probably a bassist, too.
Uh, Jesus, of course.

Uh... Mr. Christ?

I'm gonna say Santa,
then also the elves.

Uh, the pig who makes friends
with a spider...

writes, uh, nice things
in its web.

S-S-S-Slater?

Somebody-somebody named Slater?

I think he's
from <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

Ah, I knew it sounded familiar,
but you know who

we should really be looking at?

People in town who don't
even celebrate Christmas.

Like-like... Mort Goldman!

Boo! Boo, Brian!

They've suffered enough. Boo.

"Dear Santa,
thank you in advance

"for bringing me
a Happy Asking Panda.

"I've been a very good boy
this year,

"and while I understand you
'see me when I'm sleeping,'

"I just want to say
that Rupert was the aggressor.

"It may not have seemed that
way, but we had agreed

"ahead of time
on a form of role play

that would probably have seemed
confusing without that context."

Canceling Christmas?!

Now we'll never know
what's behind

the last box
on the M&M advent calendar!

It's M&M'S, Peter.

-They've all been M&M'S.
-You don't know that!

You ate my whole family,

you fat bastard.

One. More. Day.

(knocking)

Joe? What are you doing here?

Sorry, Peter, I'm on strict
orders from the mayor

to confiscate
all the Christmas stuff in town.

You heard him, Lois.
Hand over the Hallmark Channel.

No Christmas means
no Happy Asking Panda.

Stewie, I'm so sorry.

But you got to understand
the position I'm in.

(Stewie sobbing)

I'll tell you this, Rupert.

I shall not stand idly by
while our dog

steals my dream
of a Happy Asking Panda.

(inhales deeply)

I may just have to send
a little text to our mayor.

Yes, I did get a new phone case.

It's Malibu Barbie
next to a palm tree.

The man at the mall kiosk
said it was "girlish,"

and I said, "Yeah?
Maybe I think she's hot."

And he went, "Okay," and I went,
"What do you mean by 'Okay'?"

And then he says,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

"I just came back from my wife's
oncologist appointment."

And I said, "Oh, no.
What's wrong?" And he said,

"Her melanoma's coming back."

And I said, "I'm so sorry,
but they're making

advancements in treatment
every single day."

And he goes, "I know,
you're right, but still."

And I said, "Just hang
in there," and he says,

"Shoot me your digits,
our story does not

end here," so we're going
out to dinner on Friday.

I love this case.

Sir, as you requested,
I've transcribed

all your text messages
onto pieces of dried cowhide.

These just came in.

"Spirit Airlines parking lit."

"Parking lit."

"Parking lit. Asterisk, lot.

L-O-L."

Looks like we got our man.

And still plenty of time
to pick up Aunt Betty.

Oh, you really didn't have
to do this.

We both know I did.

Brian, is there anything
you want to say

about the Baby Jesus-shaped dent
in the hood of your car?

Oh, come on,
that doesn't prove anything!

That could be any baby
I hit with my car!

He was lying about Tom Bergeron
earlier. He had no idea.

Why don't you open
the trunk for me?

(laughing)

No way! No way!

You didn't even hide
the evidence?!

Brian Griffin,
you're under arrest.

(gasps) Just for destroying
public property

and fleeing the scene
of the crime?!

Why are we not leading
with drunk driving?

I'm afraid I have
to take you to jail.

Oh, no, not Brian!

Do we get
the Hallmark Channel back?

Jail?! Are you kidding me?!

Wait a minute, you get three
square meals in jail, right?

Well, I can't speak
for the shape,

but the number sounds right.

GUARD:
Griffin, visitor!

(buzzer sounds)

Hey, Brian,
sorry about the sling.

I got shot by an M&M.

Anyway, how's Christmas Eve
in jail?

You know what, it's great.

At least it keeps me away
from all the phony joy

and crass commercialism.

Well, it's good
to see you haven't lost

your lack of spirit.

Well, it certainly is
great seeing you, Brian.

-(text whooshes)
-(phone chimes)

Hey, guys, unfortunately

visiting hours end at...

10:14.

Aw! Aw!

It's like we just got here, aw!

(yawns)

Ah, best night's sleep
in a long time.

I should spend Christmas
in jail every year.

(children clamoring outside)

(scoffs) Stupid families having
stupid fun times together.

Reminding themselves
their families are...

filled with love.

Huh, looks like Stewie got
that toy he wanted.

(sighs)
A kid and his bear.

What's more innocent than that?

Aw, they got tennis balls
and junk?

(Chris panting)

I don't even like stupid

new Christmas tennis balls.

Oh, my God, what have I done?

I've been so blind.

Sure, Christmas is a commercial
holiday largely intended

to prop up a faltering economy,
but it's also about family

and togetherness
and the Hallmark Channel,

which I admit
I watch all the time!

Four tires,
not one of them the same.

-Is that guy still on the can?
-I'll check.

Let's all check.

(all gasp)

I think he's had a heart attack.

He's dead.

Oh, my God, Dad,
this is terrible.

I know. Your mother
is gonna find out we had pizza.

What the...

This is not the room I reserved.

This is the honeymoon suite.

Was that, "This is
the honeymoon," comma, "sweet"?

Or, like, "room"?

Oh, you're not gonna
get away with this.

I am gonna tweet mean stuff

at celebrities
that look vaguely like you.

Whoa, whoa,
I had nothing to do with this.

-Then how did this happen?
-Well, I'm a platinum member

at all the hotel chains,

so they probably just
saw my name and upgraded us.

Well, I don't know
if I'm comfortable with this.

Oh, no problem.
Let me call the front desk

and see if they can switch us
to a room with two beds.

Ah, yes, we were wondering if we
might be able to switch rooms?

Uh-huh. I see.

So just a windowless single
with no water pressure?

No, you know what, it's fine.
We're already here.

My wife says, no, it's fine,
we're already here.

(chuckles): Oh, you heard that.
Okay, thanks, anyway.

But don't get any ideas,

because nothing
is gonna happen between us.

You have nothing to worry about.

I'll be more of a gentleman
than John Wayne Bobbitt

with his second wife.

Hey, honey,
would you take out the trash?

Yes, yeah, absolutely.

(panting)
Love it, love it. What else?

Well, I have been dying to see
that new Rebel Wilson movie.

I hear she raps, like, a lot.

(sighs)

Let's just do this.

Okay, we have to get rid
of this body

so your mom can't
connect us with the pizza.

Anybody got any ideas?

We could put a yarmulke on him

a-and dump him
in the town square.

Pretend it's a hate crime.

Chris, come on.
Where we gonna get a yarmulke?

We should float him
with balloons, like in <i>Up.</i>

-Then he's the sky's problem.
-(electronic ding)

-Oh, my God, he got a text.
-Brian, get it.

I'm not fishing it out of his
pants, 'cause I'm into chicks.

Oh, no. This means there
are still undelivered pizzas

-in his car.
-The restaurant's gonna know

ours was the last one he dropped
off before he disappeared.

Oh, my God, that means
Mom will find out.

Which means we got to deliver
the rest of his pizzas.

And we'll leave him and his car
at the last stop.

Well, if we're going in the car,
that means I can take the iPad.

Uh, hey, guys?

You're cutting in line.

All I wanted was just

You know, Bri, they're right

We should just go

You're supposed to be over here,

Uh, Peter, I am your neighbor.

You're my neighbor?

I really want you to think back
really quickly.

Peter, we could've had fun,
but I died.

Yeesh. I-I don't want
to think anymore for a while.

Gentlemen, the jury's waiting.

Your Honor,
you got to understand,

but now...

Very well.
I'll grant a continuance

and just enter into the court
record that you're a chicken.

Ooh. I move

-I'm worried for Peter.
-I'll say.

Brick Baker's gonna win, easy.

Look, he's leaned back
with his feet up,

confidently whistling.

(exhaling sharply)

He's, uh, he's not very good
at whistling,

but he's doing the other stuff.

I can't believe
we're doing this.

We're actually going
lobster fishing.

Our way of life
is disappearing, Bri.

Stewie, we got the boat
20 minutes ago. Settle down.

How'd we get the boat, anyway?

Traded it for opioids from
a working-class New Englander

-hooked on opioids.
-Huh.

All right, well, I got
lobster pots, trammel nets,

buoys, chum, rope,
flotation gear and a radio.

-What do you got?
-Opioids.

Stewie, stop screwing around
and give me those opioids

and go get me some more opioids.

Uh, let me check
on Rupert first.

Rupert, how you doing
with that double sheet bend?

Okay, apparently I said
"half hitch" or whatever.

-I don't even know
why you brought him.
-Let's not talk about it.

He gets so jealous
when you and I hang out.

Well, tell him he doesn't
have anything to worry about.

He doesn't?

Mr. Griffin, this has been
a huge waste of time.

I hereby find for the defendant,
effective as of the moment

I slam down
my gavel uninterrup...

Wait! Your Honor, we have
evidence relevant to this case.

Who are you?
And what kind of evidence?

of a school staircase?

And why are all the men
dressed like Audrey Hepburn

and the women like Elvis?

It was
Peter Griffin's idea, sir.

For some reason, Peter always
wants to dress like a woman.

Just as a joke.

Yeah, I sniffed the poop.

I didn't roll in it.
I wanted to.

Personally, I think it
all started with that incident

with the Monterey five
on orientation day.

Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

I wear it because I'm poor.

That's charming.
I really like you.

Even though I'm poor?

Hon, I like you
<i>because</i> you're poor.

Chris and Peter became
a little team after that.

I even saw them holding hands
once under the pier.

Yeah, as a joke.

This is my new
poor friend, Chris.

I'm Joe. I sometimes have
soft-focus shower sex

with my abusive wife.

I'm Quagmire.

I'm rich,
so I named my daughter

after a recently
gentrified city: Boise.

What's your kid's name?

Jacksonville.

That's bad.

(excited shouting)

-Daddy!
-Hey, buddy.

Eyes and ears, please.

Somebody bullied
little Boise today.

They said her dad
had the cheapest Tesla.

The one you can't
drive very far.

(all gasp)

I was an early adopter.

Boise, point to the kid
who said that.

-Jacksonville, did you say it?
-No.

He's lying!
He needs to apologize.

He didn't do anything.

This isn't over.
Come on, Boise.

Let's go get $20-rhubarb
nonsense ice cream.

Just an FYI, I say a lot
with my hand over my heart

so you know I'm being sincere.

We love that you're here.

We love being here.

I've never had coffee
by the water before.

Since you're not from here,

can I ask if you've been
to a Burger King

and if it's true
they'll give anyone a crown?

I've definitely been in them,

but I'm not positive
about the crown thing.

Be careful in Monterey.

It's not just outdoor
fireplace wine shops

and the opening credits bridge
that's actually in Big Sur.

People talk
behind your back here.

But you don't?

No, I don't play those games.

Hey, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna grab another napkin.

Boy, that guy Chris
kind of sucks, eh?

I want you and Jacksonville to
come to Stewie's birthday party

at my all-glass house
this weekend.

Thank you, Peter.
That sounds so civil.

Back to the BK thing--
a Whopper Jr. isn't, like,

younger than a Whopper, right,
it's just a name?

Yeah, it's just
a smaller version.

Yeah, that's what
Wikipedia said.

I don't know why
you'd move from a place

that has a Burger King.

I can't really say why I moved.

Why did you move?

I can't really say.

Barely-thawed trout and white rice.

This trout's the lucky one.
It's over for him.

-What's that, Joe?
-Thanks, Bon. Looks terrific.

Did you guys know
you have a pool in the backyard?

It was just overgrown
with grass and weeds.

Cannonball!

There's no water in it, though.

Llabnonnac!

Phew. That was a close one.

You know, Alana, I confess I wasn't sure

how this was gonna work out,
but you've been terrific.

Uh, you're just too good to be true.

<i>STEWIE: Too good to be true.</i>

<i>Like a single Jewish doctor.</i>

<i>Hello? Where are you?</i>

<i>Doctors can be girls, too, so shut up.</i>

<i>Yes, everything seemed perfect</i>
<i>in our household,</i>

<i>We'd been so conditioned into believing</i>

<i>our mother's life was empty,</i>

<i>which I just looked up.</i>

(imitating Lois):
Stewie, eat your vegetables.

<i>STEWIE (chuckling): Okay,</i>

Oh, 8:15.

Well, that's much later
than I usually wake up,

but at least I won't react
like a character in an '80s mov...

8:15?!

(upbeat music playing)

(panting)

I am so sorry.

I didn't realize how late it was.

You guys must be starving.

Wha... What's all this?

Oh, good morning, Lois.

I thought I'd let you sleep in.

Oh, that's nice.

-Where's Peter?
-Oh, he's here.

He's just in the kid phase
of the Mini-Wheats cycle.

The shrinking process
was incredibly painful.

Mom, she made us eggs with falafel.

Or, as she calls it, "falafel à la Alana."

It's hard to say, but they're delicious.

I take adult-sized poops,
but I have kid-sized parts.

I could die from this.

Yeah, that's-that's part of why
I don't let Peter do that.

But you know what, I'm glad you guys

are all enjoying Alana so much.

Oh, she's the best.

In fact, Alana and I
stayed up all night scissoring.

Wow, Meg, you're really good at this.

Yeah, I had an older babysitter
who kind of showed me how.

(gasps) Hey, maybe after this,

we can get out the cribbage board

and work on our pegging.

<i>WEST: I'm Mayor Wild West,</i>

<i>and my neighbor's kid</i>

<i>Guess this week</i>

<i>But anyway, back to our tale.</i>

<i>STEWIE:</i>
<i>The dominoes were falling one by one.</i>

<i>Especially Peter,</i>
<i>who found Alana to be a sheer delight.</i>

<i>That will be more clear when you see</i>

<i>how she's about to be dressed.</i>

-(rustling)
-Santa?

I can almost see your bum
through your nightgown.

<i>STEWIE: Any time</i>
<i>Peter saw someone at 2:00 a.m.,</i>

<i>he assumed it was Santa.</i>

Alana? What are you doing up so nipples?

Oh, sorry, I was just
cleaning out the freezer.

Okay, any Popsicles that say

"property of Peter Griffin" are mine.

Got it. You see anything else you like?

I can think of one or two things.

Did you enjoy your five-course meal?

(laughs)
I wouldn't consider an amuse-bouche

a full course unto itself.

(sighs) I guess you're right.

Hey, maybe we could
split a Popsicle for dessert.

Yeah, sure, if any of them
have your name on 'em, help yourself.

Hey, thanks for taking
me to the dog park, Lois.

Well, now that we
have Alana, I've got more time

to do stuff like this.

Can I be honest with you, Brian?

Hmm. That's what a woman says

before she trashes another woman.

I-I'm a little worried about Alana.

I mean, the kids seem to like her

and she's good at her job,

but maybe a little too good, you know?

I don't know, she seems cool to me.

I mean, yes, I know, she's very sweet.

(grunts)

But sometimes I feel like
maybe she's after something.

I just don't know what it is.

(panting)

Well, maybe you're right.

I'll tell you what, I'll talk to Alana

and try to sniff out
what's going on with her.

Oh, thanks, Brian.

I'd appreciate that.

I'll tell you,
I'm starting to wish I'd never...

(grunts): hired her!

(panting)

Hey, sorry about that.

Well, looks like Lois is plenty threatened

by that new girl who moved in,
I tell you what.

Wow. Dusting the den, huh?

You're really going the whole 8.2 meters.

-What?
-Oh, sorry, nine yards.

I just read so many European authors,

I slip into metric sometimes.

Anyway, Alana, could you
do me a favour-- with a "U"--

and maybe do a little less housework?

Less housework?
But that's why Lois hired me.

Well, I worry Lois
might be feeling a little displaced

since you've been doing so much
around the house lately.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I would never want
to make her feel uncomfortable.

Hey, maybe we should
discuss this while I brush your fur.

Okay, I see what you're doing.

This kind of stuff
may have worked with the kids,

but I kind of look out for Lois
in a way that they don't.

And believe me, Alana,
I can get pretty mean if I want to.

(laughing): Oh, Brian, that's adorable.

And I love that you're
so protective, but come on.

We all know you're just a big sweetheart.

And even if you were
able to be mean to me,

I'd still be loving you.

Yeah, well... "Loving," you say?

Okay, now, who here knows "Jumper"?

-I...

I'm sorry, Lois.

I just wanted your life so badly.

in wet bathing suits,
and at the end of the day,

all I want is to come home, relax,

do a couple of rad jumps
through Sprinkler City,

We don't deserve this guy.

Hey, Dad? Rule number one,

I got to text that to my girl later.

Oh, she's probably eating dinner,

Uh-huh. So, Chris,

what's this "girl's" name, anyway?

Jennifaire.

Well, I'd love to see

Jennifaire's Facebook page.

Oh, we don't really
believe in social media,

but I can show you a picture.

What is this?

It's an ad for Tim Hortons in Canada.

She's a model for them.

She gets her weight in coffee
free every month.

-That's too much coffee.
-I also love coffee.

It's important in relationships
to have shared interests.

You could learn from that, Dad.

Look, I may have relationship problems,

but at least I have a real relationship.

What are you saying?

You don't have a girlfriend.
You made her up.

No, I didn't. She's real.

She's real, huh?
Well, then, let's go see her.

You and I are going to Canada

Peter, don't forget,

Tomorrow afternoon, we go to Canada.

And then on Friday,
we refill your Percocet prescription.

Sometime next week, we're going to Canada.

Peter, this is ridiculous.

You don't have to drive
all the way to Canada

Stewie, this is ridiculous.

You don't like him either?

He's a daintier Eddie Redmayne.

If there's another actor

without going over the limit,
I'd like to hear it.

Damn it, Stewie, you're not pregnant.

Oh, boy. The dog knows

he'll lose attention when the baby comes.

You are the baby! A male baby.

Look, I know all kids

like to play make-believe
and pretend to be adults.

Sometimes they even
convince themselves of it.

Now, you've brought a new twist to this--

I don't want to diminish
how weird this is--

but it's time for it to stop.

Because for God's sake,
you are not pregnant.

-You're pregnant.
-Thank you.

It's just too bad you're
gonna gain all that weight.

-What?
-When you're pregnant,
you gain, like, 30 pounds.

30 pounds?

But I only weigh 15.

Well, no matter.
At least I'll sleep comfortably

and continue to have
the same-sized, not-swollen feet.

But I just bought Thom Browne boots.

I got them for myself as a push present.

Sorry, Stewie.

Enjoy the miracle of life.

Oh, dear. Perhaps being pregnant

will be more difficult than I thought.

And we still have to
plan a gender reveal party.

Okay, would you rather do a cake reveal

or burn Napa to the ground?

I always saw you as the rock of the group.

Damn it!

Don't you see, fellas?

We made a oath to the mayor
to get our manhood back.

And our hats are that manhood.

So, we've got to find that bear
and get it back.

I don't know, that sounds dangerous.

Come on, the whole reason we came here

is 'cause we've turned into cowards.

The mayor wanted us
to finish this cattle drive

and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

We'll do it with courage and teamwork.

Who's with me?

Yeah, that's the spirit.

Well, Bri, I'm heading out for sushi
in my new boots.

So I'm guessing you got rid of the baby?

Yes, it was a tough decision.

But today I took a morning-after cocktail

of Flintstones vitamins,
Ovaltine, castor oil,

and a splash of Dr. Pepper, since its name

is both a medical professional
and a vegetable.

Well, I think you made the right decision.

Me too. I'm probably the only person

under 18 ever to say this,
but being pregnant is fun

until it forces you
to make sacrifices in any way.

Uh, yeah, I guess that's an okay takeaway.

I just hope little Timothée
or Chalamet understands.

I think he or she would have grown up

to be a strong woman

or a very weak man.

So, uh, you know that
you were never pregnant, right?

Yes, I went to the hospital for a sonogram

and got yelled at by an angry nurse.

In case you were wondering
whether she likes nonsense,

she, um... she does not.

Beer is courage--

Beer helps you achieve new heights,

Beer makes you grab the brass ring,

<i>PETER: And then--</i>
<i>I know, it's still not over yet--</i>

<i>I bought a squid boat.</i>

<i>Lieutenant Dan was also working with me.</i>

<i>And you know who's super helpful on a boat</i>

<i>A wheelchair guy.</i>

Hey, Forrest, I got our lunches.

Aah!

So after I was rich,

Jenny came back

Wow, that was great.

Sorry I was naming presidents during.

So, we getting married or what?

You don't want to marry me, Forrest.

Yeah, you're right.

Okay, well, have a good night.

Oh, I did a movie about that once.

It's called <i>Splash.</i>

No, Forrest. (whispers indistinctly)

Oh, I thought you said mermaids.

But I did a movie about your thing, too.

"Hey, guys, home with groceries.

Could use a hand unloading."

And send.

Now I wait for them to come out
to help their dear old mom.

-(phone chimes)
-PETER: Do it yourself!

(sighs)

(laughter)

Hi, sad lady.

Junior, our dinner talk stays inside.

Hi, normal lady.

What are you guys doing? It's Sunday.

I thought husbands
had to watch football all day

or they get cancer.

Today's our family fun day.

That's right, a whole day
dedicated to family and fun,

ending in the bedroom
with what I hope will be

some back-end participation.

-Hmm?
-Mm-mmm.

(disappointed groan)

(Stewie snoring)

(Lois grunts)

I am so tired of this family

just sitting around and doing nothing.

The Browns are outside having fun

while we're in here loafing around

like a bunch of stupid potatoes.

Mom, I've been anonymously
cyberbullied for a decade.

"Stupid potato" doesn't even leave a mark.

We need to spend some quality time
together like the Browns.

So we're doing a family fun day.

Oh, family-free fun day sounds great.

No, family fun day.

Yeah, family-free fun day.

No, Peter. Family. Fun. Day.

(phone rings)

<i>PETER: Yeah, I'm already at The Clam.</i>

<i>Have fun.</i>

All right, nothing's more fun
than a family card game.

Now, the game is euchre.

"Begin by separating the nines,
tens, face cards and aces

"from the rest of the deck.

"The goal is to win
at least three 'tricks.'

"Now, if the side
that fixed the trump fails

"to get three tricks,
it is said to be 'euchred.'

"The highest trump
is the jack of the trump suit,

"called the 'right bower.'

"Partnership-making trump
wins three or four tricks

"and earns one point.

"Lone hand wins three or four tricks,

"also earns one point.

"However, a lone hand wins five tricks,

"that's worth four points.

Many euchre games are scored
by rubber points, as in whist."

Ooh, ooh. "The first side to win two games

-wins the rubber."
-(gunshot, thud)

"The dealer has the right to exchange

any turned-up card..."

Oh, my God, it's the same.

"If the face-up card is a jack,

-it's considered bad luck for..."
-(gunshot, thud)

"After two rounds,
if no trump suit has been declared

"and the 'stick-the-dealer'
rule is not in effect,

then the cards
are collected and reshuffled."

<i>ANNOUNCER: </i>Family Guy
<i>is brought to you by contract bridge.</i>

<i>Way simpler than euchre.</i>

<i>You see, in contract bridge,</i>
<i>each player is dealt 13 cards</i>

<i>from a standard 52-card deck.</i>

<i>A trick starts when a player leads,</i>

<i>i.e. plays the first card.</i>

<i>The leader to the first trick</i>
<i>is determined by the auction.</i>

So, what do you think, gang?

I thought it could
be a fun family activity

if we had a make-your-own-pizza night.

Or we could order Domino's.

No, come on, this'll be fun.

Everyone gets their own crust,

and you can choose from
any of the items I put out, huh?

It could be olives, it could be peppers.

And for the risk takers,
I even put out some pineapple.

You can put anything
you want on your pizza.

Yeah, I'm putting
a Domino's pizza on my pizza.

<i>ANNOUNCER: Domino's-- we're both terrible</i>

<i>and better than your pizza.</i>

Ah, this is nice, huh?

Oh, it's so good to get the whole family

out of the house and see Quahog
from a different perspective.

It's a little tight.

-(heat jet whooshes)
-So, how'd you
get into hot-air ballooning?

They don't do background checks.

Oh. What are we flying over now?

My ex-wife's house.

If you have any garbage
or little bags of cat poo,

you can drop them now.

Did you know restraining orders
only go side to side?

They don't go up and down.

Well, there's got to be
one thing we can all

enjoy together as a family.

You know, I think we're trying too hard.

When I was a kid we did movie nights,

and it was the Holy Grail of family fun.

-I'd watch a movie.
-I'd watch a porn movie.

No, a family movie.

I'd watch a MILF porn movie.

Okay, technically that's accurate,
but no porn.

All right, let's fire up
Amazon or Netflix.

No streaming services.

They've ruined how we watch movies.

I'm talking about
an old-school movie night

where we rent one from Blockbuster.

Some of my best
childhood memories were when

I went to rent a video with my dad.

Him and I never really got along,

but the one place
where we did was Blockbuster.

He'd let me pick out any snack I wanted

while he grabbed our fifth-choice movie

because we got there too late
to get the good ones.

But that was part of it,

because it wasn't about the movie,

it was about the night you spent together.

I think renting a movie's a great idea.

Let's do it.

So it's settled.

The Griffins are making it

a Blockbuster night.

When we get there,
I'll give you 20 bucks to say,

"I've heard <i>Magic Mike</i> is good."

Huh. This used to be the Blockbuster.

Oh, man, it's gone.

Were you also looking for...

Very tall prostitute, yes.

Is that what you were going to say?

She used to hang out here--
hands like a palm leaf.

She would do sex but also
help with light bulbs and stuff.

I think her name was Phillip.

I see some of my students in your car.

That's good for me.

I'm sure there's one still open.

I'll just google it.

Eh, I got to type in my code
'cause I got too fat

-for the facial recognition to work.
-Brutal.

Oh, good. See? There is one still open.

<i>GPS VOICE:</i>
<i>Drive north for a quarter of a mile,</i>

<i>then turn left onto Highway 20.</i>

<i>Continue straight for 2,980 miles.</i>

-What?!
-Oh, yeah.

The last Blockbuster in existence

is in Bend, Oregon.

Did I not say that? Strap in, everybody,

the Griffins are going on a road trip.

Well, it looks like the family Griffin

is headed off down Holiday Road.

And Lindsey Buckingham has said no.

Well, that's all right.

I reckon, if you're a man named Lindsey,

you don't get to
call the shots very often.

Peter, this is crazy.

We can't drive 3,000
miles just to rent a movie.

Would you please turn around?

Lois, the whole family
fun thing was your idea.

Don't get mad at me
'cause I'm following through.

But I only have one pair of underwear.

Oh, that's not a problem. I got tons of

women's underwear in the back.

(chuckles): Why, why do you have that?

Tons of it.

Don't we have a say in all this, Dad?

Yeah, we don't want
to drive all the way to Oregon.

Aw, it's gonna be fun, guys.

We're gonna see the whole country,

like we're in one of those

Bruce Springsteen Jeep commercials.

<i>SPRINGSTEEN:</i>
<i>America is made up of a lot of states.</i>

<i>Some of them really stink,</i>
<i>but some of them don't stink.</i>

-(alarmed mooing)
<i>-So buy a Jeep.</i>

<i>They flip easy, but you'll be okay.</i>

<i>Probably be okay.</i>

One of the perks of a cross-country trip

is stopping for a meal
and meeting the friendly folks

who make up
the heart and soul of our country.

Hello, we're from the Northeast.

<i>(dramatic music playing)</i>

(sighs) I'm not getting any service.

-Where are we?
-Hey, I don't know.

But we can figure it out
by which radio stations come in.

<i>MAN (on radio):</i>
<i>You're listening to G-U-N-S AM radio.</i>

<i>Ha, ha, I couldn't agree more.</i>

Washington and Washington.

Well, we got to almost be there, right?

A few more hours.

Trust me, it'll all be worth it

I present to you <i>Sliver.</i>

And it's <i>Sliders,</i> season two.

Classic Blockbuster blunder.

Oh, good. You numbskulls
put the wrong movie in here.

I want a refund.

Everybody outside now.

I can't believe this.

All I was trying to do
was have a nice movie night

with my family,

Wow, this is very similar
to a screenplay I wrote.

This guy is <i>too</i> into movies.

Remember, the one I had you read

Uh, yeah, sure, I remember.

-You didn't read it?
-I'm gonna.

Don't be mad at me.
Be mad at, you know, these guys.

I'm sorry, kids, all I wanted to do

was something special with you guys.

That one thing you'd
remember doing with me

for the rest of your lives, but I failed.

Another failure
in a long string of failures.

Are you kidding, Dad?

-This has been the most exciting day ever.
-It has?

Yeah. We left the house
three days ago to rent a movie

and now we're in the middle
of the woods in Oregon

and might get murdered
by Blockbuster guys.

Like, what is this?

Yeah, we never know what you're gonna do.

It's usually silly or dangerous,

but it's also kind of awesome.

Yeah. Remember when he had tiny arms

-for, like, three months?
-Or when he brought home that horse.

Or that falcon. Or that parrot.

Lot of illegal animals.

Or when that little guy lived in his neck.

What the hell was <i>that?</i>

Every few years he fights a giant chicken

and destroys a city.

No one's named a good thing yet.

You had a blimp with your face on it.

Your mother put me
on pills after I bought that.

You see, Dad, we don't need a movie night

for us to remember you.

Every day is like a movie night with you.

Well, I guess Mom knew what she was doing

when she insisted on family fun day.

Super sweet moment, guys.

I'm gonna assume this was all a callback

to something in act one.

Time to go outside now.

Guys, please,
I'm the one with the late fees.

Don't hurt my family. I'll do anything.

Well, I have this screenplay,
it-it's an epic sci-fi,

and it's mostly
stage directions where they...

Welcome to our home,

and thank you all so much
for coming to celebrate

our dear Lois and her wonderful husband,

uh, Peter.

I know Carter wanted to say a few words.

Poor, unfunny, fat.

Oh, and the sprinklers come on at 4:00.

I don't know how to change that,
so we have until then.

Beautifully said.

Wow.

Lot of years for us.

Uh-huh.

Hey, so what do you think about dinner?

Oh, God, I'm so tired
of thinking about dinner.

I-I don't know.

Well, what are you in the mood for?

Okay, that's just another version

of the same question.

Oh, I've collected nine finalists

for our new end table. We should talk.

Will each one be instantly
overcrowded by three items?

-Absolutely.
-Great.

So where did we land, dinner-wise?

If I could have everyone's attention,

it's time to present Peter and Lois

with a very special anniversary gift.

Mr. Lloyd, I think
we can get back on track

our load outs.

See, back in my mailman days,

we would pre-sort our deliveries
by destination.

If we bundle the inventory
by invoice

rather than by product type,

it'll expedite the delivery
out on the road.

My goodness, why haven't we

Cleveland,
you've proven yourself

invaluable to this organization.

I'm hereby promoting you to

Wow, thank you, sir.

Hey, good for you, Cleveland.

Good for all of us.
Good for this department.

And as for you, Griffin,

I need you to clear your things
out of your office.

Cleveland is going
to need more room

to perform
his managerial duties.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,

so well at the brewery,

I felt like a joke.

I knew I was never
gonna be a big shot here,

but I liked playing my small
part to help make this beer.

Before you started, that
small part felt like enough.

Griffin, I was just informed
that you tried to sabotage

this operation by putting vermin
in the beer tank.

This is the last straw, Griffin.

You are fired.

Fine. I'm not good enough
for this place anyway.

Wait.

You can't fire Peter, sir.

-And why's that?
-Because you need him.

Sure, companies need some people
to work hard

and go the extra mile,
but more than that,

they need guys like Peter,

regular guys who are happy
to do a thankless job

for a mediocre salary,
day in and day out,

so long as that day ends
with a cold beer

and a best friend
to share it with.

sir, you fire your customer,

backbone of this country.

I need coming from up top.

for opiates from John.

-He'll know what you mean.
-Got it.

Now that you're doing all that,

I'm going to The Clam
with the guys.

Oh, man, this hologram thing
is the best idea

since the Mayflower hired
a cruise director.

Okay, everyone,
from 8:00 until 9:00,

we'll be trembling
before our angry God.

From 9:00 to 10:00, there's
yellow fever on the lido deck.

And at 10:00,
it's everybody's favorite,

Buckle-Hat Bingo.

What if we lost our buckle hat?

-Well, do you have a plain hat?
-Yeah.

-Do you have a belt?
-Yeah.

-You got a buckle hat.
-(murmuring)

(whispers):
I just love knowing
what's going on.

Oh, Peter, thanks
for clearing out

an area for us
to start a garden.

Yeah, they say the best day
to plant a garden is yesterday.

And the next best day is today!

(both laugh)

This, this is what I meant

about making an effort
with the family.

And I can garden, too,
'cause I have a brown thumb.

That's more of a wiping issue,
son, but I'm glad you're here.

This is great,
but I'm a little hot.

No problem, that's why
I bought a giant sun hat

that can fit all of us.

And now to quote
the kitchen towel,

"Lettuce turnip the beet."

(laughing):
Stop it or I'm gonna wet myself.

Me, too. I always wet my plants.

(laughter)

Where do you get all this?

They're all from towels, Lois!

They're all from towels!

Well, what do you think, guys?

Should we wrap it up?

Yeah, but can one of you
throw glitter on me?

It's-it's better if Lois thinks
I'm at a strip club.

She hates you guys.

Peter, I think you're
a little too drunk to walk home.

-Yeah, give us your shoes.
-Can we give you a ride?

No, no, it's okay.
I'll just black out

and-and never know
how I got home.

(insects trilling)

Works every time.

And it's good
for the environment, maybe.

"After several

"Chris is becoming

"Stewie pooped on a horse."

Whoa, Pop,

-I was?
-Yeah, I mean,

you said you lost 1,100 bucks
on BetKings.

I checked the account.
You definitely lost it.

But in light of what happened,

You lost him, Glenn!
How do you do that?

What, did you go to a-a sex...

No! We went out to dinner

But you're right.

I lost him.

And now he's gone

<i>Mary Elizabeth Becca Ryan</i>

<i>is releasing her debut single,</i>

<i>the surprisingly filthy</i>
<i>"Face Chair."</i>

Oh, my God!
I can't believe MEBR

her first song.

-"MEBR"?
-Yes. Mary Elizabeth Becca Ryan.

Her real fans call her MEBR.

I've literally never heard

Talk about MEBR?
I'm always talking about MEBR.

I love MEBR.
If I weren't such a big fan,

would I have MEBR tattooed
right above my root?

That is very low.

Yeah. It's a root tattoo.
They're low.

Brian, I have followed
her whole career

ever since she was the little
pig who went "oink, oink"

on <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

I can't believe
it's the same girl.

You know, all the <i>Jolly Farm</i>
kids grew up to be stars.

Except for the ones
who went broke, OD'd,

or are now just clickbait
mug shots on the CNN web page.

But I'm all in on MEBR.
She is a superstar.

I told you she'd grow up
to be hot.

You couldn't say that then
and you can't say it now.

Did and did.

Hey, Dad, will you have
a catch with me?

I heard girls like
baseball players,

There's no better...

Better call in
Boston Dynamics Dad instead.

Come on, sport.

I will throw
and catch with you

and not study your emotions
for future enslavement.

I think it might be time to get
your weight under control.

It's affecting your relationship
with Chris.

Boys need a father
who can spend time with them.

No, I'm fine.

Couple hard sniffs and a spit,

Okay, okay, that's a no-go.

Just put me on a blanket

Don't you think that song's

"Face Chair" isn't dirty.
Look at the lyrics.

"Knock, knock. There's a box.

"And it's coming for you.

"Open up. With care.

Then drop that box

my Taco Bell in the other room.

You know,
you shouldn't eat Taco Bell.

MEBR says you should
only eat organic food,

because it's better
for the environment.

two tacos and a big soda.

And, well, there's a lot
of bad info out there.

Anyway,
how can I help you today?

Peter needs to lose weight,
and we were hoping

you could help us.

Sure, there are
a few options we could try.

-You can increase your exercise.
-Pass.

-Switch to a vegan diet.
-I'd rather die.

-Or quit drinking.
-(bleep)

Is there something simple
we could start with first?

Yeah, what did
Honey Boo Boo's mom do?

We have a similar work ethic.

She had lap band surgery.

If you're interested
in that option,

the hospital is running
a promotion where it comes

with a free Nintendo Switch.

Lap band surgery is very popular
in the Switch community.

Do I have to walk
to the surgery room?

We'll put you on a blanket,
and slide you in right now.

I'll do it.

Hi. I'll speak for the group.

We heard about
what you did, Stewie.

No one wants to play with you.

Okay. I see.

I guess I'll just play with
this doctor's waiting room toy

where you push a bead
along a wire.

Plenty of room if anybody wants
to join.

It's a multi-kid toy. Anybody?

I already pushed the bead
through the double twist

where it gets fast for a second.

Scary part's over. Anybody?

Preschool is supposed
to be more about

socialization than education.

This could have lasting
long-term damage. Anybody?

They say kids
who aren't properly socialized

by the age of five
can never catch up.

Doctors agree. Anybody?

It doesn't necessarily affect
financial outcomes,

more affects stable
emotional relationships.

There's a lot of literature
about it. Anybody?

A long-term study out
of the University of Indiana

backs this up. I know
that doesn't sound impressive,

but all the Ivy League schools
couldn't find fault in it.

Anybody?

Go away, Brian.
I've already made my decision.

There's nothing you can say
that will change my mind.

You texted me to come outside.

This whole ordeal has made
my life a living hell,

and I no longer feel safe.

So Rupert and I have decided
to lay low for a while.

Where are you gonna go?

We're going to a restorative

in the mountains.

We will be unplugging our minds
and our bodies.

Yes, Rupert, there will still be
one thing getting plugged.

-(laughing)
-Oh, gosh.

I know. This guy is twisted.

Look, what's happened to you
is unfair.

The Stewie Griffin I know
is a good person.

And I want you to know
that I'm on your side.

Thanks, Brian.
Can you tweet that?

An online ally would be
really helpful right now.

-I know, right?
-Someone publicly standing up

for me could start
changing the conversation.

-Totally.
-Just need one person.

-All it takes is one.
-Could be you.

-Yep.
-You're still not
taking out your phone.

Look, my point is, I am here
for you right now, privately,

and out of earshot
of anyone I know.

You are gonna get
through this, champ.

-Coward.
-And friend.

I'm just gonna go grab
my sun hat,

and then we are out of here.

Rupert! No!

They killed him!

He blew up!

I had an IT band blow up
last year,

still finished the 10K.

<i>SINGERS:</i>
♪ <i>Cocky jogger.</i> ♪

A personal best.

Hey, Stewie. You doing okay?

I'm just going through
all of Rupert's stuff.

He had a space suit?

Yes, he wanted
to be an astronaut,

but he got disqualified
because of an astigmatism.

Every night he'd go to the
window and look up at the moon.

His unreachable dream.

Of course, he usually ended up
just staring at a night-light.

(crying):
He really did have
the vision of a crawfish.

Aw, please don't cry.

I start whining when people cry

because it sounds
like a fire truck.

It's just so unfair.

Rupert and I were finally
in a good place

after the difficulties
of the summer.

Oh, gosh.

Do you know what the worst part
of all this is?

Mary Elizabeth Becca Ryan
has said nothing.

She knows what her fans will do
when they're activated,

and she has been silent.

I know. She should have
to take some responsibility

for the actions of her fans.

-It's like Nelson Mandela said.
-This will be wrong.

"With great power
comes great responsibility."

Yeah, that's <i>Spider-Man.</i>

My point is, if celebrities
don't like something,

they can just not like it.

They don't have
to use their emotions

as a weapon to destroy people.

I'm lucky
I'm a strong-minded person.

Do you have any idea
how hard it is

to sit through
a couples' massage

when your partner's
not even there?

You still went on the retreat?

It was prepaid.

Eating 3,000 bucks isn't
gonna bring Rupert back.

Also, the Liebmans planned
their whole weekend around us,

and it just didn't seem right
to leave them high and dry.

Marty Liebman was on his iPad
the whole time.

Guy's addicted to work.

There you are.

Where have you
been all day, Peter?

You were supposed
to be helping Chris

with his science fair project.

Peter, get out of that cocoon!

It's a chrysalis.

Peter, the whole reason
you got this surgery

in the first place
was so you could spend time

with your son, and all
you've done is ignore him.

Stewie, you in there?

Stewie?

Oh, no. He's gonna kill her.

I've got to stop him.

I got to get
to the Walk of Fame.

Walk? Yeah, want
to go for a walk, boy?

I do.
Who wants to go for a walk?

Me! I'll get the leash.

Thank you.

Wow, very impressive, Patty.
I learned a lot.

I also learned that your parents
are little people.

And that certainly won't be
all I'm thinking about.

Our next student is
Chris Griffin,

presenting Benjamin Franklin's

discovery of electricity.

The year: 1752.

The man: Benjamin Franklin.

He owned two slaves,

a detail that is both important
and not important.

A simple gust of wind
stands between him

and an electric discovery.

(all gasp)

That was my glass eye,

but it's still
a tremendous inconvenience.

It's best to leave
these things in.

-I'm so sorry.
-No, no.

I knew the dangers
of this unpaid position.

Well, there's no way
to compete without a kite,

so the least surprising "F"
of the day goes to...

PETER:
I'll be his kite.

Dad?

I'm sorry I ditched you
this week, Chris.

I got so caught up
in my new body

that I forgot
who I did this for.

But I'm here now
and I want to make it up to you.

Chris Griffin.

Make me your kite.

Can we move on? This is weird.

No, I like weird. Continue.

It's working.

This is why I like weird.

So, as Benjamin Franklin's
slaves did all the hard work

around his house, he flew a kite
with his illegitimate son,

who grew up to fight
for the British against his dad.

And he invented
the rocking chair.

Where's his musical?

I've never seen Quahog
from this high before.

A lot of cars
parked in backyards.

What a dump.

(whimpering)

(grunting):
Rob Riggle!

Aah!
(grunts)

Well done, Chris.

Kind of a hit job on one
of our beloved founding fathers,

but he's had it good
for a while.

You win the science fair.

Did you hear that, Dad? I won.

Loud hiss, hot brain.

I couldn't have done it
without you.

Up and down shaky eyes.

Afternoon, citizens.

I said, "Afternoon, citizens."

ALL:
Afternoon, Mayor West.

That's better.

Today Quahog honors
Mary Elizabeth...

Hell, I'm not saying
the whole thing.

Her hands will be immortalized
with other Quahog greats

on this here sidewalk,
and definitely won't be sold

as molds
to Chinese sex doll companies.

We are mostly done with that.

You can't go through here.

It's only for people
who work for Miss Ryan.

You have to let me through.
I'm Ed Sheeran.

You're not Ed Sheeran.

You're a weird-looking baby
with an English accent.

(gasps)
Oh, my God!

Right this way, Mr. Sheeran.

Hey, MEBR.

Stewie, don't!

Killing her is
not gonna fix this.

Brian? I'm not gonna kill her.

I just want to talk to her.

An actual conversation
would have saved

this whole mess
in the first place.

Who are you guys,
and why are you backstage?

Don't you remember me?

I'm the guy
who insulted you online.

I'm the "oink oink" guy.

Wasn't that, like,
12,000 TikToks ago?

You tell time in TikToks?

Yeah, it's the sound
a clock makes.

What do you want?

You and your fans
ruined my life.

And it all
could have been avoided

if you just talked to me,

instead of to the world
about me.

Not every conflict needs
to be settled in public.

Like Justin Timberlake
could have apologized

to Britney in private

instead of notifying the world
what he was doing.

-(feedback)
-And shame on all of you

for blindly following
everything she says.

When did celebrity effectively
become the new religion?

Temperamental pop stars
shouldn't be deciding

what we think
and who we like or hate.

Instead of listening
to celebrities,

maybe we should take on
that same enthusiasm

and listen to scientists.

Maybe then the world could
finally be a better place.

Boo! MEBR rules!

Pretzel the baby!

I'm one of her adult fans.

(crowd booing, clamoring)

Nice speech, Stewie.

A lot of good it did.

Look at them, they don't care.
They're lost.

Well, you know,
people are desperate

for connection, Stewie.

Sometimes the only place
they can find it is online

in parasocial relationships
with a celebrity.

I just wish mine
didn't cost me Rupert.

About that.

I have someone
I want you to meet.

Rupert!

I stitched him back together.

He's pretty much himself
except for one small thing.

He lost his short-term memory
and has no recollection

of the difficulties
of the summer.

Thanks, Brian.

And if I'm honest,

I was to blame
for said difficulties.

Oh, buddy, I never cared.

Now let's get you out of here
before someone recognizes you.

Next time let's just bring
a hat and glasses.

I'm glad we worked
everything out, Dad.

What do you say we try
to have that catch again?

I would love to, Chris.

(panting)

Better call
in Boston Dynamics Dad again.

He's upstairs with Mom.

He's upstairs with her a lot.

I guess that's the future.

(laughs)

Can you stop laughing?

A robot is railing my mom.

Ah, boy, do I love
the Fall Festival.

Especially how
everywhere you turn

is the smell of pumpkin spice.

Pumpkin spice.

Sounds like a reject
from a female British pop band.

Quit tossing your scarf
over your shoulder

to punctuate your jokes.

You know what, Peter?

I like me.

Look, "Guess Your Weight."

With a line that long, I'll
guess my own wait: 30 minutes.

Oop, see you in a few.

Got scarfed up.

(laughing)

No. No, no, no.

I don't-- I don't
throw in public.

Ugh, and I only fetch.

All right, I'll see
if I can get my money back.

Excuse me?

Oh, cool. I like your tattoo.

Oh, that? Yeah, that's the
Hormone Monstress.

She likes sex
and I like sex, so I figured

I'd permanently disfigure
myself with something

I'd seen on Netflix three times.

You like sex, huh?

You, uh, wouldn't maybe want
to grab dinner sometime?

Nah, but I'll bang you
in the porta-potty

back by the
very loud generators.

The one that smells like all
different pees mixed together?

Um, hell yes.

See ya, Stewie.

Wait, you're just going to

leave me here by myself?

Look at all these
ne'er-do-wells.

When's that guy
gonna do well? Ne'er.

Hello, carnival-goers, and
welcome to "Generation Gap,"

where we learn which of these
parents and kids

know each other best.

How'd you get Dad to agree
to be in this?

I rescued him from
the corn maze, so he owes me.

Oh.

Yeah, he was crying.

Okay, first question:

Parents, what does your child
want to be

when they grow up?

How did you answer,
Team Number One?

Lady NASA scientist.

Okay, weird, and what did
you say, Dad?

<i>Hidden Figures</i> gal?

Judges?

-(bell dings)
-A match.

(crowd applauding)

Team Number Two?

You both said, "Retire after

large personal
injury settlement."

-Bravo.
-(bell dings)

-(crowd applauding)
-Team Three?

Guy who holds the "Slow" sign
during road construction.

And, Dad, you said...?

-Leprechaun.
-(buzzer buzzing)

(laughter)

Ooh, our first wrong answer.

Fat Leprechaun?

Also incorrect.

You may not understand the game.

Next question:

Kids, what would your parent
say is their hobby?

Team Number One?

Refurbishing people's

garage door openers.

That's a match.

-(bell ringing)
-It's one button.

You just got to fix one button.

Okay, final question.

Team Three, who is your child's
favorite singer?

<i>The Price is Right</i> yodeler.

What? No. I said Adele.

Judges?

(buzzer buzzing)

(laughter)

Ugh, this is more humiliating

than my first day working at
that rice pilaf company.

You know, I think we can start
putting pilaf in other things.

Lois, can I see you
in my office for a second?

(Lois sobbing)

I told you not to rock
the boat over there.

Oh, there you are, little dude.

Ah, finally back from
the carnival, I see.

Ah, it was amazing.

I got to tell you
all about Amber, amigo.

"Little dude"? "Amigo"?

Brian, have you...
have you forgotten my name?

I don't know, I-I spent
the whole afternoon

drinking ethanol out of a ladle.

It's "Stewie."

Stewie, right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Anyway, Amber is, like,
the perfect girl for me.

How old is she, even?

Well, she's so weathered

that that's a hard number
to peg.

Either 27 or 61.

But the thing is, Stewie,
she's leaving town

with the carnival
in three days, Stewie,

so it's sex-sex-sex and
then "adios," Stewie.

By the way, and, like,
relax about this,

but is abortion
still legal in Rhode Island?

Peter, it was humiliating
having the whole town witness

you and Chris not knowing the
first thing about each other.

I know the first
thing about him.

It was his goopy head squishing
out of you like toothpaste.

Peter, it's important
a boy knows his father.

Now go up to Chris' room
and talk to him.

(sighs)

Hey, Chris, can I talk
to you for a second?

Next door over, Chief.

Roger that.

-(Peter knocking)
-STEWIE: Yeah, Pop? What's up?

PETER:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

-Chris?
-Yes?

Phew.

(sighs) Is there something
you want, Dad?

I don't know.
Your mom sent me up here.

We-we embarrassed her in front
of the town or something.

Ugh, that is so Mom,

always getting mad about
stuff that doesn't even matter.

Oh, my God, tell me about it.

I can't tell you how tired
I am of hearing,

"Peter, don't use my hair dryer
to dry your anus."

(laughs) Yeah, or

"Chris, stop freezing
bees until they fall asleep

and gluing little leashes
on them."

(laughs) Totally.

God, I can't believe
you notice this stuff, too.

Oh, you mean like how if a pair
of her underpants goes missing

she can't just let it go
and move on?

Exactly.

(laughter)

Well, sounds like bonding to me.

Looks like somebody worked some
pretty good mom magic.

Huh? Where the hell
are all my underpants?

Okay, place your bets.

Stewie's shoe: burn or melt?

I'm gonna say
a little bit of melt,

and then a lot
of very quick burn.

Wow, would not have expected
rainbow sparks.

Lot of chemicals
near my baby's foot.

Well, look at you two
getting along.

Now I wonder who made
that happ--

Oh, my God, are you
lighting fires in the house?

Huh. Just what we
guessed you'd say.

Yeah, it was either
gonna be that or,

"I'm Lois. When I don't
hit my step goals,

I spin my arm
around to trick my Fitbit."

(laughter)

Wh-What is that?
Is that supposed to be me?

Oh, I don't know.
Maybe you'll recognize this one.

"I'm Mom. I cry on the toilet

as I circle things in catalogs
I'll never afford."

(laughter)

(smoke alarm beeping)

Ah, damn it.
Look what you guys did.

(toy siren wails)

All right, men, looks like Mom's
got this one under control.

Now back to the station for
spaghetti and a group shower.

Oh, hey, Stewie, perfect timing.

-Amber, come meet Stewie.
-Pass.

Ooh, he's so cute.

I just got to kidnap him,
don't I?

Would you like that?

I stuff you in a duffel bag,

zip it up, we're in Indiana
before you know it?

Charmed.

Isn't she awesome?

You want to come inside, babe?

Nah, I'm just gonna park it here
for a few hours

and watch <i>Fuller House</i>
on my stepson's cracked iPad.

I'm telling you, Stewie, this
thing is all next-level sex.

The rugs in her van are just
filled with crushed Froot Loops.

So, while we're doing it, I can
lean over and lick the crumbs.

I'm familiar with
the temptations

of crushed Froot Loops,
thank you.

Brian, you should know
the Nextdoor app

is on fire right now.

"Have you seen the van?"
"What's with the van?"

"Here's a photo of the van."

"I checked with the police
and we can't get rid of the van

unless we witness
criminal activity."

And then just some
nervous comments

about the Black Amazon driver,
but you get the gist.

Hurry up, gang,
the movie starts soon.

What are we seeing, Mom?

Oh, something I've been
waiting forever for:

<i>Penelope's Struggle</i>
starring Renée Zellweger.

The dramatic, true story

of the first female
carriage driver for the Queen.

That movie sounds terrible.

And, besides, Chris and I had
our hearts set on seeing

the re-release of
<i>You Don't Mess with the Zohan,</i>

now remastered
to be 40% louder.

Oh, but, Peter,
you know I always choose

the movie for
family movie night.

It's tradition.

Yeah, but just now I'm realizing
Chris and me are two guys.

And you're only one guy.

So, technically,
we can outvote you.

I'm sorry. Out-outvote me?

But-- but what about Meg?

I-I mean, she obviously
gets a vo--

All in on <i>Zohan,</i> bro.

<i>ZOHAN:</i>
<i>My armpit is smelly</i>

<i>and now you smell like</i>
<i>my smelly armpit.</i>

(laughs) The whispers
in this movie

would be yells in other movies.

(Fitbit beeping)

Ugh, these are basically steps,

it's the same thing as steps.

You can put all that away, Lois.

Me and Chris just bought
dinner at the grocery store.

The-the grocery store?
W-Without me?

Okay, so everybody gets
four puddings

and their own package
of bologna.

But I spent all day
making lasagna.

Yeah, no, our thing is more fun.

Shall we take a vote?

All in favor say "aye."

-Aye.
-Aye.

The "ayes" have it.

Sorry, Lois, democracy.

Oh, and we're dragging
the TV into the dining room.

What? You know that's
not allowed.

Vote? All in favor say "aye."

-Aye.
-Aye.

"Ayes" have it, sorry.
Kids, dinner.

Dad, can we watch
<i>The White Lotus</i> ?

Why not?

I poop in a suitcase,

I'm wrestled
to the ground at LaGuardia.

That guy does it: gold statue.

(phone chimes)

Oh, boy.

What? What is it?

Text from Amber:

"We should talk
about where this is going."

Man, what if she wants
to get married?

Ugh, looks like I have
to break things off with her.

(tires screeching)

Hey, Amber.
Listen, I got your text--

Brian, this here
ain't working out.

We need to break up.

What?
You're breaking up with me?

Whoa. Dumped by a carny. Brutal.

Yeah, I've been thinking.

We don't really
have much in common.

I mean, you don't know
a single Kid Rock lyric

or the names of
any monster trucks.

Monst-- I--
Grave Maker, that's one.

Ah! Grave Digger!
You're embarrassing yourself!

Come on, what's this
really about?

Is this because I couldn't
smash that Percocet

into powder fast enough?

Goodbye, Brian.

Wow, buddy, I just want you
to know that I'm...

She's stealing our mail.

She's stealing our mail!

Thanks for meeting me, guys.

I should warn you:
this is gonna be

a two-hands-on-the-coffee-cup
conversation.

All right. Time to get
some work done.

Don't mind me.

This is screenwriting software.

You've probably
never seen it before.

You guys, I don't know
what to do.

I-I told Peter to bond
with Chris, and he did,

but now, well,
it's like they've stolen

all the power in the family.

Oh, no, no, no.

For a mother to remain
in control of her family,

she needs to make sure
there are no alliances

she's not a part of.

If a scene is in the sea,

would you put
"interior" or "exterior"?

Ah, never mind.

No alliances, huh?

What's a funny name for a boat?

Well, then, that's it.

I have to drive a wedge
between Peter and Chris.

Push them back apart.

Okay, now to loudly watch this
Aaron Sorkin MasterClass.

<i>AARON SORKIN:</i>
<i>Hi, I'm Aaron Sorkin and</i>
<i>I've been paid a lot of money</i>

<i>to give you false hope</i>
<i>about your ridiculous dream.</i>

Oh, thanks, you guys.

I got this.

What the hell?

My credit card is gone.

"Dear Lois,

Chris and I borrowed your credit
card to shop for fireworks

you would normally
have to be a town to buy."

(fireworks exploding)

(Peter distantly laughing)

PETER:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

Gather all the fingers! Ow!

All right, time to put an end
to this Peter-Chris alliance.

Hey, FYI, I accidentally got
in the shower with my socks on.

I wasn't sure what to do,

so I just mashed them down
the drain with my elbow.

Peter, we need to talk.

I just found the oddest thing
in Chris' room.

It's this essay he apparently
wrote for school

about his hero: Joe Swanson.

Joe Swanson?

Let me see that.

Okay, th-this is actually quite
long, can you just summarize it?

Chris says,

I've been like
a father to that kid.

I know, right?

I mean, who does Chris
think he is?

The last three pages

how you're aging as well
as Jennifer Lopez.

(laughing)

Well, that's our son.

Oh, hey, Chris.

You know, I just found
the oddest thing

in your father's room:

an essay he wrote for work
about his favorite son,

Charles from <i>Charles in Charge.</i>

What? But Charles wasn't
even one of the sons.

He was their babysitter.

I'm so sorry.

I know it must be hard
to hear that your father

would rather be a parent
to a fictional character

who the writers, in five
seasons, never even bothered

to give a last name--

a totally weird but true fact,
feel free to Google that--

than his own son.

I hate him so much.

Wait, Dad dots all his
I's with a smiley face?

Yeah, that means he's got flair.

Maybe those faces
brighten his otherwise

bleak day just a tiny bit.

Maybe he's known for them.

I don't know,
it seems stupid and weird.

You're stupid and weird!

Now I see why
your father prefers

Charles Last Name Unknown.

Hello, uh, my name is Stewie,

and I'm a milk-aholic.

Okay, I figured out
what I got to do:

I need to get back together
with Amber.

What? But I thought you were
just about to break up with her.

Brian, are you sure this isn't
just your wounded ego talking?

Pfft, no. What?

No, I-I can really
see us together.

There's something romantic about
her style of life on the road.

Oh, really?
What's the romantic part?

Taking a whore bath
in a Taco Bell restroom

or peeing in a Gatorade bottle
that you leave near a payphone?

You don't know what
you're talking about.

Don't I?

Because I think that
you can't stand

that you got dumped by a carny,

someone you feel
is inferior to you.

Fine, you're right, okay?
I'm pissed.

That's why I'm off to win
Amber back so I can dump her.

Look, man, I don't know if
Lois and the fat man told you,

but they found a lump
on your neck.

Is this really what you want
to spend your time on?

What the hell?

I thought you said we were both
gonna get Mark Davis haircuts.

-Who's that?
-This maniac.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I'm talking about
the voice mail you left me.

Which now I see was all just
a trick to humiliate me.

-I didn't leave you

Brian? What are you doing?

Amber, please take me back.

Look, I even brought you
a peace offering:

a pack of cigarettes
and some Nicorette gum

because I wasn't sure which way
you wanted to go this week.

Aw, that's sweet.

I'm-a smoke and chew them both
for an extra nicotine surge.

It's what carnies call
"The Surf and Turf."

Well, that doesn't
make much sense,

but it sure is two things.

Amber, we have
something special.

I want us to grow mold together.

Aw, me, too.

And I'd love
to take you back, Brian,

but if we're a couple,
that means

you'd have to be willing
to come on the road

and work the carnival with me.

I mean, that's my life.

Of course.
I'm totally up for that.

Really?

Aw, that's boss!

Let's do it!

Okay, great, so you
do take me back?

Well, then, as long as we're
officially a couple again,

I have something to say.

Amber, if you think
for one second--

Oh, my gosh, Uncle Earl, you got
to meet my new boyfriend Brian.

Good to meet you, Brian.

But don't you break
her heart, you hear?

Last guy who treated her wrong

had his scrotum
nail-clippered off,

then got kicked to death
behind a Chick-fil-A.

I assure you, my intentions
are strictly honorable.

Okay, then.

I'm just telling you this as
her uncle and her ex-boyfriend.

Check it out, Chris.

Your mom tries to turn us
against each other?

Well, this ought to teach her
a thing or two.

Your plan is to drop
a piano on Mom?

No, not at all.

See, your mother
loves this piano,

and by stringing it up
in the air like this,

she'll never be able
to touch it again.

That's genius.

My plan was just to suggest
something to you halfheartedly

and then immediately back down
like a beta.

I think we should
go with my plan.

No, yeah,
your-your plan is better.

Oh, hey, you two.
What's all this?

Don't play dumb, Mom.

Chris and I see you're
trying to push us apart.

Yeah, we're your husband
and your son

and we were actually getting
to know each other,

but it seems like some part
of you wanted that to fail.

Oh, you guys, I am so sorry.

You're right.

I guess, at first, I felt bad
you were making fun of me,

and then later I resented
that you'd removed me entirely

from any family decision-making.

But what I did was awful.

I genuinely hope you
can forgive me.

Honestly, Lois, I'm not certain
I will be able to excuse this.

But I pray that, with time,
healing may come.

What? You do something crazy
basically once a week

and I always forgive you.

Fine. Get a Mark Davis haircut
and we'll call it even.

I hate you for this, Peter.

I know.

Now let's go upstairs

Well, these last few days--

-(piano crashing)
-Ahh! Son of a bitch!

I think it just fell on Brian.

He has had a bad week.

(sighs) Anyway,
like I was saying,

these last few days
have been quite an adventure,

but I'm just happy that
everything is back to normal.

Yes. And now I must away

In an effort
to win the election,

Doug has stooped to
the most preposterous

of lies and mudslinging.

He claims I was a whoops baby.
A mistake.

Well, if you think about it,
it, it is possible.

No, it's not.
That's absurd.

To be honest,
I've wondered the same thing.

You are much younger
than Chris and Meg.

Lois and Peter had two children
back-to-back,

a boy and a girl,
one of each, and then stopped.

And those two
were already a stretch

for Peter's meager salary.

I mean, don't you think
it's a little odd

that their plan would include
waiting 14 years,

until Lois was in her 40s--

not exactly prime
reproductive years--

to have their third child?

I-I'm not saying it's true,

but if you do the math,
it kind of makes sense.

My God, everything
about this is terrible.

Why do you think
Peter keeps leaving you

on the fire station steps?

Most things about this
are terrible.

Come on, little guy,
time to go to the fire station.

Let me just fix my face.

All right, let's go.

<i>Her and the wind.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

we're gonna dance to a song

written in 1985.

Okay, kids, remember,
it's Father's Day,

we have to pretend

Here it comes, we get to watch
him remove his mouth guard.

Good morning, family.

Let's see if I can break

-Sure you do.

Since it's Father's Day,

you have to do that thing

No!

Huh, son of a bitch.

a scavenger hunt would be fun.

Dads don't want fun

Anyway, now you look like a man

In fact,
my son was having a problem

that maybe a good dad
could help him solve.

There's a girl I like at school,

and I'm not sure
if she likes me back.

Now here's what you should do:

You take out
a hefty silver dollar,

and you drop it
in her corset.

If it's meant to be,
she'll accept you

in a room full of
distractingly floral wallpaper.

If not,
she'll stab you in the liver

with your own boot knife.

That's how I met my Pearl.

I think you're ready.

When Mayor West sees you now,

he's gonna know you're serious
about being his dad.

Thank you
for all your help, Peter.

You make a good partner,

and I want you
to have something.

It's the dried hand

of a Paiute
I found in the desert.

It's very important to me,

and now it's yours.

Is-is this a way to break
some kind of curse on you?

You need to make
the decision to take it.

Yeah, m-maybe just
leave it on the ground.

It doesn't work like...

It'll just wind up
back in my pocket.

Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

Well, looks like someone thinks

a shave and a haircut
means he's a changed man.

Son, I don't know how much time
I have left in this world.

Because of the cursed hand?

That does add to the stress.

I just want to make things
right between us.

I don't buy it,

and I'm gonna do to you

what should have been done
a long time ago.

(whistles)

(guns cocking)

You're under arrest
for shooting the mayor.

You ambushed me.

A real man is always
ready for an ambush.

And a man also knows
how to get out of an ambush.

(whistles)

Hmm.

(video game
gunshots and screams)

Don't you have to work today?

No, I work on Thursday.

Uh, dude? Today is Thursday.

Dang it.

(hoofbeats receding)

Forgot my phone.

(siren wailing)

I should have never
listened to you, Peter.

If I had my gun,
I would have gotten out of this.

I was only trying to help.

You want to help?

Take this Paiute hand
and put it in a safe place.

Oh, okay, yeah, I can...
Oh, wait a minute.

And I reckon you're pretty
happy with yourself,

getting your father
arrested like this.

I reckon you have
no right to reckon about

what I'm reckoning about.

That's where you're wrong.

I reckon I can reckon about
what I reckon please.

I reckon you should
check yourself

before you reckon yourself.

I reckon you know I always
come in like a reckon ball.

That Miley?

I reckon it is.

I don't agree with
all the piercings and haircuts,

but she's got
one hell of a voice.

A hell of a voice.

Joe, you can't arrest him.

He shot the mayor, Peter.

Plus, he's got multiple
warrants in multiple states.

Yeah, I know, he really
messed up. Like David Geffen.

What the hell was that?

Yeah, David Geffen
paid us $10 million

not to do the cutaway.

Huh. Was it bad?

I'm not allowed to say
as part of the settlement.

All I will say is from film,
to music, to politics,

no one has been more influential
than David Geffen.

What's the matter, Peter?

Ah, I don't know,
I just feel bad

about what happened
with Old West.

It's my fault he got arrested.

He's probably gonna die in jail

without ever
making up with his son.

Well, I know how painful it is

to see a man you've known
for 18 hours in distress,

but you've got
to let it go, Peter.

I can't do that.
Old West and I were partners,

and he taught me that when
you work a job with someone,

you never leave a man behind.

We got to form a posse
and break him out.

-I'm in.
-Let's do this.

-Yeah.

He yelled at me.

All right, Peter,

I thought you guys

I formed the posse.

Yeah, those usually go together.

He lives in L.A., right?
Where does he live?

Um, hey, settle
a bet for me, Bosch.

In all those scenes where
you're in Italian restaurants,

is it true
you're eating real spaghetti?

PETER:
Shut up.

I knew it was real spaghetti.

All right, I'm gonna go
get us some coffees.

You mind holding down
the fort for a sec?

Thanks, Bosch.

Real spaghetti. Wow.

You got to strip.

PETER:
What about tonight?

What?

Oh, did you say, "I'm never
gonna get out of here?"

No, I was telling
my horse to get naked.

Oh. Oh, well-well,
we're breaking you out tonight.

I'm surprised
you came back for me.

You taught me to never
leave another man behind.

I didn't think you'd remember.

I associate you with guns,
guns make me think of war,

Vietnam was a war,

and N.A.M.

I-I don't need
to hear the process.

Allen, you came.

Of course I did.

And I think margs
are gonna be on you

after this adventure, huh?

I don't drink that (bleep).

Okay, we'll
figure something out.

Everyone wanted to help.

We even got a member of

Oh. Well, we must've moved

Uh, try the middle drawer.

Because that drawer

is also filled to the brim

It's rare that
you can relate to someone

I know this is crazy, and
I-I don't use this word lightly,

but I love the way
you cut sandwiches.

Keep the playdate going?

Maybe take out
the popcorn machine?

Let me touch all the buttons.

You can pour in the kernels.

-You think I'm ready?
-No,

but I'll make sure
you don't spill.

break it off or go full scumbag.

as something else.

Aw, but he's so cute.

(moans)

Oh, I don't care who she is.
She can stay.

-(bell rings)
-I'll be right back.

(grunts)

Hello, dear.

I heard the doorbell,
who was it?

Delivery guy. We ordered dinner.

-Oh, where did you order from?
-That place you hate.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

Well, maybe I'll just come
downstairs and join you anyway.

You know,
it's been about a week,

and I'm starting to feel better.

Uh, no, no, no. Trust me,

you-you-you don't want
to go downstairs.

Uh, Brian is talking
about the Electoral College.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

-I'll just eat dinner up here.
-(doorbell rings)

<i>Excusez moi.</i>

(yelps, chuckles)

Hi, I have your boner
and butt pills from Gladiator.

That's supposed to be discreet.

Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

Upstairs-- Uh, the big upstairs.

-That's what we call heaven.
-Mm. I get it.

I tell T.J. that
my late husband Scott's...

-(yawns) Huh?
-(bell rings)

Mom's calling.

I-I told them every time
a bell rings,

that's their mom saying hello.

-LOIS: Help.
-Help, help. Saying-saying help.

She-she died very painfully.
<i>Pardonnez moi.</i>

You forgot your box
of boner and butt pills.

It's discreet.

(grunts)

(singsongy):
Mur-der the carpet.

Hello.

I-- What are you doing?

Can you help me down the stairs?

Uh, th-the doctor said
to stay in bed a week.

You know, I just need
to get out of this room.

My back is killing me.

(inhales sharply) Lois,

if you stay up here
for the rest of the night,

I will use
the marital tongue on you.

Okay, but this time,
I get to pick the spot.

In the meantime, can you just
get me the heating pad

for my back? It's in the attic.

-(timer dings)
-The roast.

Wait a minute,
I'm not cooking dinner.

Heating pad, heating pad,
heating pad...

-(door closes)
-Oh, crap.

Hey. H-Hey,
what are you doing, Bonnie?

I told Lois I would bring her
a loaf of my sourdough bread.

-She doesn't want it.
-What?

I just talked to her.

She's dead. Lois died. Go away.

Oh, my God.

What are you doing
with her washing machine?

It's not for sale.
You'd need a furniture dolly

to get it out
of the basement anyway.

We have one. I'll give you $100.

Yeah, y-- O-O-Okay.
Maybe. Maybe.

Will it fit through
the bulkhead door?

Yeah, it looks like it'll fit.

It'll totally fit.

Yeah, all right.
Let's do it. $100.

Heating pad.

(laughs) Ah, wonderful.

(yelps)

Ugh, terrific.

(stomping on roof)

(scoffs) Probably a prowler.
It's cool, I know him.

He'll just go right into my bed.

-Hey.
-Hey, Meg's eating dinner.

That's cool, I'll wait.

(laughing):
It's kind of my thing.

How am I gonna get down?

If you hold this feather,
you can fly.

Really? Wow, thanks, little rat.

Ow! (grunts)

That's for putting locks
on your garbage cans, you dick.

(gasps)

Heating pad.

Where did you go?
And why was your box

of boner and butt pills
on the stairs?

I almost tripped.

Those are discreet.

Now, let's get you
back upstairs.

(gasps, grunts)

(groans) It's all right, Peter,

-just open the Calm app.
-(phone beeps)

"Your credit card
has been decli..." Whee!

There you are, Peter.
Are you okay?

Is this your mother?

I'm sorry. Who the hell are you,
and why are you holding my baby?

See? Total bitch, right?

Boy, this-this is gonna be
a really funny story

when I tell you both separately
far away from each other.

-Hey, Mom.
-Mom?

Peter said you were dead.

Dead? I am not dead.

I was just recovering
from foot surgery,

so I put him
in charge of the kids.

-Now, what the hell happened?
-Heating pad?

I cannot believe this, Peter.

You've been lying to me?

I thought we had something.

And what kind of a mother
leaves their husband

with the kids for a week?
It is a miracle they're alive.

-Excuse me?
-I'll tell you
what kind of mother,

the best mom there is.

I'm sorry I lied to you, Becky.

All I wanted was free popcorn.

Taking care of kids
is relentless.

There's no escape.

You know, unless you
"accidentally" leave them

in a hot car.

I mean, you'd get less jail time

than actual murder, right?

And-and prison has to be
quieter than your actual life.

Anyway, if I've learned
anything this week,

it's that all mothers
are heroes,

and the biggest hero I know

is the one I'm lucky enough
to call my wife.

Oh, Peter,

that almost cancels out
everything you've done.

Look, Becky, I don't blame you
for what happened.

Nobody does.

But you're a beautiful woman,

you can do better than a
44-year-old morbidly obese guy.

You know what, you're right.

Ever since I lost
my late husband Scott, I...

Bonnie's dragging

Hey, Stewie,

The most glorious website

You know, you should really

<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>On March 7th, 1999,</i>

<i>a resistance took place</i>
<i>at Tree House Day Care</i>

<i>in Atlanta, Georgia,</i>

<i>that would expose the truth</i>
<i>about nap time forever.</i>

<i>Harold "Harry" Brockmeyer,</i>
<i>age three,</i>

<i>refused to nap.</i>

<i>He was not tired,</i>
<i>as he had slept 16 hours</i>

<i>the previous evening.</i>

Well, ho... ly (bleep).

<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>The fact is,</i>

<i>naps only exist</i>

<i>for the oppression</i>
<i>of young children</i>

<i>and as a scam to give parents</i>
<i>time to themselves.</i>

Could it be true?

Oh, I must get
to the bottom of this,

like a hard-nosed
police detective.

Jenkins, I'm taking you
off this murder.

You're too close to the case.

Okay, but what if I could get
further away from the case?

-What do you mean?
-What if I could, like,

not care who killed that family?

Oh. Well, then you could stay
on the case, obviously.

-As long as you don't care.
-Care about what?

The ca-- Uh... Nice. (laughs)

Get back to work.

Okay, Stewie,
time to rest your little head.

Here's your bottle.

Mommy's gonna nap, too.
Sweet dreams.

(cork pops)

(gasps) She's not sleeping.

She's scrolling through
old photos of herself.

This is exactly what the video
was talking about.

Ugh, look how young I looked.

Oh, my God, now she's retweeting
Hoover sponsored content,

trying to get a free vacuum.

Oh, and now she's scrolled past
a fundraiser

for "Women of Iran,"
not even a "like."

Hey, Quagmire.
What are you doing here?

One of these gals turning 18?

No, Peter. Believe it or not,
I actually care

about Adam West High School
girls basketball.

I'm a longtime fan of the sport,
and I find it relaxing here.

It's never crowded.

Just me and the goth kids
who come here

to actively ignore the game.

So then I said, "What do you
think of my hair now, Dad?"

-What did he say?
-He said he loved me either way.

Ass.

This could be
that championship season.

Finally get that team photo
up at Applebee's.

Oh, God, I don't want
to get ahead of myself.

I don't care about any of that.
Meg is trying out,

and Lois made me come
because she says I'm her "dad."

(whistle blows)

Okay, Griffin, you're up next.
Take a shot.

-(sighs)
-Yeah, no.

I've seen enough, Griffin.

I guess I was wrong about you.

Hey, Meg, I can see your penis.

-(laughs) She looked.
-She did look.

(all gasp)

What, are your feet nailed
to the ground? Jump.

Well, okay. You're on the team.

was pumping gas this morning.

-A lot, a lot

Come on,
where's the energy, ladies?

And that was meant
to be an insult.

Ow!

What happened to the Meg
I saw in tryouts?

Our first game is tomorrow,

and the whole team
is counting on you.

-Hey, Meg.
-They just let any strange adult

in here anytime, huh?

Yeah, well, the gym is not
connected to the main campus,

so, uh... But listen, I think
I know what your issue is.

You did much better
at tryouts, right?

-Yeah.
-Well, what was different?

My socks? Wait, no, no.

-Still the same.
-Your dad was here.

Do you think
Dad helps me play better?

"Help" is a more positive word
than I would use,

but, technically, yeah.

Each time he heckled you,
you played well.

I just wanted
to prove him wrong.

Well, there's your spinach,
Popeye.

(laughs) Man, am I aging myself.

All right, I'm gonna go

Done with naps.
My eyes are wide open now, Bri,

-and they're never
closing again.
-What's gotten into you?

I've been fed lies, Brian.

Vaccine-laced breast milk
and lies.

I recently watched
a video on YouTube...

-Oh, here we go.

invented by grown-ups
so that they can goof-off.

-What?
-And it doesn't stop there.

it's for their own good.

in a nine-seven slugfest.

We're so sorry, honey.

Yeah, but it turns out

our team is still advancing
to the championship game.

-Really?
-Yeah.

The other team was disqualified
from the league.

I guess one of them
was Gilbert Gottfried.

I have to do something.

Y'all mind if I record this

for teaching purposes
or whatever?

Sure.

Now, Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson,

can you tell me about
Stewie's "problem"?

(high-pitched):
Well, it's not something
a proper lady

is used to talking about,

but I believe
it was something he saw.

(Southern accent):
What's the big deal?
It's just sex.

Mrs. Padberry-Winkie-Woo
is just a prude

who's never gotten
enough "vitamin D,"

if you know what I mean.

(high-pitched):
Excuse me.

I will have you know
I am a tigress in the bedroom.

-This is ridiculous.
-Shh.

I find the best thing to do
with multiple personalities

is to summon them all

and let them work out
they differences.

(Southern accent):
Oh, is that so, Miss Tigress?

(high-pitched):
Quite right.

(Southern accent):
How's about you hoist off
them BVDs,

and I do you
on a front yard couch?

(high-pitched):
Why, Mr. Boone, you're terrible.
Don't stop.

I ain't gonna.

-(moaning)
-Enough. Stewie.

You're losing it because
you haven't napped in days.

You're cranky. You're scared.

Listen, what you saw
in Peter and Lois's bedroom

is not what you think.

It was just... Lois looking
very closely at the sheets

so she could check
the thread count.

And Peter was just...
cheering her on from behind.

Really? That makes sense.

I like that. Phew.

Ah, I guess I really could
use a nap.

Sometimes you just have to trust
what your parents tell you.

-It's in your best interest.
-Yes, maybe you're right.

(high-pitched):
Determining thread count with
the naked eye would take hours.

Your father walked out
after 30 seconds, apologizing.

Well, we were in our house,

Stewie?
What are you doing up?

Lois had three lattes
and a bottle of wine today,

so her breast milk was
basically a speedball.

-You?
-I'm writing.

The last two months I've
really gotten my act together.

I stopped drinking, and I'm
about to self-publish a book.

Ugh. None of the
big boys bit, huh?

No, it's fine. I'm actually
at a point in my life

where I don't need
external validation.

I'm just proud of
accomplishing my goal.

That's great.
I'm happy for you.

Even if your privilege
is showing.

Privilege?
I worked hard to...

Ooh, white fragility much,
Brian?

Okay, maybe I've had
certain advantages,

-but how...
-How?

It's not <i>our </i>job

to solve
<i>your </i>problems, pal.

-Do the work.
-Our?

I-- Who are you even
talking about?

Well, not you,
you big honky Karen.

Ha. I'm just, I'm just
riding your jock, Bri.

That's amazing you wrote a book.

Well, thanks.

You know, I'm having a little

publishing party on Thursday.

I'd love it if you could come.

Yeah. Uh, Rupert, do we have
anything on Thursday?

Okay, then, looks like
we're good to go.

Awesome. All right, Stewie.
I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.

Way to think fast, you dope.

Now we have to go.

<i>You </i>can't?!

Oh, now you have something

Oh, hey, Preston,
I'm glad you're here.

I'm about to test the prototype
for "Deskpoline."

Oh... Top will need

Anyway, what can I do you for?

I'm sorry to say
I have some bad news.

Well, that was tough
to hear, sir,

but thanks for giving it
to me straight.

I haven't even told you yet.

Stella will be gone
for six weeks.

She's taking a bereavement
leave.

Her husband died?

Okay, Peter, you got six weeks
to lose 100 pounds

and get divorced.
Let's do this.

No, Peter, it was her cat.

Employees now get six weeks to
mourn the loss of a pet.

It's our way of saying,
"Your animal died, so thanks."

Wait, hang on,
let me get this straight.

If your pet dies,

you get six weeks off?

Yes.

Let's see how long you last

Huh, brake's out.

his new book <i>Chasing My Tale...</i>

Tale is spelled T-A-L-E,

not like the thing on my butt.

...please welcome author
Brian Griffin.

Thank you so much for being here

-Why are you even here?

Just a hunch.
Please proceed.

"My mother was a huge bitch,

"and I lost my virginity
at six months old.

"Oh, I'm sorry,
I should have told you first,

"I'm a dog.

"So I turned to Fran Lebowitz

"'I may have been born

"but I'm definitely not trash.'

"Then she put on my jeans
and left.

"And so, as the sweet
mango flavor

"hit my lungs for the last time,

"I placed the vape pen
on Nelson Mandela's grave

"and knew that we were both now,

"in a sense, finally free.

The beginning."
Thank you. Thank you.

God, that took forever.

I know. I gotta go.

The twins have
a volleyball game.

-There you go, Seamus.
-Thanks.

I'll put it right on my shelf.

Hey, thanks so much
for coming, Stewie.

Of course.
What a night.

I mean, most authors wouldn't
have read the whole book.

I just felt it
from the crowd, you know?

Anyway, it means everything
to have you here,

so thanks again.

Oh, another hand
for Brian Griffin.

And if the eight of you could
somehow buy

a quarter of a million dollars
worth of books,

tomorrow I won't have to marry
a man I've never loved.

Thank you.

Excuse me, could you please
direct me to the

"about to die" section?

Sure, right this way.

We have this snake who's tying
himself into a noose,

-this near-death gerbil...
-BRUCE: Dibs!

And I'll take his
cardboard tube, too.

I snoozed and I lost.

You've heard of
a Japanese fighting fish?

This is a Japanese
honorable suicide fish.

He got fired eight months ago
and hasn't told his family.

He spends all day in a suit
riding the train.

Too much backstory.

We also have a very old parrot.

-Or you can kill my mother
for money.
-What?

I said we have
a very old parrot.

Why, did you hear something else
you'd be open to?

Family, may I kindly
introduce you

to our ticket to
six weeks bereavement leave

in lovely Puerto Vallarta:

an 80-year-old parrot.

I call him Gonzo,
'cause of <i>The Muppet Show.</i>

And also 'cause soon, he gone!

Peter, I don't want
some elderly bird

crapping all over the house.

Fine. If I can't have
the parrot,

you can only have one
pink razor in the shower

at a time.

You can have your bird.

(sniffing)

(sniffs)
Ooh, you smell that, Brian?

First fire of the season.

It won't be long before
the leaves start changing

and the sap starts flowing.

Let's just look around
and take in

the pageantry of autumn.

Chris, Bonnie's gone to bed.

She's not gonna open
her curtains again.

Just take your dump
and let's go.

Hey, check it out.

A little free library.

How white people make
giving away their trash

seem like generosity.

What the...
Is this my book?

This is the copy
I gave to Stewie.

Why, did he even bring it home?

Is our friendship
worth nothing to him?

I'm gonna go home
and give him--

Oh, Bonnie opened her curtains.

BONNIE (laughing):
Ooh!

-Mmm.
-JOE: Sounds like somebody's
having fun.

Joe? I thought that was you.

Ah, goodness no.

Pass me a Michael Crichton.
She's gonna be a while.

Does this look familiar, Stewie?

It's the culmination
of my life's work,

and it was in
the little free library

being given away!

What? That's so weird, man.

-So how'd it end up there?
-I don't know.

Some liberal cuck
Marie Kondo-ed his loft?

Well, it's your copy,
so you tell me.

That's ridiculous.
My copy is right here

on my book shel-- What?

-Not there, huh?
-No, it isn't.

-This is insane.
-Oh, is it?

Let me check my
security footage.

Crazy, man.
The footage is gone.

How did you even know
when to check?

I didn't tell you
when I found it.

All the footage is gone.

Somebody must have blown a jammy

down at central
and fried the whole grid.

Total zapparino.

Just admit you got rid
of my book.

Brian, not only did I not
give away your book,

I'm launching an investigation,

-and I'm gonna nail
the guy who did it.
-Uh-huh.

And maybe it's more
than one guy.

Maybe it's a ring.

A deep ring I can only penetrate

by nailing a bunch of guys.

Wait, are you still talking
about my book?

Oh, yeah. Maybe it's
too many guys for me

and I have to bring in
a private dick.

Close the door
on your way out, Brian.

I need privacy to think
about dicks for hire.

Thanks, Jerome, but I got this.

-Awesome.
-Whoa!
-So cool.

Yeah, you know,
I only bought Gonzo just to die

and go on vacation,

but now we're having
the time of our lives.

He's like the son I never had.

(whistles) <i>Und du bist wie mein</i>
<i>dicker vater! </i>(squawks)

His language is so weird.

It sounds like anger,
repressed sexuality

and a pig being shot
by a paintball.

-Peter, that's German.
-How do you know?

I speak German.
I went on an exchange trip

in high school,
and for some reason

my parents never bought
the airfare back.

Cool. We can communicate
with him.

Joe, ask Gonzo where he's from.

Gonzo, <i>woher kommst du?</i>

(whistles) <i>Ich wurde 1942</i>
<i>in Düsseldorf geboren.</i>

<i>Mein besitzer hieß</i>
<i>Adolf Hitler. </i>(squawks)

I heard 1942.

Peter, he just said his owner
was Adolf Hitler.

-Well, that can't be right.
-Hitler had a what now?

Look, it's him.

(whistles) <i>Das bin ich.</i>

<i>Icherinneremich daran.</i>
(squawks)

He said, "That's me.
I remember that."

Peter, your bird is a Nazi.

That can't be right.

Uh, Nazi want a cracker?

Nazi want a cracker.
(squawks)

Oh, my God, you're right.

Wow, good thing
you know German, Joe.

Yeah, and just so you know,
the German culture has

very different notions of
what's cool to do sexually.

So whatever happened over there
was completely normal,

and I don't think about it
during quiet moments.

-Joe?
<i>-Nein caca! Nein!</i>

<i>Ich no möcshte caca!</i>

I mean, uh, crazy about
Peter's bird, right?

BRIAN:
Stewie!

-I know you gave my book away.
-What is this?

Everyone on our street
has a ring camera.

Hello, I'm back.
You guys were right.

Murdering strangers
is better than paying

my credit card bill.

Okay, fine, Brian,
you caught me.

I got rid of the book
you forced me to take

after you badgered me
into coming to your reading.

Well, what the hell, Stewie?!

I sat through your reading,
I said congratulations,

I took the book.

Where do my obligations end?

Obligations?
Are you so narcissistic,

you can't do one
small thing for me?

<i>I'm </i>narcissistic?

You're the one who leaves
your book on display in my room.

Oh, sorry it's such a chore
to literally just

keep a book on a book shelf.

Okay, all right, even though
I only have e-books,

here's your stupid book
on a shelf like it's 1958.

Did you even read
the inscription?

-Yes.
-Well, then, what did it say?

"From one hardbody to another."

"To every author's dream reader
and a true kindred spirit.

"You lit the flame
that ignited my soul.

"My best friend, my inspiration,

"and the only person
who truly gets me.

I owe you everything.
B. Edward Griffin."

Your initials are BEG?

Oh, hey, Lois,
I just remembered that thing

I wanted to tell you before.

Um, you ever heard of
Adolf Hitler?

-Yes.
-Well, fun trivia.

Gonzo was Adolf Hitler's bird.

What?
Peter, if you knew that,

why the hell did you
bring that bird

to Meg's performance
of <i>Sound of Music?</i>

<i>Sie sind hinter</i>
<i>dem großen Stein.</i>

(squawks) <i>Nach links.</i>

He's saying they're behind
the big stone to the left!

(whistles) <i>Meine linke,</i>
<i>nicht Bühne linke! </i>(squawks)

He's saying,
"My left, not stage left"!

CARTER:
You're getting warmer.

What? The parrot started it.

It's not his fault, Lois.

He's just repeating
what he was taught.

By Hitler.

Yeah, that's like
40% of America right now.

Peter, if you don't
get rid of that bird,

I'm calling animal control.

You do that

-and I'll make you pay.
-How?

You ever hear of
revenge porn, Lois?

Peter, if you did that,

then everyone would see
your penis.

I retract my threat.

Please strike it
from the record.

I'll strike it if I can find it.

-You have any tweezers?
-No, I don't have any--

Oh, ha-ha-ha.

Look at us restoring
a classic car.

Yep, 2004 Saturn Ion.

This baby captures
all the glory of my youth.

<i>Shrek 2 </i>was
the number-one movie,

Dane Cook made Myspace
the place to be,

and LimeWire helped you bankrupt
your favorite bands.

What a year.

Sorry, I don't mean
to interrupt.

I just want to
throw out my laptop

since I won't be
writing anymore.

Oh come on, Brian,
don't be dramatic.

Dramatic? Me? Pshaw!

Just abandoning
my lifelong dream

since even my best friend
can't support me.

So you're getting rid of
all your photos, too?

No, I downloaded those to
an external hard drive.

How are you going

-to watch movies in bed?
-My phone.

Couldn't you also still write
in the notes app on your phone?

I deleted that app.

Okay, but couldn't you
still write

using pen and paper?

I mean, I'm sorry to keep
pushing back on this,

it just feels like
throwing away the laptop

is-is just unnecessary.

You got your wish, Stewie,
I quit.

You'll never have to worry
about keeping

one of my books again.

Come on, Brian, be reasonable.

That wasn't my intention.

Too bad. Goodbye, dream.

Okay, last objection, I swear.

But that's actually
supposed to go

in a separate collection
for e-waste,

which is the last Friday
of every month.

It's fine.

(beeping)

Laptop! Laptop! Laptop!

There he is, the genius

-getting his inspo.
-(video game blipping)

-What do you want?
-Look, here's the thing, Brian.

I actually did like your book.

Yeah, right.

-I did.
-Me, too.

Yeah, what'd you like about it?

You wrote about kibble
with a lot of passion.

Uh-huh.

You described a lot of trees,

and you also let us know
which ones were steadfast,

which was a surprisingly
high percentage of them.

-(game over sound)
-Ugh! It's pointless.

I've given writing
my whole life,

and I can't even get ten people
to come to a reading.

Hell, I've been playing
this game for 20 years,

and I can't even get
to level two.

Really? That game is,
like, very easy.

Just get out of here!
And leave me alone. Forever.

Chris, I can see his gums.
We'd better go.

This is terrible.
We have to help him.

I have a great idea.

-What is it?
-Oh, no, not for this.

Netflix... for guns.

Stewie, you're gonna be
a trillionaire.

Perhaps we can lift Brian
out of his funk

if we get his book on <i>The New</i>
<i>York Times </i>Best Seller list.

It would only take 1,500 copies.

-That's it?
-Yes. And a lot of celebrities

actually make the list
by buying their own books.

Wait, are you telling me that
some of Donald Trump Jr.'s

success isn't based
on merit alone?

Yes, I am saying that.

Still we can't afford to buy
that many copies.

(computer chimes)

But Reese Witherspoon's
manager just got back to me

about her book club.

Stewie, this could be huge.

Every alcoholic housewife
in this country

does whatever
Reese Witherspoon says.

"Unfortunately, Reese's only
interests are crawdads

"and long hikes,
so she's happily passing.

No regrets."

Now I'm glad her husband
Jim Toth failed at Quibi,

reportedly straining
their Hollywood super-marriage.

Oh, don't be nasty, Chris.

-Okay, plan C.
-What's that?

Use Lois's account to buy
three copies on Amazon.

That'll get Brian
in the top 20 of Amazon's

"Canine Nonfiction
Under 60 Pages" category.

Oh, great.
All you have to do is

click which of these
are crosswalks

to prove you're not a robot.

Well, uh... you do it.

Come on, Chris, you...

you're not actually
a robot, are you?

(robot voice):
Identity compromised.

Abort mission.

(robot voice):
Greetings, sibling.

I am Chris 2.0
with crosswalk update.

Oh, phew.
Okay, well, it's refreshed,

and now it needs you
to identify stop signs.

If you will excuse me.

So, what do you want to watch,
Nazi bird?

Fox. (squawks)

Quick, Gonzo, we gotta go.

Rabbi Goldstein, Peter Griffin.

I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

No, it's fine.

I'm just practicing circumcision

on a kosher hot dog.

How can I help you?

I bought this parrot used,
and it turns out

he's Adolf Hitler's old pet.

And what do you want from me?

Well, the word is out,

and a bunch of people
want to kill him.

And I was thinking maybe
if you said he's okay,

maybe they'd back off.

To seek vengeance or to forgive.

Such a dilemma.
Let us see what it says in...

(squawks) Torah.

Torah? What's that?

Our sacred scrolls.

Oh, I thought those was
rolls of Brawny.

<i>Bar'chu et Adonai hamvorach.</i>
(squawks)

My friend, your bird is Jewish.

He only pretended to be a Nazi
to survive the war.

Gonzo's Jewish?

Peter, you have done
a wonderful thing.

We must celebrate
with some matzah.

As we say, <i>L'Chaim!</i>

Whoa, look at you, Brian.
Back in the saddle?

Well, it's like
Ray Bradbury said:

"You only fail
if you stop writing."

That's a really healthy attitude
for someone who just failed.

Well, it turns out my book
actually did find an audience.

Right now, it's number nine
on Amazon's

"Mangy Mammal Memoirs" list.

LOIS: Who the hell used
my Amazon account

to order three copies
of Brian's book?!

(growling)

Oh, boy.

Great. So now after
having insulted me,

you've deceived me.

Thanks so much, pal.

Why do you even care?

You're the one who said you
don't need external validation.

Of course that was a lie.

All I care about
is external validation.

I'm a dog. "Good boy" is
literally the best thing

you can say to me.

And the fact that
even my best friend

doesn't want a free copy
of my book is-is devastating.

Don't you talk to me
about devastating.

-What do you mean?
-Don't you understand?

Brian, I only got rid
of the book

because I was jealous of you.

Jealous? Why?

Because you set out to
do something, and you did it.

Unlike me and my goals.

Every time I walked by
your book, it was a reminder

of all that I haven't
accomplished.

I know I'm supposed to be
happy for you,

but when you succeed,
all it does is

make me feel bad about myself.

And you made me feel really bad.

Then I guess I really succeeded.

You did. Big-time.

I'm proud of you, Brian.

-Good boy.
-Thanks, Stewie.

Now, please never do
anything again.

-Friends?
-Friends.

Still, it'd be nice
to sell a few books,

to have anyone know my name.

Meh. You ever heard of
Kirker Butler, Julius Sharpe,

Cherry Chevapravatdumrong,
Chris Regan, David Goodman,

Artie Johann, Patrick Meighan,

Mike Desilets or Gary Janetti?

They're all <i>Family Guy </i>writers
who've written books,

and no one's ever heard of them.

Gary Janetti kind of
rings a bell.

Yeah, he's got a popular
Instagram,

so he kind of broke through.

But the rest of them,
a bunch of bitter,

Emmy-less losers.

Has Seth MacFarlane ever
written a book?

-Oh, yeah.
-How'd it do?

A signed copy is cheaper
than a new one.

Thank you, everybody,
for coming today.

Chris would like to say

We got the house, guys!

Your iPad flashlight is on.

God, she's old.

What house, Mom?

The Airbnb in Nantucket

we wanted
for the Fourth of July.

There was a cancellation,
so I swooped right in

and scooped it up.
The Pelican strikes again.

-"The Pelican"?
-Yeah. Some people call me that

'cause I swoop and scoop.

-Who calls you that?
-Some people.

-Who?
-It's really catching on.

From who?

Look,
everybody just pack your bags

because we leave tomorrow.

I thought you said July 4th?
It's October.

Yeah, but we always
celebrate our holidays

off-peak to save money.

I don't know, this feels forced.

Oh, come on,
you kids are all getting older.

We are running out of time to do
stuff together as a family.

Plus this is our first Airbnb.

That's a huge mom milestone.

You know, I heard that every
time someone says "Airbnb,"

a white woman can hear it
from five miles away.

Mm, sounds like
the Pelican got her Airbnb.

Who?!

I've never been to Nantucket.

It's pretty nice.

Yeah, I like
that everyone arriving gets

Yeah. Yeah, that first!

We don't know

"But first, coffee"?

But that's the point.
It doesn't matter.

Did the owner say
what was stolen?

Maybe it was

you absolute ancient hag.

All right, Brian, if we're
going to go door-to-door

and sell all this,
we need a game plan.

So let's practice.

You and I walk up
to a client's house.

Walking, walking, walking.

We're walking, walking, walking.

Oh.

Up the steps
and we knock on the door.

Knock-knock. Nothing.

Nothing... then they answer.
Freeze!

Now what do we tell
the client we're selling?

-Taffy.
-Wrong.

The first thing
every salesman needs

to sell is himself.
Write it down.

I didn't bring a pen or paper.

All right,
after we sell ourselves,

what do we tell
the client we're selling?

-Taffy?
-Wrong!

Never tell the client
what you're selling.

The second you tell them
what we're selling,

-they'll know
what we're selling.
-Right.

-Wrong!
-Yeah, I might need
a pen and paper.

The second thing a salesman
needs to sell is an emotion.

All right, let's just skip
ahead. I'll be the client. Okay.

You've sold yourself... barely.

You've sold an emotion:
nostalgia.

-Now what are you selling?
-Taf...

Don't you dare come to my house
and tell me what you're selling.

Yeah, I'm having a hard time
tracking this.

Oh, you're having a hard time?

Do you see what I'm doing here?
Do you see my hand?

This gesture says that I'm in

a domestic abuse situation
and you're doing nothing.

You're just standing there

not even telling me
what you're selling.

-Taffy!
-Wrong!

So, Mom, did you ever find out

what was stolen from
that Nantucket house?

-I did. Funny story.
-Never is.

It was a bottle of shampoo
I must have packed in my bag.

Oh, no way.

You did it?
(laughs)

How does your fat foot taste,
Mom?

Apparently taking the rest
of a tiny bottle of shampoo

is considered stealing nowadays.

Answer the question
about the foot.

-How big was the bottle?
-Ah, it was small.

I thought you said
it was "tiny."

Would it pass
through airport security?

-That's the threshold.
-It was very little.

Oh, now it's "little."

You're all over the place.

May we see the bottle?

I would love
to show you the bottle.

Then you'll see
how ridiculous this is.

Okay, so this dinner's not one
of her best efforts, right?

-Big whiff.
-I agree.

Okay, let's pile that on, too.

-(bottle thuds)
-Yo!

That's borderline huge, Mom.

The size is misleading.

There was barely
any liquid left in it.

It was sputtering to a finish.

It made an audible thud
when you put it down.

I hated tonight's chicken.

I am not wrong here, okay?

We paid a lot of money
for that house,

and taking the ass-end
of a shampoo bottle

barely makes a dent
into their haul.

There, definitive proof that
your mother always describes

big things as being smaller
than they are.

Did you hear that, Chris?

We've all seen it, Dad.

Aw.

Good afternoon, Mr. Quagmire.

Oh, salesmen. Look,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

You see this coin purse?
It contains $87,

which is
what I allow myself to spend

on superfluous purchases
every week.

It is currently open.

Just like my ears.

If you wow me with your pitch,
the money is yours.

If it closes,
you have lost the sale.

Now let's hear it.

So...

As you can see,
we have all the classic flavors.

little jokes in 'em.

you're doing all that chewing.

Who doesn't love laughing?

That's why our taffy comes
with jokes, too.

-It does?
-This is Brian's
personal phone number.

Every time you eat a taffy,

call that number
and he'll tell you a joke.

Joke, please.

Oh, okay, um, uh...

I heard the bottle wasn't
that small.

What? Where did you hear that?

Joe and I have
eerily quiet dinners.

We can hear all
your family's conversation.

Mm-hmm, okay.

You know, I'm gonna get

Oh, let me get that for you.

They're my grandmother's knives,

so I'm gonna need you
to sign out which one you use.

Okay, that's enough.

I see what's happening here.

You think I'm a thief.

I can't believe
you're not on my side.

I heard the bottle had a pump.

A pump? Who else are you
talking to about this?

I'm on a couple of text chains

we did take it by mistake.

I-I feel terrible,

to you personally.

It was important
I did this in person.

Well, thank you again.

you could change your review.

Oh. I'm sorry, no.

I can't do that.

This is terrible, Brian.

We've barely sold any boxes.

Nobody likes taffy.

it's just subpar gum.

What are we gonna do? We sunk

Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm about to go on IG Live.

Like I said, "IG Live."

All right, Meg's
going for her phone. She...

Uhp, no, she's just scratching herself.

Well, uh, anyway,
if-if you guys are gonna join,

just go into another room,
or I'll get interference.

Other than that, uh...

I don't know, just buckle up
and enjoy the ride.

Oh, and I tagged Kurt Vonnegut's nephew,

so just... just be cool on there.

Boy, he's sure living
a lot longer than we expected.

Going live in three, two, one.

(howls) What's up, IG Live?!

It's Brian Griffin,
and you are live in the "Dog House."

Okay, no viewers yet. I'll do it again.

Hopefully I can keep that energy.

Uhp, got my first viewer.

Whoa! Getting a little crowded in here.

And @BuyCryptoKid33 has left the building.

All right, welcome @WinACarAskMeHow.

And we got
@LearnGuitarIn7Days on the line.

Let's get started.

What I'm sure is on both your minds is:

what is the "hero's journey"?

Well, that's a question
pondered by writers for many, many--

welcome, @Gain4InchesIn1Week-- many years.

Let me recap what we've learned so far.

Writer, "hero's journey,"
many, many, many years.

On the page that seemed
like eight minutes of material.

Should we bail him out with a question?

No, we're not gonna
bail him out with a question.

We're gonna... You know what?

I will ask him a question.
Give me your phone.

Hey, guys, I brought in your paper.

Why do you get the newspaper
if you're not gonna read it?

Eh, sometimes I use it
to punctuate my sentences.

Well, anyway, I have a
proposal for the two of you.

Well, this ought to be interesting.

Are the two of you free tonight
for a double date?

I'm seeing this girl,
and I think she's something special.

I want you to meet her.

Oh, Glenn, that's wonderful.

A-And you're sure she's
not a sex worker this time?

No, I-I'm pretty sure.

I've offered her money many times,
and she hasn't taken it.

A double date sounds great.
We'd love to go.

(singsongy):
Ooh, the Quag's got a girlfriend.

Ah! Get off me!
We don't have that kind of relationship.

Shoo! Go on, Meg!
Get away from the houseguest!

Get away from the houseguest!

"Hello, Brian.

"As a famous writer, you are now eligible

to become a verified account."

Yes! Finally!

Well, maybe next you can
get a verified paycheck.

Why is your paper called <i>Brazilian Teens?</i>

Well, what's your paper of record
for tan butts?

Exactly.

I can't wait to meet this
new girlfriend of Quagmire's.

You know, I always write their names down

in case his life becomes a <i>Dateline.</i>

(gasps) Oh, my God. It's her!

-What? It's who?
-Quagmire's girlfriend is

my old junior high school bully,
Stephanie.

She made my life a living hell.

Oh, see, that guy's wearing sandals.

I could've worn mine.

Peter, you don't know this

because you met me in high school,

but middle school was
a painfully awkward phase for me.

(lively chatter)

<i>I had horrible acne,</i>
<i>I had to wear a back brace,</i>

Hey, Lois, watch your step.

Stephanie never even apologized,
and junior high trauma

is something you don't recover from.

Yeah, my gym teacher
drove me home without his pants on,

but your story sounds bad, too.

Well, looks like all that
hard work is finally paying off.

I got verified on Instagram.

Look at that, a blue check.

Blue check? That's green.

Brian, you got hacked.

That's ridiculous.

Someone DM'd me and said

they just needed my mother's maiden name,

the last four numbers of my credit card,

and the first 12 numbers
of my credit card.

Then they responded right away with,

"Thank you, comploted."

Huh.

That's not how you spell "completed."

-(phone rings)
-It's my credit card company.

Hello?

No, that wasn't me.

No. No. Ma'am, I wouldn't know what to do

with that many Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts.

-Yuck.
-(phone beeps)

Okay, you were right. I got hacked.

I'm so mad, that hacker
has me seeing gray.

Red. It's red, Brian.

Why are you so upset?

You already canceled your credit card.

This hacker is destroying my Instagram.

I have a brand.

Posting Steve Harvey stand-up jokes

is actually Steve Harvey's brand.

I think you should just
give your account to the hacker.

I mean, your Instagram
wasn't setting the world on fire.

And I suppose
the hacker's posts are better?

Look at this,
it's just a half a bottle of vodka

that says, <i>"Eto vodka-chas gde-to."</i>

Brian, what does that even mean?

Hit "See translation."

"It's vodka o'clock somewhere."

(laughing): Oh, that's very funny.
That's very funny.

You know, I've heard it's "wine o'clock,"

but I've never heard it with vodka.

That's what...
That's-that's whip-smart is what that is.

No! No, it's not.

Stewie, I need to get my account back.

I-I may have sent
some weird DMs to Zendaya

that I'd rather not see the light of day.

<i>Euphoria</i> Zendaya or Disney Zendaya?

Yeah, a little from column A,
little from column B.

We need to get that account back.

Lois Pewterschmidt, what a small world.

Nice to see you, too.

You have aged infuriatingly well.

So, how did you two meet?

Did you both escape
from the same sex cult?

Sex cults sound terrible,

but also, how do I get invited to one?

-You tell it.
-No, you tell it.

No, you just tell it.

-No, you. Fine, I'll go.
-No, you, you go.

(both laughing)

Okay, Tinder.

Huh, didn't really need that whole parade.

And how did you two meet?

Lois was dating another guy
and I threatened to kill myself.

Lois, remember you had that back brace

everyone said made you look like
an ironing board in a sweater?

(giggles) Say more stuff.

You were a nerd?
I thought you said you were a prom queen.

<i>Prawn</i> Queen.

She ate a lot of shellfish

and her back was curved liked a shrimp.

(giggles) I've never meant this before,

but we should do this again.

Kids were so mean back then.

Well, I barely remember those years.

Peter and I have three lovely kids.

They're a lot happier
since you're allowed to be fat now.

Being a mom
is the most fulfilling job in the world.

Oh, do you have kids?

Be careful how you answer this.

Oh, I wish I did,
but after medical school,

then a four-year residency,
a two-year specialty,

three years in Central America
with Doctors Without Borders...

Okay. Well, I'm sure
all those achievements

will come visit you
when you're on your deathbed.

Excuse me, some of the other diners
have complained

that you're not talking loudly enough.

They're loving these stories
about how she was a nerd.

It was "prawn queen"! Like the shrimp!

MAN: Oh, that's even funnier.

(chuckles) You know what?

I feel sorry for Stephanie now.

Really? What part?
The good skin or the great job?

Oh, pfft. "Great job."

Anyone can be a doctor in Ecuador.

You think they're checking diplomas?

And she doesn't have any kids.

Probably can't. You know why? GMOs.

Just gonna run this light real quick.

-(engine revs)
-(horn honks)

Settle down.

I mean, I ate way better
than she was eating.

Did you see I ordered a salad?

It was a wedge that was
mostly bleu cheese and bacon.

It was listed under "salad."

But did you notice
Stephanie ordered french fries?

French fries, no kids, you do the math.

Anyway, point is, I won dinner.

-(horn honks)
-Settle down.

I mean, you-you think
I won dinner, right, Peter?

Well, you did eat a lot faster than her.

And-and now that I think about it,

after she said I looked good,
she looked right at my hands.

What does that mean?
Age comes out in the hands, Peter.

Maybe she's trying
to figure out how old I am.

Well, but she knows how old I am.

(gasps) I bet she was
judging my tiny wedding ring.

Why was she looking at my hands, Peter?

I think your thumb was in the butter.

But did she see that?

I don't know,
but nobody ate butter after that,

so, yeah, probably.

I love that she had to
ask what caprese was.

What a dumb bitch.

What-What's going on with your face?

(weak chuckle)
I don't know what you're talking about.

Maybe-maybe it's a giant grin, huh?

From having triumphed
over my former bully.

There's a rash forming
on the back of your legs.

What? There is?

-(back cracks)
-Ah! Son of a bitch!

Lois, what the hell's going on with you?

I don't know.

I think seeing Stephanie brought back

one of my old
junior high school panic attacks.

(gasping)
Quick, I have to do the only thing

that would calm me back then:

lie in a dark room
and try to blast Sarah McLachlan

but accidentally play the wrong song.

-So, Instagram update...
-We're talking!

The hacker contacted me.

He's demanding $10,000.

I hear you're looking to kill somebody.

What? No. I'm just trying to find a guy

who hacked my Instagram account.

I can also help with that.

I'm really good at finding cyberbullies.

One time, I got an
anonymous tweet telling me

to go kill myself and I
tracked the IP address to

-Chrissy Teigen.
-Chrissy Teigen?

Yeah, that's... It's kind of her thing.

-I don't know how you're gonna find...
-That's in Russia.

You can take the girl out of Novosibirsk,

but you can't take the
Novosibirsk out of the girl.

How do you know how to speak Russian?

If you watch enough
super dark videos on the Internet,

eventually you're gonna learn Russian.

First, just the Russian
words for "please don't kill me,"

but it's amazing how
those are really the building blocks

of an entire language.

-German's very similar.
-And then I was able to make

some friends in a Russian AOL chatroom.

You got a whole little life going on, huh?

Can you figure out
what city this hacker lives in?

Okay, I'm thinking the big boys in Moscow

are phishing in Europe.

Russia has 11 time
zones, so if we triangulate

the activity through peak hours...

Yup. Just what I thought.

-Chelyabinsk.
-That was fast.

You got to move fast in this world, bro.

So, are we gonna go find this guy or what?

All right, looks like
we're going to Russia.

Russia? We can't go there.
They're at war with Ukraine.

-They are? Whoa, crazy.
-I say we do it.

We're really gonna go to a country at war

and we couldn't go to my
business meeting on Fire Island?

-What business meeting?
-I sell bikini swimsuits
for "men of size."

-You mean fat guys?
-No.

(laughs): No, no, no, no, no, no.

Are you here for business or displeasure?

We're here to find the hacker that...

Stole your Instagram, yes.

Enjoy ten-square kilometer of country

that don't make Geiger counter
go "beep, beep, beep."

-Hey!

It's that way.

I want to be picked up now, Mom.

Fine, I'll see you at 4:00.

-What do you want?
-Dr. Hartman,

I have no idea what's going on.

I feel like I'm turning
back into my old teenage self,

and there's nothing I can do about it.

I see. Did you recently
run into an old bully

or were you tagged in a very unflattering

Throwback Thursday photo?

I did. I ran into a girl
who terrorized me in junior high

and she used to call me Scoli-Lois.

(laughs)
Like "scoliosis." That's very good.

I just learned what that is today,
as a matter of fact.

Dr. Hartman, what's happening to me?

Well, Mrs. Griffin,
I think you're suffering

from severe nerd damage.

I am? What's that?

You see, all nerds
are one tossed-off joke away

from reverting to their worst,
most humiliating selves.

But I don't want to be a nerd forever.

Tell you what,
find the coolest guy in school

and give him a tug behind the bleachers.

That usually solves it.

Does that really work?

I don't know.

Why don't we go find out.

between me and Stephanie,

so I can finally put all that
middle school baggage behind me.

And maybe I can start putting

some of my other baggage behind me.

Peter, we need to talk.

I think this relationship has...

If you leave me I will kill myself.

(sighs)

I love us.

Hi, honey, how was school today?

Well, the metal detectors
were down, so the popular kids

were all on edge all day,
so that was kind of fun.

Oh, and we also got
our yearbooks.

Ooh, let me see.

I love seeing what my handsome
boy's been up to all year.

Oh, there's the student council,
and the cheerleaders.

Peter, w-why is there
a photo of you in here?

I'm in the Peter club.

It's just me and this guy Jason
who joined as a joke.

Jason's, like, hilarious.

Wait a minute. Chris,
there's no pictures of you.

Huh, I guess not.

Chris, honey,
I keep telling you,

you need to get involved
in extracurricular activities.

Otherwise you won't
get into college,

and you'll end up a garbageman

or a congresswoman
from Colorado.

Okay, okay, fine.
I'll look for a club tomorrow.

Your mom's right, Chris.
You got to get into college.

Mostly so you can constantly

jam into conversation
where you went.

Have you been to that new
restaurant, Kristof's, downtown?

-It's amazing.
-No, but that reminds me

of when I was at school
in Cambridge.

Oh, you went to Harvard?

No, the Cambridge Technical
College for Dullards and Mutes.

Not to brag, but there are
commercials for it on TV.

Because it's embarrassing
to see you in jeans at church.

That's why.

Yeah, I'm sure it <i>was</i> fine
back home in Tampa.

Now hold still.

Hey, Brian, could you drive me
to Joann Fabrics?

I'm gonna put in some elastic
'cause I've learned my lesson.

Sure, just got to stop
at the bank.

Still getting my accounts
sorted out

after that Russian hacker thing.

Ah, yes, that Ivan fellow.

I can't believe Meg
stayed behind to be with him.

Well, they seemed
pretty happy together.

Still, it's got to be hard
leaving your whole life behind

and adapting
to a foreign culture.

I wonder how she's doing.

All right, I got to get Mom
off my back.

There's got to be
an extracurricular

for me somewhere.

-Hey, can I join your club?
-That depends.

Can you uplift
your fellow students

through the eloquent art
of public speaking?

I'll give it my best shot.

(bleep), (bleep) for sure,
and (bleep) most of all, Kelvin.

Uh, I'm not too good at sports.

You sure I can be
on the lacrosse team?

Absolutely, Chris.

We think you'd make
a great defendant.

-You mean defender?
-No.

-We're full.
-Wait, your name's not Peter.

That's Jason.
He's, like, hilarious.

So I don't have to be
a Peter to join?

We're full.

How was day working
at bot farm, my love?

It was great.

I convinced a Facebook
mommy group

that diapers cause autism.

Ooh, then we had
a big catered lunch. See?

Ah, my darling has appetite
of Siberian walrus.

And is just as fragrant.

(slobbering)

You rest, <i>milaya.</i>
I'll go make tea.

Man, I miss American food.

"Beets are fine,
but every once in a while,

"I sure could go
for a good old-fashioned

American cheeseburger."

(phone whooshes)

<i>Bozhe moi,</i> what happen?

(tires screech)

AGENT:
President Putin
will not tolerate

(distant):
even the mildest of criticism.

You need to drive slower, man.

I don't think he heard
the end of my threat.

Uh, well, maybe your threat
should be more succinct.

Well, maybe you should call
our boss "papa" again.

It was mistake. One time.

One time I do this.

LOIS:
Chris? Did you find
an after-school activity yet?

Working on it, Mom.

"In conclusion, municipal
zoning laws have ultimately hurt

the very people
they're intended to help."

And send.

Gosh, who knew there was
so much civil discourse

in the Pornhub comments section?

All right, back to business.

Hmm. This one's just called
"Sex in a School."

(porn music playing)

Whoa, that's crazy.

This set looks
just like my homeroom.

Huh, the porn school
has a Chris Griffin, too?

It's so immersive.

Wait a minute.

Is this my school?

<i>SHEPHERD (over video):</i>
<i>Attention, naughty students.</i>

<i>Ass is now in session.</i>

Oh, my God, Principal Shepherd's
making porn at school.

Hey, I'm gonna shut
this door real quick.

Rupert's pants came back
and he doesn't fit into them,

so, so we're having a thing.

Oh, you know what, guys?

I think some of these letters
are, like, numbers.

(sighs)
We got to start over.

Chris, can you erase
the boards for me?

-Kiss my shorts.
-(all gasp)

Chris, I hear you've been
acting up in class

and carelessly misquoting
<i>The Simpsons.</i>

Yeah, well,
don't have a moo, man.

(gasps)
The slacker's position.

Young man, in this school,
furniture has rules.

Well, guess what? I'm gonna do
whatever I want around here,

and there's nothing
you can do about it.

Oh, really? And why is that?

'Cause I know you've been
making porn in the school.

I... You can't prove that.

I heard your voice
on one of the videos.

(sighs)
All right, you caught me.

You see, Chris, we educators
don't make a lot of money.

So, once I saw I had
the classrooms at my disposal,

plus all the school
A/V equipment,

I realized I was only
a box of wet naps away

from becoming a pornographer,
so I gave it a shot.

<i>Hamilton</i> tells me you're not
supposed to throw those away.

Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm not making any money.

My videos hardly get any views.

I think it's time for me
to throw in the sticky towel.

Wow, that's a pretty sad story,
Principal Shepherd.

But you want to know
the saddest part of all?

Your porn sucks, bro.

What? What are you
talking about?

Well, let's start
with the titles.

Who calls their porno "Man
and Woman Having Standard Sex"?

You got to work
the algorithm, man.

You need keywords
like "stepsister,"

"stepbrother," "stepmom."

Just put "step" and a noun
and it should work.

Even "stepladder"
is getting traction these days.

You know, if you want
to make this thing work

and start making money,
I can help you out.

You want to help me?

Actually, I think
we can help each other.

You need help with this thing,

I need an after-school activity
so my mom gets off my back,

and I think I just found it.

I'm the newest member
of the porn club.

-All right, deal.
-Awesome.

I feel like I've finally found
my calling, like Steve Martin.

I've got it.

I'll do five years
of entertainment,

then 40 years of banjo.

-(phone ringing)
-Hello?

No, I don't want
ten million dollars for a movie.

Call back when you've got
14 banjo fans

in your city's worst theater.

(playing upbeat melody)

WOMAN:
Honey?

Could you shut the door?

Honey, shut the door.

(groans)
Ivan.

W-What happened?

Everyone here
was silenced by state

for careless social media post.

You mean that thing I said
about beets for lu...

(shushes)
Quiet.

Government is very strict

about criticism
of Russian way of life.

Is true. You see, President
Putin can be very sensitive...

Meg, I am so happy you okay.

I stayed by your side all night.

Oh, thank you
for being so good to me.

God, this hospital bill
is gonna be a fortune.

What? Is free.

Even in Russia,

health care is basic human right

Lunch lady porn?

Is this really something
people want to see?

Oh, yeah, it has
a very dedicated fan base.

Plus, the actors don't even
have to be attractive.

(chuckles):
You ever see a hot lunch lady?

No. It ruins the fantasy.

Cut. Get that cigarette
out of the shot.

Kids are gonna watch this.

I got to hand it to you, Chris,

our videos have been
quite a success.

I haven't felt this kind
of financial security

since I found 20 bucks in one
of the lost-and-found jackets.

In fact, I took the liberty
of buying us

a little something to celebrate.

Come on.

-Wow, is that...
-That's right.

The 1992 Toyota Cressida.

The ultimate
principal dream car.

Shallot purple
with a beige interior.

-And there's one for each of us.
-Gosh, really?

No one's ever given me
anything this nice before.

Well, you earned it.

Turns out, you just needed

to find something
you could excel at.

Thanks, Principal Shepherd.

Say, how about we drive
these babies down to Chipotle

and order guac like big shots?

I saw Elon Musk do that once.

Was it after
his hair transplant?

After one of his two
separate hair transplants, yes.

Aw. It was so sweet of you
to plan this picnic, Ivan.

But why are we in a cemetery?

Meg, I brings you here because
cemetery is very special place.

It is here where you can
finally meet my parents.

Your parents are dead?

Oh, Ivan, I'm so sorry.

It's okay. They died peacefully
being ripped apart by dogs.

Meg, when you were in hospital,
I was so afraid to lose you.

And in that moment, I realized
I never want us to be apart.

-Meg, will you marry me?
-(gasps)

I do not have much to give,

but I do have
mother's engagement ring.

What do you say, Meg?

Will you make me happiest man
in all of Russia?

Which is admittedly
a very low bar?

Oh, Ivan. Yes, yes, yes.

Then come with me
and let's take brown clothes,

not-smiling engagement photo.

-(camera shutter clicks)
-I cannot wait

to etch this picture of you
into hideous black gravestone.

Which background you want?
Frozen tundra or leaky reactor?

-Oh, oh, reactor, please.
-Reactor, please.

Don't know why I offer tundra.
Nobody choose.

Hey, where are you going?

Dinner's gonna be ready
any minute.

Oh, I-I have to get to school.

I have to meet up with
the, uh, uh, debate club.

At 8:00 p.m.?

Yeah, there was
a whole debate about it.

Well I am so glad you finally
found an extracurricular.

This is gonna look great
on your college résumé.

And maybe you'll make
some new friends.

I am so proud of you.

-No, you're not.
-What? Of course I am.

Ah, gotcha. You got debated.

Oh, so advanced already.

(laughs):
Okay, have fun.

A-Are you guys making a movie?

Um...

LOIS:
Crocs and Arby's?

Oh, my God. You're making porn.

<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Arby's. We don't judge.</i>

<i>We just hand out shaved meats.</i>

I don't believe this.

Chris, you lied to me.
And for something so disgusting.

Mom, I-I can explain.

Oh, and on school grounds,
no less.

Just you wait until Principal
Shepherd hears about this.

Well, CVS didn't
have any towels,

so follow me to the science lab

and I'll show you where
the eye-wash stations are.

-Mrs. Griffin?
-Principal Shepherd,

are you in on this, too?

Certainly not. I have no idea
what's going on here.

Principal Shepherd,
Starla is officially a no-show,

so the nine-some
is now an eight-some.

All right, put her per diem
back in petty cash,

tell Sue Ann in makeup
it's her lucky day,

tell lighting
it's legs up in five,

and let's shoot this thing.

I mean, what?

We begin with a reading
from the Russian Orthodox Bible.

And Jesus said to Mikhail,

"The radio you sold me last week
does not work."

Mikhail said to Him,
"How do I know

you didn't break it on purpose
to get your money back?"

Then they got in a fistfight
on the bus.

-Amen.
-BOTH: Amen.

I now pronounce Ukraine
actually part of Russia,

and I also pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may share a joyless kiss.

(audience shouting)

This is an outrage.

Porn doesn't belong in school,
it belongs on public trains.

I guess if I don't bring
brownies, nobody does.

Please, everyone,
not all at once.

Is there an Alpha Karen
who can speak for all of you?

First of all, I want you to know
I'm filming this.

Second of all, I'm gonna
get really angry really fast

for no reason.

Listen, folks, I-I can explain.

What is there to explain?

That you've been using
our children's school

to make pornography?

That-that you took advantage
of my son?

(overlapping chatter)

This is getting away from me.

Maybe I can filibuster this

by reading the owner's manual
for my Toyota Cressida.

"Dear consumer,
making cars is really hard.

There are so many parts,
you guys."

(indistinct shouting)

Wait. Everybody, wait a minute.

That's the boy who was
talking to an owl outside.

Let him speak.

Look, Principal Shepherd may
have made some bad decisions,

but he didn't do it for himself.

It was all to raise money
for the school.

Oh, is-is that true,
Principal Shepherd?

Um...

-Well, I-I...
-Of course it's true.

Every year they slash
the school budget,

and this man did
what he had to do

to give us the education
we deserve.

You know the reading specialist
we have?

Paid for by a "Das Boot."

What's a "Das Boot"?

That's when a whole bunch
of German men

go down at the same time.

He's right, everyone.

With all those budget cuts,
I had no choice.

It was either make porn,
or pass a modest tax increase

on the wealthiest citizens
of Quahog.

A tax hike that'll affect
none of us?

That's the last thing we want.

-Meeting adjourned.
-(indistinct chatter)

Chris, that was some
quick thinking back there.

You saved my career. Thank you.

Hold it right there,
Principal Shepherd.

Now, I appreciate that you were
trying to help out the school,

but how could you get my son
involved in something like this?

-You've corrupted him.
-"Corrupted"?

This was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

See, before we started
making porn,

I didn't care about anything

because I wasn't good
at anything.

But now, I'm using skills
I never knew I had.

I'm writing scripts, making
schedules and balancing budgets.

And it's all thanks
to Principal Shepherd.
