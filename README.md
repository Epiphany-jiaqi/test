Fluid intelligence is the type of intelligence that has to do with short-term memory and the ability to think quickly, logically, and abstractly in order to solve new problems. It    1     in young adulthood, levels out for a period of time, and then     2     starts to slowly decline as we age. But     3      aging is inevitable, scientists are finding that certain changes in brain function may not be.
One study found that muscle loss and the  4   of body fat around the abdomen are associated with a decline in fluid intelligence. This suggests the    5     that lifestyle factors might help prevent or 6 this type of decline.
The researchers looked at data that 	7	measurements of lean muscle and abdominal

fat from more than 4,000 middle-to-older-aged men and women and     8      that data to reported changes in fluid intelligence over a six-year period. They found that middle-aged people
9     higher measures of abdominal fat     10      worse on measures of fluid intelligence as the  years 11 .
For women, the association may be    12    to changes in immunity that resulted from     excess abdominal fat; in men, the immune system did not appear to be  13   . It is hoped that  future studies could      14       these differences and perhaps lead to different       15       for men and women.
      16   , there are steps you can    17    to help reduce abdominal fat and maintain lean muscle mass as you age in order to protect both your physical and mental    18    . The two    highly recommended lifestyle approaches are maintaining or increasing your     19      of      aerobic  exercise  and  following  a  Mediterranean-style  20   that  is  high  in  fiber  and eliminates highly processed foods.

How can the train operators possibly justify yet another increase to rail passenger fares? It  has become a grimly reliable annual ritual: every January the cost of travelling by train rises, imposing a significant extra burden on those who have no option but to use the rail network to get to work or otherwise. This year’s rise, an average of 2.7 percent, may be a fraction lower than last year’s, but it is still well above the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation.
Successive governments have permitted such increases on the grounds that the cost of investing in and running the rail network should be borne by those who use it, rather than the general taxpayer. Why, the argument goes, should a car-driving pensioner from Lincolnshire have to subsidise the daily commute of a stockbroker from Surrey? Equally, there is a sense that the travails of commuters in the South East, many of whom will face among the biggest rises, have received too much attention compared to those who must endure the relatively poor infrastructure of the Midlands and the North.
However, over the past 12 months, those commuters have also experienced some of  the worst rail strikes in years. It is all very well train operators trumpeting the improvements they are making to the network, but passengers should be able to expect a basic level of service for the substantial sums they are now paying to travel. The responsibility for the latest wave of strikes rests on the unions. However, there is a strong case that those who have been worst affected by industrial action should receive compensation for the disruption they have suffered.
The Government has pledged to change the law to introduce a minimum service requirement so that, even when strikes occur, services can continue to operate. This should form part of a  wider package of measures to address the long-running problems on Britain’s railways. Yes, more investment is needed, but passengers will not be willing to pay more indefinitely if they must also endure cramped, unreliable services, punctuated by regular chaos when timetables are changed, or planned maintenance is managed incompetently. The threat of nationalisation may have been seen off for now, but it will return with a vengeance if the justified anger of passengers is not addressed in short order.


21.	The author holds that this year’s increase in rail passengers fares 	.

[A]	will ease train operation’s burden
 
[B]	has kept pace with inflation

[C]	is a big surprise to commuters

[D]	remains an unreasonable measure



22.	The stockbroker in Para. 2 is used to stand for 	.

[A]	car drivers

[B]	rail traverllers

[C]	local investors

[D]	ordinary tax payers



23.	It is indicated in Para. 3 that train operators 	.

[A]	are offering compensations to commuters

[B]	are trying to repair ralations with the unions

[C]	have failed to provide an adequate source

[D]	have suffered huge losses owing to the strikes

[A]	the loss of investment

[B]	the collapse of operations

[C]	a reduction of revenue

Last year marked the third year in a row of when Indonesia’s bleak rate of deforestation has slowed in pace. One reason for the turnaround may be the country’s antipoverty program.
In 2007, Indonesia started phasing in a program that gives money to its poorest residents under certain conditions, such as requiring people to keep kids in school or get regular medical care. Called conditional cash transfers or CCTs, these social assistance programs are designed to reduce inequality and break the cycle of poverty. They’re already used in dozens of countries worldwide. In Indonesia, the program has provided enough food and medicine to substantially reduce severe growth problems among children.
But CCT programs don’t generally consider effects on the environment. In fact, poverty alleviation and environmental protection are often viewed as conflicting goals, says Paul Ferraro, an economist at Johns Hopkins University.
That’s because economic growth can be correlated with environmental degradation, while protecting the environment is sometimes correlated with greater poverty. However, those correlations don’t prove cause and effect. The only previous study analyzing causality, based on  an area in Mexico that had instituted CCTs, supported the traditional view. There, as people got more money, some of them may have more cleared land for cattle to raise for meat, Ferraro says.
Such programs do not have to negatively affect the environment, though. Ferraro wanted to see if Indonesia’s poverty-alleviation program was affecting deforestation. Indonesia has the third-largest area of tropical forest in the world and one of the highest deforestation rates.
Ferraro analyzed satellite data showing annual forest loss from 2008 to 2012—including during Indonesia’s phase-in of the antipoverty program—in 7,468 forested villages across 15 provinces and multiple islands. The duo separated the effects of the CCT program on forest loss from other factors, like weather and macroeconomic changes, which were  also  affecting forest loss. With that, “we see that the program is associated with a 30 percent reduction in deforestation,” Ferraro says.
That’s likely because the rural poor are using the money as makeshift insurance policies against inclement weather, Ferraro says. Typically, if rains are delayed, people may clear land to plant more rice to supplement their harvests. With the CCTs, individuals instead can use the money to supplement their harvests.
 
Whether this research translates elsewhere is anybody’s guess. Ferraro suggests the importance of growing rice and market access. And regardless of transferability, the study shows that what’s good for people may also be good for the value of the avoided deforestation just for carbon dioxide emissions alone is more than the program costs.”


26.	According to the first two paragraphs, CCT programs aim to 	.

[A]	facilitate health care reform

[B]	help poor families get better off

[C]	improve local education systems

[D]	lower deforestation rates



27.	The study based on an area in Mexico is cited to show that 	.

[A]	cattle rearing has been a major means of livelihood for the poor

[B]	CCT programs have helped preserve traditional lifestyles

[C]	antipoverty efforts require the participation of local farmers

[D]	economic growth tends to cause environmental degradation



28.	In his study about Indonesia, Ferraro intends to find out 	.

[A]	its acceptance level of CCTs

[B]	its annual rate of poverty alleviation

[C]	the relation of CCTs to its forest loss

[D]	the role of its forests in climate change



29.	According to Ferraro, the CCT program in Indonesia is most valuable in that 	.

[A]	it will benefit other Asian countries

[B]	it will reduce regional inequality

As a historian, who’s always searching for the text or the image that makes us re-evaluate the past. I’ve become preoccupied with looking for photographs that show our Victorian ancestors smiling (what better way to shatter the image of 19th-century prudery?). I’ve found quite a few, and—since I started posting them on Twitter—they have been causing quite a stir. People have been surprised to see evidence that Victorians had fun and could, and did, laugh. They are noting that the Victorians suddenly seem to become more human as the hundred-or-so years that separate us fade away through our common experience of laughter.
Of course, I need to concede that my collection of “Smiling Victorians” makes up only a tiny percentage of the vast catalogue of photographic portraiture created between 1840 and 1900, the majority of which show sitters posing miserably and stiffly in front of painted backdrops, or staring absently into the middle distance. How do we explain this trend?
During the 1840s and 1850s, in the early days of photography, exposure times were notoriously long: the daguerreotype photographic method (producing an image on a silvered copper plate) could take several minutes to complete, resulting in blurred images as sitters shifted position or adjusted their limbs. The thought of holding a fixed grin as the camera performed its magical duties was too much to contemplate, and so a non-committal blank stare became the  norm.
 

But exposure times were much quicker by the 1880s, and the introduction of the Box Brownie and other portable cameras meant that, though slow by today’s digital standards, the exposure was almost instantaneous. Spontaneous smiles were relatively easy to capture by the 1890s, so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of why Victorians still hesitated to smile.
One explanation might be the loss of dignity displayed through a cheesy grin. “Nature gave us lips to conceal our teeth,” ran one popular Victorian maxim, alluding to the fact that before the birth of proper dentistry, mouths were often in a shocking state of hygiene. A flashing set of healthy and clean, regular “pearly whites” was a rare sight in Victorian society, the preserve of the super-rich (and even then, dental hygiene was not guaranteed).
A toothy grin (especially when there were gaps or blackened gnashers) lacked class: drunks, tramps, prostitutes and buffoonish music hall performers might gurn and grin with a smile as wide as Lewis Carroll’s gum-exposing Cheshire Cat, but it was not a becoming look for properly bred persons. Even Mark Twain, a man who enjoyed a hearty laugh, said that when it came to photographic portraits there could be “nothing more damning than a silly, foolish smile fixed forever”.


31.	According to Paragraph 1, the author’s posts on Twitter 	.

[A]	illustrated the development of Victorian photography

[B]	highlighted social media’s role in Victorian studies

[C]	re-evaluated the Victorian’s notion of public image

[D]	changed people’s impression of the Victorians
 

32.	What does the author say about the Victorian portraits he has collected?

[A]	They are rare among photographs of that age.

[B]	They show effects of different exposure times.

[C]	They mirror 19th-century social conventions.

[D]	They are in popular use among historians.




33.	What might have kept the Victorians from smiling for pictures in the 1890s?

[A]	Their inherent social sensitiveness.

[B]	Their tension before the camera.

[C]	Their distrust of new inventions.

[D]	Their unhealthy dental condition.




34.	Mark Twain is quoted to show that the disapproval of smiles in pictures was 	.

[A]	a deep-root belief

[B]	a misguided attitude

[C]	a controversial view

[D]	a thought-provoking idea




35.	Which of the following questions does the text answer?

[A]	Why did most Victorians look stern in photographs?

[B]	Why did the Victorians start to view photographs?

[C]	What made photography develop slowly in the Victorian period?
 

[D]	How did smiling in photographs become a post-Victorian norm?

From the early days of broadband, advocates for consumers and web-based companies worried that the cable and phone companies selling broadband connections had the power and incentive to favor their own or their partners’ websites and services over those of their rivals. That’s why there has been such a strong demand for rules that would prevent broadband providers from picking winners and losers online, preserving the freedom and innovation that have been the lifeblood of the internet.
Yet that demand has been almost impossible to fill — in part because of pushback from broadband providers, anti-regulatory conservatives and the courts. A federal appeals court  weighed in again Tuesday, but instead of providing a badly needed resolution, it only prolonged the fight. At issue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was the latest take of the Federal Communications Commission on net neutrality, adopted on a party-line vote in 2017. The Republican-penned order not only eliminated the strict net neutrality rules the FCC had adopted when it had a Democratic majority in 2015, but rejected the commission’s authority to require broadband providers to do much of anything. The order also declared that  state and local governments couldn’t regulate broadband providers either.
The commission argued that other agencies would protect against anti-competitive behavior, such as a broadband-providing conglomerate like AT&T favoring its own video-streaming service at the expense of Netflix and Apple TV. Yet the FCC also ended the investigations of broadband providers that imposed data caps on their rivals’ streaming services but not their own.
On Tuesday, the appeals court unanimously upheld the 2017 order deregulating broadband providers, citing a Supreme Court ruling from 2005 that upheld a similarly deregulatory move.  But Judge Patricia Millett rightly argued in a concurring opinion that "the result is unhinged from the realities of modern broadband service," and said Congress or the Supreme Court could intervene to "avoid trapping Internet regulation in technological anachronism."
 
In the meantime, the court threw out the FCC’s attempt to block all state rules on net neutrality, while preserving the commission’s power to pre-empt individual state laws that undermine its order. That means more battles like the one now going on between the Justice Department and California, which enacted a tough net neutrality law in the wake of the FCC’s abdication.
The endless legal battles and back-and-forth at the FCC cry out for Congress to act. It needs to give the commission explicit authority once and for all to bar broadband providers from meddling in the traffic on their network and to create clear rules protecting openness and innovation online.


36.	There has long been concern that broadband provides would 	.

[A]	bring web-based firms under control

[B]	slow down the traffic on their network

[C]	show partiality in treating clients

[D]	intensify competition with their rivals



37.	Faced with the demand for net neutrality rules, the FCC 	.

[A]	sticks to an out-of-date order

[B]	takes an anti-regulatory stance

[C]	has issued a special resolution

[D]	has allowed the states to intervene



38.	What can be learned about AT&T from Paragraph 3?

[A]	It protects against unfair competition

[B]	It engages in anti-competitive practices.

[C]	It is under the FCC'S investigation.

[D]	It is in pursuit of quality service.



39.	Judge Patricia Millett argues that the appeals court's decision 	.

[A]	focuses on trivialities
 
[B]	conveys an ambiguous message

[C]	is at odds with its earlier rulings

[D]	is out of touch with reality



40.	What does the author argue in the last paragraph?

[A]	Congress needs to take action to ensure net neutrality.

[B]	The FCC should be put under strict supervision.

[C]	Rules need to be set to diversify online services.

[D]	Broadband providers' rights should be protected.

In the movies and on television, artificial intelligence (AI) is typically depicted as something sinister that will upend our way of life. When it comes to AI in business, we often hear about it in relation to automation and the impending loss of jobs, but in what ways is AI changing companies and the larger economy that don’t involve doom-and-gloom mass unemployment predictions?
A recent survey of manufacturing and service industries from Tata Consultancy Services found that companies currently use AI more often in computer-to-computer activities than in automating human activities. One common application? Preventing electronic security breaches, which, rather than eliminating IT jobs, actually makes those personnel more valuable to employers, because they help firms prevent hacking attempts.
Here are a few other ways AI is aiding companies without replacing employees:

Better Hiring Practices

Companies are using artificial intelligence to remove some of the unconscious bias from hiring decisions. “There are experiments that show that, naturally, the results of interviews are
 
much more biased than what AI does,” says Domingos. In addition, (41) 	One company that’s doing this is called Blendoor. It uses analytics to help identify where there may be bias in the hiring process.


More Effective Marketing

Some AI software can analyze and optimize marketing email subject lines to increase open rates. One company in the UK, Phrasee, claims their software can outperform humans by up to 10 percent when it comes to email open rates. This can mean millions more in revenue. (42)
 	These are “tools that help people use data, not a replacement for people,” says Patrick H. Winston, a professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT.


Saving Customers Money

Energy companies can use AI to help customers reduce their electricity bills, saving them money while helping the environment. Companies can also optimize their own energy use and cut down on the cost of electricity. Insurance companies, meanwhile, can base their premiums on AI models that more accurately access risk. (43)   	


Improved Accuracy

“Machine learning often provides a more reliable form of statistics, which makes data more valuable,” says Winston. It “helps people make smarter decisions.” (44)   	


Protecting and Maintaining Infrastructure

A number of companies, particularly in energy and transportation, use AI image processing technology to inspect infrastructure and prevent equipment failure or leaks before they happen. “If they   fail    first    and    then    you    fix    them,    it’s    very    expensive,”    says    Domingos.    “ (45) 	”



[A]	I replace the boring parts of your job. If you're doing research, you can have AI go out and look for relevant sources and information that otherwise you just wouldn't have time for.
 
[B]	One accounting firm, EY, uses an AI system that helps review contracts during an audit. This process, along with employees reviewing the contracts, is faster and more accurate.
[C]	There are also companies like Acquisio, which analyzes advertising performance across multiple channels like Adwords, Bing and social media and makes adjustments or suggestions about where advertising funds will be most effective.
[D]	You want to predict if something needs attention now and point to where it’s useful for [employees] to go to.
[E]	“Before, they might not insure the ones who felt like a high risk or charge them too much,” says Domingos, “or they would charge them too little and then it would cost [the company] money.”
[F]	We’re also giving our customers better channels versus picking up the phone … to accomplish something beyond human scale.
[G]	AI looks at résumés in greater numbers than humans would be able to, and selects the more promising candidates.

World War II was the watershed event for higher education in modern western societies. (46) Those societies came out of the war with levels of enrollment that had been roughly constant at
3-5% of the relevant age groups during the decades before the war. But after the war, great social and political changes arising out of the successful war against Fascism created a growing demand in European  and  American economies for  increasing  numbers  of graduates  with  more   than  a
 

secondary school education. (47) And the  demand that  rose in those societies  for entry  to higher

education extended to groups and social classes that had not thought of attending to a university

before the war. These demands resulted in a very rapid expansion of the systems of higher education, beginning in the 1960s and developing very rapidly though unevenly in the 1970s and 1980s.
The growth of higher education manifests itself in at least three quite different ways, and these in turn have given rise to different sets of problems. There was first the rate of growth: (48) in many countries of Western Europe the numbers of students in higher education doubled within
five-year periods during the decade of the 1960s and doubled again in seven, eight, or 10 years  by

the middle of the 1970s. Second, growth obviously affected the absolute size both of systems and individual  institutions.  And  third,  growth  was  reflected  in  changes  in  the  proportion  of  the
relevant age group enrolled in institutions of higher education.

Each of these manifestations of growth carried its own peculiar problems in its wake. For example, a high growth rate placed great strains on the existing structures of governance, of administration, and above all of socialization. When a very large proportion of all the members of an institution are new recruits, they threaten to overwhelm the processes whereby recruits to a more slowly growing system are inducted into its value system and learn its norms and forms. When a faculty or department grows from, say, five to 20 members within three or four years, (49) and when the new staff are predominantly young men and women fresh from postgraduate study,
they largely define the norms of academic life in that faculty and its standards. And if the postgraduate student population also grows rapidly and there is loss of a close apprenticeship relationship between faculty members and students, the student culture becomes the chief socializing force for new postgraduate students, with consequences for the intellectual and academic life of the institution—this was seen in America as well as in France, Italy, West Germany, and Japan. (50) High growth rates increased the chances for academic innovation; they
also  weakened  the  forms  and  processes  by  which  teachers  and  students  are  admitted  into a
 
community of scholars during periods of stability or slow growth. In the 1960s and 1970s, European universities saw marked changes in their governance arrangements, with the empowerment of junior faculty and to some degree of students as well. They also saw higher levels of student discontent, reflecting the weakening of traditional forms of academic communities.

Even if families don't sit down to eat together as frequently as before, millions of Britons will nonetheless have got a share this weekend of one of that nation’s great traditions:the Sunday roast.    1    a cold winter's day, few culinary pleasures can          2     it. Yet as we report now, the food police are determined that this    3      should be rendered yet another guilty pleasure    4    to damage our health.
The Food Standards Authority (FSA) has     5      a public warning about the risks of a compound called acrylamide that forms in some foods cooked   6   high temperatures. This means that people should     7     crisping their roast potatoes, reject thin- crust pizzas and only      8      toast their bread.But where is the evidence to support such alarmist advice?     9     studies have shown that acrylamide can cause neurological damage in mice, there is no     10      evidence that it causes cancer in humans.
Scientists say the compound is    11    to cause cancer but have no hard scientific proof    12     the precautionary principle,  it could be argued that it is     13    to follow the FSA advice.    14    , it was rumoured that smoking caused cancer for years before the evidence was found to prove a    15    .
Doubtless a piece of boiled beef can always be    16    up on Sunday alongside some steamed vegetables, without the Yorkshire pudding and no wine. But would life be worth living?   17   , the FSA says it is not telling people to cut out roast foods    18    ,but to reduce their lifetime intake. However, their     19     risks coming a cross as being pushy and overprotective.Constant health scares just    20    with    no one listening.

A group of Labour MPs, among them Yvette Cooper, are bringing in the new year with a call to institute a UK “town of culture” award. The proposal is that it should sit alongside the existing city of culture title, which was held by Hull in 2017, and has been awarded to Coventry for 2021. Cooper and her colleagues argue that the success of the crown for Hull, where it brought in £220m of investment and an avalanche of arts, ought not to be confined to cities. Britain’s towns, it is true, are not prevented from applying, but they generally lack the resources to put together a bid to beat their bigger competitors. A town of culture award could, it is argued, become an annual event, attracting funding and creating jobs.
Some might see the proposal as a booby prize for the fact that Britain  is no longer able to apply for the much more prestigious title of European capital of culture, a sought-after award bagged by Glasgow in 1990 and Liverpool in 2008. A cynic might speculate that the UK is on the verge of disappearing into an endless fever of self-celebration in its desperation to reinvent itself for the post-Brexit world: after  town of culture, who knows what will follow-village of culture? Suburb of culture? Hamlet of culture?
It is also wise to recall that such titles are not a cure-all. A badly run “year of culture” washes in and washes out of a place like the tide, bringing prominence for a spell but leaving no lasting benefits to the community. The really successful  holders of such titles are those that do a great deal more than fill hotel bedrooms and bring in high-profile arts events and good press for a year. They transform the aspirations of the people who live there; they nudge the self-image of the city into a bolder and  more optimistic light. It is hard to get right, and requires a remarkable degree of vision, as well as cooperation between city authorities, the private sector, community groups and cultural organisations. But it can be done: Glasgow's year as European capital of culture can certainly be seen as one of a complex series of factors that have turned the city into the powerhouse of art, music and theatre that it remains today.
A “town of culture” could be not just about the arts but about honouring a town’s peculiarities—helping  sustain its high street, supporting  local facilities and above all celebrating its people. Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, should welcome this positive, hope-filled proposal, and turn it into action.

Scientific publishing has long been a licence to print money. Scientists need journals in which to publish their research, so they will supply the articles without monetary reward. Other scientists perform the specialised work of peer review also    for free, because it is a central element in the acquisition of status and the production   of scientific knowledge.
With the content of papers secured for free, the publisher needs only find a market for its journal. Until this century, university libraries were not very price sensitive. Scientific publishers routinely report profit margins approaching 40% on their operations at a time when the rest of the publishing industry is in an existential crisis.
The Dutch giant Elsevier, which claims to publish 25% of the scientific papers produced in the world, made profits of more than £900m last year, while UK universities alone spent more than £210m in 2016 to enable researchers to access      their own publicly funded research; both figures seem to rise unstoppably despite increasingly desperate efforts to change them.
The most drastic, an thoroughly illegal, reaction has been the emergence of    Sci-Hub, a kind of global photocopier for scientific papers, set up in 2012, which now claims to offer access to every paywalled article published since 2015. The success of Sci-Hub, which relies on researchers passing on copies they have themselves legally accessed, shows the legal ecosystem has lost legitimacy among its users and must be transformed so that it works for all participants.
In Britain the move towards open access publishing has been driven by funding bodies. In some ways it has been very successful. More than half of all British    scientific research is now published under open access terms: either freely available from the moment of publication, or paywalled for a year or more so that the     publishers can make a profit before being placed on general release.
Yet the new system has not yet worked out any cheaper for the universities. Publishers have responded to the demand that they make their product free to readers   by charging their writers fees to cover the costs of prep ring an article. These range   from around £500 to $5,000, and apparently the work gets more expensive the more  that publishers do it. A report last year pointed out that the costs both of subscriptions and of these “article preparation costs” had been steadily rising at a rate above inflation.
In some ways the scientific publishing model resembles the economy of the     social internet: labour is provided free in exchange for the hope of status, while huge profits are made by a few big firms who run the market places. In both cases, we need    a rebalancing of power. 
26. Scientific publishing is seen as “a licence to print money” partly because
[A] its funding has enjoyed a steady increase.
[B] its marketing strategy has been successful.
[C] its payment for peer review is reduced.
[D] its content acquisition costs nothing.

27. According to Paragraphs 2 and 3, scientific publishers Elsevier have
[A] thrived mainly on university libraries.

28. How does the author feel about the success of Sci-Hub? 
[A] Relieved.
[B] Puzzled.
[C] Concerned.
[D] Encouraged.

29. It can be learned from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that open access terms
[A] allow publishers some room to make money.
[B] render publishing much easier for scientists.
[C] reduce the cost of publication substantially.
[D] free universities from financial burdens.

30. Which of the following characterizes the scientific publishing model?

Progressives often support diversity mandates as a path to equality and a way to level the playing field. But all too often such policies are an insincere form of virtue-signaling  that benefits only the most privileged and does little to help average people.
A pair of bills sponsored by Massachusetts state Senator Jason Lewis and House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, to ensure “gender parity” on boards and commissions, provide a case in point.
Haddad and Lewis are concerned that more than half the state-government  boards are less than 40 percent female. In order to ensure that elite women have more   such opportunities, they have proposed imposing government quotas. If the bills     become law, state boards and commissions will be required to set aside 50 percent of board seats for women by 2022.
The bills are similar to a measure recently adopted in Califomia, which last year became the first state to require gender quotas for private companies. In signing the measure, California Governor Jerry Brown admitted that the law, which expressly classifies people on the basis of sex, is probably unconstitutional.
The US Supreme Court frowns on sex-based classifications unless they are    designed to address an “important” policy interest, Because the California law applies     to all boards, even where there is no history of prior discrimination, courts are likely to rule that the law violates the constitutional guarantee of “equal protection”.
But are such government mandates even necessary? Female participation on corporate boards may not currently mirror the percentage of women in the general population, but so what?
The number of women on corporate boards has been steadily increasing without government interference. According to a study by Catalyst, between 2010 and 2015   the share of women on the boards of global corporations increased by 54 percent.
Requiring companies to make gender the primary qualification for board  membership will inevitably lead to less experienced private sector boards. That is exactly what happened when Norway adopted a nationwide corporate gender quota.
Writing in The New Republic, Alice Lee notes that increasing the number of opportunities for board membership without increasing the pool of qualified women to serve on such boards has led to a “golden skirt” phenomenon, where the same elite women scoop up multiple seats on a variety of boards.
Next time somebody pushes corporate quotas as a way to promote gender equity, remember that such policies are largely self-serving measures that make their sponsors feelgood but do little to help average women.


31.The author believes that the bills sponsored by Lewis and Haddad will
[A] help little to reduce gender bias.
[B] pose a threat to the state government.
[C] raise women’s position in politics.
[D] greatly broaden career options.

32. Which of the following is true of the Califormia measure?
[A] It has irritated private business owners.
[B] It is welcomed by the Supreme Court.
[C] It may go against the Constitution.
[D] It will settle the prior controversies.

33. The author mentions the study by Catalyst to illustrate
[A] the harm from arbitrary board decision.
[B] the importance of constitutional guarantees.
[C] the pressure on women in global corporations.
[D] the needlessness of government interventions.

34. Norway’s adoption of a nationwide corporate gender quota has led to
[A] the underestimation of elite women’s role.
[B] the objection to female participation on boards.
[C] the entry of unqualified candidates into the board.
[D] the growing tension between labor and management.

35. Which of the following can be inferred from the text?
[A] Women’s need in employment should be considered.
[B] Feasibility should be a prime concern in policymaking.
[C] Everyone should try hard to promote social justice.
[D] Major social issues should be the focus of legislation.

Last Thursday, the French Senate passed a digital services tax, which would  impose an entirely new tax on large multinationals that provide digital services to consumers or users in France. Digital services include everything from providing a platform for selling goods and services online to targeting advertising based on user   data, and the tax applies to gross revenue from such services. Many French politicians and media outlets have referred to this as a “ GAFA tax,” meaning that it is designed  to apply primarily to companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and  Amazon—in other words, multinational tech companies based in the United States.
The digital services tax now awaits the signature of President Emmanuel Macron, who has expressed support for the measure, and it could go into effect within the next few weeks. But it has already sparked significant controversy, with the United States trade representative opening an investigation into whether the tax discriminates against American companies, which in tum could lead to trade sanctions against France.
The French tax is not just a unilateral move by one country in need of revenue.                   
Instead, the digital services tax is part of a much larger trend, with countries over the past few years proposing or putting in place an alphabet soup of new international tax provisions. They have included Britain’s DPT. (diverted profits tax), Australia’s MAAL (multinational anti-avoidance  law),  and  India’s  SEP  (significant  economic     presence) test, to name but a few. At the same time, the European Union, Spain, Britain and several other countries have all seriously contemplated digital services taxes.
These unilateral developments differ in their specifics, but they are all designed     to tax multinationals on income and revenue that countries believe they should have a right to tax, even if international tax rules do not grant them that right. In other words, they all share a view that the international tax system has failed to keep up with the current economy.
In response to these many unilateral measures, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is currently working with 131 countries  to  reach a consensus by the end of 2020 on an international solution. Both France and      the United States are involved in the organization's work, but France's digital services tax and the American response raise questions about what the future holds for the international tax system.
France’s planned tax is a clear warning: Unless a broad consensus  can  be    reached on reforming the international tax system, other nations are likely to follow    suit, and American companies will face a cascade of different taxes from dozens of nations that will prove burdensome and costly.


36.The French Senate has passed a bill to
	[A] regulate digital services platforms.
	[B] protect French companies” interests.
	[C] impose a levy on tech multinationals.
	[D] curb the influence of advertising.

37. It can be learned from Paragraph 2 that the digital services tax
	[A] may trigger countermeasures against France.
	[B] is apt to arouse criticism at home and abroad.
	[C] aims to ease international trade tensions.
	[D] will prompt the tech giants to quit France.

38. The countries adopting the unilateral measures share the opinion that
	[A] redistribution of tech giants’ revenue must be ensured.
	[B] the current international tax system needs upgrading.
	[C] tech multinationals’ monopoly should be prevented.
	[D] all countries ought to enjoy equal taxing rights.

39. It can be learned from Paragraph 5 that the OECD’s current work
	[A] is being resisted  by  US  companies.
	[B] needs to be readjusted immediately.
	[C] is faced with uncertain prospects.

[A] Eye fixations are brief
[B] Too much eye contact is instinctively felt to be rude
[C] Eye contact can be a friendly social signal
[D] Personality can affect how a person reacts to eye contact
[E] Biological factors behind eye contact are being investigated 
[F] Most people are not comfortable holding eye contact with strangers
[G] Eye contact can also be aggressive.

In a social situation, eye contact with another person can show that you are paying attention in a friendly way. But it can also be antagonistic such as when a political candidate turns toward their competitor during a debate and makes eye contact that signals hostility.Here’s what hard science reveals about eye contact:

 We know that a typical infant will instinctively gaze into its mother’s eyes, and she will look back. This mutual gaze is a major part of the attachment between mother and child. In adulthood, looking someone else in a pleasant way can be a complimentary sign of paying attention. It can catch someone’s attention in a crowded room, “Eye contact and smile” can signal availability and confidence, a common-sense notion supported in studies by psychologist Monica Moore.

Neuroscientist Bonnie Auyeung found that the hormone oxytocin increased the amount of eye contact from men toward the interviewer during a brief interview when the direction of their gaze was recorded. This was also found in high-functioning men with some autistic spectrum symptoms, who may tend to avoid eye contact. Specific brain regions that respond during direct gaze are being explored by other researches, using advanced methods of brain scanning.

With the use of eye-tracking technology, Julia Minson of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government concluded that eye contact can signal very different kinds of messages, depending on the situation. While eye contact may be a sign of connection or trust in friendly situations, it’s more likely to be associated with dominance or intimidation in adversarial situations. “Whether you’re a politician or a parent, it might be helpful to keep in mind that trying to maintain eye contact may backfire if you’re trying to convince someone who has a different set of beliefs than you,”said Minson.

When we look at a face or a picture, our eyes pause on one spot at a time, often on the eyes or mouth. These pauses typically occur at about three per second, and the eyes then jump to another spot, until several important points in the image are registered like a series of snapshots. How the whole image is then assembled and perceived is still a mystery although it is the subject of current research.

In people who score high in a test of neuroticism, a personality dimension associated with self-consciousness and anxiety, eye contact triggered more activity associated with avoidance,according to the Finnish researcher Jari Hietanen and colleagues “Our findings indicate that people do not only feel different when they are the centre of attention but that their brain reactions also differ.” A more direct finding is that people who scored highly  for negative emotions like anxiety looked at others for shorter periods of time and reported more comfortable feelings when others did not look directly at them.

Following the explosion of creativity in Florence during the 14th  century known as the Renaissance, the modern world saw a departure from what it had once known.  It turned from God and the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and instead favoured a more humanistic approach to being. Renaissance ideas had spread throughout Europe well into the 17th century,with the arts and sciences flourishing extraordinarily among those with a more logical disposition. (46) with the Church’s teachings and ways of thinking eclipsed by the Renaissance,the gap between the Medieval and modern periods had been bridged leading to new and unexplored intellectual territories.
During the Renaissance, the great minds of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei demonstrated the power of scientific study and discovery.   (47) Before each of their revelations many thinkers at the time had sustained more ancient ways of thinking, including the geocentric view that the Earth was at the  centre of our universe. Copernicus theorized in 1543 that all of the planets that we knew of revolved not around the Earth, but the Sun, a system that was later upheld by Galileo at his own expense. Offering up such a theory during a time of high tension between scientific and religious minds was branded as heresy and any such heretics that continued to spread these lies were to be punished by imprisonment or even death.
(48) Despite attempts by the Church to suppress. this new generation of logicians  and rationalists, more explanations for how the universe functioned were being made   at a rate that the people could no longer ignore.It was with these great revelations that a new kind of philosophy founded in reason was born.
The Church’s long-standing dogma was losing the great battle for truth to rationalists and scientists. This very fact embodied the new ways of thinking that swept through Europe during most of 17th century. (49) As many took on the duty of trying to integrate reasoning and scientific philosophies into the world, the Renaissance was over and it was time for a new era - the Age of Reason.
The 17th and 18th centuries were times of radical change and curiosity, Scientific method, reductionism and the questioning of Church ideals was to be encouraged, as were ideas of liberty,  tolerance and progress. (50) Such actions to seek knowledge and to understand what information we already knew were captured by the Latin phrase ‘sapere aude’ or ‘dare to know’, after Immanuel Kant used it in his essay An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?. It was the purpose and responsibility of great minds to go forth and seek out the truth, which they believed to be founded in knowledge.

Financial regulators in Britain have imposed a rather unusual rule on the bosses of big banks. Starting next year, any guaranteed bonus of top executives could be delayed 10 years if their banks are under investigation for wrongdoing. The main purpose of this “clawback” rule is to hold bankers accountable for harmful risk-taking and to restore public trust in financial institutions. Yet officials also hope for a much larger benefit: more long-term decision-making, not only by banks but by all corporations, to build a stronger economy for future generations.
“Short-termism” or the desire for quick profits, has worsened in publicly traded companies, says the Bank of England’s top economist, Andrew Haldane. He quotes a giant of classical economics, Alfred Marshall, in describing this financial impatience as acting like “children who pick the plums out of their pudding to eat them at once” rather than putting them aside to be eaten last.
The average time for holding a stock in both the United States and Britain, he notes, has dropped from seven years to seven months in recent decades. Transient investors, who demand high quarterly profits from companies, can hinder a firm’s efforts to invest in long-term research or to build up customer loyalty. This has been dubbed “quarterly capitalism.”
In addition, new digital technologies have allowed more rapid trading of equities, quicker use of information, and thus shorter attention spans in financial markets. “There seems to be a predominance of short-term thinking at the  expense  of long-term investing,” said Commissioner Daniel Gallagher of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in a speech this week.
In the US, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has pushed most public companies to defer performance bonuses for senior executives by about a year, slightly helping reduce “short-termism.” In its latest survey of CEO pay, The Wall Street Journal finds that “a substantial part” of executive pay is now tied to performance.
Much more could be done to encourage “long-termism,” such as changes in the tax code and quicker disclosure of stock acquisitions. In France, shareholders who hold onto a company investment for at least two years can sometimes earn more voting rights in a company.
Within companies, the right compensation design can provide incentives for executives to think beyond their own time at the company and on behalf of all stakeholders. Britain’s new rule is a reminder to bankers that society has an interest in their performance, not just for the short term but for the long term.
 

21.	According to Paragraph 1, one motive in imposing the new rule is to
[A]	enhance bankers’ sense of responsibility.
[B]	help corporations achieve larger profits.

22.	Alfred Marshall is quoted to indicate
[A]	the conditions for generating quick profits.
[B]	governments’ impatience in decision-making.

23.	It is argued that the influence of transient investment on public companies can be
[A]	indirect.
[B]	adverse.
[C]	minimal.
[D]	temporary.


24.	The US and France examples are used to illustrate
[A]	the obstacles to preventing “short-termism”.

Grade inflation – the gradual increase in average GPAs (grade-point averages) over the past few decades – is often considered a product of a consumer era in higher education, in which students are treated like customers to be pleased. But another, related force – a policy often buried deep in course catalogs called “grade forgiveness” – is helping raise GPAs.
Grade forgiveness allows students to retake a course in which they received a low grade, and the most recent grade or the highest grade is the only one that counts  in calculating a student’s overall GPA.
The use of this little-known practice has accelerated in recent years, as colleges continue to do their utmost to keep students in school (and paying tuition) and improve their graduation rates. When this practice first started decades ago, it was usually limited to freshmen, to give them a second chance to take a class in their first year if they struggled in their transition to college-level courses. But now most colleges, save for many selective campuses, allow all undergraduates, and even graduate students, to get their low grades forgiven.
College officials tend to emphasize that the goal of grade forgiveness is less about the grade itself and more about encouraging students to retake courses critical  to their degree program and graduation without incurring a big penalty. “Ultimately,” said Jack Miner, Ohio State University’s registrar, “we see students achieve more success because they retake a course and do better in subsequent courses or master  the content that allows them to graduate on time.”
That said, there is a way in which grade forgiveness satisfies colleges’ own needs as well. For public institutions, state funds are sometimes tied partly to their success on metrics such as graduation rates and student retention – so better grades can, by boosting figures like those, mean more money. And anything that  raises  GPAs  will  likely  make students – who, at the end of the day, are paying the bill – feel they’ve gotten a better value for their tuition dollars, which is another big concern for colleges.
Indeed, grade forgiveness is just another way that universities are responding to consumers’ expectations for higher education. Since students and parents expect a college degree to lead to a job, it is in the best interest of a school to turn out  graduates who are as qualified as possible – or at least appear to be. On this, students’ and colleges’ incentives seem to be aligned.

This year marks exactly two centuries since the publication of “Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,” by Mary Shelley. Even before the invention of the electric light bulb, the author produced a remarkable work of speculative fiction that would foreshadow many ethical questions to be raised by technologies yet to come.
Today the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) raises fundamental questions: “What is intelligence, identity, or consciousness? What makes humans humans? ”
What is being called artificial general intelligence, machines that would imitate the way humans think, continues to evade scientists. Yet humans remain fascinated by the idea of robots that would look, move, and respond like humans, similar to those recently depicted on popular sci-fi TV series such as “Westworld” and “Humans.”
Just how people think is still far too complex to be understood, let alone reproduced, says David Eagleman, a Stanford University neuroscientist. “We are just in a situation where there are no good theories explaining what consciousness actually is and how you could ever build a machine to get there.”
But that doesn’t mean crucial ethical issues involving AI aren’t at hand. The coming use of autonomous vehicles, for example, poses thorny ethical questions. Human drivers sometimes must make split-second decisions. Their reactions may be  a complex combination of instant reflexes, input from past driving experiences, and what their eyes and ears tell them in that moment. AI “vision” today is not nearly as sophisticated as that of humans. And to anticipate every imaginable driving situation is a difficult programming problem.
Whenever decisions are based on masses of data, “you quickly get into a lot of ethical questions,” notes Tan Kiat How, chief executive of a Singapore-based agency that is helping the government develop a voluntary code for the ethical use of AI. Along with Singapore, other governments and mega-corporations are beginning to establish their own guidelines. Britain is setting up a data ethics center. India released its AI ethics strategy this spring.
On June 7 Google pledged not to “design or deploy AI” that would cause “overall harm,” or to develop AI-directed weapons or use AI for surveillance that would violate international norms. It also pledged not to deploy AI whose use would violate international laws or human rights.
While the statement is vague, it represents one starting point. So does the idea that decisions made by AI systems should be explainable, transparent, and fair.
To put it another way: How can we make sure that the thinking of intelligent machines reflects humanity’s highest values? Only then will they be useful servants and not Frankenstein’s out-of-control monster.
 

31.	Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein is mentioned because it
[A]	fascinates AI scientists all over the world.
[B]	has remained popular for as long as 200 years.
[C]	involves some concerns raised by AI today.
[D]	has sparked serious ethical controversies.


32.	In David Eagleman’s opinion, our current knowledge of consciousness
[A]	helps explain artificial intelligence.
[B]	can be misleading to robot making.
[C]	inspires popular sci-fi TV series.
[D]	is too limited for us to reproduce it.


33.	The solution to the ethical issues brought by autonomous vehicles
[A]	can hardly ever be found.
[B]	is still beyond our capacity.
[C]	causes little public concern.
[D]	has aroused much curiosity.


34.	The author’s attitude toward Google’s pledges is one of
[A]	affirmation.
[B]	skepticism.
[C]	contempt.
[D]	respect.

States will be able to force more people to pay sales tax when they make online purchases under a Supreme Court decision Thursday that will leave shoppers with lighter wallets but is a big financial win for states.
The Supreme Court’s opinion Thursday overruled a pair of decades-old decisions that states said cost them billions of dollars in lost revenue annually. The decisions made it more difficult for states to collect sales tax on certain online purchases.
The cases the court overturned said that if a business was shipping a customer’s purchase to a state where the business didn’t have a physical presence such as a warehouse or office, the business didn’t have to collect sales tax for the state. Customers were generally responsible for paying the sales tax to the state themselves if they weren’t charged it, but most didn’t realize they owed it and few paid.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the previous decisions were flawed. “Each year the physical presence rule becomes further removed from economic reality and results in significant revenue losses to the States,” he wrote in an opinion joined by four other justices. Kennedy wrote that the rule “limited states’ ability to seek long-term prosperity and has prevented market participants from competing on an even playing field.”
The ruling is a victory for big chains with a presence in many states, since they usually collect sales tax on online purchases already. Now, rivals will be charging sales tax where they hadn’t before. Big chains have been collecting sales tax nationwide because they typically have physical stores in whatever state a purchase is being shipped to. Amazon.com, with its network of warehouses, also collects sales tax in every state that charges it, though third-party sellers who use the site don’t have    to.
Until now, many sellers that have a physical presence in only a single state or a few states have been able to avoid charging sales taxes when they ship to addresses outside those states. Sellers that use eBay and Etsy, which provide platforms for smaller sellers, also haven’t been collecting sales tax nationwide. Under the ruling Thursday, states can pass laws requiring out-of-state sellers to collect the state’s sales tax from customers and send it to the state.
Retail trade groups praised the ruling, saying it levels the playing field for local and online businesses. The losers, said retail analyst Neil Saunders, are online-only retailers, especially smaller ones. Those retailers may face headaches complying with various state sales tax laws. The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council advocacy group said in a statement, “Small businesses and internet entrepreneurs are not well served at all by this decision.”
 

36.	The Supreme Court decision Thursday will
[A]	better businesses’ relations with states.
[B]	put most online businesses in a dilemma.
[C]	make more online shoppers pay sales tax.
[D]	force some states to cut sales tax.


37.	It can be learned from paragraphs 2 and 3 that the overruled decisions
[A]	have led to the dominance of e-commerce.
[B]	have cost consumers a lot over the years.
[C]	were widely criticized by online purchasers.
[D]	were considered unfavorable by states.


38.	According to Justice Anthony Kennedy, the physical presence rule has
[A]	hindered economic development.
[B]	brought prosperity to the country.
[C]	harmed fair market competition.
[D]	boosted growth in states’ revenue.


39.	Who are most likely to welcome the Supreme Court ruling?
[A]	Internet entrepreneurs.
[B]	Big-chain owners.
[C]	Third-party sellers.
[D]	Small retailers.


40.	In dealing with the Supreme Court decision Thursday, the author
[A]	gives a factual account of it and discusses its consequences.
[B]	describes the long and complicated process of its making.
[C]	presents its main points with conflicting views on them.
[D]	cites some cases related to it and analyzes their implications.
 
Part B Directions:
The following paragraphs are given in a wrong order. For Questions 41-45, you are required to reorganize these paragraphs into a coherent text by choosing from the list A-G and filling them into the numbered boxes. Paragraphs C and F have been correctly placed. Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET. (10 points)

[A]	These tools can help you win every argument – not in the unhelpful sense of beating your opponents but in the better sense of learning about the issues that divide people. Learning why they disagree with us and learning to talk and work together with them. If we readjust our view of arguments – from a verbal fight or tennis game to a reasoned exchange through which we all gain mutual respect, and understanding – then we change the very nature of what it means to “win” an argument.

[B]	Of course, many discussions are not so successful. Still, we need to be careful not to accuse opponents of bad arguments too quickly. We need to learn how to evaluate them properly. A large part of evaluation is calling out bad arguments, but we also need to admit good arguments by opponents and to apply the same critical standards to ourselves. Humility requires you to recognize weakness in your own arguments and sometimes also to accept reasons on the opposite side.

[C]	None of these will be easy but you can start even if others refuse to. Next time you state your position, formulate an argument for what you claim and honestly ask yourself whether your argument is any good. Next time you talk with someone who takes a stand, ask them to give you a reason for their view. Spell out their argument fully and charitably. Assess its strength impartially. Raise objections and listen carefully to their replies.

[D]	Carnegie would be right if arguments were fights, which is how we often think of them. Like physical fights, verbal fights can leave both sides bloodied. Even when you win, you end up no better off. Your prospects would be almost as dismal if arguments were even just competitions – like, say, tennis games. Pairs
 
of opponents hit the ball back and forth until one winner emerges from all who entered. Everybody else loses. This kind of thinking is why so many people try to avoid arguments, especially about politics and religion.

[E]	In his 1936 work How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie wrote: “There is only one way…to get the best of an argument – and that is to avoid it.” This aversion to arguments is common, but it depends on a mistaken view of arguments that causes profound problems for our personal and social lives – and in many ways misses the point of arguing in the first place.

[F]	These views of arguments also undermine reason. If you see a conversation as a fight or competition, you can win by cheating as long as you don’t get caught. You will be happy to convince people with bad arguments. You can call their views stupid, or joke about how ignorant they are. None of these tricks will help you understand them, their positions or the issues that divide you, but they can help you win – in one way.

[G]	There is a better way to win arguments. Imagine that you favor increasing the minimum wage in our state, and I do not. If you yell, “Yes,” and I yell, “No,” neither of us learns anything. We neither understand nor respect each other, and we have no basis for compromise or cooperation. In contrast, suppose you give a reasonable argument: that full-time workers should not have to live in poverty. Then I counter with another reasonable argument: that a higher minimum wage will force businesses to employ fewer people for less time. Now we can understand each other’s positions and recognize our shared values, since we both care about needy workers.

It was only after I started to write a weekly column about the medical journals, and began to read scientific papers from beginning to end, that I realised just how bad much of the medical literature frequently was. I came to recognise various signs of a bad paper: the kind of paper that purports to show that people who eat more than one kilo of broccoli a week were 1.17 times more likely than those who eat less to suffer late in life from pernicious anaemia. (46) There is a great deal of this kind  of nonsense in the medical journals which, when taken up by broadcasters and the lay press, generates both health scares and short-lived dietary enthusiasms.
Why is so much bad science published? A recent paper, titled “The Natural Selection of Bad Science”, published on the Royal Society’s open science website, attempts to answer this intriguing and important question. It says that the problem is not merely that people do bad science, but that our current system of career advancement positively encourages it. What is important is not truth, but publication, which has become almost an end in itself. There has been a kind of inflationary process at work: (47) nowadays anyone applying for a research post has to have published twice the number of papers that would have been required for the same post only 10 years ago. Never mind the quality, then, count the number.
(48) Attempts have been made to curb this tendency, for example, by trying to incorporate some measure of quality as well as quantity into the assessment of an applicant’s papers. This is the famed citation index, that is to say the number of times a paper has been quoted elsewhere in the scientific literature, the assumption being that an important paper will be cited more often than one of small account. (49) This would be reasonable if it were not for the fact that scientists can easily arrange to cite themselves in their future publications, or get associates to do so for them in return for similar favours.
Boiling down an individual’s output to simple metrics, such as number of publications or journal impacts, entails considerable savings in time, energy and ambiguity. Unfortunately, the long-term costs of using simple quantitative metrics to assess researcher merit are likely to be quite great. (50) If we are serious about ensuring that our science is both meaningful and reproducible, we must ensure that our institutions encourage that kind of science.

①Among the annoying challenges facing the middle class is one that will probably go unmentioned in the next presidential campaign: What happens when the robots come for their jobs?
①Don't dismiss that possibility entirely. ②About half of U.S. jobs are at high risk of being automated, according to a University of Oxford study, with the middle class disproportionately squeezed. ③Lower-income jobs like gardening or day care don't appeal to robots. ④But many middle-class occupations—trucking, financial advice, software engineering—have aroused their interest, or soon will. ⑤The rich own the robots, so they will be fine.
①This isn't to be alarmist. ②Optimists point out that technological upheaval has benefited workers in the past. ③The Industrial Revolution didn't go so well for Luddites whose jobs were displaced by mechanized looms, but it eventually raised living standards and created more jobs than it destroyed. ④Likewise, automation should eventually boost productivity, stimulate demand by driving down prices, and free workers from hard, boring work. ⑤But in the medium term, middle-class workers may need a lot of help adjusting.
①The first step, as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in The Second Machine Age, should be rethinking education and job training. ②Curriculums—from grammar school to college—should evolve to focus less on memorizing facts and more on creativity and complex communication. ③Vocational schools should do a better job of fostering problem-solving skills and helping students work alongside robots. ④Online education can supplement the traditional kind. ⑤It could make extra training and instruction affordable. ⑥Professionals trying to acquire new skills will be able to do so without going into debt.
①The challenge of coping with automation underlines the need for the U.S. to revive its fading business dynamism: Starting new companies must be made easier. ②In previous eras of drastic technological change, entrepreneurs smoothed the transition by dreaming up ways to combine labor and machines. ③The best uses of 3D printers and virtual reality haven't been invented yet. ④The U.S. needs the new companies that will invent them.
①Finally, because automation threatens to widen the gap between capital income and labor income, taxes and the safety net will have to be rethought. ②Taxes on low-wage labor need to be cut, and wage subsidies such as the earned income tax credit should be expanded: This would boost incomes, encourage work, reward companies for job creation, and reduce inequality.
①Technology will improve society in ways big and small over the next few years, yet this will be little comfort to those who find their lives and careers upended by automation. ②Destroying the machines that are coming for our jobs would be nuts. ③But policies to help workers adapt will be indispensable.

①A new survey by Harvard University finds more than two-thirds of young Americans disapprove of President Trump’s use of Twitter. ②The implication is that Millennials prefer news from the White House to be filtered through other sources, not a president’s social media platform.
①Most Americans rely on social media to check daily headlines. ②Yet as distrust has risen toward all media, people may be starting to beef up their media literacy skills. ③Such a trend is badly needed. ④During the 2016 presidential campaign, nearly a quarter of web content shared by Twitter users in the politically critical state of Michigan was fake news, according to the University of Oxford. ⑤And a survey conducted for BuzzFeed News found 44 percent of Facebook users rarely or never trust news from the media giant.
①Young people who are digital natives are indeed becoming more skillful at separating fact from fiction in cyberspace. ②A Knight Foundation focus-group survey of young people between ages 14 and 24 found they use “distributed trust” to verify stories. ③They cross-check sources and prefer news from different perspectives—especially those that are open about any bias. ④“Many young people assume a great deal of personal responsibility for educating themselves and actively seeking out opposing viewpoints,” the survey concluded.
①Such active research can have another effect. ②A 2014 survey conducted in Australia, Britain, and the United States by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that young people’s reliance on social media led to greater political engagement.
①Social media allows users to experience news events more intimately and immediately while also permitting them to re-share news as a projection of their values and interests. ②This forces users to be more conscious of their role in passing along information. ③A survey by Barna research group found the top reason given by Americans for the fake news phenomenon is “reader error,” more so than made-up stories or factual mistakes in reporting. ④About a third say the problem of fake news lies in “misinterpretation or exaggeration of actual news” via social media. ⑤In other words, the choice to share news on social media may be the heart of the issue. ⑥“This indicates there is a real personal responsibility in counteracting this problem,” says Roxanne Stone, editor in chief at Barna Group.
①So when young people are critical of an over-tweeting president, they reveal a mental discipline in thinking skills—and in their choices on when to share on social media.
26. According to Paragraphs 1 and 2, many young Americans cast doubt on
[A] the justification of the news-filtering practice.
[B] people's preference for social media platforms.
[C] the administration's ability to handle information.
[D] social media as a reliable source of news.
27. The phrase "beef up” (Para. 2) is closest in meaning to
[A] boast.
[B] define.
[C] sharpen.
[D] share.
28. According to the Knight Foundation survey, young people
　  [A] tend to voice their opinions in cyberspace.
　[B] verify news by referring to diverse sources.
　[C] have a strong sense of social responsibility.
　  [D] like to exchange views on "distributed trust".
29. The Barna survey found that a main cause for the fake news problem is
[A] readers' misinterpretation.
[B] journalists' biased reporting.
[C] readers' outdated values.
[D] journalists' made-up stories.
30. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
[A] A Counteraction Against the Over-tweeting Trend
[B] A Rise in Critical Skills for Sharing News Online
[C] The Accumulation of Mutual Trust on Social Media
[D] The Platforms for Projection of Personal Interests

①Any fair-minded assessment of the dangers of the deal between Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and DeepMind must start by acknowledging that both sides mean well. ②DeepMind is one of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies in the world. ③The potential of this work applied to healthcare is very great, but it could also lead to further concentration of power in the tech giants. ④It is against that background that the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has issued her damning verdict against the Royal Free hospital trust under the NHS, which handed over to DeepMind the records of 1.6 million patients in 2015 on the basis of a vague agreement which took far too little account of the patients' rights and their expectations of privacy.
①DeepMind has almost apologised. ②The NHS trust has mended its ways. ③Further arrangements—and there may be many—between the NHS and DeepMind will be carefully scrutinised to ensure that all necessary permissions have been asked of patients and all unnecessary data has been cleaned. ④There are lessons about informed patient consent to learn. ⑤But privacy is not the only angle in this case and not even the most important. ⑥Ms Denham chose to concentrate the blame on the NHS trust, since under existing law it “controlled” the data and DeepMind merely “processed” it. ⑦But this distinction misses the point that it is processing and aggregation, not the mere possession of bits, that gives the data value.
①The great question is who should benefit from the analysis of all the data that our lives now generate. ②Privacy law builds on the concept of damage to an individual from identifiable knowledge about them. ③That misses the way the surveillance economy works. ④The data of an individual there gains its value only when it is compared with the data of countless millions more.
①The use of privacy law to curb the tech giants in this instance feels slightly maladapted. ②This practice does not address the real worry. ③It is not enough to say that the algorithms DeepMind develops will benefit patients and save lives. ④What matters is that they will belong to a private monopoly which developed them using public resources. ⑤If software promises to save lives on the scale that drugs now can, big data may be expected to behave as big pharma has done. ⑥We are still at the beginning of this revolution and small choices now may turn out to have gigantic consequences later. ⑦A long struggle will be needed to avoid a future of digital feudalism. ⑧Ms Denham’s report is a welcome start.
31. What is true of the agreement between the NHS and DeepMind?
[A] It fell short of the latter's expectations.
[B] It caused conflicts among tech giants.
[C] It failed to pay due attention to patients' rights.
[D] It put both sides into a dangerous situation.
32. The NHS trust responded to Denham's verdict with
[A] empty promises.
[B] tough resistance.
[C] sincere apologies.
[D] necessary adjustments.
33. The author argues in Paragraph 2 that
[A] privacy protection must be secured at all costs.
[B] the value of data comes from the processing of it.

①The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) continues to bleed red ink. ②It reported a net loss of $5.6 billion for fiscal 2016, the 10th straight year its expenses have exceeded revenue. ③Meanwhile, it has more than $120 billion in unfunded liabilities, mostly for employee health and retirement costs. ④There are many reasons this formerly stable federal institution finds itself on the verge of bankruptcy. ⑤Fundamentally, the USPS is in a historic squeeze between technological change that has permanently decreased demand for its bread-and-butter product, first-class mail, and a regulatory structure that denies management the flexibility to adjust its operations to the new reality.
①And interest groups ranging from postal unions to greeting-card makers exert self-interested pressure on the USPS’s ultimate overseer—Congress—insisting that whatever else happens to the Postal Service, aspects of the status quo they depend on get protected. ②This is why repeated attempts at reform legislation have failed in recent years, leaving the Postal Service unable to pay its bills except by deferring vital modernization.
①Now comes word that everyone involved—Democrats, Republicans, the Postal Service, the unions and the system's heaviest users—has finally agreed on a plan to fix the system. ②Legislation is moving through the House that would save USPS an estimated $28.6 billion over five years, which could help pay for new vehicles, among other survival measures. ③Most of the money would come from a penny-per-letter permanent rate increase and from shifting postal retirees into Medicare. ④The latter step would largely offset the financial burden of annually pre-funding retiree health care, thus addressing a long-standing complaint by the USPS and its unions.
①If it clears the House, this measure would still have to get through the Senate—where someone is bound to point out that it amounts to the bare, bare minimum necessary to keep the Postal Service afloat, not comprehensive reform. ②There’s no change to collective bargaining at the USPS, a major omission considering that personnel accounts for 80 percent of the agency’s costs. ③Also missing is any discussion of eliminating Saturday letter delivery. ④That common-sense change enjoys wide public support and would save the USPS $2 billion per year. ⑤But postal special-interest groups seem to have killed it, at least in the House. ⑥The emerging consensus around the bill is a sign that legislators are getting frightened about a politically embarrassing short-term collapse at the USPS. ⑦It is not, however, a sign that they’re getting serious about transforming the postal system for the 21st century.
36. The financial problem with the USPS is caused partly by
[A] its unbalanced budget.
[B] its rigid management.
[C] the cost for technical upgrading.
[D] the withdrawal of bank support.
37. According to Paragraph 2, the USPS fails to modernize itself due to
[A] the interference from interest groups.
[B] the inadequate funding from Congress.
[C] the shrinking demand for postal service.
[D] the incompetence of postal unions.
38. The long-standing complaint by the USPS and its unions can be addressed by
[A] removing its burden of retiree health care.
[B] making more investment in new vehicles.
[C] adopting a new rate-increase mechanism.
[D] attracting more first-class mail users.
39. In the last paragraph, the author seems to view legislators with
[A] respect.
[B] tolerance.
[C] discontent.
[D] gratitude.
40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

A. In December of 1869, Congress appointed a commission to select a site and prepare plans and cost estimates for a new State Department Building. The commission was also to consider possible arrangements for the War and Navy Departments. To the horror of some who expected a Greek Revival twin of the Treasury Building to be erected on the other side of the White House, the elaborate French Second Empire style design by Alfred Mullett was selected, and construction of a building to house all three departments began in June of 1871.
B. Completed in 1875, the State Department's south wing was the first to be occupied, with its elegant four-story library (completed in 1876), Diplomatic Reception Room, and Secretary's office decorated with carved wood, Oriental rugs, and stenciled wall patterns. The Navy Department moved into the east wing in 1879, where elaborate wall and ceiling stenciling and marquetry floors decorated the office of the Secretary.
C. The State, War, and Navy Building, as it was originally known, housed the three Executive Branch Departments most intimately associated with formulating and conducting the nation's foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century—the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed some of the nation's most significant diplomats and politicians and has been the scene of many historic events.
D. Many of the most celebrated national figures have participated in historical events that have taken place within the EEOB's granite walls. Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush all had offices in this building before becoming President. It has housed 16 Secretaries of the Navy, 21 Secretaries of War, and 24 Secretaries of State. Winston Churchill once walked its corridors and Japanese emissaries met here with Secretary of State Cordell Hull after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
E. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) commands a unique position in both the national history and the architectural heritage of the United States. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, it was built from 1871 to 1888 to house the growing staffs of the State, War, and Navy Departments, and is considered one of the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country.
F. Construction took 17 years as the building slowly rose wing by wing. When the EEOB was finished, it was the largest office building in Washington, with nearly 2 miles of black and white tiled corridors. Almost all of the interior detail is of cast iron or plaster; the use of wood was minimized to insure fire safety. Eight monumental curving staircases of granite with over 4,000 individually cast bronze balusters are capped by four skylight domes and two stained glass rotundas.
G. The history of the EEOB began long before its foundations were laid. The first executive offices were constructed between 1799 and 1820. A series of fires (including those set by the British in 1814) and overcrowded conditions led to the construction of the existing Treasury Building. In 1866, the construction of the North Wing of the Treasury Building necessitated the demolition of the State Department building.

 Shakespeare's lifetime was coincident with a period of extraordinary activity and achievement in the drama. (46) By the date of his birth Europe was witnessing the passing of the religious drama, and the creation of new forms under the incentive of classical tragedy and comedy. These new forms were at first mainly written by scholars and performed by amateurs, but in England, as everywhere else in western Europe, the growth of a class of professional actors was threatening to make the drama popular, whether it should be new or old, classical or medieval, literary or farcical. Court, school, organizations of amateurs, and the traveling actors were all rivals in supplying a widespread desire for dramatic entertainment; and (47) no boy who went to a grammar school could be ignorant that the drama was a form of literature which gave glory to Greece and Rome and might yet bring honor to England.
When Shakespeare was twelve years old the first public playhouse was built in London. For a time literature showed no interest in this public stage. Plays aiming at literary distinction were written for schools or court, or for the choir boys of St. Paul's and the royal chapel, who, however, gave plays in public as well as at court. (48) But the professional companies prospered in their permanent theaters, and university men with literary ambitions were quick to turn to these theaters as offering a means of livelihood. By the time that Shakespeare was twenty-five, Lyly, Peele, and Greene had made comedies that were at once popular and literary; Kyd had written a tragedy that crowded the pit; and Marlowe had brought poetry and genius to triumph on the common stage—where they had played no part since the death of Euripides. (49) A native literary drama had been created, its alliance with the public playhouses established, and at least some of its great traditions had been begun.
The development of the Elizabethan drama for the next twenty-five years is of exceptional interest to students of literary history, for in this brief period we may trace the beginning, growth, blossoming, and decay of many kinds of plays, and of many great careers. We are amazed today at the mere number of plays produced, as well as by the number of dramatists writing at the same time for this London of two hundred thousand inhabitants. (50) To realize how great was the dramatic activity, we must remember further that hosts of plays have been lost, and that probably there is no author of note whose entire work has survived.

①First two hours, now three hours—this is how far in advance authorities are recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. airports with increasingly massive security lines.
①Americans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security procedures in return for increased safety. ②The crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, which terrorists may have downed over the Mediterranean Sea, provides another tragic reminder of why. ③But demanding too much of air travelers or providing too little security in return undermines public support for the process. ④And it should: Wasted time is a drag on Americans' economic and private lives, not to mention infuriating.
①Last year, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found in a secret check that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons—both fake and real—past airport security nearly every time they tried. ②Enhanced security measures since then, combined with a rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, have resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago’s O’Hare International. ③It is not yet clear how much more effective airline security has become—but the lines are obvious.
①Part of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the steep increase in airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. ②Part of the issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. ③Another factor may be that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, though the airlines strongly dispute this.
①There is one step the TSA could take that would not require remodeling airports or rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the PreCheck program. ②PreCheck is supposed to be a win-win for travelers and the TSA. ③Passengers who pass a background check are eligible to use expedited screening lanes. ④This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. ⑤The TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in PreCheck.
①It has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is sticker shock: Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. ②Since the beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck's fatal flaw. ③Upcoming reforms might bring the price to a more reasonable level. ④But Congress should look into doing so directly, by helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut costs in other ways.
①The TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck lanes while most of the traveling public suffers in unnecessary lines. ②It is long past time to make the program work.
21. The crash of EgyptAir Flight 804 is mentioned to
[A] stress the urgency to strengthen security worldwide.
[B] explain Americans’ tolerance of current security checks. 
[C] highlight the necessity of upgrading major U.S. airports.
[D] emphasize the importance of privacy protection.
22. Which of the following contributes to long waits at major airports?
[A] New restrictions on carry-on bags.
[B] The declining efficiency of the TSA.
[C] An increase in the number of travelers.
[D] Frequent unexpected secret checks.
23. The word “expedited” (Para. 5) is closest in meaning to
[A] quieter.            [B] faster.
[C] wider.             [D] cheaper.
24. One problem with the PreCheck program is
[A] a dramatic reduction of its scale.
[B] its wrongly-directed implementation.
[C] the government’s reluctance to back it.
[D] an unreasonable price for enrollment.
25. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

①“The ancient Hawaiians were astronomers,” wrote Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last reigning monarch, in 1897. ②Star watchers were among the most esteemed members of Hawaiian society. ③Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. ④Protests have erupted over construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), a giant observatory that promises to revolutionize humanity’s view of the cosmos.
①At issue is the TMT’s planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano worshiped by some Hawaiians as the piko, that connects the Hawaiian Islands to the heavens. ②But Mauna Kea is also home to some of the world’s most powerful telescopes. ③Rested in the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea’s peak rises above the bulk of our planet’s dense atmosphere, where conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of unsurpassed clarity. 
①Opposition to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. ②A small but vocal group of Hawaiians and environmentalists have long viewed their presence as disrespect for sacred land and a painful reminder of the occupation of what was once a sovereign nation. 
①Some blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. ②In their eagerness to build bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is not the only way of understanding the world. ③They did not always prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea’s fragile ecosystems or its holiness to the islands’ inhabitants. ④Hawaiian culture is not a relic of the past; it is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today.
①Yet science has a cultural history, too, with roots going back to the dawn of civilization. ②The same curiosity to find what lies beyond the horizon that first brought early Polynesians to Hawaii’s shores inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. ③Calls to disassemble all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban future development there ignore the reality that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both seek to answer big questions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going. ④Perhaps that is why we explore the starry skies, as if answering a primal calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral homes. 
①The astronomy community is making compromises to change its use of Mauna Kea. ②The TMT site was chosen to minimize the telescope’s visibility around the island and to avoid archaeological and environmental impact. ③To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites returned to a natural state. ④There is no reason why everyone cannot be welcomed on Mauna Kea to embrace their cultural heritage and to study the stars.
26. Queen Liliuokalani’s remark in Paragraph 1 indicates
[A] the importance of astronomy in ancient Hawaiian society.
[B] her conservative view on the historical role of astronomy.
[C] the regrettable decline of astronomy in ancient times.
[D] her appreciation of star watchers’ feats in her time.
27. Mauna Kea is deemed as an ideal astronomical site due to
[A] its religious implications.
[B] its protective surroundings.
[C] its geographical features. 
[D] its existing infrastructure.
28. The construction of the TMT is opposed by some locals partly because
[A] it may risk ruining their intellectual life.
[B] they fear losing control of Mauna Kea.
[C] their culture will lose a chance of revival.
[D] it reminds them of a humiliating history.
29. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that progress in today’s astronomy  
[A] is fulfilling the dreams of ancient Hawaiians.
[B] helps spread Hawaiian culture across the world.
[C] may uncover the origin of Hawaiian culture.
[D] will eventually soften Hawaiians’ hostility.

①Robert F. Kennedy once said that a country’s GDP measures “everything except that which makes life worthwhile.” ②With Britain voting to leave the European Union, and GDP already predicted to slow as a result, it is now a timely moment to assess what he was referring to.
①The question of GDP and its usefulness has annoyed policymakers for over half a century. Many argue that it is a flawed concept. ②It measures things that do not matter and misses things that do. ③By most recent measures, the UK’s GDP has been the envy of the Western world, with record low unemployment and high growth figures. ④If everything was going so well, then why did over 17 million people vote for Brexit, despite the warnings about what it could do to their country’s economic prospects? 
①A recent annual study of countries and their ability to convert growth into well-being sheds some light on that question. ②Across the 163 countries measured, the UK is one of the poorest performers in ensuring that economic growth is translated into meaningful improvements for its citizens. ③Rather than just focusing on GDP, over 40 different sets of criteria from health, education and civil society engagement have been measured to get a more rounded assessment of how countries are performing.
①While all of these countries face their own challenges, there are a number of consistent themes. ②Yes, there has been a budding economic recovery since the 2008 global crash, but in key indicators in areas such as health and education, major economies have continued to decline. ③Yet this isn’t the case with all countries. ④Some relatively poor European countries have seen huge improvements across measures including civil society, income equality and the environment. 
①This is a lesson that rich countries can learn: When GDP is no longer regarded as the sole measure of a country’s success, the world looks very different.
①So, what Kennedy was referring to was that while GDP has been the most common method for measuring the economic activity of nations, as a measure, it is no longer enough. ②It does not include important factors such as environmental quality or education outcomes—all things that contribute to a person’s sense of well-being.
①The sharp hit to growth predicted around the world and in the UK could lead to a decline in the everyday services we depend on for our well-being and for growth. ②But policymakers who refocus efforts on improving well-being rather than simply worrying about GDP figures could avoid the forecasted doom and may even see progress.
31. Robert F. Kennedy is cited because he
[A] praised the UK for its GDP.
[B] identified GDP with happiness.
[C] misinterpreted the role of GDP.
[D] had a low opinion of GDP.
32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that

    [B] policymakers in the UK are paying less attention to GDP.
[C] the UK will contribute less to the world economy.
[D] the UK is reluctant to remold its economic pattern.
33. Which of the following is true about the recent annual study?
[A] It excludes GDP as an indicator.
[B] It is sponsored by 163 countries.
[C] Its criteria are questionable.
[D] Its results are enlightening.
34. In the last two paragraphs, the author suggests that
[A] the UK is preparing for an economic boom.
[B] it is essential to consider factors beyond GDP.
[C] high GDP foreshadows an economic decline. 
[D] it requires caution to handle economic issues.

①In a rare unanimous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the corruption conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. ②But it did so while holding its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which included accepting gifts such as a Rolex watch and a Ferrari automobile from a company seeking access to government.
①The high court’s decision said the judge in Mr. McDonnell’s trial failed to tell a jury that it must look only at his “official acts,” or the former governor’s decisions on “specific” and “unsettled” issues related to his duties. 
①Merely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless done with clear intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, the justices found.
①The court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening doors is “distasteful” and “nasty.” ②But under anti-bribery laws, proof must be made of concrete benefits, such as approval of a contract or regulation. ③Simply arranging a meeting, making a phone call, or hosting an event is not an “official act.”
①The court’s ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of favoritism that is not criminal. ②Elected leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with bureaucratic problems without fear of prosecution of bribery. “The basic compact underlying representative government,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the court, “assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act on their concerns.”
①But the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected representatives, not the courts, to ensure equality of access to government. ②Officials must not be allowed to play favorites in providing information or in arranging meetings simply because an individual or group provides a campaign donation or a personal gift. ③This type of integrity requires well-enforced laws in government transparency, such as records of official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information about each elected leader’s source of wealth.
①Favoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of corruption. ②But it is not always corruption. ③Rather officials must avoid double standards, or different types of access for average people and the wealthy. ④If connections can be bought, a basic premise of democratic society—that all are equal in treatment by government—is undermined. ⑤Good governance rests on an understanding of the inherent worth of each individual.
①The court’s ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both corruption and official favoritism.
36. The underlined sentence (Para. 1) most probably shows that the court
[A] made no compromise in convicting McDonnell.
    [B] avoided defining the extent of McDonnell’s duties.
[C] was contemptuous of McDonnell’s conduct.
[D] refused to comment on McDonnell’s ethics.
37. According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive only if it involves
[A] concrete returns for gift-givers.
[B] sizable gains in the form of gifts.
[C] leaking secrets intentionally.
[D] breaking contracts officially.
38. The court’s ruling is based on the assumption that public officials are
[A] allowed to focus on the concerns of their supporters.
[B] qualified to deal independently with bureaucratic issues.
[C] justified in addressing the needs of their constituents.
[D] exempt from conviction on the charge of favoritism.
39. Well-enforced laws in government transparency are needed to
[A] awaken the conscience of officials.
[B] allow for certain kinds of lobbying.
    [C] guarantee fair play in official access.
[D] inspire hopes in average people.
40. The author’s attitude toward the court’s ruling is
[A] sarcastic.            [B] tolerant.
[C] skeptical.            [D] supportive.

A. The first published sketch, “A Dinner at Poplar Walk” brought tears to Dickens’s eyes when he discovered it in the pages of The Monthly Magazine. From then on his sketches, which appeared under the pen name “Boz” in The Evening Chronicle, earned him a modest reputation.
B. The runaway success of The Pickwick Papers, as it is generally known today, secured Dickens’s fame. There were Pickwick coats and Pickwick cigars, and the plump, spectacled hero, Samuel Pickwick, became a national figure.
C. Soon after Sketches by Boz appeared, a publishing firm approached Dickens to write a story in monthly installments, as a backdrop for a series of woodcuts by the then-famous artist Robert Seymour, who had originated the idea for the story. With characteristic confidence, Dickens successfully insisted that Seymour’s pictures illustrate his own story instead. After the first installment, Dickens wrote to the artist and asked him to correct a drawing Dickens felt was not faithful enough to his prose. Seymour made the change, went into his backyard, and expressed his displeasure by committing suicide. Dickens and his publishers simply pressed on with a new artist. The comic novel, The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, appeared serially in 1836 and 1837 and was first published in book form in 1837. 
D. Charles Dickens is probably the best-known and, to many people, the greatest English novelist of the 19th century. A moralist, satirist, and social reformer, Dickens crafted complex plots and striking characters that capture the panorama of English society.
E. Soon after his father’s release from prison, Dickens got a better job as errand boy in law offices. He taught himself shorthand to get an even better job later as a court stenographer and as a reporter in Parliament. At the same time, Dickens, who had a reporter’s eye for transcribing the life around him, especially anything comic or odd, submitted short sketches to obscure magazines.
F. Dickens was born in Portsmouth, on England’s southern coast. His father was a clerk in the British Navy pay office—a respectable position, but with little social status. His paternal grandparents, a steward and a housekeeper, possessed even less status, having been servants, and Dickens later concealed their background. Dicken’s mother supposedly came from a more respectable family. Yet two years before Dicken’s birth, his mother’s father was caught stealing and fled to Europe, never to return. The family’s increasing poverty forced Dickens out of school at age 12 to work in Warren’s Blacking Warehouse, a shoe-polish factory, where the other working boys mocked him as “the young gentleman.” His father was then imprisoned for debt. The humiliations of his father’s imprisonment and his labor in the blacking factory formed Dickens’s greatest wound and became his deepest secret. He could not confide them even to his wife, although they provide the unacknowledged foundation of his fiction. 
G. After Pickwick, Dickens plunged into a bleaker world. In Oliver Twist, he traces an orphan’s progress from the workhouse to the criminal slums of London. Nicholas Nickleby, his next novel, combines the darkness of Oliver Twist with the sunlight of Pickwick. The popularity of these novels consolidated Dickens’ as a nationally and internationally celebrated man of letters.

The growth of the use of English as the world’s primary language for international communication has obviously been continuing for several decades. (46) But even as the number of English speakers expands further there are signs that the global predominance of the language may fade within the foreseeable future. 
    Complex international, economic, technological and cultural changes could start to diminish the leading position of English as the language of the world market, and UK interests which enjoy advantage from the breadth of English usage would consequently face new pressures. Those realistic possibilities are highlighted in the study presented by David Graddol. (47) His analysis should therefore end any self-contentedness among those who may believe that the global position of English is so stable that the young generations of the United Kingdom do not need additional language capabilities.
    David Graddol concludes that monoglot English graduates face a bleak economic future as qualified multilingual youngsters from other countries are proving to have a competitive advantage over their British counterparts in global companies and organisations. Alongside that, (48) many countries are introducing English into the primary-school curriculum but British schoolchildren and students do not appear to be gaining greater encouragement to achieve fluency in other languages. 
If left to themselves, such trends will diminish the relative strength of the English language in international education markets as the demand for educational resources in languages, such as Spanish, Arabic or Mandarin grows and international business process outsourcing in other languages such as Japanese, French and German, spreads. 
(49) The changes identified by David Graddol all present clear and major challenges to the UK’s providers of English language teaching to people of other countries and to broader education business sectors. The English language teaching sector directly earns nearly £1.3 billion for the UK in invisible exports and our other education related exports earn up to £10 billion a year more. As the international education market expands, the recent slowdown in the numbers of international students studying in the main English-speaking countries is likely to continue, especially if there are no effective strategic policies to prevent such slippage. 
The anticipation of possible shifts in demand provided by this study is significant: (50) It gives a basis for all organisations which seek to promote the learning and use of English, a basis for planning to meet the possibilities of what could be a very different operating environment. That is a necessary and practical approach. In this as in much else, those who wish to influence the future must prepare for it.

①France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. ②Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on runways. ③The parliament also agreed to ban websites that “incite excessive thinness” by promoting extreme dieting.
①Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. ②They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. ③That’s a start. ④And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death—as some have done. ⑤It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth.
①The bans, if fully enforced, would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. ②And perhaps faintly, they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques.
①The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep—and bone-showing. ②Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison.
①The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment and idealized body types. ②In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement.
①In contrast to France’s actions, Denmark’s fashion industry agreed last month on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. ②The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: “We are aware of and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young people.” ③The charter’s main tool of enforcement is to deny access for designers and modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion Institute. ④But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of compliance.
①Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse of body ideals may be the best step. ②Even better would be to help elevate notions of beauty beyond the material standards of a particular industry.
21. According to the first paragraph, what would happen in France?
A. Physical beauty would be redefined.
B. New runways would be constructed.
C. Websites about dieting would thrive.
D. The fashion industry would decline.
22. The phrase “impinging on” (Para. 2) is closest in meaning to
A. indicating the state of.
B. heightening the value of.
C. losing faith in.
D. doing harm to.

A. The French measures have already failed.
B. New standards are being set in Denmark.
C. Models are no longer under peer pressure.
D. Its inherent problems are getting worse.
24. A designer is most likely to be rejected by CFW for
A. pursuing perfect physical conditions.
B. caring too much about models’ character.
C. showing little concern for health factors.

①For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country. ②In Britain this has had a curious result. ③While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support.
①A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” ②It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” ③Hill’s pressure later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. ④They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. ⑤It needs constant guardianship.
①At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. ②The Conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation, even authorising “off-plan” building where local people might object. ③The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. ④Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. ⑤The Liberal Democrats are silent. ⑥Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. ⑦Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Conservative parties.
①The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. ②The London agents Stirling Ackroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the Landon area alone, with no intrusion on green belt. ③What is true of London is even truer of the provinces.
①The idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. ②The issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. ③Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. ④He favours out-of-town shopping sites against high streets. ⑤This is not a free market but a biased one. ⑥Rural towns and villages have grown and will always grow. ⑦They do so best where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. ⑧We do not ruin urban conservation areas. ⑨Why ruin rural ones?
①Development should be planned, not let rip. ②After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. ③Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. ④There is no doubt of the alternative—the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. ⑤Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum.
26. Britain’s public sentiment about the countryside

①“There is one and only one social responsibility of business,” wrote Milton Friedman, a Nobel prize-winning economist, “That is, to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.” ②But even if you accept Friedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders’ money, things may not be absolutely clear-cut. ③New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for companies—at least when they are prosecuted for corruption.
①The largest firms in America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on CSR, according to an estimate by EPG, a consulting firm. ②This could add value to their businesses in three ways. ③First, consumers may take CSR spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality. ④Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes it helps. ⑤And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others.
①Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers can be affected by all three. ②A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). ③It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company’s products as part of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo effect.
①The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensive CSR programmes tended to get more lenient penalties. ②Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms’ political influence, rather than their CSR stand, that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines.
①In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seem to be influenced by a company’s record in CSR. ②“We estimate that either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials,” says one researcher.
①Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. ②Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the other possible benefits, when they decide their do-gooding policies. ③But at least they have demonstrated that when companies get into trouble with the law, evidence of good character can win them a less costly punishment.
31. The author views Milton Friedman’s statement about CSR with
A. uncertainty.
B. skepticism.
C. approval.
D. tolerance.
32. According to Paragraph 2, CSR helps a company by
A. guarding it against malpractices.
B. protecting it from being defamed.

D. raising the quality of its products.
33. The expression “more lenient” (Para. 4) is closest in meaning to

B. more lasting.
C. more effective.
D. less severe.
34. When prosecutors evaluate a case, a company’s CSR record
A. comes across as reliable evidence.
B. has an impact on their decision.
C. increases the chance of being penalized.
D. constitutes part of the investigation.
35. Which of the following is true of CSR, according to the last paragraph?

①There will eventually come a day when The New York Times ceases to publish stories on newsprint. ②Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. ③“Sometime in the future,” the paper’s publisher said back in 2010.
①Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside, there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print. ②The infrastructure required to make a physical newspaper—printing presses, delivery trucks —isn’t just expensive; it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don’t have the same set of financial constraints. ③Readers are migrating away from print anyway. ④And though print ad sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts, revenue from print is still declining.
①Overhead may be high and circulation lower, but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake, says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti.
①Peretti says the Times shouldn’t waste time getting out of the print business, but only if they go about doing it the right way. ②“Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them,” he said, “but if you discontinue it, you’re going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you.”
①Sometimes that’s worth making a change anyway. ②Peretti gives the example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. ③“It was seen as a blunder,” he said. ④The move turned out to be foresighted. ⑤And if Peretti were in charge at the Times? ⑥“I wouldn’t pick a year to end print,” he said. “I would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product.”
①The most loyal customers would still get the product they favor, the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. ②“So if you’re overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping,” Peretti said.③ “Then increase it at a higher rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue.” ④In other words, if you’re going to make a print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with it. ⑤Which may be what the Times is doing already. ⑥Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year—more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.
①“It’s a really hard thing to do and it’s a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn’t have a legacy business,” Peretti remarked. ②“But we’re going to have questions like that where we have things we’re doing that don’t make sense when the market changes and the world changes. ③In those situations, it’s better to be more aggressive than less aggressive.”
36. The New York Times is considering ending its print edition partly due to
A. the increasing online ad sales.
B. the pressure from its investors.
C. the complaints from its readers.
D. the high cost of operation.
37. Peretti suggests that, in face of the present situation, the Times should
A. make strategic adjustments.
B. end the print edition for good.
C. seek new sources of readership.
D. aim for efficient management.
38. It can be inferred from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that a “legacy product”
A. helps restore the glory of former times.
B. is meant for the most loyal customers.
C. will have the cost of printing reduced.
D. expands the popularity of the paper.
39. Peretti believes that, in a changing world,
A. traditional luxuries can stay unaffected.
B. cautiousness facilitates problem-solving.
C. aggressiveness better meets challenges.
D. legacy businesses are becoming outdated.

A. Create a new image of yourself
B. Decide if the time is right
C. Have confidence in yourself 
D. Understand the context
E. Work with professionals
F. Make it efficient 
G. Know your goals
No matter how formal or informal the work environment, the way you present yourself has an impact. This is especially true in the first impressions. According to research from Princeton University, people assess your competence, trustworthiness, and likeability in just a tenth of a second, solely based on the way you look.
The difference between today’s workplace and the “dress for success” era is that the range of options is so much broader. Norms have evolved and fragmented. In some settings, red sneakers or dress T-shirts can convey status; in others not so much. Plus, whatever image we present is magnified by social-media services like LinkedIn. Chances are, your headshots are seen much more often now than a decade or two ago. Millennials, it seems, face the paradox of being the least formal generation yet the most conscious of style and personal branding. It can be confusing.
So how do we navigate this? How do we know when to invest in an upgrade? And what’s the best way to pull off one that enhances our goals?
Here are some tips:
41.	
As an executive coach, I’ve seen image upgrades be particularly helpful during transitions—when looking for a new job, stepping into a new or more public role, or changing work environments. If you’re in a period of change or just feeling stuck and in a rut, now may be a good time. If you’re not sure, ask for honest feedback from trusted friends, colleagues and professionals. Look for cues about how others perceive you. Maybe there’s no need for an upgrade and that’s OK.
42.	
Get clear on what impact you’re hoping to have. Are you looking to refresh your image or pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be taken more seriously and enhance their professional image. For another, it may be to be perceived as more approachable, or more modern and stylish. For someone moving from finance to advertising, maybe they want to look more “SoHo.” (It’s OK to use characterizations like that.)
43.	
Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the norms of your environment? What conveys status? Who are your most important audiences? How do the people you respect and look up to present themselves? The better you understand the cultural context, the more control you can have over your impact.
44.	
Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals and context. Hire a personal stylist, or use the free styling service of a store like J. Crew. Try a hair stylist instead of a barber. Work with a professional photographer instead of your spouse or friend. It’s not as expensive as you might think.
45.	
The point of a style upgrade isn’t to become more vain or to spend more time fussing over what to wear. Instead, use it as an opportunity to reduce decision fatigue. Pick a standard work uniform or a few go-to options. Buy all your clothes at once with a stylist instead of shopping alone, one article of clothing at a time.

Mental health is our birthright. (46) We don’t have to learn how to be mentally healthy; it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone. Mental health can’t be learned, only reawakened. It is like the immune system of the body, which under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, but which never leaves us. When we don’t understand the value of mental health and we don’t know how to gain access to it, mental health will remain hidden from us. (47) Our mental health doesn’t really go anywhere; like the sun behind a cloud, it can be temporarily hidden from view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant.
Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem—confidence in ourselves and an ability to trust in our common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives—the ability to not take ourselves too seriously, to laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger picture, and to see that things will work out. It’s a form of innate or unlearned optimism. (48) Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles, with kindness if they are in pain, and with unconditional love no matter who they are. Mental health is the source of creativity for solving problems, resolving conflict, making our surroundings more beautiful, managing our home life, or coming up with a creative business idea or invention to make our lives easier. It gives us patience for ourselves and toward others as well as patience while driving, catching a fish, working on our car, or raising a child. It allows us to see the beauty that surrounds us each moment in nature, in culture, in the flow of our daily lives.
(49) Although mental health is the cure-all for living our lives, it is perfectly ordinary as you will see that it has been there to direct you through all your difficult decisions. It has been available even in the most mundane of life situations to show you right from wrong, good from bad, friend from foe. Mental health has commonly been called conscience, instinct, wisdom, common sense, or the inner voice. We think of it simply as a healthy and helpful flow of intelligent thought. (50) As you will come to see, knowing that mental health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us to slow down to the moment and live life happily.

①Though not biologically related, friends are as “related” as fourth cousins, sharing about 1% of genes. ②That is   1   a study, published from the University of California and Yale University in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has   2  .
①The study is a genome-wide analysis conducted   3   1,932 unique subjects which   4   pairs of unrelated friends and unrelated strangers. ②The same people were used in both   5  .
①While 1% may seem   6  , it is not so to a geneticist. ②As James Fowler, professor of medical genetics at UC San Diego, says, “Most people do not even   7   their fourth cousins but somehow manage to select as friends the people who   8   our kin.”
①The study   9   found that the genes for smell were something shared in friends but not genes for immunity. ②Why this similarity exists in smell genes is difficult to explain, for now.   10  , as the team suggests, it draws us to similar environments but there is more   11   it. ③There could be many mechanisms working together that   12   us in choosing genetically similar friends   13   “functional kinship” of being friends with   14  !
①One of the remarkable findings of the study was that the similar genes seem to be evolving   15   than other genes. ②Studying this could help   16   why human evolution picked pace in the last 30,000 years, with social environment being a major   17   factor.
①The findings do not simply explain people’s   18   to befriend those of similar   19   backgrounds, say the researchers. ②Though all the subjects were drawn from a population of European extraction, care was taken to   20   that all subjects, friends and strangers, were taken from the same population.

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET. (40 points)
Text 1
①King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted “kings don’t abdicate, they die in their sleep.” ②But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. ③So, does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? ④Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles?
①The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. ②When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above “mere” politics and “embody” a spirit of national unity.
①It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs’ continuing popularity as heads of state. ②And so, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). ③But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.
①Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. ②Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history—and sometimes the way they behave today—embodies outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. ③At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. 
①The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. ②Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). ③Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.
①While Europe’s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.
①It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy’s reputation with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. ②The danger will come with Charles, who has both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. ③He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service—as non-controversial and non-political heads of state. ④Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy’s worst enemies.
21. According to the first two paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain
［A］used to enjoy high public support.
［B］was unpopular among European royals.

①Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? ②The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.
①California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling, particularly one that upsets the old assumption that authorities may search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. ②It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.
①The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California’s advice. ②Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justices can and should provide updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.
①They should start by discarding California’s lame argument that exploring the contents of a smartphone—a vast storehouse of digital information—is similar to, say, going through a suspect’s purse. ②The court has ruled that police don’t violate the Fourth Amendment when they go through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a warrant. ③But exploring one’s smartphone is more like entering his or her home. ④A smartphone may contain an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. ⑤The development of “cloud computing,” meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.
①Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. ②But keeping sensitive information on these devices is increasingly a requirement of normal life. ③Citizens still have a right to expect private documents to remain private and protected by the Constitution’s prohibition on unreasonable searches.
①As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn’t ease the challenge of line-drawing. ②In many cases, it would not be overly burdensome for authorities to obtain a warrant to search through phone contents. ③They could still invalidate Fourth Amendment protections when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they could take reasonable measures to ensure that phone data are not erased or altered while waiting for a warrant. ④The court, though, may want to allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to more freedom.
①But the justices should not swallow California’s argument whole. ②New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protections. ③Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now.
26. The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to
［A］search for suspects’ mobile phones without a warrant.
［B］check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized. 
［C］prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.
［D］prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.
27. The author’s attitude toward California’s argument is one of
［A］tolerance.                 ［B］indifference.
［C］disapproval.               ［D］cautiousness.
28. The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to
［A］getting into one’s residence.
［B］handling one’s historical records.
［C］scanning one’s correspondences.
［D］going through one’s wallet.
29. In Paragraphs 5 and 6, the author shows his concern that
［A］principles are hard to be clearly expressed.
［B］the court is giving police less room for action.
［C］phones are used to store sensitive information. 
［D］citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected.
30. Orin Kerr’s comparison is quoted to indicate that
［A］the Constitution should be implemented flexibly.
［B］new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution.
［C］California’s argument violates principles of the Constitution.
［D］principles of the Constitution should never be altered.

①The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced today. ②The policy follows similar efforts from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are contributing to the irreproducibility of many published research findings.
①“Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal,” writes McNutt in an editorial. ②Working with the American Statistical Association, the journal has appointed seven experts to a statistics board of reviewing editors (SBoRE). ③Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, or by its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. ④The SBoRE panel will then find external statisticians to review these manuscripts.
①Asked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ was motivated by concerns broadly with the application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research and is part of Science’s overall drive to increase reproducibility in the research we publish.”
①Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group, says he expects the board to “play primarily an advisory role.” ②He agreed to join because he “found the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE to be novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. ③This impact will not only be through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science.”
①John Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says that the policy is “a most welcome step forward” and “long overdue.” ②“Most journals are weak in statistical review, and this damages the quality of what they publish. ③I think that, for the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than expert review,” he says. ④But he noted that biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet pay strong attention to statistical review.
①Professional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, but statistical errors are alarmingly common in published research, according to David Vaux, a cell biologist. ②Researchers should improve their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals should also take a tougher line, “engaging reviewers who are statistically literate and editors who can verify the process.” ③Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the papers that need scrutiny’ in the first place.”
31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 that
［A］Science intends to simplify its peer-review process.
［B］journals are strengthening their statistical checks.
［C］few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis.
［D］lack of data analysis is common in research projects.
32. The phrase “flagged up” (Para. 2) is the closest in meaning to
［A］found.                       ［B］revised.    
［C］marked.                      ［D］stored.
33. Giovanni Parmigiani believes that the establishment of the SBoRE may
［A］pose a threat to all its peers.
［B］meet with strong opposition.
［C］increase Science’s circulation.
［D］set an example for other journals.
34. David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now
［A］adds to researchers’ workload.
［B］diminishes the role of reviewers.
［C］has room for further improvement.
［D］is to fail in the foreseeable future.
35. Which of the following is the best title of the text?
［A］Science Joins Push to Screen Statistics in Papers.
［B］Professional Statisticians Deserve More Respect.
［C］Data Analysis Finds Its Way onto Editors’ Desks.
［D］Statisticians Are Coming Back with Science
Text 4
①Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter, Elisabeth, spoke of the “unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions.” ②Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a collective acceptance that the only “sorting mechanism” in society should be profit and the market. ③But “it’s us, human beings, we the people who create the society we want, not profit.”
①Driving her point home, she continued: “It’s increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose, of a moral language within government, media or business could become one of the most dangerous goals for capitalism and freedom.” ②This same absence of moral purpose was wounding companies such as News International, she thought, making it more likely that it would lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking.
①As the hacking trial concludes—finding guilty one ex-editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones, and finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, innocent of the same charge—the wider issue of dearth of integrity still stands. ②Journalists are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people. ③This is hacking on an industrial scale, as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, the man hired by the News of the World in 2001 to be the point person for phone hacking. ④Others await trial. ⑤This long story still unfolds.
①In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the fact of such widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial took place. ②One of the astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah Brooks knew of what went on in her newsroom, how little she thought to ask and the fact that she never inquired how the stories arrived. ③The core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing.
①In today’s world, it has become normal that well-paid executives should not be accountable for what happens in the organisations that they run. ②Perhaps we should not be so surprised. ③For a generation, the collective doctrine has been that the sorting mechanism of society should be profit. ④The words that have mattered are efficiency, flexibility, shareholder value, business-friendly, wealth generation, sales, impact and, in newspapers, circulation. ⑤Words degraded to the margin have been justice, fairness, tolerance, proportionality and accountability.
①The purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote reader understanding, to be fair in what was written or to betray any common humanity. ②It was to ruin lives in the quest for circulation and impact. ③Ms Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how her journalists got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions—nor received traceable, recorded answers.
36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by
［A］the consequences of the current sorting mechanism.
［B］companies’ financial loss due to immoral practices.
［C］governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues.
［D］the wide misuse of integrity among institutions.
37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that
［A］Glenn Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime.
［B］phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions. 
［C］Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge.
［D］more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking.
38. The author believes that Rebekah Brooks’s defence
［A］revealed a cunning personality.       ［B］centered on trivial issues.
［C］was hardly convincing.             ［D］was part of a conspiracy.
39. The author holds that the current collective doctrine shows
［A］generally distorted values.          ［B］unfair wealth distribution.
［C］a marginalized lifestyle.            ［D］a rigid moral code.
40. Which of the following is suggested in the last paragraph?
［A］The quality of writings is of primary importance.
［B］Moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper.
［C］Common humanity is central to news reporting.
［D］Journalists need stricter industrial regulations.

In the following text, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable one from the list A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. There are two extra choices, which do not fit in any of the blanks. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET. (10 points)
How does your reading proceed? Clearly you try to comprehend, in the sense of identifying meanings for individual words and working out relationships between them, drawing on your implicit knowledge of English grammar. (41) ________ You begin to infer a context for the text, for instance, by making decisions about what kind of speech event is involved: Who is making the utterance, to whom, when and where.
The ways of reading indicated here are without doubt kinds of comprehension. But they show comprehension to consist not just of passive assimilation but of active engagement in inference and problem-solving. You infer information you feel the writer has invited you to grasp by presenting you with specific evidence and clues. (42) ________
Conceived in this way, comprehension will not follow exactly the same track for each reader. What is in question is not the retrieval of an absolute, fixed or “true” meaning that can be read off and checked for accuracy, or some timeless relation of the text to the world. (43) ________
Such background material inevitably reflects who we are. (44) ________This doesn’t, however, make interpretation merely relative or even pointless. Precisely because readers from different historical periods, places and social experiences produce different but overlapping readings of the same words on the page—including for texts that engage with fundamental human concerns—debates about texts can play an important role in social discussion of beliefs and values. 
How we read a given text also depends to some extent on our particular interest in reading it. (45) ________ Such dimensions of reading suggest—as others introduced later in the book will also do—that we bring an implicit (often unacknowledged) agenda to any act of reading. It doesn’t then necessarily follow that one kind of reading is fuller, more advanced or more worthwhile than another. Ideally, different kinds of reading inform each other, and act as useful reference points for and counterbalances to one another. Together, they make up the reading component of your overall literacy, or relationship to your surrounding textual environment.
[A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond in a way that fulfils the requirement of a given course? Reading it simply for pleasure? Skimming it for information? Ways of reading on a train or in bed are likely to differ considerably from reading in a seminar room. 
[B] Factors such as the place and period in which we are reading, our gender, ethnicity, age and social class will encourage us towards certain interpretations but at the same time obscure or even close off others. 
[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms, you guess at their meaning, using clues presented in the context. On the assumption that they will become relevant later, you make a mental note of discourse entities as well as possible links between them.
[D] In effect, you try to reconstruct the likely meanings or effects that any given sentence, image or reference might have had: These might be the ones the author intended. 
[E] You make further inferences, for instance, about how the text may be significant to you, or about its validity—inferences that form the basis of a personal response for which the author will inevitably be far less responsible. 
[F] In plays, novels and narrative poems, characters speak as constructs created by the author, not necessarily as mouthpieces for the author’s own thoughts. 
[G] Rather, we ascribe meanings to texts on the basis of interaction between what we might call textual and contextual material: between kinds of organization or patterning we perceive in a text’s formal structures (so especially its language structures) and various kinds of background, social knowledge, belief and attitude that we bring to the text.

Within the span of a hundred years, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a tide of emigration—one of the great folk wanderings of history—swept from Europe to America. (46) This movement, driven by powerful and diverse motivations, built a nation out of a wilderness and, by its nature, shaped the character and destiny of an uncharted continent.
(47) The United States is the product of two principal forces—the immigration of European peoples with their varied ideas, customs, and national characteristics and the impact of a new country which modified these traits. Of necessity, colonial America was a projection of Europe. Across the Atlantic came successive groups of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Scots, Irishmen, Dutchmen, Swedes, and many others who attempted to transplant their habits and traditions to the new world. (48) But the force of geographic conditions peculiar to America, the interplay of the varied national groups upon one another, and the sheer difficulty of maintaining old-world ways in a raw, new continent caused significant changes. These changes were gradual and at first scarcely visible. But the result was a new social pattern which, although it resembled European society in many ways, had a character that was distinctly American.
(49) The first shiploads of immigrants bound for the territory which is now the United States crossed the Atlantic more than a hundred years after the 15th-and-16th-century explorations of North America. In the meantime, thriving Spanish colonies had been established in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. These travelers to North America came in small, unmercifully overcrowded craft. During their six- to twelve-week voyage, they survived on barely enough food allotted to them. Many of the ships were lost in storms, many passengers died of disease, and infants rarely survived the journey. Sometimes storms blew the vessels far off their course, and often calm brought unbearably long delay.
To the anxious travelers the sight of the American shore brought almost inexpressible relief. Said one recorder of events, "The air at twelve leagues' distance smelt as sweet as a new-blown garden." The colonists' first glimpse of the new land was a sight of dense woods. (50) The virgin forest with its richness and variety of trees was a real treasure-house which extended from Maine all the way down to Georgia. Here was abundant fuel and lumber. Here was the raw material of houses and furniture, ships and potash, dyes and naval stores.

①In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency,” George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search” scheme. ②Only if the jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit—and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. ③What could be more reasonable?
①More apparent reasonableness followed. ②There will now be a seven-day wait for the jobseeker’s allowance. ③“Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on,” he claimed. ④“We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster.” ⑤Help? ⑥Really? ⑦On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises laziness. ⑧What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness”—protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.
①Losing a job is hurting: you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. ②It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. ③You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. ④Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. ⑤Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job. 
①But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency—permanent dependency if you can get it—supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. ②It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. ③The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. ④Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no fundamental right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance contributions. ⑤Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ￡71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.
21. George Osborne’s scheme was intended to
[A] motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.
[B] provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.
[C] encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.
[D] guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.
22. The phrase “to sign on” (Para. 2) most probably means
[A] to register for an allowance from the government.
[B] to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.
[C] to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.
[D] to attend a governmental job-training program.
23. What promoted the chancellor to develop his scheme?
[A] A desire to secure a better life for all.
[B] An eagerness to protect the unemployed.
[C] An urge to be generous to the claimants.
[D] A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.
24. According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel
[A] insulted.
[B] uneasy.
[C] enraged.
[D] guilty.
25. To which of the following would the author most probably agree?
[A] Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.
[B] The British welfare system indulges jobseekers’ laziness.
[C] The jobseekers’ allowance has met their actual needs.
[D] Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.

①During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. ②The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools. ③But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. ④Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.
①There are many reasons for this. ②One is the excessive costs of a legal education. ③There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. ④This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. ⑤Law-school debt means that they have to work fearsomely hard.
①Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. ②Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them. ③One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate degree. ④Another is to let students sit for the bar after only two years of law school. ⑤If the bar exam is truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be allowed to do so. ⑥Students who do not need the extra training could cut their debt mountain by a third.
①The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure of the business. ②Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. ③This keeps fees high and innovation slow. ④There is pressure for change from within the profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.
①In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency. ②After all, other countries, such as Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions. ③America should follow.
26. A lot of students take up law as their profession due to
[A] the growing demand from clients.
[B] the increasing pressure of inflation.
[C] the prospect of working in big firms.
[D] the attraction of financial rewards.
27. Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?
[A] Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.
[B] Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.
[C] Admissions approval from the bar association.
[D] Receiving training by professional associations.
28. Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from
[A] non-professionals’ sharp criticism.
[B] lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.
[C] the rigid bodies governing the profession.
[D] the stern exam for would-be lawyers.
29. The guild-like ownership structure is considered “restrictive” partly because it
[A] prevents lawyers from gaining due profits.
[B] keeps lawyers from holding law-firm shares.
[C] aggravates the ethical situation in the trade.
[D] bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.
30. In this text, the author mainly discusses
[A] flawed ownership of America’s law firms and its causes.
[B] the factors that help make a successful lawyer in America.
[C] a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.
[D] the role of undergraduate studies in America’s legal education.

①The US $3-million Fundamental Physics Prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. ②And it is far from the only one of its type. ③As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. ④Many, like the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. ⑤These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.
①What’s not to like? ②Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News Feature. ③You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels. ④The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. ⑤They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led research. ⑥They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. ⑦They do not fund peer-reviewed research. ⑧They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.
①The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. ②Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers in research.
①As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science prizes—both new and old—are distributed. ②The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include. ③But the Nobel Foundation’s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research—as will be demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson. ④The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. ⑤Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.
①As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. ②First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. ③Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere. ④It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. ⑤It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.
31. The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as
[A] a symbol of the entrepreneurs’ wealth.
[B] a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes.
[C] a handsome reward for researchers. 
[D] an example of bankers’ investments.
32. The critics think that the new awards will most benefit
[A] the profit-oriented scientists.
[B] the founders of the awards.
[C] the achievement-based system.
[D] peer-review-led research.
33. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves
[A] the joint effort of modern researchers. 
[B] controversies over the recipients’ status.
[C] the demonstration of research findings.
[D] legitimate concerns over the new prizes.
34. According to Paragraph 4, which of the following is true of the Nobels?
[A] History has never cast doubt on them.
[B] They are the most representative honor.
[C] Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.
[D] Their endurance has done justice to them.
35. The author believes that the new awards are
[A] harmful to the culture of research.
[B] acceptable despite the criticism.
[C] subject to undesirable changes.
[D] unworthy of public attention.

①“The Heart of the Matter,” the just-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. ②Regrettably, however, the report’s failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good.
①In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by “federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others” to “maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education.” ②In response, the American Academy formed the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences. ③Among the commission’s 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism.
①The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. ②Because representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. ③To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students’ ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. ④The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.
   ①Unfortunately, despite 2½ years in the making, “The Heart of the Matter” never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. ②The commission ignores that for several decades America’s colleges and universities have produced graduates who don’t know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. ③Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing “progressive,” or left-liberal propaganda.
①Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas —such as free markets and self-reliance—as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.
①The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. ②Yet its report may well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to illuminate.
36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author’s attitude toward the AAAS’s report?
[A] Critical.            [B] Appreciative.
[C] Contemptuous.      [D] Tolerant.
37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to
[A] safeguard individuals’ rights to education.
[B] define the government’s role in education.
[C] retain people’s interest in liberal education.
[D] keep a leading position in liberal education.
38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests
[A] an exclusive study of American history.
[B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects.
[C] the application of emerging technologies.
[D] funding for the study of foreign languages.
39. The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are
[A] supportive of free markets.
[B] biased against classical liberal ideas.
[C] cautious about intellectual investigation.
[D] conservative about public policy.
40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
[A] Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”
[B] The AAAS’s Contribution to Liberal Education
[C] Ways to Grasp “The Heart of the Matter”
[D] Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education

[A] Some archaeological sites have always been easily observable—for example, the Parthenon in Athens, Greece; the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of Stonehenge in southern England. But these sites are exceptions to the norm. Most archaeological sites have been located by means of careful searching, while many others have been discovered by accident. Olduvai Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was found by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 1911. Thousands of Aztec artifacts came to light during the digging of the Mexico City subway in the 1970s. 
[B] In another case, American archaeologists René Million and George Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the entire city of Teotihuacán in the Valley of Mexico near what is now Mexico City. At its peak around AD 600, this city was one of the largest human settlements in the world. The researchers mapped not only the city’s vast and ornate ceremonial areas, but also hundreds of simpler apartment complexes where common people lived. 
[C] How do archaeologists know where to find what they are looking for when there is nothing visible on the surface of the ground? Typically, they survey and sample (make test excavations on) large areas of terrain to determine where excavation will yield useful information. Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding the larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites. 
[D] Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. In one case, many researchers working around the ancient Maya city of Copán, Honduras, have located hundreds of small rural villages and individual dwellings by using aerial photographs and by making surveys on foot. The resulting settlement maps show how the distribution and density of the rural population around the city changed dramatically between AD 500 and 850, when Copán collapsed. 
[E] To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on systematic survey methods and a variety of high-technology tools and techniques. Airborne technologies, such as different types of radar and photographic equipment carried by airplanes or spacecraft, allow archaeologists to learn about what lies beneath the ground without digging. Aerial surveys locate general areas of interest or larger buried features, such as ancient buildings or fields. 
[F] Most archaeological sites, however, are discovered by archaeologists who have set out to look for them. Such searches can take years. British archaeologist Howard Carter knew that the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other sites. Carter sifted through rubble in the Valley of the Kings for seven years before he located the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans combed antique dealers’ stores in Athens, Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals attributed to the ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated Greece from the 1400s to 1200s BC. Evans’s interpretations of these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan palace at Knossos (Knosós), on the island of Crete, in 1900. 
[G] Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where digs will be successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, looking for surface clues such as small fragments of pottery. They often include a certain amount of digging to test for buried materials at selected points across a landscape. Archaeologists also may locate buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, magnetic-field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use computers to map sites and the landscapes around sites. Two- and three-dimensional maps are helpful tools in planning excavations, illustrating how sites look, and presenting the results of archaeological research.

Music means different things to different people and sometimes even different things to the same person at different moments of his life. It might be poetic, philosophical, sensual, or mathematical, but in any case it must, in my view, have something to do with the soul of the human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is purely and exclusively physical: sound. I believe it is precisely this permanent coexistence of metaphysical message through physical means that is the strength of music. (46) It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself. 
Beethoven’s importance in music has been principally defined by the revolutionary nature of his compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of harmony and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to break all signs of continuity. The music is abrupt and seemingly disconnected, as in the last piano sonata. In musical expression, he did not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47) By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.
This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the performers of Beethoven’s music. His compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in the use of dynamics. (48) Beethoven’s habit of increasing the volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him.  
Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the word. He was not interested in daily politics, but concerned with questions of moral behavior and the larger questions of right and wrong affecting the entire society. (49) Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression. 
Beethoven’s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order were an imperative of human existence. For him, order does not result from forgetting or ignoring the disorders that plague our existence; order is a necessary development, an improvement that may lead to the Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral March is not the last movement of the Eroica Symphony, but the second, so that suffering does not have the last word. (50) One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

① In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, scolds her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her. ② Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the poor girl doubtless found her garment.
① This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or at odds with the feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of “fast fashion”. ② In the last decade or so, advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. ③ Quicker turnarounds mean less wasted inventory, more frequent releases, and more profit. ④ These labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable—meant to last only a wash or two, although they don’t advertise that—and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. ⑤ By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.
① The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. ② For H&M to offer a $5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2,300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amounts of harmful chemicals.
① Overdressed is the fashion world’s answer to consumer-activist bestsellers like Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma. ② “Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable and wasteful,” Cline argues. ③ Americans, she finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year—about 64 items per person—and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.
① Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Kate Beaumont, who since 2008 has made all of her own clothes—and beautifully. ② But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example can’t be knocked off.
① Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment—including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection line—Cline believes lasting change can only be effected by the customer. ② She exhibits the idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. ③ Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford not to.
21. Priestly criticizes her assistant for her
[A] lack of imagination.
[B] poor bargaining skill.
[C] obsession with high fashion.
[D] insensitivity to fashion.
22. According to Cline, mass-market labels urge consumers to
[A] combat unnecessary waste.
[B] shop for their garments more frequently.
[C] resist the influence of advertisements.
[D] shut out the feverish fashion world.
23. The word “indictment” (Para. 2) is closest in meaning to
[A] accusation.
[B] enthusiasm.
[C] indifference.
[D] tolerance.
24. Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph?
[A] Vanity has more often been found in idealists.
[B] The fast-fashion industry ignores sustainability.
[C] Pricing is vital to environment-friendly purchasing.
[D] People are more interested in unaffordable garments.
25. What is the subject of the text?
[A] Satire on an extravagant lifestyle.
[B] Challenge to a high-fashion myth.
[C] Criticism of the fast-fashion industry.
[D] Exposure of a mass-market secret.

① An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted—the trouble is, no one knows which half. ② In the internet age, at least in theory, this fraction can be much reduced. ③  By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim “behavioural” ads at those most likely to buy.
① In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?
① In December 2010 America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed adding a “do not track” (DNT) option to internet browsers, so that users could tell advertisers that they did not want to be followed. ② Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari both offer DNT; Google’s Chrome is due to do so this year. ③ In February the FTC and Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responding to DNT requests.
① On May 31st Microsoft set off the row. ② It said that Internet Explorer 10, the version due to appear with Windows 8, would have DNT as a default.
① Advertisers are horrified. ② Human nature being what it is, most people stick with default settings. ③ Few switch DNT on now, but if tracking is off it will stay off. ④ Bob Liodice, the chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, says consumers will be worse off if the industry cannot collect information about their preferences. ⑤ People will not get fewer ads, he says. ⑥ “They’ll get less meaningful, less targeted ads.”
① It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. ② Getting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. ③ Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.
① Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. ② After all, it has an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. ③ If it is trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on advertising, it has chosen an indirect method: There is no guarantee that DNT by default will become the norm. ④ DNT does not seem an obviously huge selling point for Windows 8—though the firm has compared some of its other products favorably with Google’s on that count before. ⑤ Brendon Lynch, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, blogged: “We believe consumers should have more control.” ⑥ Could it really be that simple?
26. It is suggested in Paragraph 1 that “behavioural” ads help advertisers to
[A] lower their operational costs.
[B] ease competition among themselves.
[C] avoid complaints from consumers.
[D] provide better online services.
27. “The industry” (Para.3) refers to

[D] internet browser developers.
28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default
[A] goes against human nature.
[B] fails to affect the ad industry.
[C] will not benefit consumers.
[D] may cut the number of junk ads.

[A] Advertisers are willing to implement DNT.
[B] DNT may not serve its intended purpose.
[C] DNT is losing its popularity among consumers.

① Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely—though by no means uniformly—glowingly positive. ② Science and technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives of fulfillment and opportunity for all.
① Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change. ② You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.
① But such gloominess is misplaced. ② The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years—so why shouldn’t we? ③ Take a broader look at our species’ place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years. ④ Look up Homo sapiens in the “Red List” of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) and you will read: “Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline.”
① So what does our deep future hold? ② A growing number of researchers and organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. ③ For example, the Long Now Foundation has as its flagship project a mechanical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years hence.
① Perhaps willfully, it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future. ② The potential evolution of today’s technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it’s perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. ③ That’s one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.
① But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assurance. ② As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants will find themselves.
① This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a passing fad. ② To be sure, the future is not all rosy. ③ But we are now knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.
31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by
[A] our desire for lives of fulfillment.
[B] our faith in science and technology.
[C] our awareness of potential risks.
[D] our belief in equal opportunity.
32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggests that human beings are

[C] the world’s dominant power.
[D] a threat to the environment.
33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?
[A] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.
[B] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.

①On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona’s immigration law Monday—a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. ②But on the more important matter of the Constitution, the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration’s effort to upset the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
①In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the four contested provisions of Arizona’s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal immigration law. ②The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization” and that federal laws precede state laws are noncontroversial. ③ Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel to the existing federal ones.
①Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court’s liberals, ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. ②On the overturned provisions the majority held that Congress had deliberately “occupied the field,” and Arizona had thus intruded on the federal’s privileged powers.
①However, the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal status of people who come in contact with law enforcement. ②That’s because Congress has always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.
①Two of the three objecting Justices—Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas—agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted with the federal statute. ②The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia, who offered an even more robust defense of state privileges going back to the Alien and Sedition Acts.
①The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes in his objection as “a shocking assertion of federal executive power”. ②The White House argued that Arizona’s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities, even if state laws complied with federal statutes to the letter. ③ In effect, the White House claimed that it could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with.
①Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of citizenship and the borders is among them. ②But if Congress wanted to prevent states from using their own resources to check immigration status, it could. ③ It never did so. ④ The Administration was in essence asserting that because it didn’t want to carry out Congress’s immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. ⑤ Every Justice rightly rejected this remarkable claim.
36. Three provisions of Arizona’s plan were overturned because they
[A] overstepped the authority of federal immigration law.
[B] disturbed the power balance between different states.
[C] deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers.
[D] contradicted both the federal and state policies.
37. On which of the following did the Justices agree, according to Paragraph 4?
[A] States’ independence from federal immigration law.
[B] Federal officers’ duty to withhold immigrants’ information.
[C] States’ legitimate role in immigration enforcement.
[D] Congress’s intervention in immigration enforcement.
38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition Acts
[A] violated the Constitution.
[B] stood in favor of the states.
[C] supported the federal statute.
[D] undermined the states’ interests.
39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement
[A] outweighs that held by the states.
[B] is established by federal statutes.
[C] is dependent on the states’ support.
[D] rarely goes against state laws.
40. What can be learned from the last paragraph?
[A] Immigration issues are usually decided by Congress.
[B] The Administration is dominant over immigration issues.
[C] Justices wanted to strengthen its coordination with Congress.
[D] Justices intended to check the power of the Administration.

The social sciences are flourishing. As of 2005, there were almost half a million professional social scientists from all fields in the world, working both inside and outside academia. According to the World Social Science Report 2010, the number of social-science students worldwide has swollen by about 11% every year since 2000.
Yet this enormous resource is not contributing enough to today’s global challenges, including climate change, security, sustainable development and health. (41) ________ Humanity has the necessary agro-technological tools to eradicate hunger, from genetically engineered crops to artificial fertilizers. Here, too, the problems are social: the organization and distribution of food, wealth and prosperity. 
(42) ________This is a shame—the community should be grasping the opportunity to raise its influence in the real world. To paraphrase the great social scientist Joseph Schumpeter: there is no radical innovation without creative destruction. 
Today, the social sciences are largely focused on disciplinary problems and internal scholarly debates, rather than on topics with external impact. Analyses reveal that the number of papers including the keywords “environmental change” or “climate change” have increased rapidly since 2004. (43) ________
When social scientists do tackle practical issues, their scope is often local: Belgium is interested mainly in the effects of poverty on Belgium, for example. And whether the community’s work contributes much to an overall accumulation of knowledge is doubtful.
The problem is not necessarily the amount of available funding. (44) ________This is an adequate amount so long as it is aimed in the right direction. Social scientists who complain about a lack of funding should not expect more in today’s economic climate. 
The trick is to direct these funds better. The European Union Framework funding programs have long had a category specifically targeted at social scientists. This year, it was proposed that the system be changed: Horizon 2020, a new program to be enacted in 2014, would not have such a category. This has resulted in protests from social scientists. But the intention is not to neglect social science; rather, the complete opposite. (45) ________That should create more collaborative endeavors and help to develop projects aimed directly at solving global problems. 
[A] It could be that we are evolving two communities of social scientists: one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly specialized journals, and one that is problem-oriented and publishing elsewhere, such as policy briefs.
[B] However, the numbers are still small: in 2010, about 1,600 of the 100,000 social-sciences papers published globally included one of these keywords.
[C] The idea is to force social scientists to integrate their work with other categories, including health and demographic change; food security; marine research and the bio-economy; clean, efficient energy; and inclusive, innovative and secure societies.
[D] The solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, and what it considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social innovation ought to receive much more attention from scientists, especially the young ones.
[E] These issues all have root causes in human behavior: all require behavioral change and social innovations, as well as technological development. Stemming climate change, for example, is as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance as it is about developing clean energy.
[F] Despite these factors, many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems. And in Europe, some are up in arms over a proposal to drop a specific funding category for social-science research and to integrate it within cross-cutting topics of sustainable development.
[G] During the late 1990s, national spending on social sciences and the humanities as a percentage of all research and development funds—including government, higher education, non-profit and corporate—varied from around 4% to 25%; in most European nations, it is about 15%.

It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic human need in the individuals who made them: the need for creative expression. There is no doubt that gardens evidence an irrepressible urge to create, express, fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human urge; (46)yet when one looks at the photographs of the gardens created by the homeless, it strikes one that, for all their diversity of styles, these gardens speak of various other fundamental urges, beyond that of decoration and creative expression.
One of these urges has to do with creating a state of peace in the midst of turbulence, a “still point of the turning world,” to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot. (47) A sacred place of peace, however crude it may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to shelter, which is a distinctly animal need. This distinction is so much so that where the latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardeners, the former becomes all the more urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible by the structuring of one’s relation to one’s environment. (48) The gardens of the homeless, which are in effect homeless gardens, introduce form into an urban environment where it either didn’t exist or was not discernible as such. In so doing they give composure to a segment of the inarticulate environment in which they take their stand.
Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to arise from, is so intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its abiding claims on us. When we are deprived of green, of plants, of trees, (49) most of us give in to a demoralization of spirit which we usually blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find ourselves in a garden and feel the oppression vanish as if by magic. In most of the homeless gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is unfeasible, yet even so the compositions often seem to represent attempts to call forth the spirit of plant and animal life, if only symbolically, through a clumplike arrangement of materials, an introduction of colors, small pools of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as well as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements whose reference, at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. (50) It is this implicit or explicit reference to nature that fully justifies the use of word garden, though in a “liberated” sense, to describe these synthetic constructions. In them we can see biophilia—a yearning for contact with nonhuman life—assuming uncanny representational forms.

①Come on—Everybody’s doing it. ②That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words peer pressure. ③It usually leads to no good—drinking, drugs and casual sex. ④But in her new book Join the Club, Tina Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve their lives and possibly the world.
①Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of examples of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool. ②In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.
①The idea seems promising, and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. ②Her critique of the lameness of many public-health campaigns is spot-on: they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology. ③“Dare to be different, please don’t smoke!” pleads one billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers—teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. ④Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.
①But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is less persuasive. ②Join the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful. ③The most glaring flaw of the social cure as it’s presented here is that it doesn’t work very well for very long. ④Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. ⑤Evidence that the LoveLife program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed.
①There’s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on our behavior. ②An emerging body of research shows that positive health habits—as well as negative ones—spread through networks of friends via social communication. ③This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day.
①Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and bureaucrats can select our peer groups and steer their activities in virtuous directions. ②It’s like the teacher who breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-behaved classmates. ③The tactic never really works. ④And that’s the problem with a social cure engineered from the outside: in the real world, as in school, we insist on choosing our own friends.
21. According to the first paragraph, peer pressure often emerges as
[A] a supplement to the social cure.
[B] a stimulus to group dynamics.
[C] an obstacle to social progress.
[D] a cause of undesirable behaviors.
22. Rosenberg holds that public-health advocates should
[A] recruit professional advertisers.
[B] learn from advertisers’ experience.
[C] stay away from commercial advertisers.
[D] recognize the limitations of advertisements.
23. In the author’s view, Rosenberg’s book fails to
[A] adequately probe social and biological factors.
[B] effectively evade the flaws of the social cure.
[C] illustrate the functions of state funding.
[D] produce a long-lasting social effect.
24. Paragraph 5 shows that our imitation of behaviors
[A] is harmful to our networks of friends.
[B] will mislead behavioral studies.
[C] occurs without our realizing it.
[D] can produce negative health habits.

①A deal is a deal—except, apparently, when Entergy is involved. ②The company, a major energy supplier in New England, provoked justified outrage in Vermont last week when it announced it was reneging on a longstanding commitment to abide by the state’s strict nuclear regulations.
①Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it would not: challenge the constitutionality of Vermont’s rules in the federal court, as part of a desperate effort to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant running. ②It’s a stunning move. 
①The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation bought Vermont’s only nuclear power plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. ②As a condition of receiving state approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012. ③In 2006, the state went a step further, requiring that any extension of the plant’s license be subject to the Vermont legislature’s approval. ④Then, too, the company went along.
①Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, or it simply didn’t foresee what would happen next. ②A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 2007 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised serious questions about both Vermont Yankee’s safety and Entergy’s management—especially after the company made misleading statements about the pipe. ③Enraged by Entergy’s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension.
①Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is invalid because of the 2006 legislation, and that only the federal government has regulatory power over nuclear issues. ②The legal issues in the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that states do have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say the Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those powers extend. ③Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork regulations that could result if every state sets its own rules. ④But had Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside the point.
①The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont is already so damaged that it has nothing left to lose by going to war with the state. ②But there should be consequences. ③Permission to run a nuclear plant is a public trust. ④Entergy runs 11 other reactors in the United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. ⑤Pledging to run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to keep it open for another 20 years. ⑥But as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviews the company’s application, it should keep in mind what promises from Entergy are worth.
26. The phrase “reneging on” (Para. 1) is closest in meaning to
[A] condemning.
[B] reaffirming.
[C] dishonoring.
[D] securing.
27. By entering into the 2002 agreement, Entergy intended to
[A] obtain protection from Vermont regulators.
[B] seek favor from the federal legislature.
[C] acquire an extension of its business license.
[D] get permission to purchase a power plant.
28. According to Paragraph 4, Entergy seems to have problems with its
[A] managerial practices.
[B] technical innovativeness.
[C] financial goals.
[D] business vision.
29. In the author’s view, the Vermont case will test
[A] Entergy’s capacity to fulfill all its promises.
[B] the nature of states’ patchwork regulations.
[C] the federal authority over nuclear issues.
[D] the limits of states’ power over nuclear issues.
30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A] Entergy’s business elsewhere might be affected.
[B] the authority of the NRC will be defied.
[C] Entergy will withdraw its Plymouth application.
[D] Vermont’s reputation might be damaged.

①In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work. ②But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous and complicated route. ③We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context of our unique life experiences. ④Prior knowledge and interests influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. ⑤Opportunities for misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.
①Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. ②Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. ③But it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. ④This is the credibility process, through which the individual researcher’s me, here, now becomes the community’s anyone, anywhere, anytime. ⑤Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
①Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. ②But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. ③Within the complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. ④As a discovery claim works its way through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual’s discovery claim into the community’s credible discovery.
①Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. ②First, scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. ③Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. ④The goal is new-search, not re-search. ⑤Not surprisingly, newly published discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future researchers. ⑥Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. ⑦Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi once described discovery as “seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” ⑧But thinking what nobody else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change their views. ⑨Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.
①In the end, credibility “happens” to a discovery claim—a process that corresponds to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. ②“We reason together, challenge, revise, and complete each other’s reasoning and each other’s conceptions of reason.”
31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is characterized by its
[A] uncertainty and complexity.
[B] misconception and deceptiveness.

①If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil servants. ②When Hoffa’s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. ③In 2009 the number of unionists in America’s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. ④In Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized.
①There are three reasons for the public-sector unions’ thriving. ②First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. ③Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. ④A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree. ⑤Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. ⑥Some of their ties go back a long way. ⑦Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. ⑧Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector unions.
①At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. ②Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California points out that much of the state’s budget is patrolled by unions. ③The teachers’ unions keep an eye on schools, the CCPOA on prisons and a variety of labor groups on health care.
①In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private one. ②But the real gains come in benefits and work practices. ③Politicians have repeatedly “backloaded” public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.
①Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most notoriously in education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles. ②Even though there is plenty of evidence that the quality of the teachers is the most important variable, teachers’ unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and promoting good ones.
①As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have begun to clamp down. ②In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of supporters against Scott Walker, the hardline Republican governor. ③But many within the public sector suffer under the current system, too.
①John Donahue at Harvard’s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. ②The only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. ③Bankers’ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America.
36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that
[A] Teamsters still have a large body of members.
[B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant.
[C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership.
[D] the government has improved its relationship with unionists.
37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2?
[A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions.
[B] Education is required for public-sector union membership.
[C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions.
[D] Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions.
38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state sector is
[A] illegally secured.
[B] indirectly augmented.
[C] excessively increased.
[D] fairly adjusted.
39. The example of the unions in Wisconsin shows that unions
[A] often run against the current political system.
[B] can change people’s political attitudes.
[C] may be a barrier to public-sector reforms.
[D] are dominant in the government.
40. John Donahue’s attitude towards the public-sector system is one of
[A] disapproval.
[C] appreciation.
[B] tolerance.
[D] indifference.

Think of those fleeting moments when you look out of an aeroplane window and realise that you are flying, higher than a bird. Now think of your laptop, thinner than a brown-paper envelope, or your cellphone in the palm of your hand. Take a moment or two to wonder at those marvels. You are the lucky inheritor of a dream come true.
The second half of the 20th century saw a collection of geniuses, warriors, entrepreneurs and visionaries labour to create a fabulous machine that could function as a typewriter and printing press, studio and theatre, paintbrush and gallery, piano and radio, the mail as well as the mail carrier. (41) ________
The networked computer is an amazing device, the first media machine that serves as the mode of production, means of distribution, site of reception, and place of praise and critique. The computer is the 21st century’s culture machine.
But for all the reasons there are to celebrate the computer, we must also act with caution. (42) ________ I call it a secret war for two reasons. First, most people do not realise that there are strong commercial agendas at work to keep them in passive consumption mode. Second, the majority of people who use networked computers to upload are not even aware of the significance of what they are doing.
All animals download, but only a few upload. Beavers build dams and birds make nests. Yet for the most part, the animal kingdom moves through the world downloading. Humans are unique in their capacity to not only make tools but then turn around and use them to create superfluous material goods—paintings, sculpture and architecture—and superfluous experiences—music, literature, religion and philosophy. (43) ________
For all the possibilities of our new culture machines, most people are still stuck in download mode. Even after the advent of widespread social media, a pyramid of production remains, with a small number of people uploading material, a slightly larger group commenting on or modifying that content, and a huge percentage remaining content to just consume. (44) ________
Television is a one-way tap flowing into our homes. The hardest task that television asks of anyone is to turn the power off after he has turned it on. (45) ________
What counts as meaningful uploading? My definition revolves around the concept of “stickiness”—creations and experiences to which others adhere.
[A] Of course, it is precisely these superfluous things that define human culture and ultimately what it is to be human. Downloading and consuming culture requires great skills, but failing to move beyond downloading is to strip oneself of a defining constituent of humanity.
[B] Applications like tumblr.com, which allow users to combine pictures, words and other media in creative ways and then share them, have the potential to add stickiness by amusing, entertaining and enlightening others.
[C] Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system accessed by billions of people every day.
[D] This is because the networked computer has sparked a secret war between downloading and uploading—between passive consumption and active creation—whose outcome will shape our collective future in ways we can only begin to imagine.
[E] The challenge the computer mounts to television thus bears little similarity to one format            being replaced by another in the manner of record players being replaced by CD players.
[F] One reason for the persistence of this pyramid of production is that for the past half-century, much of the world’s media culture has been defined by a single medium—television—and television is defined by downloading.
[G] The networked computer offers the first chance in 50 years to reverse the flow, to encourage thoughtful downloading and, even more importantly, meaningful uploading.

Since the days of Aristotle, a search for universal principles has characterized the scientific enterprise. In some ways, this quest for commonalities defines science. Newton's laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory framework.
(46) In physics, one approach takes this impulse for unification to its extreme, and seeks a theory of everything—a single generative equation for all we see. It is becoming less clear, however, that such a theory would be a simplification, given the dimensions and universes that it might entail. Nonetheless, unification of sorts remains a major goal.
This tendency in the natural sciences has long been evident in the social sciences too. (47) Here, Darwinism seems to offer justification, for if all humans share common origins, it seems reasonable to suppose that cultural diversity could also be traced to more constrained beginnings. Just as the bewildering variety of human courtship rituals might all be considered forms of sexual selection, perhaps the world's languages, music, social and religious customs and even history are governed by universal features. (48) To filter out what is unique from what is shared might enable us to understand how complex cultural behavior arose and what guides it in evolutionary or cognitive terms. 
That, at least, is the hope. But a comparative study of linguistic traits published online today supplies a reality check. Russell Gray at the University of Auckland and his colleagues consider the evolution of grammars in the light of two previous attempts to find universality in language.
The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that humans are born with an innate language-acquisition capacity that dictates a universal grammar. A few generative rules are then sufficient to unfold the entire fundamental structure of a language, which is why children can learn it so quickly. 
(49) The second, by Joshua Greenberg, takes a more empirical approach to universality, identifying traits (particularly in word order) shared by many languages, which are considered to represent biases that result from cognitive constraints. 
Gray and his colleagues have put them to the test by examining four family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 languages. (50) Chomsky’s grammar should show patterns of language change that are independent of the family tree or the pathway tracked through it, whereas Greenbergian universality predicts strong co-dependencies between particular types of word-order relations. Neither of these patterns is borne out by the analysis, suggesting that the structures of the languages are lineage-specific and not governed by universals.

Text 1
①The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. ②For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. ③“Hooray! At last!” wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.
①One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. ②Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert’s appointment in the Times, calls him “an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.” ③As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise.
①For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. ②To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. ③All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes.
①Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. ②For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. ③These recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances; moreover, they can be “consumed” at a time and place of the listener’s choosing. ④The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert.
①One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. ②Gilbert’s own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into “a markedly different, more vibrant organization.” ③But what will be the nature of that difference? ④Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. ⑤If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hopes to attract.

①When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was surprisingly straight up. ②Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving “to pursue my goal of running a company.” ③Broadcasting his ambition was “very much my decision,” McGee says. ④Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29.
①McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. ②It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his aspirations. ③And McGee isn’t alone. ④In recent weeks the No. 2 executives at Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. ⑤As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don’t get the nod also may wish to move on. ⑥A turbulent business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations.
①As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net. ②In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. ③As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.
①The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. ②For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached. ③Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey: “I can’t think of a single search I’ve done where a board has not instructed me to look at sitting CEOs first.”
①Those who jumped without a job haven’t always landed in top positions quickly. ②Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade ago, saying she wanted to be a CEO. ③It was a year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. ④Robert Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. ⑤He finally took that post at a major financial institution three years later.
①Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. ②The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. ③“The traditional rule was it’s safer to stay where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted,” says one headhunter. ④“The people who’ve been hurt the worst are those who’ve stayed too long.”
26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being
［A］ arrogant.     
［B］ frank.
［C］ self-centered. 
［D］ impulsive.
27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives’ quitting may be spurred by
［A］ their expectation of better financial status.
［B］ their need to reflect on their private life.
［C］ their strained relations with the boards.
［D］ their pursuit of new career goals.
28. The word “poached”（Paragraph 4）most probably means
［A］ approved of. 
［B］ attended to.
［C］ hunted for.  
［D］ guarded against.
29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
［A］ top performers used to cling to their posts.
［B］ loyalty of top performers is getting out-dated.
［C］ top performers care more about reputations.
［D］ it’s safer to stick to the traditional rules.

①The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. ②No longer. ③While traditional “paid” media—such as television commercials and print advertisements—still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. ④Consumers passionate about a product may create “earned” media by willingly promoting it to friends, and a company may leverage “owned” media by sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. ⑤The way consumers now approach the process of making purchase decisions means that marketing’s impact stems from a broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.
①Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. ②For earned media, such marketers act as the initiator for users’ responses. ③But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media—for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. ④We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. ⑤This trend, which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. ⑥Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. ⑦Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies’ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.
①The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways. ②Such hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or product. ③Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.
①If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at risk. ②In such a case, the company’s response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. ③Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg. 
31. Consumers may create “earned” media when they are
［A］ obsessed with online shopping at certain Web sites.
［B］ inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them.
［C］ eager to help their friends promote quality products.
［D］ enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products.
32. According to Paragraph 2, sold media feature
［A］ a safe business environment. 
［B］ random competition.
［C］ strong user traffic.         
［D］ flexibility in organization.
33. The author indicates in Paragraph 3 that earned media
［A］ invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers.
［B］ can be used to produce negative effects in marketing.
［C］ may be responsible for fiercer competition.
［D］ deserve all the negative comments about them.
34. Toyota Motor’s experience is cited as an example of
［A］ responding effectively to hijacked media.
［B］ persuading customers into boycotting products.
［C］ cooperating with supportive consumers.
［D］ taking advantage of hijacked media.
35. Which of the following is the text mainly about?
［A］ Alternatives to conventional paid media.
［B］ Conflict between hijacked and earned media.
［C］ Dominance of hijacked media.
［D］ Popularity of owned media.

①It’s no surprise that Jennifer Senior’s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, “I Love My Children, I Hate My Life,” is arousing much chatter—nothing gets people talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-enriching experience. ②Rather than concluding that children make parents either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. ③Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that “the very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.”
①The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. ②There are also stories about newly adoptive—and newly single-mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant” news. ③Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.
①In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing? ②It doesn’t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the childless. ③Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn’t have had kids, but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single most important thing in the world: obviously their misery must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives.
①Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like Bullock. ②According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. ③No shock there, considering how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their “own” (read: with round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake.
①It’s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. ②But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped getting “the Rachel” might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston. 
36. Jennifer Senior suggests in her article that raising a child can bring
［A］ temporary delight.             ［B］ enjoyment in progress.
［C］ happiness in retrospect.         ［D］ lasting reward.
37. We learn from Paragraph 2 that
［A］ celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip.
［B］ single mothers with babies deserve greater attention.
［C］ news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining.
［D］ having children is highly valued by the public.
38. It is suggested in Paragraph 3 that childless folks
［A］ are constantly exposed to criticism.
［B］ are largely ignored by the media.
［C］ fail to fulfill their social responsibilities.
［D］ are less likely to be satisfied with their life.
39. According to Paragraph 4, the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is 
［A］ soothing.                     ［B］ ambiguous.
［C］ compensatory.                 ［D］ misleading.
40. Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph? 
［A］ Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms.
［B］ Celebrity moms have influenced our attitude towards child rearing.
［C］ Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life.
［D］ We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing.

[A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much enthusiasm as the humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, become a lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out before getting their degrees.
[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: literature, languages, philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic canon of ideas that every educated person should possess. But most find it difficult to agree on what a “general education” should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, “the great books are read because they have been read”—they form a sort of social glue.
[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor’s degrees in 1970-71 than they did 20 years later. Fewer students require fewer teachers. So, at the end of a decade of thesis-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something for which they have not been trained.
[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they cut across the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts education and professional education should be kept separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience both varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional qualification.
[E] Besides professionalising the professions by this separation, top American universities have professionalised the professor. The growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960 and 1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful academic career: as late as 1969 a third of American professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that “the knowledge and skills needed for a particular specialisation are transmissible but not transferable.” So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of knowledge.
[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in which “the producers of knowledge are produced”. Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, investigate and criticise. “Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.” Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand does not say.
[G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree. They may then decide to go elsewhere. For something curious has been happening in American universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard University, captured it skillfully.

With its theme that “Mind is the master weaver,” creating our inner character and outer circumstances, the book As a Man Thinketh by James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the central idea of self-help writing.
(46) Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share—that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts—and reveal its erroneous nature. Because most of us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think that thoughts can be hidden and made powerless; this allows us to think one way and act another. However, Allen believed that the unconscious mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and (47) while we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that? ”
Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that do not accord with desire, Allen concluded: “We do not attract what we want, but what we are.” Achievement happens because you as a person embody the external achievement; you don’t “get” success but become it. There is no gap between mind and matter.
Part of the fame of Allen’s book is its contention that “Circumstances do not make a person, they reveal him.” (48) This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom.
This, however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. Each set of circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for growth. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed. In fact, (49) circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us, and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation. Nevertheless, as any biographer knows, a person’s early life and its conditions are often the greatest gift to an individual.
The sobering aspect of Allen’s book is that we have no one else to blame for our present condition except ourselves. (50) The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible.

①Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage. 
①It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. ②Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. ③To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.
①We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England between the turn of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. ②In those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. ③Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were about. ④These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. ⑤ “So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism,” Newman wrote, “that I am tempted to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are’.”
①Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. ②Neville Cardus, who wrote for the Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. ③During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England’s foremost classical-music critics, and a stylist so widely admired that his Autobiography (1947) became a best-seller. ④He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic to be so honored. ⑤Yet only one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.
①Is there any chance that Cardus’s criticism will enjoy a revival? ②The prospect seems remote. ③Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern readers have little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. ④Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat. 
21. It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that
[A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers
[B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews

①Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. ②Amazon.com received one for its “one-click” online payment system. ③Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. ④One inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.
①Now the nation’s top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. ②In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. ③In re Bilski, as the case is known, is “a very big deal,” says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of Law. ④It “has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents.”
①Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called State Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. ②That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging Internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. ③Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. ④In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents, despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. ⑤Similarly, some Wall Street investment firms armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.
①The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market. ②The Federal Circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court’s judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should “reconsider” its State Street Bank ruling.
①The Federal Circuit’s action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the Supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. ②Last April, for example, the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for “inventions” that are obvious. ③The judges on the Federal Circuit are “reacting to the anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court,” says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School. 
26. Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of 
[A] their limited value to businesses.
[B] their connection with asset allocation.
[C] the possible restriction on their granting.
[D] the controversy over their authorization.
27. Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?
[A] Its ruling complies with the court decisions.
[B] It involves a very big business transaction.
[C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit.
[D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S.
28. The word “about-face” (Para. 3) most probably means
[A] loss of goodwill.
[B] increase of hostility.
[C] change of attitude.
[D] enhancement of dignity.
29. We learn from the last two paragraphs that business-method patents
[A] are immune to legal challenges.
[B] are often unnecessarily issued.
[C] lower the esteem for patent holders.
[D] increase the incidence of risks.
30. Which of the following would be the subject of the text?
[A] A looming threat to business-method patents.
[B] Protection for business-method patent holders.
[C] A legal case regarding business-method patents.
[D] A prevailing trend against business-method patents.

①In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that “social epidemics” are driven in large part by the actions of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well connected. ②The idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn’t explain how ideas actually spread.
①The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible-sounding but largely untested theory called the “two-step flow of communication” : Information flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. ②Marketers have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the influentials, those select people will do most of the work for them. ③The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. ④In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid attention. ⑤Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain special people can drive trends.
①In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. ②In fact, they don’t seem to be required at all.
①The researchers’ argument stems from a simple observation about social influence: With the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey—whose outsize presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence—even the most influential members of a population simply don’t interact with that many others. ②Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics, by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. ③For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. ④If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the cascade of change won’t propagate very far or affect many people.
①Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the dynamics of social influence by conducting thousands of computer simulations of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people’s ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. ②They found that the principal requirement for what is called “global cascades” —the widespread propagation of influence through networks—is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily influenced people. 
31. By citing the book The Tipping Point, the author intends to
[A] analyze the consequences of social epidemics.
[B] discuss influentials’ function in spreading ideas.
[C] exemplify people’s intuitive response to social epidemics.
[D] describe the essential characteristics of influentials.
32. The author suggests that the “two-step-flow theory”
[A] serves as a solution to marketing problems.
[B] has helped explain certain prevalent trends.
[C] has won support from influentials.
[D] requires solid evidence for its validity.
33. What the researchers have observed recently shows that
[A] the power of influence goes with social interactions.
[B] interpersonal links can be enhanced through the media.
[C] influentials have more channels to reach the public.
[D] most celebrities enjoy wide media attention.
34. The underlined phrase “these people” in Paragraph 4 refers to the ones who
[A] stay outside the network of social influence.
[B] have little contact with the source of influence.
[C] are influenced and then influence others.
[D] are influenced by the initial influential.
35. What is the essential element in the dynamics of social influence?
[A] The eagerness to be accepted.
[B] The impulse to influence others.
[C] The readiness to be influenced.
[D] The inclination to rely on others.

①Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. ②Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else the accounting standard-setters. ③Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it’s just not fair. ④These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.
①Unfortunately, banks’ lobbying now seems to be working. ②The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. ③And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult. ④After a bruising encounter with Congress, America’s Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. ⑤These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statements. ⑥Bob Herz, the FASB’s chairman, cried out against those who question our motives. ⑦Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls the use of judgment by management.
①European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. ②The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. ③Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did not live in a political vacuum but in the real world and the Europe could yet develop different rules.
①It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. ②Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. ③The truth will not be known for years. ④But banks’ shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. ⑤And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.
①To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. ②America’s new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. ③Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. ④The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility interests. ⑤But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.
36. Bankers complained that they were forced to
[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules.
[B] collect payments from third parties.
[C] cooperate with the price managers.
[D] re-evaluate some of their assets.
37. According to the author, the rule changes of the FASB may result in
[A] the diminishing role of management.
[B] the revival of the banking system.
[C] the banks’ long-term asset losses.
[D] the weakening of its independence.
38. According to Paragraph 4, McCreevy objects to the IASB’s attempt to
[A] keep away from political influences.
[B] evade the pressure from their peers.
[C] act on their own in rule-setting.
[D] take gradual measures in reform.
39. The author thinks the banks were “on the wrong planet” in that they
[A] misinterpreted market price indicators.
[B] exaggerated the real value of their assets.
[C] neglected the likely existence of bad debts.
[D] denied booking losses in their sale of assets.
40. The author’s attitude towards standard-setters is one of
[A] satisfaction.
[B] skepticism.
[C] objectiveness.
[D] sympathy.

[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out; the consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from about 32 percent of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic alternative.
[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe’s largest markets are at a standstill, leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of market retailers need.
[C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible trends dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the seller, to decide what to buy. At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold.
[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably apply their gigantic scale, existing infrastructure, and proven skills in the management of product ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection reveals important differences among the biggest national markets, especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers must understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.
[E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been closely examined—France, Germany, Italy, and Spain—are made out of the same building blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to buy straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to consumers when they don’t eat at home. Such food service operators range from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of these businesses are known in the trade as “horeca”: hotels, restaurants, and cafés. Overall, Europe’s wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.
[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales came to $268 billion in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000—more than 40 percent of retail sales. Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of this fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.
[G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some large food producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2.  (10 points)
One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value. Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.
When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to love it, we invent excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of the century songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. (46) Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. The evidence had to be economic in order to be valid. 
It is painful to read these roundabout accounts today. We have no land ethic yet, (47) but we have at least drawn nearer the point of admitting that birds should continue as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us.
A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. (48) Time was when biologists somewhat overworked the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on “worthless” species. Here again, the evidence had to be economic in order to be valid. It is only in recent years that we hear the more honest argument that predators are members of the community, and that no special interest has the right to exterminate them for the sake of a benefit, real or fancied, to itself.
Some species of trees have been “read out of the party” by economics-minded foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale value to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the noncommercial tree species are recognized as members of the native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason. Moreover, some have been found to have a valuable function in building up soil fertility. The interdependence of the forest and its constituent tree species, ground flora, and fauna is taken for granted.
To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.
