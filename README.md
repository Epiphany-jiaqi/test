Everybody,
I got bad news.

We've been canceled.

Oh no, Peter,
how could they do that?

Well, unfortunately, Lois,
there's just no more room on the schedule.

We've just got to accept the fact

that Fox has to make room
for terrific shows

like <i>Dark Angel,</i>
<i>Titus, Undeclared,</i>

<i>Action,</i>
<i>That '80s Show,</i>

<i>Wonderfalls, Fastlane,</i>

<i>Andy Richter</i>
<i>Controls the Universe,</i>

<i>Skin, Girls Club,</i>
<i>Cracking Up,</i>

<i>The Pitts, Firefly,</i>
<i>Get Real,</i>

<i>FreakyLinks, Wanda at Large,</i>
<i>Costello, The Lone Gunmen,</i>

<i>A Minute with Stan Hooper,</i>
<i>Normal, Ohio, Pasadena,</i>

<i>Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie,</i>
<i>The Street, American Embassy,</i>

<i>Cedric the Entertainer,</i>
<i>The Tick,</i>

<i>Louie, </i>and
<i>Greg the Bunny.</i>

Is there no hope?

Well, I suppose
if all those shows

go down the tubes,
we might have a shot.

<i>It seems today</i>
<i>that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies</i>
<i>and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry</i>

<i>He's a family guy!</i>

-What are you watching, Peter?
-<i>Passion of the Christ.</i>

I tell you, Brian,
I can't believe

that this guy's
just lying there taking it.

If it was me,
I would've done something about it.

Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

Aah! Aah!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Stop it. Stop it.

-Okay.
-Okay?

-Okay.
-All right.

Hi, boys.

I didn't have my hand
down my pants.

Mm, good for you.

I just bought us
some new sheets

at Bed Bath and Beyond.

Oh, boy, I hope you
stayed away

from that Beyond section.

(SCREAMING)

Oh, here are the coffee mugs.

Honey, what do you say
we, uh, christen these new sheets, huh?

Why, Lois Griffin,
you naughty girl.

(GIGGLES) That's me.

-You dirty hustler.
-(LAUGHS)

You filthy,
stinky prostitute.

Okay, I get it.

You foul, venereal-disease-carrying,
streetwalking whore.

All right,
that's enough.

(BED SPRINGS CREAKING)

(SIGHING)

It's good to have land.

(PETER AND LOIS GIGGLING)

LOIS: George!

George?
Who the hell is George?

George Clooney.

Our sex is so dull for you
that you gotta fantasize

about George Clooney?

I'm sorry, honey.
I guess that things

have become a little stale
for me.

W... I... I don't know
what to do.

I mean, I don't really know that much
about any kinky stuff.

I mean, I... I could hook
this car battery up to my nipples.

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Oh, God! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

This doing it for you?

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

Oh, I don't know.
I just don't feel that spark anymore.

I mean, our honeymoon.

Ah, so much rug burn!

Wait a second, Lois.
That's what we need.

We'll go
on a second honeymoon.

(GASPS)
Peter, that's a wonderful idea!

Yeah. We'll be just like
<i>The Honeymooners!</i>

One of these days, Alice.

One of these days...

Yeah, yeah.
I know, Ralph.

Right to the moon.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

Oh.

Well, that's everything.
Now, remember, kids,

Brian is in charge while your father and I
are out at Cape Cod.

I'll take good care
of them, Lois.

You guys
have a good time.

(ENGINE STARTS)

LOIS: Be good.
PETER: Buh-bye!

Mom, I love you!

You know Brian, if I choose
to make stool in my pants right now

you're the only one here
to change me.

What do you think
of that? Hm?

-I'm not gonna change you.
-What?

I said,
I'm not gonna change you.

You can't be serious.

Oh, what if... what
if I make a fudgie?

Well, I just won't,
I just won't, that's all. I just won't.

Blast, I just did!

(CHRIS AND MEG SHOUTING)

Chris, cut it out!

Brian, Chris just picked his nose

and he keeps touching me with his finger!

CHRIS: What good is mining nose gold

if I can't share it with the townspeople?

I swear to God, these kids
are gonna make me

put a bullet through my head.

Well, if I was in charge, we wouldn't
be having this problem.

You got some ideas? Tell me.

Oh, I'll tell you.

Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange.

(LAUGHING)

How does it smell, dog?

Does it smell like servitude?

(LAUGHING)

Aft torpedoes, fire!

Lois?

Hey, Lois, honey?

Sweetheart?

-(BRAKES SCREECH)
-Aah!

Oh, you're awake!

Hey, uh, can you hand me the pretzels?

Here. Where are we?

About two hours from Cape Cod's
most luxurious bed and breakfast.

Oh, Peter, this is gonna be wonderful.

I'm so excited I want to prep
my diaphragm now.

(LAUGHS) Gross.
Hey, why don't you go back to sleep?

I'll wake you up
when we get there.

Okay.

PETER: (LAUGHING)

Look at all those hamburgers.

You can't eat all
those hamburgers, you stupid fellow!

-(CAR THUDDING)
-Oh, jeez!

Ah, he's gonna do it!
Oh, he's so ridiculous.

You hear me, you ridiculous man?
You're... whoa!

(SCREAMING)

(CRASHES)

Peter, what the hell
is wrong with you?

I fall asleep for ten minutes

and you plow the car into a tree?

Oh, my God!
You gotta pay attention to the road.

We could have been killed!

I mean, look at the front of our car.

It's totaled.
It's completely totaled, Peter!

Oh, this is just terrific.

How are we gonna get...

Oh, my God!

I knew I should've driven.

I should always drive.

I cannot trust you, Peter Griffin!

Dear God,
this is where we're sleeping?

Oh, come on, Lois. They said
they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow,

and then our second honeymoon's
back on track, huh?

Peter, there's a hooker on the bed.

-Hi.
-Stand perfectly still, Lois.

Their vision is based on movement.

Where did you go?

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now back</i>
<i>to </i>Two and a Half Men<i>.</i>

(ALL SCREAMING)

Kill me!

Turn it, Chris. I wanna watch
<i>George Lopez.</i>

That show only furthers the stereotype

that George Lopez is funny.

-Give me that! Let go.
-Chris, give me the remote.

-Chris, stop!
-Stop doing that!

Chris...
(GASPS) My hat!

(LAUGHING)

Wear it now.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Hey, uh, uh, you two
better settle down.

Chris, give Meg her hat.

I don't have to listen to you.

You're a dog!
You don't have a soul!

Ow.

Don't take that.
Raise your voice to them.

Hey! Knock it off!

Look, you kids are obviously
in need of some type of activity,

so, uh, uh,
I don't know,

what do you say
we read a book or something?

Stewie, what does Peter
have on his bookshelf?

Uh, two Garfield books

and the novelization
of the movie <i>Caddy Shack.</i>

"Mananananana," said Ty,
sinking yet another ball.

-"mananananana..." Oh, hang on.
-(PHONE RINGING)

Oh, thank God.

<i>Garfield at Large,</i> by Jim Davis.

Now, as you can see in this panel,

Garfield doesn't care for Nermal,

but like him or not,
Nermal is here to stay.

Or is he? Let's read on.

Okay, I'll be there.

Peter and Lois were supposed to chaperone

Chris' school dance tomorrow night,

so, I guess it's up to me.

You mean it's up to us.

Clearly, you need my help
with this parenting thing,

you're too stupid
to do it alone.

Besides, I know
how to deal with children,

Unlike Mr. Geppetto.

Oh, no. I dropped my glasses.

Uh, by the way, Pinocchio,

there was a cookie missing from the jar.

did you, uh,
did you take it by any chance?

Yes, Papa Geppetto.
I'm sorry.

Are you sure
you took it?

Because, uh, I'd believe you
if you said you didn't.

No, I took it, papa.
I wouldn't lie to you.

You could try. Who knows?
You might get away with it.

900 bucks to fix the car.

That was all the money
we had for this trip.

Look, Peter, this second honeymoon
was a nice thought,

but maybe we should
just go home.

(SIGHING)

Coming up,
handsome mustachioed man

recaps news
in pleasing baritone.

Stay tuned for this...
and more.

But first,
Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa

is on hand for the opening

of Manhattan's
newest luxury hotel.

Diane, I am standing outside
the Park Barrington Hotel

because they don't
allow Asians inside.

Fancy place. Boy, that'd make
some second honeymoon, huh?

The Park Barrington is already attracting
some big names,

such as Christianity enthusiast,
Mel Gibson,

who has his own room on permanent reserve.

A room which he barely uses.

Barely uses, huh?

Lois, I just got an idea!

Much better than that time
I experimented with gene splicing.

Uh, Lois, quick question.

Do we have any Tylenol?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, how I envy them, dog.

They've got their whole lives
ahead of them.

Oh, man,
look at that kid.

That is one
ugly eighth grader.

You don't wanna
hurt yourself dancing.

Make sure you stretch out
those creamy hamstrings.

Come on, Chris.
It's just vodka.

Jake swiped it
from his dad's liquor cabinet.

Yeah, see?
It's good.

Well, okay. Maybe just one sip.

Christopher Griffin, is that alcohol?

Mister, you're in serious trouble.

He's absolutely right, kids.

Because when you drink, nobody wins.

In fact, last year alone,
there were over 27,000 deaths

from chronic liver disease
as a result of alcohol abuse.

ALL: Now we know.

And knowing
is half the battle.

<i>GI Joe!</i>

Peter, we can't afford this.

No, but Mel Gibson can.

Uh, excuse me,
I'm Mel Gibson,

here for the key to my specially
reserved room.

You're Mel Gibson?

Yes, I've put on a few pounds
for my next role.

I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior

who defied the English
to free England from the English.

Holy mackerel!
Let me show you to your room, Mr. Gibson!

Peter, the toilet paper
is made of money.

Yeah, and look at this.

They even got some of that
high-class British porn.

Almost. Almost. Almost.

-There we are.
-Well done.

Did you think you were cool?

Did you think you were grown up? Hmm?

I didn't actually drink any of it.

Besides, Jake Tucker gave it to me.

Well, we are going to have a talk

with Jake's parents tomorrow,
after my burping.

And, in the meantime,
you're grounded, Chris.

Oh, come on. That sucks!

Do you want us to pull over?

I don't care what you do!

Oh, we'll pull over.
We'll pull over. Pull over.

(TIRES SCREECH)

-(SPANKING)
-(CRYING)

If your teachers ask about your bruises,
what do you tell them?

I got hit by a baseball!

-(SPANKING)
-(CRYING)

(PETER AND LOIS GIGGLING)

LOIS: Oh, Mel!

PETER: Mel? Wait a minute.

You were fantasizing about Mel Gibson.

You... You don't find me
attractive anymore.

Honey, I'm sorry.
I know you're trying,

but you can't force the spark back
into our marriage.

Well, then I guess
this whole second honeymoon

-was a waste of time.
-Peter...

I don't wanna talk about it!

I'm just gonna watch British porn.

You know, Margaret,

We could have
sexual intercourse right now.

Yes, yes we could.

Mm, but, let's not.

Do you think we were too hard
on Chris tonight?

What? Oh, God,
no, no.

No, no, I don't... I don't think so.

-Do you?
-Oh, no, I just

always feel badly when we
have to be strict.

Oh, did I remember
to turn the stove off?

Yes.

I'm sorry for everything
that's happened, Peter.

I guess I'm going through
a phase right now

where I'm only attracted
to handsome men.

Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

Just admit that there's
no excitement left in our marriage,

go home and spend
the rest of our lives

looking at each other
across the breakfast table,

talking about how much
we both like <i>Total?</i>

-Oh, I love <i>Total</i>.
-Oh, actually, so do I.

And it's healthy for us, too...

Oh, God!
It's starting already!

Lois, we are screwed.

(WHIRRING)

Wow!

ANNOUNCER: <i>This July,</i>
<i>let he who is without sin</i>

Oh, man, that's all we need,

more Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo.

Well, not if I have anything
to say about it!

I am gonna make sure this never sees
the light of day.

Peter, are you crazy?

Stealing Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes,

and Nazi paraphernalia is one thing,

but this is a multi-million-dollar film,

and he's a very powerful man.

He could have us arrested or...
or killed.

It's worth the risk, Lois

to save the world
another two hours of torture.

We gotta get rid of this thing
for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy

and all the other
beloved children's characters.

Let's go!

Pardon me.
We work for Mel Gibson.

Seems he left something
very valuable

in his room,
and we're here to retrieve it.

Mr. Gibson
just checked out a moment ago.

There he goes now!

Uh-oh, Lois, run!

Hey, stop!

Uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh.

(ENGINE ACCELERATING)

They're gaining on us.

Oh, we never should've stolen this film.

Oh, man, this is even more intense

than that time I forgot how to sit down.

(CRASHES)

Don't worry, Lois, I think I know how
to lose them.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

I am always so polite.

Ha... I, uh,
hope we don't wind up on the evening news

-'cause of this.
-(CHUCKLES)

You're funny.

Ah, Brian, please come in.

Can my wife Stacy get you anything?

-Go to hell, Tom.
-Already there, hon.

Yes, well, uh, Mr. Tucker,
uh, it seems your son Jake had some vodka

at the school dance
and, uh, Chris got blamed for it.

This, uh, this...
this whole situation has just turned

his whole life upside-down face.

It's no concern of mine
if it's turned his life upside-down face.

Jake's a good boy.

-Aren't you, Jake?
-Yeah!

-Look, Mr. Tucker, I...
-We're through here.

Get out of my house, Benji!

Well fine! If you're gonna be that way
about it, maybe I'll do this.

-Yeah, look at this.
-Stop that!

-Oh, yeah,
you don't like this, huh? -Stop it!

-Yeah, this is what Benji would do.
-Stop doing that in my carpet!

-Hey! Knock it off!
-Oh, boy, that feels so good.

-Stop it! Stop it!
-That feels so good.

There's gotta be a way to get back

at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.

(GASPS) I know! I know! I know!
Let's plant drugs in his locker.

Oh, my God!
That's a great idea.

Yeah,
thought you'd like that.

Hey, look at that
Yosemite Sam mud flap.

You better stay back, Brian.

(GRUNTS)

(SIGHING)
I think we lost them.

You stay here.
I'm gonna go bury this film.

Well, Mel Gibson,
this is one piece of crap

the world will never
have to suffer through.

(SNICKERS)

I am so clever.
That's why they picked me

to convince Congress to go to war.

There is no just cause
for an invasion of Iraq.

Well, that may be.

But what
we're all forgetting is,

Anyone who doesn't want
to go to war is gay.

I wanna go to war.

ALL: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
We should definitely go.

ALL: Yes, we should totally
go to war.

I was the first one
who wanted to go to war!

I'm doing this because I have to.

What are you gonna do to me?

Oh, what are you gonna do to me?

As soon as your husband
gives me what I want,

you're free to go.

-(DOOR OPENING)
-PETER: Anybody home?

Peter!

All right, Gibson.
I want my wife back.

Or a woman of equal
physical attractiveness.

Where's the film?

Come on, honey, let's get out of here.

Peter,
you're just gonna give him the film?

Don't worry, Lois, there's a dog turd
in there.

But by the time he finds out,
we'll be long g...

There's a dog turd in here.

Of course, he did.

What, that rash?

No, no, the spark.

Honey, I have never been
more attracted to you than I am right now.

Really? Wow!

Hey, so I guess
this honeymoon

was just the kind of excitement

our marriage needed. Huh?

I guess it just goes to show
that you...

Shut up and let's do it!

We now go to Ollie Williams

-Thanks, Ollie.

Now this.

So you actually put coke
in that kid's locker?

-Yup.
-Wow, where'd you get it?

Oh, i got a guy.

from the kettle drum

to the trombone.

I love the trombone!

(GASPS)

(TROMBONE PLAYING)

ALL: Wow!

I know,
isn't he wonderful?

He took lessons
in junior college.

Heads up!

I like meeting
Chris' teachers.

This ought to be
more interesting

than that time
I met Ted Danson.

Wow! Ted Danson
and Mary Steenburgen!

Hey, always nice
to meet a fan.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Oh, shoot!
I forgot my umbrella.

That's okay, honey.
Come on over here.

Thanks, dear.

Sometimes it's good
to be a freak.

Hey, do you wanna
sleep together later?

Oh... no.

No, no.
Thanks, though.

Good evening, parents.
I'm Ms. Clifton.

I'd like for you to fill out

these contact information sheets.

Now... now, who would like
to pass them out?

Oh, oh, oh,

Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton over here!

Oh, oh, oh,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton

Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

Mm, Mrs. Griffin.

(GROANS)

I... I... I'm sorry, will you all
please excuse me for a moment?

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Tonight's winning lottery numbers</i>

<i>are 6, 21, 18, 7, 42.</i>

Oh, my God! I won!

I'm free from all those
snot-nosed little bastards!

(LAUGHING)

I'm free!

(MS. CLIFTON LAUGHING)

Is she coming back?

I don't know.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)

I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone.

Who's gonna teach my class now?

Brian, why don't you
teach Chris' class?

You're very knowledgeable,
and the kids might knock you down

a few pegs, which'd be good for you.

You know,
that is a terrific idea, Lois.

I probably have a lot
to offer young people.

Hah, what's he going to teach them?

How to lick the Dorito crumbs
from between the sofa cushions?

Or how to leave
a dead bird on the carpet?

That was a gift, you bastard.

That was a gift for the family.

Good morning, class. I'm your
substitute teacher, Brian Griffin.

ALL: Good morning, Mr. Griffin.

(LAUGHING)
Please, please, call me Brian.

Mr. Griffin is my father.

I thought your father's name was Cocoa,

and he was hit by a milk truck!

All right, our goal here

is to gain a command
of the English language.

so you
can be successful writers

like Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon.

Ah, there. Finished.

<i>Good Will Hunting</i>
by Matt Damon.

Hey, uh, you think
we could put both our names on that?

What? You've done nothing
but eat Breyer's and smoke pot

for the last six months.

Oh, that's ridicu...
Come on! I... I helped.

Oh, yeah? Okay, uh,
write a line. Just... just right now

just pitch me a line right now.

Okay.

(FARTS) How about that?

That wasn't a line.
You just farted.

Is there anymore pot?

So, how was your first day,
Mr. Ko-terr? (LAUGHS)

Yeah, Chris. What's it like
to have Brian as a teacher?

It sucks!

Mr. Griffin gave me an "F"
on my first assignment!

What? An "F", Brian?

After all Chris has done for you?

Ah... yeah, just kinda
pull it out. Yeah.

You know, if dogs aren't
supposed to eat

dental floss outta the garbage,

why do they make it
mint-flavored?

Hey, hey, Chris,
when I was in school,

you know what we used to do
when a teacher gave us a bad grade?

-What?
-We'd egg his house.

Come on!
Where's this bastard live?

I'll show you!

That's his house!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

-Take that!
-I got it!

PETER: Take that, you bum!

What the hell are you doing?

-Is that him?
-Yeah!

Oh, crap!

Hello, class.

Mark Twain here,
filling in for Brian Griffin.

I understand
you children read my book,

<i>The Adventures</i>
<i>of Huckleberry Finn.</i>

-ALL: Yeah, read it.
-Now, who can tell me...

Bobby, stop screwing around
back there!

Who can tell me the significance

of the carpetbaggers
in my novel?

Yeah, uh, they stood
for corruption and greed.

That's exactly right.

Just like
the presidency of James Garfield.

(ALL LAUGHING)

He died in office.

You kids are mighty smart.

You must
have a powerful good teacher.

Well, I gotta catch
my time steamboat back to the 1800s.

(FEET PATTERING)

Hey, sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

Yeah!
Captain Crunch was here.

Didn't you pass him
on the stairs?

Well, I hope the rest of you kids
learned something today.

ALL: Yeah.

<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>this is Principal Sloan.</i>

<i>Mr. Griffin,</i>
<i>you've been reassigned.</i>

<i>Please report</i>
<i>to Remedial English.</i>

STUDENTS: Huh?
-Reassigned? W... C... can I at least

come down to your office
and talk to you about this?

<i>No, no, I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'm far too busy today.</i>

Esteban,
uh, <i>mucho </i>tension lower.

Little lower. Lower.

Lower. Lower...

(HIGH-PITCHED SINGING)
<i>On top of old Smokey</i>

Gosh, I was really starting
to like this job.

It was nice interacting
with intelligent people.

I usually hang out
with an idiot.

Brian, Brian,
check it out.

I made a water slide
in the house.

Yay... Ah ah, ah!

(GROANING)

(CONTINUES GROANING) Ow!

I'm not gonna
call the hospital

because you won't
learn anything if I do.

Well, kids,
I'll see you later.

Pardon me,
is this first-period English?

I'm your new teacher,
Mrs. Lockhart.

(SCRIBBLING)

Oh, my God. I'm in love.

Watch out for the stairs!

-(SCREAMS)
-(CRASHING)

Good morning, class.

ALL: Good morning,
Mrs. Lockhart.

I graded your quizzes
from yesterday.

Most of you did well.

Some of you,
I think, can do better.

What do you see here, Chris?

Two Ds and an F.

(MUSIC AND NOISE)

Uh, hi. I'm, uh, Mr. Griffin,

but you can call me Brian.

Mr. Griffin is my father.

-(GUN FIRES)
-Uh, well, has, uh,

anybody read <i>Huckleberry Finn?</i>

-(GUN FIRES)
-Uh, all right, uh,

how about we go around
the room,

and everyone can say
a little something about themselves?

Uh, let's start
with you there in the front.

My name's Tim.
I'm 28 years young,

and I love weed.

My name is Carlos.
And beneath my tough exterior

is a boy aching to learn.

And beneath that
is a rapist.

My name is Amanda,
and my water just broke.

Oh, my God!

Yo, it's my turn to deliver.

Can I have this one?

My mom keeps
giving mine away.

Dad, I need some advice.

I need to know
how to get a girl to like me.

Ah, Chris, buddy,
there's a million ways to do that.

You just gotta do something simple,
like Vincent van Gogh.

Ooh, it's...
what is this?

It's my ear.
Do you like it?

Y... you don't...
you don't like it.

No, I like it.
But it's just... Why your ear?

-Because I love you.
-Well, at least this'll be a funny story

to tell our kids someday.

Oh, you want kids?
Ugh, yikes.

Uh... I wish you'd told me
that before I got you this.

Oh, did I hear
my big boy say

he's got a crush
on some lucky girl?

Oh, you know, Chris,
I knew this day would come.

So, I brought you
a condom.

Use it wisely, though.
It wasn't easy to obtain.

(COUPLE MOANING)

MAN: Ah! Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

WOMAN: Hey,
give that back!

MAN: Aww, man!

WOMAN: Now,
where were we?

(BOTH MOANING)

MAN: Oh,
this is much better.

Chris, honey,
the way to win a girl

is to do something
romantic and unexpected.

Hey, hey, remember
the naked spaceman, Lois?

Oh, yeah. You remember
the naked spaceman.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

On my 25th birthday,
your father surprised me

by showing' up in nothing
but a space helmet and moon boots.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

It just came to me.

You want some Tang,
Mr. Spaceman?

Oh, do I!

(BOTH LAUGH)

Just remember, fat man,

those jugs are mine
until the milk dries up.

Then you can have the remains.

So, basically,
what Orwell was saying was,

"It's not perfect,
but I'll take it."

All right, moving on...

CHRIS: Sorry, I'm late,
Mrs. Lockhart.

Oh, my God, Chris!
What are you doing?

Being romantic
and unexpected.

Chris, you can't
be so impulsive.

People have gotten
into a lot of trouble that way.

Uh, Marie?

Yeah, Donny?

Um...

we cannot tell Mom.

So, Chris, what's the latest
with your little girlfriend?

Oh, I don't think
Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.

Mrs. Lockhart?
Your teacher?

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

Lois, this is not
my Batman glass.

Peter,
are you listening?

Chris has a crush
on his teacher.

Ew, gross!

You know
what else is gross?

(FARTS)

Argh!
Broke a damn blood vessel!

How's it coming, dog?

God, Just... L... Listen to
this kid's report on <i>Great Expectations.</i>

"Miss Havisham should've
throwed that cake out

so it don't like
mess all up da bitch's house."

I... I... I don't know
what to do.

You know? Society's
given up on these kids,

and I feel like I may be the only one
who can help them.

Well, I think your problem
is you're not communicating in a way

that speaks
to their experience.

You know
what you should do?

Get in there tomorrow
and do the robot.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe
I should just try a whole new approach.

Thanks.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay,
you can stop that now.

I can't hear you,
I'm a robot.

-Come on, knock it off.
-Does not compute.

Boo.

I'm going to bed.

I do not require sleep.

Boop! (LAUGHS)

Ahh, let's see the kid
with the hearing aid from <i>Barney </i>do this.

A'ight, a'ight,
so's I'm chilling in Verona

when my homie busts out with,

"Yo, Romeo,
check out

that bee-yatch Juliet
in the window."

Problem is, Juliet's peeps
are like, East Coast rappers,

and my posse's
representing west si-yeed.

Just like my boys
Tupac and Biggie.

Know what I'm saying'?

That's racist, man.

Yeah, that's just
straight ign'ant, dog.

It's good to meet you,
Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.

Well, we wanted
to talk to you about our son.

You see,
Chris really...

L... L... Lois...
Lois, honey,

Let's, uh, make sure
we do this delicately, all right?

Mrs. Lockhart... our son...

would like to plow you.

I had a feeling
that's what was going on.

Sorry, our... our son
can sometimes be a boob.

I... I mean a melon.
I... I mean,

a... a sopping-wet
pair of breasts

-barely covered
by a racing t-shirt. -Peter...

Mrs. Lockhart,
we just wanted you to know

so you could spare his feelings
and let him down gently.

Don't worry.
I know exactly what to say to Chris.

Thank you so much.

You've been
very understanding.

Gosh. You know,
I... I don't mean to impose,

but... do you have
a picture of yourself

that I could tape
to the back of Lois's head?

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

(RAPPING ON WINDOW)

Mrs. Lockhart?

Chris, come down here.
I need to talk to you.

-Why are you here?
-'Cause I couldn't stand

to be away from you
for another moment.

I think I'm falling
in love with you.

I love you, too!

The only problem
is I'm married.

Therefore,
there's only one thing to do.

Um, make a flip book
of a stick figure

whose head gets
bigger and bigger

and bigger and then pops?
(LAUGHS)

This isn't
a flip book, Chris.

They're instructions.

If we're going
to be together,

I need you
to kill my husband.

(SCREAMS)

Hey! Do you have any idea
what time it is?

Get in the house, fatty!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, Chris,
you big beautiful man,

I'm so glad you came.

Up the stairs,
second door on the left.

He should still be asleep.

Mrs. Lockhart,
I don't think I can do this.

-What?
-M... Maybe you could just get a divorce,

and we could live together
in the fort under my bed.

Fine. I'll do it myself.
But we're through.

Okay. But I gotta
give you the password,

or you can't
get into the fort.

(DOOR SLAMS)

It's taco. Taco!

Oh, good God!

Look at the fat man's underwear.

Looks like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

Don't put that in
with my things!

Huh, what's this?

You know, Stewie,
Mommy doesn't usually read things

outta Chris' pockets.

She's more respectful
than that.

Well, whatever helps you
sleep at night, bitch.

Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Chris is gonna murder
Mrs. Lockhart's husband!

W... We gotta stop him!

Oh, can we stop at
the supermarket?

I want a Granny Smith apple.
Ah!

How's your oatmeal, honey?

You know, it tastes
kinda different than usual.

(GROWLING)

Oh, my God!
There's a bear in my oatmeal!

(ROARING)

-(MR. LOCKHART SCREAMING)
-(BEAR ROARING)

(ALL CHATTERING)

(SIGHING) Yeah, I know. I'm late.

Okay, let's just get started.

Hey, yo, man,
what's that thing in the middle?

What, this?

(SCOFFS)
you gotta be freaking kidding me.

That's an ampersand.

It's a symbol
for the word "and."

My God,
nobody can be this stupid.

N... N... Not even Peter
when he took that blow to the head

and thought he was Larry
from <i>Three's Company.</i>

Jack, there's a hot tub party
across the street and we're invited.

Oh, and don't worry,
if, uh, Mr. Furley comes by,

I'll make sure
he thinks you're...

(EFFEMINATELY) Yay.

Yo, Mr. Griffin, chillax.
We're doing the best we can.

There is nothing I would like
to do more than chillax, Amanda

but w... without
a decent education,

you could spend
the rest of your life

as a ditch-digger
or a motel maid or a hooker.

I could be a ditch-digger?

A motel maid?

-I could be a hooker?
-W... W... Well, no.

Y... You don't want
to be a hooker.

Wow, Mr. Griffin!
You're the first teacher

that ever told us
we could do anything.

Well, I... I... I didn't mean
sell your body for money.

O, captain! My captain!

No, you're
actually misunderstanding.

O, captain! My captain!

Well, if it works for you,
I guess...

O, captain! My captain!

Yeah, what the hell.
Be the best damn hooker you can be.

O, captain! My captain!

In your case,
I'd get the money up front.

(MUMBLING)

Jack, twins!
Swedish. My place. Now.

(SCREAMING)

Oh, we're too late!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay, I gotta call the police.

Oh! (SNIFFING) Ugh, what's that smell?

Oh, dead body, right.
That's what that is.

Mm. I just had a dream
I was an egg,

and I was being hatched
by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

Ah! No, wait a minute.
I can't call the police.

I have to get rid
of this body, or Chris'll go to prison!

And we all know what happens
in those prison showers.

I've seen <i>Oz.</i>

(CAR DOOR SHUTS)

All right,
wait here, Stewie,

while Mommy
gets the cement blocks.

(GASPS)

Everything all right here?

Oh, fine, officer,
just, uh, enjoying the sunset.

No law against that,
is there?

What happened to your shirt?

(LAUGHING) Oh, you know,

just... a pizza party
at the office.

Oh, yeah? Where do you work?

First Fidelity Insurance
over on Weybosset Street.

Oh, my cousin Arnie
works over there.

Oh, Arnie's
your cousin, is he?

-You know him?
-Oh, somewhat.

Good middle-management type. Just sort of
blends in with the furniture, though.

Never really wowed
anyone at the office.

Yeah. That's always
been Arnie's problem.

Well, take it easy.

Yes, yes,
you too, you too.

Oh, and, uh,
if you see Arnie tell him,

"Oogidy boogidy boo!"

He'll know what it means.

You know what
I hate?

A guy
in a blue suit.

Eugh!

(INHALING)
There's one

right behind me,
isn't there?

You know, Lois,
Chris is cool and everything,

but, uh,
since he killed that guy, uh,

I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't
be living with us here now.

-Peter, I'm scared.
-Don't worry, sweetheart,

you'll have
plenty of time to escape

while he's killing Meg.

He hates her
the most.

Hey, everybody.
What's for dinner?

I'm starving.

My God, his blood lust
is unquenchable!

Hey, Chris, why don't
you take your sister

into the kitchen
for a sandwich?

I don't wanna die!

(CRASHING)

Why is everybody acting weird?

Chris, honey,
we know what you did.

And I have to say,
honestly, I don't approve.

What I did?
Oh, that I lied about my age

to get into Indian bingo?

-Uh, no...
-That I had hard gas and pooed myself?

Close, but still no.

How is that close?

For God's sake, Chris,

you murdered Mr. Lockhart!

What? No, I didn't!

Oh, come on, Chris. Everybody's done
something they're not proud of.

Like when I used
to be a Wonder Twin.

Peter,
the old schoolhouse is on fire! Let's go!

BOTH: Wonder Twin
powers, activate!

Form of a hawk!

Come on, Peter.

Yeah,
I'll be right behind you.

Shape of...
Jayna's tampon.

PETER: And now
I play the waiting game.

Chris, I saw the body.

Premeditated murder
is one thing,

but I will not
have lying in this house.

Wait, wait, wait
hold it, hold it,

can we finish this
after <i>Joan of Arcadia?</i>

Oh, is <i>Joan of Arcadia </i>on?

All right.

Must be good.
Enjoyable program.

We interrupt this broadcast

to bring you
a breaking news story.

We apologize
to <i>Joan of Arcadia's</i> sanctimonious,

fear-based
and probably overweight viewers.

That's right, Diane.
It appears Ronald Lockhart

has been brutally murdered
by his wife Lana

and a local bear.

Well, I'll be damned.

Chris, I guess
we owe you an apology.

That's okay.

I just wonder what happened
to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.

The whereabouts
of these suspects are currently unknown.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

You ready?

-What's that?
-I thought we'd try that lobster place

we passed in the car.

Yeah, can I just, uh,
finish watching this?

You can watch TV anytime.
I'm starving.

Lana, this is gonna
be a real long trip

if you don't
knock off the crap!

Love you.

(SIGHS)

GLENN (MUTTERING):
Giggity goo. Goo goo goo goo giggity.

(MUTTERING CONTINUES)

(GLENN GROANING)

GLENN: Would you just sit down
and go to the bathroom already?

(SCREAMING)

A scandal at the Quahog
Bowling Alley tonight

where a local man, Glenn Quagmire,

was charged with peeping
in the ladies' room.

Coming up, Diane's weight.

He's all yours, Joe.

You know, you're lucky
I've got some extra pull around here

thanks to my 18 medals for heroism.

Jeez, there he goes again with the medals.

Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much,
why don't you marry them?

(LAUGHS) I... I did something
like that once.

And in the event of your death,

you'd like the insurance policy
to be paid to your wife?

Yup.

And your wife is this piece of pie?

You got it. Love you.

Okay, sign here.

You know what?
You can probably go ahead and cancel that.

Well, well, look who's here.

All right, all right, look,
I know an apology is due here,

so, Lois, tell Quagmire
you're sorry you had him arrested.

Excuse me?
He's the one who owes me an apology.

He was watching me go to the bathroom.

Well, clearly he thinks
you're attractive, Lois.

It's a positive thing.

Thank you, Glenn,
for complementing our family.

We have had it with
his disrespect for women.

We're petitioning the city
to have him removed from the neighborhood.

Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby

into the world with him running around.

Okay, first of all, Bonnie, you've been
pregnant for, like, six years, all right?

Either have the baby or don't.

Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy.

He's just a little mixed up.

(GRUNTING)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(PETER PANTING)

Sorry about that.

Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy,

you know? He's just a little mixed up.

That's all. Come on.

Give him another chance, eh?

All right. But one more incident

like the one at the bowling alley

and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.

Now, don't worry about a thing, Quagmire.

Your pals are gonna
help you change your ways.

Uh, I don't know, Peter.
I'm not sure I can do this.

GLENN: Meg, get out of the way.

All right, Glenn,

this exercise should help
teach you self-control.

(FAN HUMMING)

Here's this month's
Victoria's Secret catalog.

Oh, oh, God. Oh, God.

Uh, uh, d... dead kittens. Dead kittens.

Uh, uh, old nuns. Uh, really old nuns.

Uh, Renee Zellweger. Oh, there we go.

-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

Oh, good. Good.

Peter, are you sure
Quagmire is ready to be out in public?

Nothing to worry about, Lois.

We figured out a foolproof
rehabilitation method.

I got the idea from when

Brian had to wear that cone
after his operation.

Okay, okay, if I make this,
we're all gonna get laid.

Ha ha! Yes! Score! Score!

BRIAN: Boy, I'd really like
to chew on my crotch right now.

Okay, Quagmire,
time to take off your training wheels.

(EXHALES) Okay, I think I'm ready.

(CHATTERING)

(GULPING)

-Oh, boy.
-What's the matter, Glenn?

Uh, nothing.

Oh, Stacy, you dropped
your pom pom in the water.

I'll get it for you. I'll come with you.

Me, too. But wait a minute,

we don't want to get our sweaters all wet.

Better take them off.

Splash fight!

(ALL GIGGLING)

(GROANING)

(STUTTERING) Oh, God.
Oh, oh, oh... I need... I need some air.

I need some air!

Aah, naked plastic chicks!

(SCREAMING)

Where... where am I? Am I dead?

No. This is where we monitor

all the dressing rooms in the mall

so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.

You don't say.

Oh, my God!
That one's having a heart attack!

(WOMEN EXCLAIM)

(BLOWING)

(COUGHING)

That was amazing. You saved her life.

Thank God you know CPR.

What the hell is CPR?

Congratulations, Quagmire.

You're the newest member
of my Wall of Fame.

What's wrong, Peter?

Oh, it's nothing, Joe. It's, I don't know.

It's just that all you guys have
something to be proud of, you know?

PETER: Quagmire got a key to the city.

Mort bowled a perfect game.

You're always getting medals
for catching crooks.

Hell, even Cleveland used to be
an accomplished auctioneer.

(SPEAKING RAPIDLY)
I have 125. Do I hear 130?

130,000 for this authentic
Comanche headdress?

I got 130. I got 130.

Do I hear 135? 140? Do I hear 140?

(SPEAKING SLOWLY) 135, going once.

I... I'm the only one here
who's got nothing, you know?

If... if I die tomorrow, there's nothing
people would remember me for.

Not if you jumped off a skyscraper

and landed on Joan Cusack.

People would say, "Hey, remember that guy

who landed on Joan Cusack?"

Well, things are gonna change.

From this day forth, people are gonna know
the name Peter Griffin,

even if I have to shout it
from the rooftops.

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYS)

You hear that, world?

I am gonna do something that
people will remember me for!

(YELPING)

(THUDS)

Oh, oh, God! Sorry, sorry.

Hey, Joan Cusack.

Hello?

Uh-oh.

Peter, if you'd just let me talk,

I'll explain to you
why you shouldn't do this.

Later. Later, Brian.

I gotta do something
people will remember me for,

which is why I've invented
a new type of flying machine.

You know, I vaguely recall
seeing footage somewhere

of something exactly like this

that, uh, leads me to believe
this probably won't work.

All right, Stewie. Let her rip.

(PROPELLER WHIRS)

(YELPS)

All right, we attack
the Rice Krispie guys at dawn,

assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.

Brian, this time,

I think I got just the thing
people will remember me for.

I am gonna stop pollution
with my new lovable character,

Gary the No-Trash Cougar.

(BANGING DOOR)

-(CHILDREN GASPING)
-Pick up your trash!

I want to know whose cup this is.

(GUN FIRES)

I said I want to know whose cup this is!

Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

Thank you, sweetie.

See what a nicer place this is
when we all pitch in?

Like Gary the No-Trash Cougar says,

"Give a larbage, throw out your garbage."

Spread the word.

(GUN FIRING)

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Those freaking elves, man.

They just came out of the trees, man.

They just came out of the trees.

You saved my ass back there.

You saved mine.

Here's to Snap.

To Snap.

Oh, this sucks.

I've been working
on this all week and I keep coming up dry.

Who am I kidding?

I'm never gonna
be remembered for anything.

Not like
my great-great-uncles, the Siamese twins

who fought each other in the Civil War.

I'm seceding.

Like hell you are.

Not too smart, huh?

Yeah, did not think that one through.

Peter, you have to stop

comparing yourself to other people

and find out what's special about you.

TOM (ON TV): In sadder news,

the man who held the Guinness World Record

for most drugs ever done

by a single human being died today.

He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs

he thought he saw.

Ooh, there you go, Peter.

You could break a world record.

What, are you nuts?
I got no special talents.

W... w... what can I do
that nobody else does?

Well, you just ate my tip.

I got it!

Peter, you're really
putting away those Mentos.

Oh, these aren't Mentos, Lois.

Everybody, you're looking at a guy

who's gonna set a new world record.

I am gonna eat more nickels

than anyone has ever eaten before.

Setting this world record
is gonna make me famous.

Just like the world's
fattest twins over there.

Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins?

Oh, that's not good for you.

(COINS JINGLING)

Dad, I just don't hear it.

Come on!

Really, Peter it just doesn't...

You're telling me that doesn't
sound like <i>Camptown Races?</i>

Not one bit.

(LAUGHING)

Do <i>Short People!</i>

Ugh, this is the worst use of money

since I tricked out my big wheel.

(STEREO PLAYING)

(BIG WHEEL APPROACHING)

Hey, ladies. Check out
this ride, huh? Yeah.

I'm off to make trouble
for the establishment.

Oh, my God. Lois, I can't see!

DR. HARTMAN: Uh, how about now?

No, nothing.

Well, that makes me feel much better.

You can't see the spaceship, either.

My cousin Marshall insists
if you look past the picture,

you can see a spaceship.

Can you please just tell us
what's wrong with my husband?

Oh, yes. Uh, well, you see,

after ingesting
such a large number of metal coins,

Mr. Griffin appears
to have succumbed to nickel poisoning,

causing him to lose his sight.

Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat.

I can't see a damn thing.

You know what else you can't see?
The writing on the wall.

Vaudeville's dead
and TV's the box they're gonna bury it in.

Back then, everybody had a specialty.
I, for one, am a tumbler.

Watch me leap through this big hoop.

Vamp! Vamp!

(PLAYING VAUDEVILLE MUSIC)

So we're all gonna have to pitch in

and help your father out
now that he's lost his sight.

Nobody took care of me
when I lost my arms and legs

and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb.

Hey, hey, Meg, they got
a <i>Happy Days</i> spoof in here,

but they call it <i>Crappy Days.</i>

(LAUGHING)

All right, you know what?

If you're not gonna laugh,
then I'm not gonna keep you company.

This sucks. Now the only thing

anybody's gonna remember
me for after I die

is being that blind guy.

Don't give up yet, Peter.

I mean, many blind people
lead rich, fulfilling lives.

(SIGHING) I don't know, Brian.

I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God! I almost didn't do it!

I almost didn't do it!

I thought, is this in bad taste?

But you know what? I went for it.

I went for it, and I am so glad I did.

Oh, worth it. Totally worth it.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Hey, you still awake, Lois, honey?

Dad?

That's right. I'm your daddy.

Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.
Don't talk, Lois. Don't talk.

Just let me do all the work. Yeah.

Now feel my warm breath
on the nape of your neck.

My hands on your big, soft boobs

running down your big manlike...

Holy crap, it's Chris.

Uh, uh, so, uh, how're you doing?

Did you do all your homework?

Finish all your subjects?

-Yes, sir.
-Good.

Just, uh, just checking.

Have a good night, son.

PETER: You still awake, honey?

STEWIE: What the deuce?

Peter, what the hell is that?

Ah, this is my seeing eye dog, Brutus.

What do you need a seeing eye dog for?

Well, because I can't do anything

for myself, Brian. I can't drive,

I don't know when to cross the street,

and I took a dump
in a church confessional,

which I guess they frown upon
if you're not homeless.

I thought I could deal
with being blind at first,

but I don't know.

I... I haven't felt this out of place

since that week I lived with Superman.

We must stop Lex Luthor
before he irradiates

the world's supply of gold.

Uh, hi. Uh, sorry.

I know you got a meeting
going on, but, um...

so we are officially
running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its.

So, um, just putting it out there.

If you're heading to the store later, uh,

you know, uh, 800-mile drive for me,

like, uh, five seconds for you.

Whatever. I'm not here.

Peter, this is something
you're still adjusting to.

You can't expect to
get used to it overnight.

Whatever you say, Brian.
I'm going to The Clam.

(DOOR OPENS)

Did Peter leave?

Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this.

Oh, I know. I'm so worried about him.

I've been looking into support groups
we could join to help him.

Are you... are...

are you not wearing makeup?

Oh, no, I just...

You know, since Peter went blind,

it's actually been kind of nice

not to have to worry about my appearance.

I see.

Is it really noticeable?

Well, a...
little mascara wouldn't kill you.

Huh, I was kind of thinking
I'd try an au naturel thing.

You think, uh, you think
you have the skin for that?

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Oh, uh, let me light that for you, babe.

(LIGHTNING AND THUNDER CRASHING)

Wow!

Yeah, magic fingers.

Oh, hey, you ever watch that show <i>Scrubs?</i>

Yeah, Lois had it on the other night

and I was kind of fading in and out.

But, uh, you know,
I was watching a-and I'm wondering,

which one is the funny guy?

(GRUNTS)

Peter, grab my hand!

Jeez, Horace, you been drinking?

Grab it and pull!

Come on, let's go.

And here comes the heroic blind man.

Tell us, sir, how did you
summon the courage

to save your friend
from that burning building?

That freaking place was on fire?

And there you have it.

Coming up next, watch me shave.

Oh, Peter, you're all right!

Oh, I am so proud of you
for saving Horace's life.

Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.

Huh. You know, Brian, I guess I was.

And you know what else?

People are gonna remember me for this.

Meg, you should ask him out.

I mean, you're the only one of us
who's ever had a real boyfriend.

I'm back. I brought another picnic.

You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.

You're so good with animals.

I guess I could give it a try.
All right, here goes.

Hi, Craig.

I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...

I don't know, go out sometime.

That's about as likely as me playing
by someone else's rules besides my own

which I would never do.

I play by my own rules, nobody else's.

Not even my own.

-How about a movie?
-I don't go out with dudes.

-Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
-Of course not, sweetie.

Yeah, where'd you get

-Craig Hoffman.
-Craig Hoffman said that?

Well, he's a sharp kid. You might be ugly.

There, there, let me dry those tears.

Yes, your anguish sustains me.

Meg, honey, don't let
those awful kids at school

make you feel bad about yourself.
I tell you what,

tomorrow you and I are gonna go out
and get you some brand new outfits.

Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans
that'll show off your cute butt, huh?

Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.

Guys, we were freaking electric.

Yeah, they loved us.
Gentlemen, this is a sign.

We are gonna start our own rock band.

-PETER: Who's with me?
-CLEVELAND: I'm in.

-JOE: I'm in.
-GLENN: I'm in.

Looks like the guys are gonna
form a rock band.

Maybe they'll learn a little something.

Stick around, you just might learn
something, too.

You know, Peter, just because you guys
entertained a bunch of drunken idiots

at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean
you have what it takes to form a band.

Brian, you're just ants at a picnic.
We're gonna be awesome.

Wait. What am I?

I'm ants at a picnic?
Is that what you just said?

I'm ants at a picnic? All right.
Just making sure.

Sorry I'm late, fellas.

Cool, Glenn. You look just like Tommy Lee.

Well, I figured it'd be appropriate
since I just found out I got hepatitis.

You know, maybe we should have
decided on outfits that matched.

Now we all look like a bunch of queers.

Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear

as long as you play kickass rock and roll
and do this with your tongue.

-Am I right, Gene?
-You got that right, Pete.

(LOIS GIGGLES)

LOIS: Oh, my. Hi, Gene.
I didn't know you were here.

All right.
Keep it in your mouth, rock star.

(BOYS WHISTLING)

-Great job getting hot, Meg.
-Gee, thanks.

-Hey, Meg.
-Hi, Craig.

Now that you're attractive,
how about we go out sometime?

Gosh, I'd love to.

Great, I'll pick you up whenever
I feel like it.

Hey, Meg. We noticed Craig Hoffman
just asked you out.

That makes you cool.
Wanna hang out with us?

-Wow. Sure.
-Hey, I'm here to pick you up.

Here we are, fellas. Our first major gig.

Peter, this is a house of corrections.

You gotta start somewhere, fellas.
That's how you evolve.

Like when the Tin Man found out
he was gay.

Oh, oh. Look what happened by accident.

I hear there's a lot of buzz
about this band.

Yeah, there was a pretty positive review
carved in Tony's ass.

All right, kids.
Now everyone stay together.

It's very important to your father

that we're here for his band's
first performance.

The people who beat you are proud
to present, all the way from Quahog...

Fat, Horny, Black and Joe.

-Hello, Cleveland!
-Hello, Peter.

One, two, three, four...

Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.

-You suck!
-Get off the stage!

What do we do?

I know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.

Giggity, giggity, giggity, gone.

Hey, how about a funny story
about Lake Wobegone?

It was the day
of the tuna hot-dish jamboree

Oh, no. Kids, your father's in trouble.

-I'm going up there.
-I'm coming, too, Mom.

Oh, my God.

The guy behind me braided my hair.

Chris, grab a guitar.
Brian, take the drums.

Here, Stewie, play with this.

Mom, can we please just get out of here?

-Oh, my God.
-Who is she?

God, I could strangle her all night long.

Boy, that's not healthy, is it?
That that's the first place I go to?

I just have a...

(BARKING)

God, I'm so sorry. I keep doing that.

God, please forgive me.

I get that from my father.
He's from a different generation.

-It's...
-Whatever, man.

-We cool? We good?
-Yeah, we're cool. Fine.

(GROWLS)

Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud

can you perform surgery on yourself?

Well, no, Chris. My degree's in optometry.

All right, Dr. Ditty.

I got three choices for you
for the name of the band:

Peter Griffin Starship,
Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers

or Testicular Sound Express.

I think the name is Meg.

-Me? Why?
-Yeah, why?

Let me explain
something to you, all right?

We got to get her half-naked
and put her out front, center stage.

And that's gonna make y'all billionaires

because America loves
hot, white jailbait ass.

Wait a minute.

That's the smartest thing I've ever heard

anyone say about anything.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg
being exploited that way.

Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
I want to be exploited.

Meg, don't you talk to me like that.

Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket
just as much as I love Chris and Stevie

but business is business.
So, let's get this show on the road, huh?

Good. Now, I just need you to sign this.

(BARKING)

Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

Oh, my God. That is not me.

That's not who I am. I vote Democrat.

It will not happen again.

You...

Yeah, so, hey, check it out.

Stewie and I have been working
on some stuff of our own.

And we thought there might be a place
for us to sing on the next album.

Hey, cool. You're busy. No sweat.

Boy, <i>Benson</i> was a funny show.

-I'll talk to you later.
-Well, what did he say?

He said he'd think about it.
Okay, so where were we?

Okay.

Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.

-Excuse me, young lady?
-Did I freaking stutter?

-I said more Skittles.
-All right. That is it, Meg.

You know, ever since you got that makeover

you've developed a terrible attitude.

And all the success with the family band
is only making it worse.

The family band?

You know, maybe you haven't noticed,
Lois, but I am the band.

-Right, Missus Wong?
-Yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.

Peter, we have to do something.
We're losing our daughter.

I'm worried about what's happening to her.

Lois, this is the kind of thing

that always resolves itself
if you just ignore it, all right?

What's more important is
we're living the sweet life.

This is even more fun than
when I performed at the White House.

Mr. President,
I present to you Peter Griffin.

Meg, you and your family are gonna
perform on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

You mean I'm gonna get to meet
John Belushi and Gilda Radner

and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley,
and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!

Wow! <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

I can't think of anything more exciting.

Oh, my God, a water fountain!

(LAUGHING)

Hey, Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.

It's great to finally meet you.
I'm hosting.

Why don't you come hang out
in my dressing room?

-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

Come on, let's go.

Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
She's spiraling out of control.

I mean, what if she develops
a coke problem?

No Coke. Pepsi.

-(LAUGHING)
-(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)

Come on, you set me up for that one.

Wow, Jimmy.

That was everything
<i>Ladies Home Journal</i> said it would be.

Awesome, great, thanks.

You know, there's something I...

There's something I gotta tell you.

Being with you just made me feel
so... a-live from New York...

it's <i>Saturday Night!</i>

TV HOST: <i>It's</i> Saturday Night Live.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, that wasn't a very good
opening sketch, was it?

-A rare miss.
-I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.

Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.

Wait a minute.

Are you telling me
that my daughter was deflowered

in front of one-and-a-half times
the <i>Mad TV</i> audience?

My poor baby.

My God, Lois, you were right.

Why the hell didn't I see it coming?

All right, stand aside.
It's about time I did my fatherly doody.

(LAUGHS) I said doody but no time
to laugh about it now.

Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.

So we got a great show tonight and...

Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.

And this is for laughing
and looking at the camera

during every sketch you've ever been in.

Who do you think you are? Carol Burnett?

You think because she did it,
it's okay for you?

You haven't earned what she's earned,
buddy.

All right, now where's the guy
who slept with my daughter?

I'm so glad to be the real me again.

It's too much work being beautiful.

Not for me, but it's good
to have you back, pumpkin.

Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

Listen, thanks, everybody.
I had a great time tonight.

I want to thank Jimmy Fallon
for being such a good sport.

Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris,
the guys from the prison

Counting Crows.

If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
Goodnight, everybody!

Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!

TV HOST: From the world famous
Apollo Theater in Harlem...

<i>it's show time at the...</i>

What? I'm tired.

It has nothing to do with the fact
that it's a black show.

when Joe was drowning.

Now, be quiet and pay attention.

Hi, there. I'd like to
welcome you all to CPR

I see a lot of smiles here in this room.

There's one.

Oh, there's another.

That's good.

I see that soda up under your chair.

That's all right.

Now, who wants to go first?

No takers? Well, fine. I'll go first.

Peter, why don't you volunteer?

Oh, no, I don't volunteer
for anything since I helped those guys

repaint the <i>Sistine Chapel.</i>

was kind of lame, so I put this up.

we just did that. Hmm.

I've got to check
if you've soiled yourself.

Get off me! Are you crazy?

Sir? I'm gonna need you

-I've got to get these trousers off.
-Somebody call the cops!

I gotta see if you've soiled yourself.

Nobody asked you
to get involved! You idiot!

Get off him, you jackass!

Sir, I'm gonna need you to step back.

All right, looks like
we're clean down here.

You guys take it easy.
No need to thank me.

Just pay it forward.

So they revoked your CPR card, huh?

Yeah. I tell you, this is worse
than when they took away my library card

for reading while intoxicated.

Oh, don't be
ashamed of your hand, Johnny Tremain.

You still live in exciting times.

Oh, crap!

Sir, do you know how loud
you were reading?

"The life of a silversmith's apprentice
was not an easy one."

(SCREAMING)

I got to figure out some way
to get that card back.

Well, you could always
take the class again.

I mean, I'm sure
they'd give you another card.

(LORETTA SCREAMING)

-Hey, do you hear that?
-What?

Sounds like someone screaming.

What is it, boy?
What are you trying to say?

It sounds like Loretta is screaming.

Trouble at the old mill?

-What are you, insane?
-Somebody fall through the ice?

-It's summer.
-Bobcat?

-Loretta's in trouble?

Peter Griffin,

We should go.

Boy, that was embarrassing, huh?

Walking in on
Loretta and Cleveland having sex.

Peter, that wasn't, uh...

You know, for a large, heavyset black guy,

Cleveland's got a cute, little white ass.

That wasn't Cleveland.
It was some white guy.

What was that?

Shut up and put some more
of that sugar in my bowl.

Wait a minute. Brian?

If that wasn't Cleveland
doing it with Loretta,

then Loretta's having an affair.

Oh, we can't tell anyone about this.

That is the last thing
in the world we want to do.

What a day! We've done
everything in the world.

So, I guess the only thing
left to do is tell you

that Loretta Brown is having an affair.

-Oh, no!

And I am sorry.

Yeah, huh, any idea who it was, Peter?

No, we didn't see his face.

(SIGHING)

All we know is it's a skinny white guy

with a tattoo on his left butt cheek.

Well, I better tell Cleveland.

I got a knack for delivering bad news.

I don't know how to
tell you this, Mr. Devanney.

So, listen, Cleveland.

The reason I asked you out here,

I've been
wanting to talk to you about something.

In <i>Superman II,</i>

what is the story with that cellophane S

that Superman rips off his chest
and throws at the bad guy?

Prepare to be destroyed, Superman!

GENERAL ZOD: (GROANS)

-What was that?
-Yeah, take that, you jerk.

That was a minor inconvenience.

Yeah, well, that's the idea.
Slowed you down.

I'll say. Ow.

-Didn't see that coming, did you?
-No.

Yeah, well, you know, take that.

Which actually brings me to my next point:

-Your wife's cheating on you.
-What?

Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story.

True story.

Brian and I walked into your house

and, she was with some guy going,

bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

-Um, Peter, maybe...
-Hang on, I'm not done.

Bam, bam, bam!

And then she's all, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."

Bam, bam, bam!

You want to take it from here, Bamm-Bamm?

Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

-You want to take it from here, Emeril?
-Bam!

So that's what we're dealing with here.
Any thoughts?

Loretta, is it true what they're saying?

Were you really having carnal relations
with another gentleman?

I'm a woman, Cleveland.
I need some passion in my life.

I need a real man.
And Lord knows that ain't you.

Well, I admit after a long day at work

I don't always come home

with that "Reunite on ice,
that's nice" mentality.

And for that, I apologize.

Apologize? I cheat on you
and you apologize to me?

Cleveland Brown, you are pathetic!

I disagree, but I respect your candor.

Good-bye, Cleveland.

I love you.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, hi, Cleveland.

Hey, what are you doing here?

Oh, Loretta kicked me out.

Oh, Cleveland, I am so sorry.

You can stay here as long as you like.

Cleveland, sit down.

I want to sing a little song that, uh,
kept me going when I had troubles.

(INTRO TO THE B-52'S ROCK LOBSTER)

(SINGING) <i>We were at the beach</i>

<i>Everybody had matching towels</i>

<i>Somebody went under a dock</i>

<i>And there they saw a rock</i>

<i>But it wasn't a rock</i>

<i>It was a rock lobster</i>

<i>Rock lobster</i>

<i>Rock lobster</i>

(SHEEPISH GIGGLING)

Yeah, you're gonna be okay.

Now, everybody, Cleveland's gonna be

staying with us for a few days.

That's right, kids.
So just treat him like one of the family.

You mean like Cousin Janine
who we're polite to,

but then mock her diabetes
on the drive home?

(LAUGHS) She can't eat caramel.

(LAUGHING) Exactly.

Can I touch your hair?

I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna touch it.

(GIGGLES IN DELIGHT) It's like a sheep!

You know, Peter,
I'm a little worried about Cleveland.

His wife cheated on him,
kicked him out of the house,

and he doesn't seem at all affected by it.

He's probably bottling up his emotions.
That's not good for you.

Right. I almost got an ulcer
after you shelled out $200 for tickets

to <i>Crossing Over</i><i>with John Edward.</i>

I'm sensing an "A."
Does your name begin with an "A"?

-No.
-A "B"?

-No.
-C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P?

"P"! Peter! My name's Peter!

Is your name Peter?

Wow, you are some kind of sorcerer.

What Cleveland really needs right now

is to learn how to express his feelings.

No, what he needs right now
is a revenge lay.

And I know just who to talk to.

(WHIRRING)

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, God!

Huh. Sorry, guys.
Let me throw something on.

(GASPS)

Peter, look!

Holy crap, that's the tattoo!

Well, I think we're about to find out
who the culprit is.

5-5-5-0-1-4-3.

-Peter, I...
-Shut up, Brian! I'm sleuthing.

(PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-Quagmire?

-Yeah.
-Hey, it's Peter.

What's going on, buddy?
We're at your house.

Peter, he's the one we saw

-sleeping with Loretta!
-Oh, my God!

Damn it, I knew this was gonna happen!

Look, I didn't mean it,
you know? I knew it was a mistake!

It never felt right!
Please don't tell Cleveland!

Well, all right, Quagmire.

Cleveland, Quagmire's sleeping
with your wife!

-What?
-Quagmire slept with Loretta?

Oh, my God, Cleveland!

I am so sorry.

I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

-It's okay.
-It's okay?

It's okay to be betrayed
by your wife and best friend?

Better it be Quagmire

than someone she could get a disease from.

Cleveland, don't you see?

This is why your wife left you.

You don't have any passion.

Sometimes a woman
wants to see her man be a man.

You got to push back a little!

You got to get a little rough!

-Oh, God! Peter, hit me!
-Yeah!

(SCREAMING)

Wow, so, that's something,

about Quagmire and Loretta, huh?

Cleveland, we got to get
your manhood back.

Now, the first thing
we're gonna do is take you to a good,

old-fashioned, wrestling match.

(WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA SYSTEM)

(CROWD CHEERING)

All right, Cleveland.
Nothing like a good smackdown

to get the testosterone going.

I must be in Quahog 'cause all I see

is a bunch of hicks!

(CROWD BOOING)

Oh, you take that back,
Macho Man Randy Savage!

Oh, don't he make you so mad you just
want to go down there and hit him?

No.

Well, maybe not him
'cause he's kind of big.

But don't you want to hit
the guy sitting next to you?

Well, not him
'cause he's kind of big, too.

But don't you want to hit his kid?

Take that, Macho Man
Randy Savage. You jerk.

All right, Cleveland. If this doesn't
light a fire in your belly, nothing will.

Hey, look at me. I'm Quagmire.

I had sex with your wife.

Giggity-giggity giggity-giggity.

(LAUGHING)

Those are so his mannerisms.

-Peter, what the hell are you doing?
-I'm not Peter, I'm Quagmire.

-And I'm doing you, Loretta.
-What the hell?

-Oh, you like that? Yeah. Yeah.
-Hey!

Much better than Cleveland.
You sweet thing.

Hey, Peter, knock it off!

-Get you damn hands off me you son of a...
-You like it dirty, don't you?

-Easy girl. Easy.
-What the hell are you doing?

-What is that in your pocket?
-Cleveland can't satisfy you.

-Lois! Somebody!
-Quagmire's got you. Yeah.

(GROWLING)

Glenn Quagmire,

you're dead!

(POPEYE THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

(TOOTING)

(GROWLING)

All right, all right.
Calm down, Cleveland.

I'm gonna kill Quagmire!

Oh, God, you're hyperventilating!
Chris, get me a bag.

Okay, Cleveland,
breathe into the bag. It'll calm you down.

-Uh, Peter, I'm not sure that's...
-Not now, Lois!

Okay, Cleveland, relax.

Relax.

There you go.

There you go. Okay.

Shh-shh-shh.

It's okay.

It's all gonna be okay.

Peter, you better do your CPR

There's no time, Lois.
I got to go warn Quagmire

while I got the chance.
Quick, to the Peter-copter!

(ENGINE REVVING)

(SCREAMING)

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Ow!

Peter, what the hell?

Joe, get inside!
The blades are still spinning!

Oh, my God, Peter!

-What is that thing?
-Joe! Get inside!

-It's tearing up my yard!
-Oh, God!

-Oh, my God!
-No, no!

(SCREAMING)

(SIGHING)

Oh, Joe,

-I am sorry, buddy.
-It's okay.

-Are you okay? You all right?
-Look, it's okay.

-It's okay, I'm fine.
-Oh, boy.

-Everybody's fine.
-Oh, that was scary.

-Peter, what are we doing here?
-Trust me, Quagmire.

Cleveland will never think
to look for you at Mayor West's house.

Hey, there. How you doing?

Good evening, gentlemen.

Listen, Mayor West, my friend
Quagmire here's in trouble.

He needs a place to stay tonight.

Say no more. I'll protect you, sir.

It is my job. I only ask
that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie,

as he's already eaten and might throw up.

Well, Derwood,

now you really are
the big man of the house.

Mother, change him back.

You know, Endora, uh,
I'm getting a little sick of this crap.

You ever seen one of these? Huh?

-You know what this is? Huh?
-No!

Yeah, it's holy water. Huh? Yeah.

-(SCREAMING)
-Try it. Yeah? How's that feel? Huh?

You like that? Huh?
Power of Christ compels you, bitch.

I hate <i>Bewitched.</i>

(GROWLING)

STEWIE: Hey, so that's
a pretty reasonable reaction, huh?

It's all right to go to sleep, my friend.
I'll stand guard.

Uh, okay.

Don't worry. I'll be here all night.

Just don't try
to make me smile. I'm forbidden to smile.

Oh, no. Huh.

That episode of <i>Growing Pains</i>
when Mike's friend Boner

ran for student council. (CHUCKLING)

Boner. His name was Boner.

(CHUCKLING)

(SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHING)

I've failed you.

Yeah, this is
kind of creeping me out. I'm gonna go.

Take this, for protection.

What the hell's this for?
When the time comes,

you'll know.

I'll teach him to mess with my wife.

Oh, hi, Cleveland.

Will, uh, you be joining us for dinner?

(GROWLING)

-Okay, then.
-He's a wrecking machine!

Peter, we have got to do
something about Cleveland.

I think you created a monster.

Well, there's only one thing to do, Lois.

We've got to get
Loretta and Cleveland back together.

And I know just how to do it.

To the Hinden-Peter!

(ENGINE ROARING)

(EXPLOSION)

JOE: Oh, my God!

PETER: Joe, I am so sorry.

JOE: How can you afford these things?

(PHONE BEEPING)

Yeah, Cleveland,
this is Quagmire. Uh, listen,

I feel awful.

Why don't you come on over
and we can try to get things back

to the way they used to be?
Remember how it was?

Perhaps here there are
many unsuspecting foxes

to have sex with us.

That is why we wear tight pants

to show our bulges.

-We are...
-BOTH: Two wild and crazy guys!

You guys look stupid.

Anyway, let's talk this thing through.

(THUNDER CRACKING)

Oh, hey, Cleveland.

I was just leaving you a message.

You violated the sanctity of my marriage.

(FRIGHTENED SHOUTS)

Oh, this is awful!

Somebody stop them! Do something!

Good.

Let the hate flow through you.

You're not helping!

Oh, I can't.

It isn't in me to cause harm to anyone.

No matter how much someone has harmed me.

I'm sorry, Cleveland.

Cleveland, I think this beautiful woman

would like to say something to you.

You told me this was Lois' intervention.

Nice. Cleveland?

Loretta, what you did was unforgivable.

This marriage is over.

Well, that's just fine, Cleveland.

'Cause I am through being your wife.

Well, I may not be perfect,

but I deserve better than you.

Look at that, Lois.

As beautiful as
an <i>HBO</i> minority fairy tale.

But, Peter, their marriage is ending.

Well, look at the bright side, Lois.

It's a chance for a fresh start
for both Cleveland and Lor...

(SCREAMING)

Oh, my God!

What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

What the hell, man?

-Hurts, doesn't it? What the hell... yes!
-What the hell's your problem?

-My friend?
-What?

You've been kicked in the nuts.

-(PEOPLE CHEERING)
-No way!

(LAUGHING) You're gonna be on TV.

Oh, sweet!

-Oh, my God.
-Wow! We love that show.

Oh, that is awesome. Hey, hi.

-You're on it.
-Oh, wow.

Glenn, you sure you want to do this?

I already told you I forgive you.

No, I feel like I got off too easy.

All right. If you insist.

You wanna ring the bell, Apollo?

All right.

than last Saturday

no luck yet finding Osama bin Laden.

You just do a little better each time.

Oh, I forgot to
pick up the paintball guns.

Well, we could use these.
I brought them from the office.

Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns

Oh, God, I can picture them now,

That's right, Peter, they are red.

Lois, what are you doing?

Well, Lois, since you asked, I find
this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic.

What is this,
you're gonna talk down to everyone

just because you won a game
of <i>Trivial Pursuit?</i>

Perhaps.

Okay, you know what?
Fine, you are a genius, Peter.

As a matter of fact,
let's make it official.

You ever heard

Perhaps.

Well, if you qualify as a genius

just to sit around

Wow! Imagine what a genius like me
could do with all that money.

Well, here they are, Brian.
My test results. Read them and weep.

Peter, according to this,
you're not a genius.

In fact, you're mentally retarded.

Oh, yeah?
Well, would a mentally retarded guy

have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver
to level half of his house

Uh... Maybe.

Uh-oh.

(ENGINE WHIRRING)
(BREAKS SQUEALING)

(SLURRING) Congratulations.

So, as you can see, you are just
over the line of mental retardation.

Don't you mean, just under the line?

The day I'm corrected by a...

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just please trust the analysis.

Hello. Sally?

Hey, it's Peter Griffin.

That's right, senior prom.
Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.

So, listen.

I just found out I'm retarded.

And I'm just calling to let you know

you might want to get yourself tested.

Hello?

Peter, mental retardation usually happens
before you're born.

It isn't something you can catch.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

Well, excuse me for being retarded.

My whole world
has been turned upside down.

Black is east, up is white.

You know, Peter, I hate to say "I told you
so" about not being a genius, but,

yeah! In your...face...wad.

I'm sorry about that.

I can't believe this is happening to me.
I can never go back to school again.

Oh, yes, Meg, yes.

Yes, everything was going
swimmingly for you until this.

Yes, this is the thing
that will ruin your reputation.

Not your years of grotesque appearance
or awkward social graces,

or that Felix Unger-ish way
you clear your sinuses.

No, it's this.

Do you hear yourself talk?
I might kill you tonight.

Peter, you're still you.

No piece of paper from the city
is gonna tell me

you're any different
from the man I married.

And your life's not gonna change
because of it.

(CLANKING)

-What is that?
-(CLANGING)

Oh, my God, what are they doing?

Why are they trying
to publicly humiliate me like this?

Ooh, Shiny red ball.

-(BREAKS SCREECHING)
-LOIS: (GASPS) Peter, watch out!

So what can I do for you, Peter?

Well, Joe, I need to talk to you
about something kind of personal.

-Shoot.
-Well, you know, I took this test

and it sort of turns out
that I'm technically mentally retarded.

And, I just wanted to ask

how do you deal with it?

-Deal with what?
-You know, with being retarded.

Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped.

Now you're just splitting hairs.

Griffin. Party of two.

Oh, Mr. Griffin, we've been expecting you.

Peter, relax. It's for liability reasons.

Now, let's just try to enjoy our meal.

I kind of get the helmet.
But what's with the water wings?

Well, you did order the soup.

Like something could happen...

you're not even gonna call the cops?

Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago?
I'm retarded.

Aw, you're just curious.

Well, let me show you
how everything works down there.

Hey, everyone.

Say hello to my state-appointed
inspirational social worker, Vern.

It's truly a pleasure to meet you all.

Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself
one super family.

High five! All right!

(EXCITED LAUGHTER)

So, Vern, what exactly is it that you do?

I'm here to lend a hand
to my main man, Peter.

-Right, Peter?
-Right.

-High five! All right!
-(EXCITED LAUGHTER)

(GOBBLING)
Done.

-Peter!
-What? I don't know any better.

Peter, I don't like this.

You are really starting to take advantage
of this whole situation.

Peter's just expressing himself.

High five for expressing yourself, Peter.

High five! All right!

(EXCITED LAUGHTER)

This man seems bent on diluting
the already watered-down significance

of the elevated hand slap.

-Hey, Stewie, high five.
-Well, it's about time.

-Psych.
-Damn!

I look even more foolish
than when I was at that cocktail party.

All right, you're gonna love this. So...
Hang on a sec.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Okay, so these two black guys walk
into a bar, and the bartender looks...

Hey, what are you guys talking about?

Oh, I was just telling a joke.

So, the bartender looks around and says,

"What'll you two fine gentlemen have?"

And they paid their tab
and couldn't have been more courteous.

All right, my first trip to a fast-food
joint as a retarded guy.

Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.
Special needs.

Yeah, I'll have a... Is this thing on?

Attention, restaurant customers.
Testicles. That is all.

Give me that.

Sorry, folks. Oh, my God.
Is that what my voice sounds like?

It's all whiney and nasally. Ugh.

You know what?
I'm just gonna get my own food.

-LOIS: Peter, get back here.
-No freaking way.

The fryolator. I am so taking this.

-(GROANS)
-(METAL CREAKING)

-(LOIS SCREAMING)
-Uh-oh.

Lois, you look worse than
that Rocky Dennis kid from <i>Mask.</i>

Rocky, I don't even know
what you look like.

-Can I touch your face?
-Of course, Diana.

Oh, God.

Oh, God. What is this?

What is all this?

Am I touching the outside of a house?

Oh, God! You're a monster.

I'm beautiful on the inside.

Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit.

What is this now?
Does your face have a pelvis?

Oh, God, what have I done?
I'm the worst husband ever.

Make that the worst father ever.

Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services.
I'm here to take your kids away.

What? Why?

Because you're mentally unfit
to take care of them.

No way!

-Oh, my God.
-Finally.

I can't believe they took the kids away.

Well, at least Cleveland offered
to take care of them.

Sorry you have to share a bed, boys.
I'm a little short on space.

Have a good sleep.

STEWIE: Hey, Chris,

whatever happened to Geena Davis?

She used to be in movies,
but she's not in movies anymore.

She's attractive enough

but when she smiles, you see too much gum.

Not a good tooth-to-gum ratio.

Chris?

I'll tell you tomorrow.

Thanks for letting my friends sleep over,
Mr. Brown.

No problem, Meg.

If y'all get hungry,
there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.

I'm gonna get me a spoonful now
before y'all have at it.

Oh, my God.
Craig Hoffman's new car is so cool.

Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color.

Really? What color is it?

It's like blue, kind of blue-green.

It's the same color as his eyes.

Oh, wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it.

I heard he bought it from his dad.

Yeah, I remember his dad
dropped him off at school in it

one time when he was a freshman.

-Doesn't his dad live in Hartford?
-I think so.

My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford.

They have a mall there that's pretty cool.
It's part underground.

Oh, that's awesome.

Damn it, you guys are boring
the crap out of me.

Stupid, mindless chatter, is what it is.

You know what I'm gonna do?

I'm just gonna go back to my place
and rent a dirty movie.

This is ridiculous.

That was weird. Oh, well.
Hey, let's compare breasts.

Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey?

Listen, there's no toilet paper
in the bathroom

so, I'm just gonna...

(RUSTLING) There we go.

(TOILET FLUSHING)

PETER: Oh, God. Hang on!

Well, the doctors still don't know how
much longer she's gonna have to be here.

I feel horrible, Brian.

I put Lois in the hospital, and I lost the
kids.

This is turning out worse
than Stewie's iPod commercial.

<i>Shooting at the walls of heartache</i>

<i>Bang, bang</i>

<i>I am the warrior</i>

<i>Well, I am the warrior</i>

Peter, you just need to show
what a good father you are.

Then you can get
the kids back from Cleveland.

Wait a second, Brian. You're right.

And the best way to do that is to show
what a terrible father Cleveland is.

This plan is so perfect, it's retarded.

Good evening. I'm Dan Rather.

And tonight on CBS News,

seven Saudi soldiers sodomize

several of Saddam's
southern settlement squatters.

(WHISTLING)

I'm Dan Rather.

All right, come on, ladies.
Right this way.

This'll show them
that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.

So, tell me, is there any tread left
on the tires at all?

Or at this point, would it be like
throwing a hot dog down a hallway?

Oh, my Lord. Look who's here.

Agent Jessup,
look at all these prostitutes.

<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven</i>

Seven. Seven prostitutes.

This is a shakedown.

Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work.

Yeah. Peter, you and five
of those prostitutes, get out.

So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin,
you've inspired me

to distrust
all mentally challenged parents.

Thank you, Your Honor.

And thank you, Agent Jessup,
for your comically misleading remarks.

Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say
in your defense

as to why this court should return custody
of your children to you?

Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand my surprise witness,

The Ghost That Never Lies.

ALL: (EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE)

But I'm the only one
who can see him and hear him.

So, I'll let everyone know
what he's saying and doing.

Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous.

Overruled. I'll allow it.

You better be going somewhere
with this, Mr. Griffin.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Ghost That Never Lies,

did you witness the events
that took place on that fateful day?

You did? Well, how interesting.

And, do you see the culprit or culprits
in this courtroom today?

You do?

Well, would you kindly
point him or them out for this court?

Don't point at me, you jackass!

Well, if there's nothing further,
I hereby sentence...

Wait, Your Honor,
here is something further.

Look, I know I screwed up big time.

But I only did it
so I could get my kids back.

I love them.

And I think it's a bum rap
that just because I'm retarded

that makes me an unfit parent.

There are plenty of unfit parents
out there who aren't retarded

but they get to keep their kids.

Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford.
I think the Ramsey's still got one left.

I just want them back, Your Honor,
and you're the only one who can help me.

What do you say?

Are you kidding? You're a monster.

In fact, if I could,

I would put you in a place where you
would be removed from the general public.

Perhaps locked in a big, secure building
with other dangerous people

for a pre-determined period of time

based on the nature and degree
of your offense.

Unfortunately, as far as I know,
no such place exists.

So I have no choice but to set you free.

Does that mean I get my kids back?

Absolutely not. Case closed.

Oh, crap!

Oh, it was prison you were
thinking of. Prison.

Oh, I already banged the hammer.

ANNOUNCER: And now,
back to <i>Jake and the Fatman.</i>

Hey, look over here on the carpet.
That's a cigarette butt.

This is probably evidence.

Uh. (BREATHING HEAVILY)

What do you think was in that Danish?

You think it was cheese?

(WHEEZING)

'Cause I got a little problem with cheese.

Hey, I'm talking about evidence here.
There's lipstick on it.

Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me?

I can't move it. This is a crime scene.

(SIGHS) Well, can you describe it to me?

You know what? Forget it.
I'll take care of this, okay?

Oh, no. No, no, no. Just...
(INHALES DEEPLY)

Just let me close my eyes for a minute.

Look, I know his wife is a smoker.

Just yesterday,
when we saw her at the country club

she had a cigarette in her hand.

(SNORING)

What, so that's it, Peter?
You're just giving up?

I don't know what else to do, Brian.

I guess we're never
gonna be a family again.

-Hi, Peter.
-Oh, my God, Lois.

-You're all better.
-That's right.

And the doctors say I'll smell like
French fries for the next six months.

I'll enjoy that.

And, Peter, I got a surprise for you.

You got the kids back.

I love you so much,
delicious French-fry wife.

Now we can live with you again
even though you're a dangerous retard.

Don't say retard, Chris.
We prefer to be called, little people.

Because there's nothing wrong
with being mentally challenged.

In fact, I've learned
that we are superior people.

Above all you dumb brainy smarties.

Someday, you will beg us for mercy
and we will consider it.

Isn't it wonderful
that everything's back to normal?

Yeah.

Oh, God. Nobody move.

-(GASPS) What is it?
-Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it.

Because you can't just

You got to get out and meet some women.

Well, I suppose I could give it a try.

Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black
and then have to make

a difficult decision regarding
whether or not to go back?

Sorry, I went burnt sienna

Ready, baby? Who's this clown?

Open up, Stewie.
The airplane's coming in for a landing.

I guess the pilot must have been
JFK Junior.

Even I found that to be in bad taste.

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God!
Look at the size of that pimple.

You're like a circus freak!

I'm kidding.
You're just becoming a man, sweetie.

Yeah. I remember when I became a man.

The operation was a success.
What are you gonna go by now?

Peter.

You know, Chris, we'll have to
do something about that.

But I don't wanna get rid of my zit.

I like him. He's my friend.
His name is Doug.

I just wish I didn't have to look at it.

We have to look at your anus all day.

Thank you.

<i>The Bachelorette</i> comes to Quahog
in search of male contestants.

Story at 11:00.

Well, actually, that was pretty much it.

But there will be other stuff, too.

Look, I'm turning down the thermostat.

See Diane's erect nipples at 11:00.

Oh, my God!
<i>The Bachelorette</i> is coming to Quahog.

That's, like, my favorite show ever.

Meg, how can you watch that crap?

That show is not reality. It's all staged.

It's a complete mockery
of human relationships.

You know, this could be the perfect way
for Cleveland to meet Mrs. Right.

I got to tell him. Hey, Cleveland.

Joe? Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
I meant to call Cleveland.

No, I just wanted to tell him something.

No, I'd like to talk to you, too.
It's just that...

Fine. I'll call you after
I talk to Cleveland.

I don't feel obligated. I want to.

You're a good pimple, Doug.

Feed me.

(GASPS) You can talk?

That's right.
And we're gonna raise some hell.

All right! Raise some hell!

Yeah!

(LAUGHS)

(FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING)

Yay! (LAUGHS)

(CRASHES)

So, why would you be a good candidate
on <i>The Bachelorette?</i>

<i>I would be perfect for your show...</i>

<i>because I know</i>
<i>how to talk dirty to the ladies.</i>

<i>Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That feels so good.</i>

<i>Spit in my mouth.</i>

200 auditions and nothing.

We still got one guy waiting.

You lined up 201 auditions?
What a weird number.

You're weird.

Peter, I can't do this.
I am too nervous. I got to go.

No, Cleveland,
I'm not gonna let you do this.

I'll tie you down, if I have to.

Peter, this is only making it worse.

Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in.

It's all right. It's okay.
It's the fabric.

It's your clothes.
Let's get your clothes off.

Peter, what's wrong with you? I am naked!

Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry.

Here. You know what?
Look, Cleveland, look.

See? Now you're not alone, Cleveland.

Let me out of here!
I need to get out of here.

Cleveland, no, you're staying.
This is for your own good.

Oh, my God!

Hi, we're here for the interview.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Excuse me. Hi. Listen, I just wanted
to apologize for Peter.

He was just trying to help out his friend.

You see, his wife left him
and he's been kind of lonely...

confused about what he really wants.

-What's your name?
-Brian.

Congratulations, Brian.
You're gonna be on <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

Really? You're sure
you don't want to reconsider my friend?

Let me see.

Oh, that ain't bad!

Brian, I can't believe
you're gonna be on <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

Yeah, I thought you said
those shows were stupid.

They are stupid.

But I figured I got a few days
of free booze and free food

before they kick me off.
I could use a vacation.

Oh, yes, because you've got
such a heavy workload around here.

How you coming on that novel
you're working on, huh?

Got a big stack of papers there?

Got a nice little story
you working on there?

The big novel you've been working on
for three years, huh?

Got a compelling protagonist?

Got an obstacle for him to overcome?

Little story brewing there? Working on?

Working on that for quite some time, huh?

Talking about that three years ago.
Been working on that the whole time?

Nice little narrative.
Beginning, middle, and end.

Some friends become enemies,
some enemies become friends?

At the end your main character
is richer for the experience? Yeah?

No, you deserve some time off.

I am super excited.
You think she'll be hot?

-i bet she'll be hot.
-i think she'll be hot, too.

No way! So do i!

-Quagmire.
-Hey, Brian!

-How did you get on the show?
-I had to do a few favors.

I got to get on that show.
Come on, I'll do anything.

Anything?

-Yeah.
-All right.

-Okay, you're ready?
-Yep.

Okay, check under the bed.

-No, nothing.
-Check in the closet.

No, no monsters in here.

Now check the bathroom.

-No, none in here, either.
-Okay, good.

-So, can I be on <i>The Bachelorette?</i>
-Yeah. Goodnight.

Peter, I'm getting
a little worried about Chris.

All he does lately is sit alone
in his room talking to that zit.

Relax, Lois. What's a zit gonna do?

Talk to him and tell him to
sneak out of the house and cause trouble?

Now light it, ring the doorbell,
and run like hell!

-I don't know about this, Doug.
-Just do it!

Oh, good Lord!

Is that... Doody!

I'm doing the dishes, Joe.
I'll change you in a minute.

Trevor, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.

I wasn't too nervous.
When I am nervous I work out.

I wasn't working out,
so I must not have been nervous.

I was very pleased and surprised.

I really was not expecting an open bar.

Top-shelf booze, I tell you.

And this guy knew his stuff.
Made me a Mojito.

(SLURPING)

I don't think it's a gay drink.

Mojito!

Hey, guys.
Well, it's been great to meet you all.

And I am looking forward
to getting to know you while we're here.

GLENN: Giggitty, giggity,
giggity, giggity.

-MAN: Dude, put your pants on.
-GLENN: Shut up.

Well, I really like all the guys.

But some of them
seem a little too competitive.

I got to tell you. I don't know what she
would possibly see in Count Chocula.

I think he's just here
because he's a minority.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

(SPRAYING)

You were right, Doug. Mischief is fun.

We're the best pals since the <i>Snorks.</i>

I am having a really great time.

Me, too. I really value our friendship.

You're not like those other Snorks
who only want one thing.

Oh, that was clumsy. Hang on a second.

Gentlemen, it's time
for the first rose ceremony.

Who gets to stay,
and who takes the bus ride home...

it's up to Brooke.

-Trevor.
-That's what Trevor's talking about.

Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine?

-Sure.
-Hi, Jesus!

No way!

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

Hello. I know. I saw.

Glenn.

(SIGHS)

-Brian.
-What? Are you serious?

I feel like I didn't get
to know you at all.

-Would you accept this rose?
-All right.

But I think this whole thing is about
as pointless as Peter's cow-kite.

(LAUGHING)

This is never gonna work. Damn cow.
Cleveland, what am I doing wrong?

You got to get her running
before you start running.

Chris.

Chris, honey, can I talk to you?

Oh, my God, he's gone!

That means this room is mine now.

I am gonna party my ass off in here.

Great pot, Stewie.

Yeah, I got it from
our cleaning lady's boyfriend.

It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna
use the money to get a mammogram.

Chris, where have you been?

Doug told me I don't need
to listen to you.

Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it!

First thing tomorrow, we're going down
to Goldman's Pharmacy...

and get some astringent
to get rid of that thing.

What did I tell you?
She's trying to drive us apart.

We can't let that happen.

I am in no mood.

Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch
and our first group date.

Is everyone ready
for a little cowboy action?

-Yeah!
-I love horses.

Sorry, I am late, Brian. Here's your ride.

Oh, come on, you can't expect me
to ride that thing.

Sorry, we're short on horses.

(SIGHS) You know what? Forget it.
I'll just go smoke.

-Hey, there, Adam.
-Hello, Henry.

I have the power!

(HORSE WHINNIES)

Brooke, what are you doing here?

Oh, I just can't take it anymore.

All these guys just coming on to me.

I had to sneak off.
Oh, could I bum one of those?

You know, I don't even know
why I agreed to do this show.

This is just so not me.

I'd much rather just be home
listening to my old jazz records.

Really? I didn't know. I actually have
quite a jazz collection myself.

-What do you like?
-DJ Jazzy Jeff!

-Oh!
-I'm kidding!

Oh, you got me. Oh, you got me, yeah.

No, I really like Coleman Hawkins,
Ben Webster.

Oh, and early Coltrane,
before he got clean.

Yeah, no junk, no soul.

No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase.

Right.

You know, I got to say, I thought
she was just some actress...

looking for her 15 minutes of fame,
but she's pretty sharp, you know.

I guess you can't judge
a Brooke by her cover.

You can cut that out, right?

And maybe you can cut out when I said
junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing.

Seems like he's probably
the kind of guy who might sue.

I mean, the guy's got to have
no money left.

All right, gentlemen...

let's see how Glenn's
private date with Brooke is going.

Hey, Brooke, what do you say,
we get you some more champagne?

Sure.

(THUDS)

All right.

Hey, forgot about you guys.

Well, I guess the date's over.

Goodnight, Brooke.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

(GLENN SNIFFING)

(GLENN EXCLAIMING IN DELIGHT)

Oh, my God, Peter,
it looks like there's been a break in.

Do you think so?

Oh, God, they're back.

(SCREAMING)

Whoa, awesome! Totally awesome!

All right, Goldman.

What the hell is your problem, Mort?

I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were
one of those criminals...

who broke in and destroyed
my entire stock of acne medication.

Oh, my God. Peter, do you think
Chris might have done this?

Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild
streak you had when you were younger.

For God's sake, you used to make
plaster molds of celebrity body parts.

Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry.

Very nice, by the way.

This one's going on the shelf
right next to Dan Fogelberg.

Hey, Lois, am I up next?

Just wait in your dressing room.
I'll come back for you, Oates.

I am not coming back for Oates.

Glenn, will you accept this rose?

Really? After I drugged you...

and tried to have sex
with your unconscious body?

-What?
-Yes.

This is the final rose tonight.

-Brian.
-Yes!

Yeah, I mean,
I know I was skeptical at first...

but I got to be honest, I've never
felt this way about anyone before.

I mean, I am in love. That's it.

I am in love.

I finally understand
those songs on the radio.

(SINGING) <i>What did you think</i>

<i>I would do at this moment</i>

<i>When you're standing before me</i>

<i>With tears in your eyes</i>

Brooke has narrowed her choice down
to Quagmire and Brian.

All that's left is for Brooke
to meet their families.

Hey, Brian, I can't wait
to meet your family.

Yeah, me, too. They're pretty great.

Brian, welcome home, you son of a bitch!

So, did you lose?
You got to tell me all about it.

Hey, how was your bachelorette?

Was she a dumb bimbo like you said
but with a big rack.

Come on in and tell me everything.

I bet your stories will make me laugh
so hard, I'll shoot milk out of my nose.

Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.

She's having dinner with us tonight.

I went over this with you
a few minutes ago.

(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

Why, it's wonderful to meet you.
We've heard so many nice things.

Yes, indeed.
So, how long have you been a prostitute?

No, Doug, I will not lift up her shirt.

Chris, we have company.

So, you ever been with a woman?

No.

-Peter!
-What?

There. Are you happy, Doug?

Christopher Cross Griffin,
what are you doing?

Joe, what are you doing here?

Peter, Lois, we have proof that it was
Chris who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy.

I knew it. I didn't want
to believe it, but it's true.

Oh, God, what happened to my baby.

Who sold you the drugs?

I can't believe this!

(ALL ARGUING)

Do you know what a cavity search is!

You made my mom cry tonight, Doug.

I don't think you're a very good friend.

I am not gonna listen to you anymore.

Oh, yeah? I'm inside your head now, fatty.

And I just might reach into your brain
and do this.

Okay, I'll listen.

(LAUGHING)

That's my boy.

Now, grab my bacon grease
and slather me up some homeys.

-What's going on, man?
-Wassup, dog.

Yeah, where are all the whiteheads at?

Brian, we've had some wonderful times.
I really like you.

Look, I understand. It's okay.

I hope you and Quagmire
have all the happiness in the world.

But I am choosing you.

Just promise me
you'll make him wear this...What?

You're choosing me?
After what happened with my family?

Well, it wasn't as bad as the evening
I spent with Glenn and his mother.

Glenn, would you feed Mittens?

Mittens has food in his bowl.

That's old food!

Mittens, shut up!

Don't you talk to Mittens that way.
Mittens is a member of this family.

Mom, you want this three-way to happen,
you're gonna have to change your tone.

My God, you've just made me
the happiest dog in the world.

-I love you, Brooke.
-I love you, too, Brian.

All right, that's a wrap.

Well, it was great working with you,
Brian. Good luck.

What are you talking about?
What about us?

Oh, stop it. It's just TV.

-Hi, Brian.
-Michael Eisner?

On behalf of ABC,
I'd like to give you this parting gift.

A bill for the mansion.

No givesies-backsies!

Hey, Brooke, it's me again, Brian.

Hi. Wasn't sure
if you got my last message...

or any of the other ones.
Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...

'cause you might be trying
to call me right now.

And I don't want to tie up the line.
So, I guess...

I guess...Yeah, give me a call.

Okay, I'm hanging up...

in three, two, one.

Okay, call me back.

I'll be here all day and tonight.

Okay, bye.

Hey, me again. Thought I might've
heard a voice when I was hanging up.

Nope? I guess not.
Okay, I will talk to you soon.

Hello? No. Sorry.

Hey, babe. Just trying you again.

Listening to our guy Coltrane,
you know. Okay.

Anyway, I got a fax earlier
about cheap airfare to Cancun.

Didn't know if that was you
trying to reach me.

Let me give you my home number again
just in case you lost it.

<i>-Voicemail is full.</i>
-Damn.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

-Package for Brooke Roberts.
-Oh, that's me. Thanks.

BRIAN: <i>Hey, there. Me again.</i>

<i>Your voicemail was full,</i>
<i>so I got you this answering machine.</i>

<i>So, what's going on?</i>

<i>I was thinking about</i>
<i>doing something tonight...</i>

BRIAN: Hey, you're home.

Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me
alone, or I'm calling the cops.

(SINGING) <i>Brooke, I'm so in love with you.</i>

(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

(GROANING)

Chris, where the hell are we?

I told you, Doug,
this is the bacon factory.

Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit.

-You traitor!
-That's a doozy.

I bet some of those awful kids at school
call you zit-face.

-No.
-Pop-a-zit.

-No.
-Pus-Peak.

-No.
-Fat ass?

-Yeah.
-That's terrible.

Well, we're gonna have to use
some cortisone on that.

Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game.

(GUN FIRES)

Don't think I won't do it, man.

All right, let's all be cool here.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

No!

You okay, fat ass?

She told me she loved me
on what used to be a hit TV show.

I can't believe I got sucked into
that phony reality world...

just like everyone else.
I became the very thing I was mocking.

I know it hurts now, Brian,
but look at the bright side.

You have some new material
for that novel you've been writing.

You know, the novel
you've been working on.

You know, the one
you've been working on for three years.

You know, the novel.

You got something new
to write about now, you know.

Maybe a main character
gets into a relationship...

then suffers a little heartbreak.

Something like
what you've just been through.

Draw from a real-life experience.

Little heartbreak, you know,
work it into the story.

Make those characters
a little more three-dimensional.

A little richer experience for the reader.

Make those second hundred pages...

really keep the reader guessing
what's going to happen.

Some twists and turns. Little epilogue.

Everybody learns the hero's journey
isn't always a happy one.

Yeah, I look forward to reading it.

(OUTRO THEME SONG PLAYING)

Thanks for
baby-sitting, Meg.

We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

I don't understand
why I have to baby-sit Stewie.

I mean, what's he
really gonna do

if we leave him
by himself?

And now to test
my teleportation pods.

(MACHINE BEEPING)

-(ALARM BLARING)
-Oh, damn!

(SCREAMING)

I'm a monster!

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

ALL: <i>He's a family guy!</i>

So, um, this, is,
uh, awkward,

but, uh, have... have
we ever actually, you know,

met?

I mean, y-you know,
I don't even know, say,

for example,
if you have a room up there.

You know, a room?

I have a room.

You know, Meg,
if you kill yourself now,

you'll probably
get a full page in the yearbook.

So, um, you know,
that's something to think about.

(BURPS)
Oh, just burped.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, Meg.

(LISPING)
You busy Saturday night?

Neil, you ask me out,
like, once a day,

and I always give you
the same answer.

No!

God, I don't think
I could have been any clearer

the last time
I turned him down.

Hey, Mort.
Uh, Lois and I are out on our date night.

Uh, why don't you
give me some condoms?

A-and some Excedrin.

My wife's got
a headache this big.

You know, it's... it's like
from the commercial.

This big.
Only... only it's my junk.

All right, then.
$12.43.

Oh, jeez, that's more of a rip-off
than that breakfast machine I bought.

(GUN FIRES)

Ah! Ow! Ow!

What was the point
of all that?

(GROANS)

All it does
is shoot you.

It doesn't make
breakfast at all.

(GROANING)

Besides, I forgot my wallet.

Well, that's okay.
I'll just open up a tab.

Wait a minute,
what the hell's a tab?

Does that mean
I don't gotta pay?

Well, not
right now, but...

Oh, sweet!

Hey, while I'm at it,
give me all these copies of <i>Marie Claire.</i>

You know, in case I want
to rub out that easy one

before I get Lois
into bed tonight.

Kathleen Turner's
on page 45.

Kathleen Turner, huh?

Let's see how she looks.

Oh, that's a shame.

(KIDS WHINING)

(WHIMPERING)

STEWIE: Meg!

Meg, I'm hungry!

There's a granola bar
in the cupboard.

I want it.

Hey.

Hey.

What's this?

What's going on?

Am I talking to myself
up there?

Oh, my God.

Stewie, just shut up
and go to bed!

Do you know what I do, Meg?

I spit in your mouth
while you sleep.

Finally. Look, Mom,
I've had it.

I am not
baby-sitting anymore.

It's Saturday night,
I could be out having a life.

Meg, if you don't want
to baby-sit anymore, that's fine.

But don't you
stand there and lie to me.

(CHUCKLING)
Oh, Meg, she torched your ass, man.

She torched your ass.

Why can't you just
hire a real baby-sitter?

Well, I guess
we could do that.

Damn! I'm terrible
at meeting new people.

Like the time
I was on <i>Blind Date.</i>

I'm having
a great time, Stewie.

Me, too.

So, you ready
to go grab some 'za?

Uh, yeah.

(BEEPING)

So, uh, a wild guess here

but from the looks of your arm hair,
I'm guessing you're Italian?

All right, you guys,
I got eight crates of ipecac from Mort,

all on my tab.

Now, whoever goes the longest
without puking

gets the last piece
of pie in the fridge.

Okay, here we go.

How's everybody doing?

Good.
Good so far.

All right,
all right.

Nothing yet.

Cool, cool.

You know, I... I don't know if you guys
had any of that pie already,

but that is, uh,
that is some tasty stuff.

That's from the, uh,
bake sale that Lois...

Ooh, one down. I know somebody
who won't be having any...

I'm starting
to feel funny.

Well, I feel fine.
I guess I'm...

Oh, boy!
That means I win. I get to eat...

(GASPING)

Oh, God! Why didn't
anybody tell me...

Oh, my God!
My insides are on...

No. No, please.
No more, no more. No...

Dad, I'm scared.

Get the phone.
Call 911...

Lois! Lois! Lois,
get in here...

(GASPS)

(PANTING)
Okay, okay. I think it's all gone.

I think...

(CRYING)
I don't wanna, I don't wanna...

Peter. Peter,
I need you to hold my ears...

Oh, oh.

(ALL GROANING)

Who wants chowder?

What the hell?

Hey, Meg,
you better check this out.

-(AIRPLANE ENGINE WHIRRING)
-(GASPS)

Oh, God, this is
so embarrassing.

I can't believe
this is happening to me.

Oh, looks like someone could use
a greeting card to cheer them up.

I put these on my tab.

Here, take a <i>Far Side</i> one.

The vulture thinks
he's a cowboy.

It's kind of funny.

Hey, Peter,
you got a card for

if you transferred V.D.
to somebody?

Uh, let's see here, uh...

Yup. "Sorry,
I accidentally gave you V.D."

Oh, that's all you got
is accidental, huh?

All right,
I'll take it.

Well, first let me thank you
for answering the ad.

Now, what do you
feel qualifies you

to be an effective
baby-sitter for Stewie?

(SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE)

Uh, yeah. Uh, we couldn't
run an ad that said "no Portuguese,"

but, um...

no Portuguese.

So, I see here you worked for a family
for a number of years.

Can I call
the, uh, Herculoids for a reference?

(CHATTERING)

I-I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

(CHATTERING)

The position has been filled.

(CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

The position
has been filled.

Thank you very much.
You can go now.

(GRUMBLING)

Ahh! Ahh!

Leave! Now!

I didn't think it was gonna be this hard
to choose a baby-sitter.

Yes, if only you
were this discerning

when you picked
that happening Bruce Jenner hairdo.

Sorry I'm late.
Can I still apply for the job?

My God, I haven't
been this exhilarated

since Brian took me
to see <i>Les Miserables.</i>

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Attention, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

<i>There will be a slight change</i>
<i>in the cast tonight.</i>

Oh, no.

ANNOUNCER: <i>For this evening's performance,</i>
<i>the role of Jean Valjean</i>

<i>will be played</i>
<i>by Kirk Cameron.</i>

Oh! Oh!

Unbelievable!
Oh, my God!

How lucky
are we, huh?

"Hey, Stewie,
what are you doing tonight?"

"Oh, nothing. Just watching
Kirk Cameron play Jean Valjean."

Oh, my God!
Curtain up.

Hey, Mort, do these suppositories come
in other flavors?

Peter, are you
eating those?

No, I'm shoving them
up my butt.

Of course I'm eating them.
Give me a carton.

Peter, it's the end of the month,
and I'm calling your tab.

You owe me
$34,000.

What?

Oh, man, how am I
gonna come up with that kind of money?

Peter, I'm waiting.

All right, all right.

Listen, I got another idea.

What if I sold you
my daughter?

Huh?

You drop the tab,
and your son can have Meg.

MEG:
What?

Yep, all you gotta do
is sign this contract.

Are you out
of your mind?

You can't sell me,
you fat son of a bitch!

Whoa! Careful
getting this fish off the hook, Mort.

She's got some fangs.

What do you
think of that, Neil?

Daddy bought you
a girlfriend.

Excuse me. If anybody is interested,
I already have a girlfriend.

There's no way...
Wait, what?

You ready to go, honey?

You rejected me
too many times, Meg.

I couldn't wait
for you forever.

Besides, Cecilia thinks
my psoriasis is sexy.

I can't believe he's over me.

I can't believe
I'm out $34,000.

I can't believe
it's not butter.

(CHUCKLES)

Stick around.
More <i>Family Guy</i> coming up.

Peter, how could you
have tried to sell our daughter?

All right, Lois,
I don't want this to ruin our date night,

so I'll make it
up to you.

Oh, Peter.

"I'm sorry I tried
to sell our daughter."

Yeah, you don't know
how hard it was

to find one of those
in English.

(SIGHING)
Tonight the baby-sitter comes, Rupert.

Lovely LaDawn.

Mmm.

Oh, hey, LaDawn.

Hey, what's going on?
How are you?

Yeah. Oh, just me, Stewie.

Just, uh,
being myself.

Uh, yeah. Oh, oh, well, this here?
Oh, it's just my package.

Yeah, just... just, uh,

just, uh, my package.

God delivered it,
I signed for it.

World keeps on
spinning. Yeah.

Oh, no!

Oh, Jenga,
there it is.

(LAUGHING)
Oh, oh,

well, I guess that's why
they call it Jenga. Mmm?

Stewie, you're so cute,
I can't even stand it.

Oh, thank you.
I'm having a good time, too.

I hope I don't make
any social faux pas

like I did at Pamela
and Tommy Lee's dinner party.

Hi, sorry I'm late.

I was visiting my aunt
in the hospital.

She has
hep...a...titis.

Ooh.

Sorry.

CECILIA:
Neil is such an amazing guy.

We just make
an absolutely perfect couple.

You know,
Neil liked me first.

And I was gonna
go out with him

when I was ready
to settle for him.

Get your own spaz.

All right, ladies,
enough chitchat.

Take it off, get in the shower
and bounce around for me.

Sweetie, your daddy
and I are going to the movies tonight.

How would you like
LaDawn to baby-sit?

Yes! I'm going to wow
her tonight, Rupert.

I'm gonna be
cooler than Brian

when he hangs out
at the bowling alley.

That's what I love
about high-school girls.

I keep getting older,
they stay the same age.

(CHUCKLING)
Yes, they do. Yes, they do.

Please go out with me.

I'm just trying
to make Neil jealous.

I promise, I'll pay
and everything.

Yeah. Uh,
that sounds cool,

but I'm gonna be
in the hospital that night.

(GROANING)

(CONTINUES GROANING)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, gorgeous man.

Oh, you.

Must I lock up your tongue
with the rest of the silver?

Stewie,
this is Jeremy.

Hey, little man.
So you're the guy

who's been trying
to steal my girlfriend.

What... You...

Girlfriend?

What kind of sick,
twisted game are you playing at?

Stewie sounds
a little cranky.

I'll put him to bed.

Ha! I got your hat!
Take that, hatless!

Now go back to the quad
and resume your hacky sack tourney!

I'm not gonna lie down
for some frat-boy bastard

with his damn Teva Sandals
and his Skoal Bandits

and his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeved
open-stitched crew-neck Henley

smoking his sticky buds
out of a soda can

while watching his favorite downloaded
<i>Simpsons</i> episodes every night!

Yes, we all love Mr. Plow.

Oh, you've got
the song memorized, do you?

So does everyone else!

That is exactly
the kind of idiot you see

at Taco Bell
at 1:00 in the morning.

The guy who just
whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder.

Good night, Stewie.

If he wants to throw hands,
I'll throw hands.

I tell you...

(MUMBLING)

(GROANS)

(SUCKING)

Oh, hey!
Neil and Cecilia.

I didn't expect
to see you here.

Meet Jake,
my boyfriend.

I want some BBs.

My dad lets me
shoot at cats.

Oh, hi, Meg.

Neil and I
are celebrating our two-week anniversary.

Oh, it seems like
only yesterday

he was just a stranger
videotaping me through the window.

Big deal.

He did that to me
three years ago.

And he gave me
the tapes for Christmas.

He gave me DVDs.

The production values
were amazing,

much better than
<i>Kramer vs. Predator.</i>

You want him back?

You can't just disappear for three months
and then suddenly decide

you want him back!
You can't have him!

Well, I'm glad
Neil's over me, anyway.

I'm with Jake now.
Right, Jake?

Maybe someday
we'll get married and you can go up on me.

Neil, I wanna be
your girlfriend.

-What?
-I was wrong to drive you away.

We belong together.

Of course,
I'm understandably skeptical

of your newfound
affection for me.

You still got
that contract our dads drew up?

Give me that.

You wanna hook up?

Buy me something.

Oh, I can't believe
we're going out.

This is so cool.

Oh, Neil. Neil,
n-not... not so fast.

(TITTERING)
Uh, Meg,

you need
to fulfill your contractual obligations.

What are you
talking about?

(LAUGHING LECHEROUSLY)

All right, Meg,
according to the contract,

every night,
you have to put on my pajamas.

My mom's record
is 12 seconds.

Neil, I think you're
old enough to...

Go!

-(GIGGLING)
-Neil, would you stop kicking?

-Ooh, that's tickling. It tickles.
-Just hold still.

-Ow, my thumb.
-Hold still.

-(EXCLAIMING)
-Quit it. No. Ah!

Oh, LaDawn, I thought
we could watch a DVD together.

I picked up the first season
of <i>Jiminy Glick.</i>

Imagine being
that guy for a day.

Colin Farrell,

so I was talking to my wife,
Dixie, the other day

and she was saying
that you weren't a very good actor.

And I agreed with her.

Now... now, why, now, why,
Colin, why would we both say that?

All right, that's it.

Jeremy must be destroyed.

Mom?

(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)

Dad?

Mom? Is anyone there?

Uh, little man?
You... you in here?

(BELLOWING)

(SCREAMING) Ow!

I say, I think this is
how you change a tire.

But what do I know?
I'm just a baby!

Here's your iPod,
so you can listen

to The Streaks
while you gasp for air.

(MUFFLED)

Oh, the Strokes. Right.

Boy, this was
a better acquisition than I thought.

We may even be able
to put in some sorghum this year.

So, uh,
anyway, um...

Hey, I made you
a mix tape.

I don't have
a dual cassette player

so, you know, I had to hold
the tape recorder up to the radio,

so the quality
is kind of sucky

but, you know,
all the songs describe my feelings.

(SOBBING)
Oh.

I'm sorry, Stewie.
I'm just upset.

Jeremy stopped
calling me.

He what?
That blaggard!

Oh, come here, l-let me just...
let me just hold you for a while.

Stewie! No! That is
a bad place to touch.

No. No, no, no,
no, no. No.

But... but... but...

(STAMMERING)
But I... You... I...

(WAILING)

No more TV.

Well, how about
no more job? Hmm?

You hear that,
miss fussy britches?

I shall see you fired,
damn you!

I thought we were
going to go all the way

and die together
like Hitler and Eva Braun.

(GUN FIRING)

We do everything
together, <i>ja?</i>

<i>Ja.</i>

-You got your poison?
-Mmm.

Okay. One, two, three.

You... you didn't do it.

You didn't do it,
either.

Okay, okay. All right,
this time we really have to do it.

-Okay, all right. You ready? Okay, okay.
-Okay.

BOTH:
One, two.

-Ah!
-Ah!

You want me to kill myself
and you're not going to.

You suck. You suck.

You suck.

Hey, Stewie,
there's, uh, something

thunking around in
the trunk of my car

and I can't get in there
'cause somebody busted the lock.

You... you have, uh,
any idea what that's about?

Oh, oh, that.
It's this whole...

(CLICKS TONGUE)

It's this whole
crazy thing.

(CLANGING)

Hey, this is not a barn,
young lady.

Oh, I'm just
so exhausted.

You know, I thought
I'd be happy being with Neil,

but I'm not.

This is horrible.

Oh, sweetheart, we'll figure some way
to get you out of this.

Brian, did you find any loophole
in the contract?

Nope, it's airtight.

The only way out
is if Neil commits an infidelity.

Well, that's it then.

We got to find
somebody to seduce Neil.

Who, me?

Well, if not you, Lois,
then who?

Beverly D'Angelo?

'Cause I don't think
she'd do it.

And I don't even know
how to get a hold of her.

Oh, hello, LaDawn.

Listen, I certainly hope
you'll excuse

last night's
indiscretion.

It was just...
Oh, my God, LaDawn!

What's that
on your neck?

Ha!

Lois! Oh, thank God
you're here, Lois.

It was all
her friends.

They... they were doing
marijuana and heroin.

And... and they were
taking eczema and touching each other.

LOIS:
LaDawn, wake up this instant.

What?

I... I don't...

You know what?
Don't bother, LaDawn.

You are fired.

Well, I really don't know
how this happened

but I guess
this is the last time I get to see you.

I... I'm gonna miss you,
little guy.

Oh, this is for you.

She... she made me
a mix tape.

Oh, dear God,
what have I done?

I've made a
terrible mistake.

LaDawn! LaDawn!

LaDawn!

All right,
you all set, honey?

LOIS:
Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this.

It's so disgusting.

But it's for
my little girl.

Dad, how do you know
Neil will show up?

Don't worry, Meg.

I sent him an invitation
he couldn't refuse.

Hmm.

Strange. These conventions
usually have Segway parking.

Hello? Am I too late
for the Q and A?

Yeah, but you're just
in time for the T and A.

(GROWLS SEDUCTIVELY)

Mrs. Griffin,
what... what are you...

(SHUSHING)

You can call me Mystique.

Mrs. Griffin,
this is wrong.

Well, well, well,
look at this, Meg.

Your boyfriend is violating
both your contract and my wife.

Meg, I wasn't
doing anything.

Uh, Mrs. Griffin was just...
Ow, you're bending it.

I don't care.

You've nullified
the contract.

(LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY)
I'm free!

Free?

I don't understand, Meg.

You don't want to be
my girlfriend?

Well, I thought I did.

But I guess
I was just jealous.

I see.

Well, Meg, I want you
to be with me

because you want
to be with me,

not because
you have to.

Thank you, Neil.

Cecilia,
it's the Goldman.

How about we fire up
the old Segway

and find a nice quiet field
to do long division in?

I... I... I mean,
a nice quiet field

in which to do
long division. Sorry.

Sorry, everybody.

Okay, I'm on my way.

He's going back to Cecilia?

I can't believe
I'm actually jealous.

I can't believe
I actually touched him.

I still can't believe
it's not butter.

Next week I run
for Mayor of Quahog.

Do I have what it takes?

We'll find out.
Don't miss it.

Well, here we are again.

Another Saturday night
with basic cable.

Yep.

Oh, I suppose neither of us
is really cut out for love, and we...

Oh, my God!
Jeremy's still in the trunk!

Oh, God, how long
has it been?

Uh, let's... let's see.
two... two weeks. Yep.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

Yeah, he's dead.

Definitely dead.

Okay now, don't wander too far kids.

You know, more children get kidnapped

at the grocery store than anywhere else.

Hey!

Ahh, you got me!

Oh, not quick enough.

Not quick enough, no.

No I was close, though.

You were close!

I'm gonna go get some oranges Stewie.

Here, hold the rest of
these bags for Mommy.

Oh, what brilliant parenting Lois.

Leave a tiny infant with a plastic bag.

You know I might asphyxiate myself,

just to teach you a lesson.

Here I go, just like that boy from INXS.

I am going to do it. I am going to do it.

(GRUNTING)

Blast! Good lord Lois,

either I was a C-section
or you're Wonder Woman.

Chris, would you run and get some milk?

And be sure to take it from the back.

Chris, where have you been?

I don't know.

(BEEPS)

$53.98.

Oh no I forgot to go to the bank.

Uh I'm a little short.

I'll have to put the ham back.

You know I got some candy in my van,

if your kid wants some.

Oh, great! (GASPS)

Wait a second!

Ah, you got me! You got me.

-(LAUGHING)
-Oh, man.

I'll get him, though I'll get him.

I bet you will. I bet you will.

Hey, is that ham?
I thought you put that back.

Oh, um...

No I put the other ham back.

I don't remember another ham.

Well, you were too busy
eyeballing that <i>Redbook</i>

with Glenn Close on the cover.

Hey, she is a handsome woman.

Well, well! Look who's carrying

a little flame for Glenn Close.

What a surprise!

Although it's not the first time
you've surprised me.

Oh I have so much stuff to do today.

I have to do laundry,
then I have a piano lesson,

then I have to make dinner. I am so busy.

Better hurry.

Lois I want my graham cracker...

Oh.

Hey.

Hey.

Playing a little dress-up?

Yeah.

Yeah, good.

It's fun to pretend.

Um, so listen, if you see Lois tell her...

-Graham cracker.
-Graham cracker.

Yes, yes. That's... That's it.

Um, all right, so, uh,

I'm just gonna go out in the hallway

and throw up about something else.

Oh, this is cute.

Oh, my God.

(LAUGHING)

(WHOOPING)

(PANTING)

Oh, my God, that was such a rush.

(GRUNTING)

Yeah. I'm alive!

Thanks for having us over.

Yeah, it's a wonderful dinner.

And on this beautiful new china.

You guys have a lot of new stuff.

Yeah Lois has been splurging her ass off.

Yeah, she has.

You know, she bought me
something yesterday,

but I... I am not going to
tell you what it is.

I want you to guess. Just close your eyes.

(HONKING)

(GROANING)

It's a soccer horn.

I know what it is!

Hey, is that an original <i>Matisse?</i>

Uh, hey, uh Bonnie.

Uh, listen, why don't you
stop with the questions?

You're ruining everyone's good time.

Like Peter did, when he used
to entertain terminally ill kids.

Hi there. How you all doing?

all right, so I'm at
the DMV the other day.

Long lines. Long lines at the DMV.

But you'll find out
all about that when you get...

(STAMMERING)

Um, moving on. So, uh
I finally tried Viagra and...

(BOY GROANING)

Oh, we got a joker in the audience there.

You, uh, you got something
you want to say, there Mr. Heckler?

Dying hurts.

Tell me about it.

So anyway, who hates flying?

(CLEARING THROAT)

(GASPING) Brian, what are you doing here?

I should ask you the same question.

Lois, you're in
an auto parts store, stealing mufflers.

This is worse than
that Winona Ryder thing.

Oh, are you saying I am a klepto?

Actually, I was talking about
<i>The Age of Innocence.</i>

It is settled May.
Our parents have consented

and you and I are to be married

on the first warm, sunny day of spring.

That would be most good,
Newland, most good.

(SIGHING) I am sorry,
but she is just awful.

Is there any way...

I mean, can we add,
like, a topless scene, or something?

DIRECTOR: Uh, yeah.

-Really?
-Yeah.

We can? Oh, great.
All right, we got a movie.

Oh, God, you're right,
Brian, I'm out of control,

But I don't know what to do.

I'm just hooked on
the rush of shoplifting.

I haven't felt a thrill
like this in a long time.

Well, I think you've had enough thrills.

Why don't you just
put everything back, huh?

Uh, okay, Brian.

You know, you really are a good friend.

Let me rub your belly.

(MOANING)

Put it back.

(CONTINUES MOANING)

(TV PLAYING)

Welcome back to Channel 5 News at 10:00.

For those of you wondering

what I've been writing down
as we go to commercial,

it's a cat. Just a cat.

In other news,
police are still looking for the culprit

who stole a valuable Matisse painting

from the Quahog Museum of Art.

A Matisse painting?

Also, scientists announced today

that if your hand is
bigger than your face,

you have cancer.

Ha-ha!

Got you. Aha! Ah!

Oh, that's not even really news.

(VROOMING)

(SPUTTERING)

Oh, no, Rupert, we're out of gas.

We better ask directions

at that creepy,
and possibly haunted house.

Ah! A ghost!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's okay. It's okay.

We got away just in time.
We got away just in time.

All right, now,
is that everything you stole?

Uh, that's everything.

You know, you really should talk
to a therapist about this.

I mean, it really helped Peter out

when he became obsessed

with that fantasy world of his.

Yeah!

You're a little too heavy, buddy.

Yeah!

We're going down.

Yeah!

Yeah.

(SIGHING) You know, Lois, we're just lucky

we got this under control
before the police caught onto you.

Hold it right there, Lois,
you are under arrest.

Oh, crap. A-All right, look,
just... just take it easy, Joe.

All right, Lois will go peacefully.

Oh, my God, I am so embarrassed.

Let me just get my purse.

(LAUGHING)

LOIS: Sucker!

(GRUNTING)

(GASPS)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(LOIS EXCLAIMING)

(GROANING)

Sorry Lois. Regulations.

I can't give you any special treatment.

It's okay, Joe, I understand.

Shut up, maggot!

(GROANING)

Your Honor, I am so sorry
for stealing all that stuff.

I just couldn't control myself.

Well, Mrs. Griffin,

considering this is your first offense,

I've decided to go lenient and...

Where the hell is my gavel?

(GIGGLING)

Give me that.

I sentence you to two years
in the state prison.

(GASPS)

Ah, man, that is bogus.

Order in the court!

Another outburst like that, Mr. Griffin,

and I'll extend the sentence.

(SNEEZES)

Okay, three years.

That was a sneeze.

-Four years.
-I am sorry.

-Five years.
-You douchebag.

All right, three years it is.

Three years in prison?

Oh, my God, what have I done?

Oh, man, I haven't been this upset

since I watched <i>The Blob </i>on television.

Look out behind you, lady! It's the blob!

I'll save you.

Here you go. Meet your new friends.

Uh, hi, I'm Lois.

I'm Fisty, that's Stabby,
and that's Balls.

Pull up a chair, we're playing cards.

Oh. Okay.

So, are those biblical names?

Yeah, Fisty is.

Boy, I sure miss Lois.

I wish she was here
to clean up all this stuff.

Hey, what's this?

Mustard.

Oh, that's right.
We had hot dogs last week.

You gonna eat that?

The mustard on your shoulder? No.

Oh, oh, kids, look! Look. A deer.

Can we pet him?

No, no. No, no, no.
No, just... just watch.

(CLATTERS)

(ALL SIGHING)

Peter! Peter!

There's... there's so much doody in here.

I ca... I can't take it anymore.

I haven't eaten in four days

'Cause I... 'cause... 'cause I...

I just can't fit any more in there.

Help me.

Okay, now when we get
to your mother's cage,

say "hello", but don't drag your ass,

'cause I want to go the reptile house.

Oh, and we got to see those pandas.

Peter, this isn't a zoo, it's a prison.

Quagmire, what are you doing' here?

Ah, it's conjugal visit day.

You know, I love doing a woman in the can.

Oh! Giggity, giggity, giggity, goo.

Who else but Quagmire?

<i>He's Quagmire,</i><i>Quagmire</i>

<i>You never really know</i>
<i>what he's gonna do next</i>

<i>He's Quagmire,</i><i>Quagmire</i>

<i>Giggity, giggity,</i><i>giggity, giggity</i>

<i>Let's have sex</i>

I do hope nothing happens

to spoil this fancy dinner party.

(GASPING)

Giggity, giggity,
giggity, giggity. (GIBBERING)

Who else but Quagmire?

<i>He's Quagmire,</i><i>Quagmire</i>

<i>Giggity, giggity, goo!</i>

Oh, it is so good to see all of you.

How is everything at home?

Oh, it's horrible, Lois. I've had to do

all the things that you usually do.

Like the other night,

I had to go to your book club meeting.

Well, I really admired

the mother character's
admission of personal torment

after her daughter's death.

I... I disagree.

I felt a total lack of ethical integrity

in her readiness to abandon her children

and start a life of her own.

Ah here's another thing,
the book can also be...

a hat.

And the other night, I had to do a...

Well, you know, that thing that you

usually do for me every Thursday night.

(GRUNTING)

Ah!

Ah, I can't believe you're serving

a three-year sentence, it seems so harsh.

Well, the only upside is
that it's given me time

to think about why I ended up in here.

I... I guess was stealing

because I was so sick of
the same old routine.

I felt like I had a void in my life.

Like... like there was
a secret hole in me.

Oh, God!

And I was trying to fill that hole with

all kinds of expensive objects and things.

Oh, God!

And I felt wonderful

with all those things filling that hole.

Oh, God!

I did this to myself

so I'm just gonna have to lay back

and let the penal system
teach me a lesson.

That one is also sexual.

Well, I guess with good behavior,

you could be out in two years.

I made my own bed with this one, guys.

I'm just gonna have to
pay my debt to society.

Not necessarily.

I think I got an idea
of how to smuggle you out.

Bye-bye, take care, now. Have a nice day.

(MUMBLING)

(ALARM WAILING)

(CHATTERING)

What do we do?

Hurry! We'll hide in that van.

My God, you know what this means?

You're all accessories to my escape.

She's right. We're fugitives from the law.

What the hell is wrong with you?

I'm a dog, all right.

I have a very tough time
standing up in the car.

Well, then we're fugitives.

But at least the family's back together.

I wonder where we're going.

Calm down!

I'll tell you what we're going to do.

Wherever this van stops,

we'll begin a new life together.

We'll blend in to the fabric
of that community.

Peter, we're in Asiantown.

Well, at least I don't have to worry

about the evil monkey here.

(SCREAMS)

Well, if we're gonna hide
out here in Asiantown,

we have to find a place to live.

Yes, and we should do nothing

to draw attention to
ourselves as outsiders.

Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.

Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.

Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.

Hi there!

Always nice to meet a fan of my movies.

Oh, my God, you're Ethan Hawke!

Uh, no, I'm not.

Sorry, my mistake.

Oh, my God, it's Ethan Hawke!

Mom, can we go get some food?

Oh, my God, there's Malcolm in Middle!

I'm not a boy.

Yes, you are.

I can't believe we have to live here.

No, this sucks!

Ugh, tell me about it. I haven't seen

one female baby since we got here.

This place is a sausage-fest.

Come on, kids, we've been through worse.

Meg, you... you remember
when you found out

your gynecologist
never finished med school?

All right, Meg,

let's take a look at that bergina.

But Peter, how are we
going to support ourselves here?

Well, we'll all have
to get jobs, but I'm sure

we'll each find something we can do.

Where are you from?

Tokyo.

Oh, Tokyo! Yeah, it's a great town.

Lot of people, though.

Yup.

You... you're here on business?
I bet its business

'cause I had a fare earlier today that...

This used to be a people business,

but now, I don't know.

Oh, damn! I say, I seem to have sewn

a shoe to my hand, may I go to the nurse?

Replace him!

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMS)

(BABY CRYING)

Faster!

So, what exactly would you say

qualifies you to work as a sumo wrestler?

Oh, are you kidding?

I'm a born athlete,
just like Greg Louganis.

Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

You're probably asking yourself,

"Which way are they gonna go?

Are they gonna make

a diving-board head-injury joke?

Are they gonna make an AIDS joke?

Or are they gonna make
a joke about the fact

that his last name

sounds suspiciously like anus?"

Well, we're gonna take the high road

and do a no-body-hair joke.

Brian?

Hi, I'm Greg Louganis. I'm totally shaven.

Terrific! Terrific.

Damn it, Swanson. I want them found.

Mayor West, we have every available man
looking for the Griffins.

We just don't have any leads.

Not the Griffins, you moron!

The rest of my Lite Brite pieces!

My name isn't Adam We!

Or is it? Who am I?

What number did you dial?

Don't ever call here again.

I guess I told him!

Nobody messes with Adam We.

And now, ladies and gentlemen,

<i>Sumo Tonight,</i>
brought to you by Asian Trix.

Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids!

You share!

(GROANS)

Uh, I'm not really sure what to do here.

Boy! You've put on weight, Jackie Chan.

(ALL CHEERING)

Oh, my God!

BONNIE: Did you walk?

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

(EXCLAIMING)

MALE ANNOUNCER:
You're watching CBS Asiantown.

Hey, everybody, I'm home.

Oh, you're just in time.

I ordered Caucasian for dinner.

Chris, I'm hungry.

It's your turn to keep watch for the cops.

Wait a minute, am... am I the only one who
thinks this is nuts?

We've given up our whole lives.

Come on, Brian,

a change of scenery is always good.

Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed
my trip to Nebraska.

So, um, anybody see
any good movies lately?

-No, not really. No.
-Uh-uh.

Oh.

Read any good books?

-No.
-Uh-uh, no.

Oh.

Anything new with corn?

Oh, yeah, corn...

Corn... You bet you!

Corn, absolutely.

Corn, yeah.

Corn is always interesting.

Hey, Mom, Mr. Swanson's here to visit us.

What?

(INAUDIBLE)

Oh, my God, we got to get out of here!

Taxi! Follow that family.

Come on, everybody, over the fence.

Ah, yes, a fence.

The cripple's natural enemy.

(SIGHS)

I think we lost him.

There they are.

Quick! Into the sewer.

(GRUNTING)

Ugh, good lord! It's disgusting down here.

Oh, boy, Stewie's got the right idea.

It's wet down there, Brian.

Gee, this sucks worse than that time

I did cocaine with Karl Malden.

What are you getting
all bent out of shape about?

Well, you know, Karl, I... I didn't get...

I got virtually nothing here, you know?

Look, I don't see what the problem is.

No, you wouldn't, would you?

L... look, all I'm saying is,
I got the raw end of the deal.

You invited me over.

Yeah, well, now I'm regretting it.

We're running through a sewer,

Look, honey, it was very sweet of you

to break me out of jail

And I'm the one who should pay,

I'm gonna turn myself in.

You're mine now, Lois!

Oh, my God, Joe!

Joe, you're too heavy. I can't hang on.

Pretend I'm your child, Lois.

Not Meg! Not Meg!

Lois, you saved my life.

I say, Corey Haim!

Are you with the Goonies as well?

No, I just live down here.

Mine!

Ah, it was so nice of Joe

to work things out with that judge.

Yeah, but I'm sure gonna miss my buddies

down at the sumo ring.

Dad, can you teach me how to sumo wrestle?

Oh, it's not too hard, Chris.

Hey, Brian, help me demonstrate.

Uh, Peter, maybe somebody else could...

Come on!

(SIGHS)

Okay, so on the count of three,

you try to push me out of the ring,

I try to push you out of the ring.

Okay? Ready?

One, two, three!

(GROANING)

Ow. What... What the hell? What the hell?

Brian, I'm sorry...

No! No, no. You know what?

It's not cool, Peter. It's not cool.

Hey, that's fantastic, Lois.

-Me, too.
-Me, too.

Oh, God. Meg, that's sick.

-That's your mother.

Get out. Get out of this house.

I said now!

That's good about your modeling, Lois.

Here are your pictures, Lois.
They sure are terrific.

Thank you, Mort.
I'm trying to get into modeling.

That's great. Oh, hey! Get out of here.

Hey, go on. Get out.

-I didn't hurt anybody.
-Scat, Mister.

I know deep down I'm your friend.

That greased-up deaf guy
is going to be the death of me.

Like business isn't bad enough already.

Well, gosh, Mort. You ever think
about sending out a mailer?

'Cause I know where you could get
a good deal on a model.

-I'm touching on the candy.
-Get out. Get out.

What the hell is all this?

Oh, Brian, you're here. Good.
Okay, let me give you the rundown.

This is your work area.

Please keep personal knickknacks tasteful.

You get 25 minutes for lunch, and...
Enjoy it here.

Welcome aboard.

-Yes?
-It's Brian.

Oh, yes, the new fellow. Come on in.

What exactly am I supposed to do?

You'll pick up the phone
and you'll sell, sell, sell.

But before you go thinking
it's all seriousness,

the first Friday of every month
is Wacky-Tacky-Tie Day.

So, you know, start thinking up
some fun tacky ties to wear.

Oh, we're done.

Here you go, guys.

Lois, could I be a son of a bitch
and impose on you

to sign one of your flyers for me.

Of course, Cleveland.

Oh, man.
I can't believe I'm sleeping with a model.

I'm luckier than
the State of Rhode Island.

Well, I can't decide
what to call this place.

We'll flip a coin.

Well, here's my card. Give me a call.

Now, perhaps some young gentleman

Yes, the letter G is wonderful.

Of course, and the number six.

Okay. Okay.

Grover. Grover. Grover.

Grover. Grover.

You know what? If you're gonna shout,
we can just talk later.

Okay. All right, you know what?
Call me back when you calm down.

You wanted something?

Oh, yes. Can you go ahead
and send Lois a congratulatory basket?

Thank you.

Oh, and if Cookie Monster calls,
tell him I'm not talking to him...

until he gets out of rehab.

-What are these?
-I don't know.

What do you mean, "you don't know"?

I don't know how they got there.

No. No, Derek was in here earlier.

Can I talk to you about something?

Yeah, what is it?

That coffee mug you have on your desk

that's dangerously close
to the word bitch, isn't it?

Yeah, that's the joke.

Absolutely, and nobody
appreciates a joke like Stewie.

And, you know, between you and me,
I think it's a stitch...

but some of the other employees
have found it offensive.

Other employees?
Who else works here besides me?

(BEEP) you. That's who works here!

Dinner's almost ready, kids.

Wow, Lois, look at you.
You're like Britney Spears.

Dad, how could you be okay with Mom
parading herself around like this?

I mean, she's half-naked.
It makes all women look bad.

Meg, who let you back in the house?

Oh, Karin. Come on in.

Lois, I got your new headshots,
and I set up a shoot for you...

over at <i>Glamour</i> next Monday...

but, sugar,
you're gonna need these to stay on top.

Diet pills? Karin,
I'm not gonna take these.

I don't need to.

Lois, sooner or later
every model needs a little boost, huh?

I just wanna make sure
you got everything you need.

-Hey, you like Pez?
-Sure.

Hey, who's putting together a puzzle?
'Cause I just found a hot piece.

Wow. Lois, you look great.

I'd like to split you in half
like a piece of lumber.

Thank you, Glenn.

Yeah, Lois.
I'd like to wear you like a hockey mask.

That's it. That's enough.

Peter, what are you doing?

Lois, if you being a model
means you're going to be eye-candy

for the whole town,
then I ain't going for it.

Excuse me?
Who do you think you are, my father?

Lois, I think Meg was right.

and something and all that noise.

You can't stop me from modeling, Peter.

You know,
I would just not go near it at all.

Brian, thanks for showing up so promptly
for your quarterly evaluation.

Now, then. I'm going to do something
I call the compliment sandwich

where I say something good, then talk
about where you need improvement

and then end with something good.

Whatever you gotta do.

Okay.

Let's see. Something good.
Something good. Something good.

You look like Snoopy,
and it makes me smile.

Where you need improvement.

You have smelly dog farts.

Something good. Something good.

You really dazzled that rep
from the Cincinnati office last week.

That is sensational. You really made me
feel confident about those numbers.

Listen, if you're ever looking
for a change of scenery...

we could sure use
a fellow like you in Cincinnati.

-That was you in disguise.
-No, it wasn't.

-Yes, it was.
-No, it wasn't.

-Fine, it wasn't.
-It was.

Mr. Pewterschmidt, I need your help.

Lois is out of control.

I mean, she's acting crazier than I did
that time I tried ecstasy.

Oh, Brian, your fur is so soft.

Oh, your ears.

Your ears are like dog ears.

Oh, this couch.

How you doing that?

Oh! Everything here is fantastic.

(MAKING HAPPY MUMBLING NOISES)

I'm really worried about her,
Mr. Pewterschmidt

and I figured I'd come to you since
you were always good at reeling her in.

Well, Lois was always a wild stallion

but don't worry.
I know how to control her.

And I'll help you.

But first, you have
to do something for me.

Eat this pine cone.

-Well...
-Eat it. It will amuse me.

-How is it? How does it taste?
-It's awful.

-Finish it. Eat it.
-I hate it.

Eat it. Eat it. Swallow it.

-You see Jimmy Smits in there?
-Yeah.

Yeah, that was cool.

So, what did you wanna see me about?

You know, Brian, there was a note
in the suggestion box that says:

"Stewie should eat a steaming bag of..."

Well, I'm not gonna say the last word,
but I think you know what it is.

Look, Brian, a corporation
is a lot like a centipede.

It only works if all the legs are moving
toward the same end.

And you know what you are, Brian?

-You're a busted leg.
-What?

Are you firing me?

Don't think about coming back
and shooting up the place

because security has your picture.

What the hell are you guys doing?

You're not leaving this room until
you agree to stop this modeling thing...

once and for all.

This isn't gonna work, you guys.

Why can't you understand
I'm doing what I want?

Jeez, Carter, what are we doing?

I mean, if Lois wants to be a model...

we don't got any right to stop her.

You really mean that, Peter?

Of course, I do.
I just want you to be happy.

This is ridiculous.
No daughter of mine is going to be happy.

Excuse me, Carter. I think I owe you this.

That's for giving me
a book last Christmas.

You're rich, you jerk.

Well, Lois, I guess you should go ahead
and get back to your party.

What's wrong?

Aren't you gonna go do your little turn
on the catwalk, Lois?

On the catwalk?

Yeah, on the catwalk?

Do your little turn on the catwalk?

Well, now that you say
you're fine with it

to be honest, I'm not really sure
I wanna do it anymore.

I think all I really wanted
was the freedom to know I could

and now I have it because I have you.

You sure do, Lois.

What are we gonna do with him?

Hey, you wanna make him
really mad, Lois?

By the way, we're out of chips,
cookies, and Funny Bones.

Now, I'm going to my book club
and you are going to the meeting.

Hey, Brian, how about you go
to that meeting for me, huh?

Yeah. I don't think so.

Oh, come on, buddy. You owe me.

You remember what I did for you last week?

(SINGING) <i>Sighing softly to the river</i>

<i>Comes the loving breeze</i>

<i>Setting nature all aquiver</i>

<i>Rustling through the trees</i>

<i>Through the trees!</i>

(SIGHING) All right. I'll go.

Quagmire, what are you doing here?
You don't have kids.

Don't be so sure, Brian.
I've slept with chicks all over the world.

Who knows, I could have kids in their 20s.

(BOTH TALKING IN SPANISH)

-What are you doing here?
-I got roped into this by Peter.

Wow, that's a... that's a lovely color.

(STAMMERING) Your dress is...
The color of your dress is...

-I like... You're very pretty.
-Oh, thank you.

I'm the 11th grade history teacher,
Miss Parks.

Oh! Like Rosa Parks.

Or, you know,
or someone white named Parks.

Nothing cuter than a nervous white dog.

(STAMMERING) Well, I'm Brian and...

gosh, if I'm not being too forward,
it's lovely to meet you, Miss Parks.

Oh, please. Call me Shauna.

(SINGING IN BARBERSHOP STYLE)
<i>Shauna! Shauna!</i>

So, Brian, you ready
to go play some darts at The Clam?

Sorry, Peter. I can't make it tonight.
I have a date.

Dad!

You were supposed to drive tonight.
What am I supposed to do?

If I drive, I'll have to have
a bunch of drinks first

because I am very self-conscious
about my driving.

Oh, you've got a date! What's his name?

Ha! Do you see that?
Do you see what I did?

I made it seem
as though you were a homosexual.

That's funny to me.

How exciting, Brian.
So who's the lucky lady?

Well, actually, her name is Shauna Parks.

Meg's teacher?

Yeah, we really hit it off. She's great.

Brian on a date.

That'll be more pathetic than that game
of Marco Polo I played with Helen Keller.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

Marco.

I don't know. I mean,
I think I want to have kids someday.

Oh, I love kids. I just love them.

I can't get enough of those
little buggers, let me tell you.

You know, it's like I tell the other
volunteers down at the adoption center.

My God, you know, if I could just take
all the orphans in the world

and just, you know, buy a farm somewhere

and let them all run free, you know.

Just let them do little macaroni-art
pictures of their dead parents.

(STAMMERING) So what's it like to work
at a high school?

Oh, Brian, I just love it.

Working at James Woods High is great.

You know, I've always wondered why they
named if after James Woods, you know?

I mean, there's got to be somebody
more deserving.

Like, just, you know,
off the top of my head, I don't know

Sidney Poitier, Reggie Jackson,
Martin Luther King.

You know, those are just three names
that come to mind.

Brian, that's a great idea.

We should get them to rename the school
after Dr. King.

You like Dr. King?
Because I love Dr. King. I love... MLK!

Man, he's my guy.

He's... I mean, I love all black people,
you know.

I mean, if I could take
all the black people in the world

and just, you know, just buy a farm
somewhere and let them all...

Whoa, you know what, that actually
didn't really come out right.

Brian, relax. I'm having a great time.
You don't have to try so hard.

Great. Great. 'Cause, you know, I'm not
okay with slavery. Just so we're clear.

(STAMMERING) I mean, if I was offered
a slave, I'd say no.

Oh by the way, Bonnie

we just finished reading
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i> at my book club.

You were right. It's terrific.

Let me guess. Some flowery, 300-page,
menopausal masturbatory aid.

I loved it.

And the chapters are only
about two pages long.

So you feel really smart when you read it.

Take it outside, Lois.

Good night, sweetie.

Oh, yes. Just as I thought: France, art...

murder?

Well, this is a bigger surprise than
that time Peter vanished into thin air.

-Hey, Stewie. Peekaboo!
-Yes, I see you, fat man.

Where's Daddy?

Where did you go? Oh, this is impossible.

I can hear you, but I can't see...

Well, he must really be gone!

-Peekaboo!
-How the hell did you do that?

Look, I thought you'd disappeared,
otherwise I wouldn't have picked my...

Oh great, leave when I'm in the middle
of a sentence.

Hey, there you are, Brian.
We're all set for tonight, right?

Oh, tonight's no good, Peter.
I have another date with Shauna.

Oh, come on. Again?

Well, fine, Brian. If that girl
is more important to you than me

then I guess
I'll have to find a new best pal.

Boy, Barney, it's sure been great
hanging out with you.

(BARNEY LAUGHING)

BARNEY: I've enjoyed it, too, Peter.

Hey, you almost done in the john?
'Cause we're late for darts.

All done, Peter.

You think you have a crap job.

I don't need Brian to watch TV with.
I got you, Meg.

Hey, what's that? What's that?
Is that a dog?

Is that another dog on the TV, huh?

You see that? Go get it. Go get it.

What's that? Who's that? Who's that?

Oh! Who's that?

Who's there?
Is there somebody at the door?

Somebody at the door? Huh?

Somebody at the door?
What are you gonna do about it?

What are you gonna do about it?

What are you...

I'm not a dog, you fat bastard!

Wow, Stewie, you're up early.

I'm up still. I've been reading all night.

Hang on, Lois. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

Well, I loved this book.

Nothing like a good story
to recharge your batteries.

(SNORING)

Hey, everybody, check this out.

This is wonderful. Look at this, Peter.

"Two hundred die in train derailment."

Oh, God, Lois.
That is just morbidly obese.

No, no, Peter. Right here.

I mentioned to Shauna that they ought to
change the name of James Woods High

to Martin Luther King Jr.
and she really ran with it.

The school board is voting on it tomorrow.

Congratulations, Brian.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait.

You and your girlfriend are taking the
name James Woods off the high school?

-Well, yes. For Martin Luther King.
-That's crazy.

You're gonna name the school
after the star of <i>Space 1999?</i>

No, that's Martin Landau.

-Oh. The guy who played Sheneneh?
-That's Martin Lawrence.

-The drunk crooner?
-That's Dean Martin.

The drink that's best served on the rocks?

Martini & Rossi.

-The guy on <i>The West Wing?</i>
-Martin Sheen.

-The guy from <i>Platoon?</i>
-Charlie Sheen.

No, no, the other guy from <i>Platoon.</i>

-(PONDERING) It's...
-Come on.

Willem Dafoe.

No, it's Tom Berenger.
We were looking for Tom Berenger.

Well, thanks for playing Brian.
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

Oh, that's okay. I had a lot of fun.
I'm a big fan of the show.

Wait a minute!

Peter, Martin Luther King was
an inspiration to an entire generation.

He was a driving force
behind the civil rights movement.

Lois, we're talking about
Rhode Island's own James Woods here.

He's a hero in these parts, huh?
Use your head.

Peter, you're acting like an idiot.

Oh, yeah? I don't like the way
you've been acting lately.

And I think it has a lot to do
with that woman

you've been spending so much time with.

Why don't you just mind
your own damn business, Peter?

Will you guys stop fighting, please?

What's wrong with Meg?

Oh, nothing.
It's just her time of the month.

Not again.

Well, Mr. Griffin, your arguments
for the school's name change

are quite compelling.

Brian, I think you did it.

Oh, amen.

By the way,
I just want to remind everybody

to put their e-mail address
on the list in the back there

so we can send you
our quarterly newsletter.

It's chock-full of goings-on around
the school. It's got a word jumble.

A little hint:

All the answers have to do
with something here at the school.

Yes, I'm sure
we're all looking forward to that.

Now, unless there is any objection,
I move that the board pass this measure.

I've got an objection,
and so does this man.

James Woods!

-Oh, my God.
-I don't believe it.

Hi. How are you? Hello, everyone.

He brought James Woods here?
What the hell is he doing?

Believe me,
Peter does stupid things all the time.

That's why he got fired from that airline.

-Coffee for you, Capt. Griffin?
-Thank you, stewardess.

Hey, where are we right now?

On an airplane?

No. This room. What is this room called?

-The flight deck?
-No.

-Control room?
-No.

Cockpit?

Oh, God! I told you I'd get her to say it.

Oh, God!

All right. Go on. Get out of here.

Look, I came as soon as
Peter contacted my website.

Let me just say, I'm all in favor
of renaming the school after Dr. King.

-What?
-Wow!

A big star and yet so humble.

James Woods High School it remains.

-What?
-You can't be serious.

Yes! This is more exciting than that time
I got to ride the washing machine.

Man, what a great lunch, Lois.
Thank you so much for having me over.

Well, it's not often
we get to meet celebrities.

Yeah, except when I was
Christina Aguilera's manager.

(SINGING SCALES)

Okay, let me just go ahead
and stop you right there.

You sound terrible, all right?

You're doing this thing, which is just,
you know... What the hell is that?

And you look like if I touched you,
you'd be sticky

and frankly, you smell bad.

You're pretty much offensive
to all five senses.

That's only four.

Well, actually, you know when you smell
something and it gets stuck in there

and you can sort of taste it?

Yeah. Well, I'm tasting you right now
and it tastes awful.

Truly disgusting, like salty garbage.

Yeah, I totally taste it.

Oh, Brian, there you are.
Look who's here for lunch.

Hello, Mr. Woods.
Peter tells me you're in films.

Peter, can I talk to you
in the living room?

I can't believe you went
to that much effort just to sabotage me.

You're a jerk, you know that?

Listen, at least I wasn't trying to change
the name of the school

to impress my girlfriend.

Now that is not true.

Oh, yeah?
Then why did you pick Martin Luther King?

Why not Ronald Reagan?

He was always fun,
especially in his later years.

Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

Tear it down.

Reagan smash. Reagan smash.

(BANGING ON WALL)

What's that?

Oh, it's just Reagan.

Just leave him alone.
He'll tire himself out.

Reagan sleepy.

You're an ass, you know that?

You're just jealous because
I'm hanging around with someone else.

Hey, I don't care, man.
Girls are stupid anyway.

Well, fine.
Then maybe I'll go see her right now.

Fine! I'll just hang out with James Woods.

Well, Peter, thanks for lunch.

Guess I'll be heading back to old LA now.

You're leaving?

Oh, man, I thought maybe
you could stick around

and, you know,
maybe you and me could be pals.

You mean just hang around
like regular people.

Regular people, sure, yeah.

That does sound appealing.

You know what?
I'm gonna check back into my hotel.

Oh, screw that.
You'll stay with me right here.

Come on, we'll have a campout in the yard.

Wicked cool.

(USING EERIE VOICE)

His sweater was neatly folded on the grave

so we went back to the car

and the severed hook was hanging
from the door handle

because the calls were coming
from inside the house.

(FRIGHTENED OOHING)

That's a scary story, Peter.

It's almost as scary as...boo!

Boy, James Woods, you're the best friend
a guy could ever have.

I feel the same way about you, Peter.

-Shauna? Shauna?
-Brian, over here.

I couldn't save your seat.

I know I'm late, I apologize.

-Hello, fellow moviegoer.
-Sorry, I couldn't get him to move.

-Where have you been?
-I just had it out with Peter.

Would you like some corn?
I brought it from home.

Peter? You're still not friends
with that idiot after what he did?

Well, I mean, that may be a little harsh.

I'm not going to avoid Peter
like the drunk chick at a party.

(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

I just smoked the wrong side
of a cigarette!

Who wants to go swimming?

This song is about me!

Look, Brian, Peter is a jerk.

And as far as I'm concerned,
it's either him or me.

Shauna, come on, why you want
to play a brother like that?

I think I have my answer.

You know what? I will have some of that.

-What the hell is this?
-Creamed corn.

I brought it from home, because I don't
like the creamed corn they have here.

It's too crunchy.

(BRIAN SIGHING)

Peter, I'm sorry, I was a jerk.
Let's be friends again. Okay.

-Peter, can I talk to you for a second?
-What is it, Brian?

Listen, I'm sorry for everything
that's happened between us

and I figure, I don't know, I thought
maybe we could be friends again, huh?

What do you say? I kind of miss
sleeping at the foot of your bed.

-I don't think so.
-Come on, can't we just go...

-I tried to tell you.
-This is my spot now, Brian.

Oh. I see.

(SIGHING)

Look, Lois. Lois, look, look, look.
He's dreaming he's running.

(DOG-LIKE WHIMPERING)

Okay, James, you ready?
Now catch it in your mouth like Brian.

-James, you got to bite down.
-I got a question, Peter.

Motivation. What is my motivation?

Just throw it back to me.

You know what? This is boring.
I got a better idea.

James, do we really
have to watch <i>Videodrome?</i>

Yeah, I think you're really
going to appreciate

all the subtle nuances in my performance.

See? For example, see how even though
this other guy is talking

your eye is drawn to me.

Yeah, that's... that's neat.

-Is there going to be any nudity?
-Yes, I get naked.

You know, it's bad enough
that Peter and I were fighting

but ever since he met James Woods,
it's like I don't even exist.

Do you really care about a man
who used to try and pick up girls

at the Miss USA Pageant?

Hey, how's it going? I'm Peter.
You want to go out sometime?

Maybe you got a Saturday night free...

You know what? To hell with you, then.
Yeah, go to hell.

I'm Peter. What do you say you and me go
get a couple of beers, maybe we could...

Fine. You know what?
You got mosquito-bite boobs anyway.

I don't care. I don't care.
I don't need you.

Hey, how are you? I'm Peter.

I got a coupon for Sizzler
with your name on it.

Maybe the two of us could...

You know what? I don't care.
You're a bitch.

Well Brian, I know you're upset now, but
if there's anything I've learned

in this life is that you can't let
the little things...

Hey! Hey!

Where's my money?
Don't you walk out on me!

Hey.

Hey.

So where's your good buddy, James Woods?

Turns out he wasn't very good
at catching stuff with his mouth.

-Where's your girlfriend?
-Same problem.

(EERIE MUSIC)

(STAMMERING) James, what are
you doing here?

-What's going on?
-Hello, Peter.

Would you like some cold roast beef?

What do you mean?

I don't know, Peter, I had this crazy idea

that you and I were supposed to
have dinner tonight.

But I guess you had other plans, huh?

Brian and I were just at The Clam.

Oh, that's fun.
That sounds like you had a fun time.

And where would I fit in
with the fun time, huh?

Where does James Woods fit into
the fun, you **?

Look, James, you're acting kind of weird.

I'll act however I want to act,
you son of a bitch!

I'm sorry, Peter, I didn't mean that.

Boy, I haven't been this creeped out
since I saw that episode of <i>Star Trek.</i>

-Number One.
-Yes, Captain.

Let me ask you something.

If I whispered in your ear
that Commander Worf's head

looks like a fanny,
would you join me in a laugh?

-Yeah, I could get in on that.
-All right!

Here it comes!

Commander Worf's head looks like a fanny!

-You can both suck my ridges.
-Get a sense of humor, Rocky Dennis.

Boy, I tell you, Brian, James Woods
has been getting kind of obsessive

ever since you and me
started hanging out again.

Yeah, how are you going to handle that?

We got to come up with some crazy
scheme like the kids on <i>That '70s Show.</i>

And I think I got it.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

All right,
that's the last of the Reese's Pieces.

Good. Now we wait.

Peter? A piece of candy!

A piece of candy!

A piece of candy!

A piece of candy!

A piece of candy!

Man, I hope that's James Woods.

'Cause if it's me under there again,
I'm gonna be really pissed off.

It's good to have you back
in that spot, Brian.

It's good to be back, Peter.

By the way, what did you end up doing
with James Woods?

Don't worry, Brian.
He's being examined by top men.

-Who?
-Top men.

Mom, I need to talk to you about Dean.

Which Dean? Howard Dean,
James Dean or Jimmy Dean.

Ugh! Too old, too dead, and too fattening.

You don't have to tell that to my thighs.

Can you ask your thighs
if they borrowed my Gap capris?

They did not and they're
insulted that you even asked such a thing.

As insulted as Kitty Kelley
when people accuse her of taking liberties

with her best-selling tell-alls.

-Almost. Wanna make out?
-Absolutely not.

-Oh, you're so lying.
-I so am.

Oh, honey,
how was your day? Did you catch any fish?

No, but I caught this turtle.
Named him Terence.

Then killed him, and hollowed him out
into an ashtray for Stewie.

Peter, we have a family to feed.

We all count on you to provide for us.

(SIGHING) I know, and I feel terrible.

I must look like a bigger loser

than when I was on that game show.

Okay, Peter! Listen closely and tell us

if this is a song

or the rantings
of former comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.

Here we go.

(MAN GIBBERING)

Oh, Bill, that's gotta be Bobcat.

(BUZZER BUZZING)

Oh, sorry, that was Bjork.

I tell you, fellows,
if I don't find some fish out there soon,

my family's gonna go hungry.

SEAMUS: If it's fish you wants,
Pelican's Reef is where you'll find them.

I've seen fish there,

more fish than you could possibly imagine,

fish as far as the eye can see.

Lots and lots of fish, I, I guess...

I guess, would be the main bullet point
of this presentation.

Jeez, where is this Pelican's Reef?

Th-arr.

But beware, no man has ever returned.

Many have gone, all have been lost.

Vanished, never to be seen again.

No one has ever come back,
I guess, I guess

would be the, the, the central theme
of what I'm trying to get across here.

Pelican's Reef, huh?

Then, that's where I'll go,

because I'm not afraid of a challenge.

So you can watch the sea until I return.

Go on, try it out.

Peter, that doesn't look entirely...

Go on!

Peter, I'm really not comfortable
stepping foot on this...

Lois, I gotta leave
in, like, five minutes.

Is this scotch-tape?

(SCREAMING)

(CHUCKLING) You drunk.

Boy, I really appreciate
you guys helping me out on this.

Peter, we're your friends.

We're always there
for you in your time of need.

Especially when you provide the free beer.

(LAUGHING)

Uh...

Hey, hey, I got an idea.
Let's play I never.

You gotta drink if you did the thing
that the person says they never did.

Oh, I got one.

I never slept with a woman
with the lights on.

I'll go next. Uh...

I never had sex with Cleveland's wife.

Uh, all right, let's see.

Uh, I never did a chick
in a Logan Airport bathroom.

God, let's see. What else is there?

Um...

I never gave a reach around
to a spider monkey

while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

Oh, God.

I, uh,

I never picked up
an illegal alien at Home Depot

to take home and choke me,
while I touched myself.

Oh, come on.

Uh, I never did the same thing
but with someone from Jo-Ann Fabrics.

Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

Oh, boy. He's out cold.
Hey, let's write on him.

(GIGGLING)

(THUDDING)

What the hell is that?

Oh, my God. There's fish everywhere.

Wow! This must be Pelican's Reef.

Holy crap! We're rich!

Rich? I'll tell you what's rich

The amusing folksy monologues
of young Will Rogers.

But me, I like the visual slapstick gag.

Like this comically oversized powder puff.

Makeup. Now, that's rich.

(LAUGHS)

Play me off, Johnny.

(PLAYING FAST, LIVELY MELODY)

In local news, we have more
on the approach of Hurricane RuPaul,

which is working his
or her way up the coast.

Let's go live to Ollie Williams

with the Black-U-Weather Report. Ollie?

It's raining sideways!

Sounds rough, Ollie.
Do you have an umbrella?

-Had one!
-Where is it?

Inside out, two miles away!

-Is there anything we can do for you?
-Bring me some soup!

-What kind?
-Chunky!

All right, we'll get on that.

Coming up next,
a pig who refuses to eat Jews?

After this.

A hurricane.
Oh, my God! Peter's out there.

Don't worry, Lois.
Peter's good at getting out of trouble.

Just like Kobe Bryant.

We want the truth, Kobe. Did you rape her?

-Ooh!
-Ooh!

What were we talking about?

That's a hell of a catch, Peter.

Guys, this is great.

Not only will I be able to put food
on the table and pay all my bills,

I'll also be able
to finance my Christmas album.

They sank, I guess,

so many blow-up dolls,

The tiniest prick will pop these things.

Giggity.

We've been out here for days.
I'm starving.

(CRUNCHING)

Hey, what's that? Uh, what?

You're eating something.

-You bastard! You have food?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

Give me that.

Yeah. See, now this is why
I didn't say anything.

I knew you were gonna get like this.

What the hell is wrong with you?

-Look, look, Joe, I, Joe...
-You've been eating me!

Okay, you know what?
Let's just agree to disagree.

Hey, guys. There's an island.

PETER: Holy Crap! Oh, thank God!

(ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

Oh, wow. I feel like an explorer.

Just like my ancestor,
Ponce De Leon Griffin.

There it is, boys, the Fountain of Youth.
Just like I told you.

Well, that was worth
the eight-year boat ride.

We gather today to remember
those brave Quahog men

who were lost at sea.

The Bible declares, "an eye for an eye,"

so let us now take our vengeance
on this murderous ocean.

(GRUNTING)

You won't be hurting anyone anymore.

I just can't believe he's gone.

Don't worry, Lois. We'll get through this.

Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.

(WAILING) Daddy!

Oh, Daddy!

I know, sweetie. I'm sad, too

But you're making a scene.
All our friends are here.

Ah, screw you, fish.

Oh, I miss you so much.

But I promise, one day
I'll see you again, Captain Caveman.

It feels like we've been here forever.

Okay, okay, here's one.

What would you guys
rather be? Blind or a midget?

Oh, that's easy. Blind.

It heightens your other senses
to near superhero levels.

Yeah, and every woman I did
would be Cheryl Tiegs.

(CHUCKLES) All right.

Definitely blind.

Aw, you guys are crazy.

You don't wanna be a midget?

One of those funny little guys

running around
getting in all kinds of shenanigans?

Smoking a cigar,
while you're riding around in a stroller?

-Good point.
-Never thought of it that way.

They are God's little punch lines.

Okay, all right.
Here's another one. Black or crippled?

(SIGHING) All right, fellas.

We've been out here for months,

and we all know
that men have certain needs.

And being that there's no women around,

we're gonna have to have an orgy.

-Uh, anybody horny?
-No.

-No.
-No.

Yeah, me neither.

Uh, and whoever's toe that is,
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

but, uh, I think you can stop.

Boy, I'm sure glad
nobody's here to see this.

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

(MAN OVER PA): <i>And if you</i>

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

<i>...fanny bandits.</i>

Well, that was a great cruise.

Yeah, the buffet was great.

And I enjoyed shooting Skeet.

Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich,
we'll get you to the hospital.

You bastard.

There's nothing good
about what you do or who you are.

Lois, I'm home.

-(GASPS) Peter?
-CHRIS: Daddy.

-Dad.
-What's your name again?

I wanna say Allen.

Oh, it's so good to see you guys.

Peter, we'd given up hope.

I can't tell you
how happy I am that you're alive.

Oh, come here, sweetheart.

Wait, Peter.
There's something you should know.

I'm not quite sure
how to tell you this, but I got remarried.

What?

Well, it was a very difficult time,
and he was there for us.

What the hell... Who was there for you?

Honey, I'm home.

Peter, you're alive!

Brian?

This is just
like that sitcom where there's two dads.

Except nobody's laughing.

No, wait, it's the same.

You... You married Brian?

Peter, remember. We thought you were dead.

I needed help, and Brian was there.

He even took a job selling cars
to keep the family afloat.

Well, just get a divorce,
and everything will be back to normal.

It's not that easy.

What am I supposed to tell Brian?

Thanks for saving our family, now scram.

And besides,
he's been great with the kids.

I mean, Chris is doing better in school,

and Meg even went on a date
with the announcer from the <i>Super Friends.</i>

Meanwhile, under Meg Griffin's bra.

Fine, fine. I can see I'm not wanted here.

Maybe I'll just find my own place.

Oh, Peter. I just feel
terrible about this.

I don't need your sympathy.
I don't need anything.

You know what?
Maybe I'll just go take up my old job

as a construction worker in New York.

Although I never did get
the catcalling right.

(WHISTLING)

Yeah, baby!

I want a piece of that.

You suck!

Hey, listen, Lois.

You know, I know
your head must be turned upside down

by this whole Peter thing.

So, you know, if there's
anything you wanna talk about...

Oh, don't worry, Brian.

I'll admit this is an emotional time
for me, but you and I are married

and that's the way it's gonna stay.

So, uh, any possibility of, uh,

tonight being the night
we finally push the beds together.

Good night, Brian.

Come on.

Jeez, enough with that already.

You're like a dog with a bone.

Tell me about it. I'll be in the basement.

Doing what?

BRIAN: What do you think?

Wow, Joe, where'd you get the new legs?

Transplant. They belonged
to a death row inmate who got the chair.

Unfortunately for me,
he was also a paraplegic.

(SIGHS) Guys,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Lois is the only woman for me.

Well, then, it sounds like you've gotta
find a way to win her back.

Yeah, like, like we could get her drunk

and take turns having sex with her.

-How would that help me?
-Oh, help you?

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Then, no.

No, then, that... that wouldn't help you.

Well, Joe is absolutely right.

I just gotta figure out
a way to win Lois back.

I can do that, I'm a smart guy.

I once built that time machine
out of a DeLorean.

(ENGINE HUMMING)

All right, past. Here I come.

(SCREAMING)

Wow. Everybody in 1955 was on fire.

I never knew that.

Oh, hello, Lois.

Peter, what are you doing here?

And where are your clothes?

Oh, did I forget my clothes?

Oh, you know, I'd leave my ass behind

if it wasn't so
perfectly attached to my sternum.

Perhaps I should cover myself.

Look, Peter, I know what you're trying
to do, but it's not gonna work.

I'm married to Brian.

Oh, that's right. How inappropriate of me

Well, I guess, I should be going.

Lois, Lois, do you...

-Do you have a magnet in your head?
-What?

You must,
because it's attracting my buns of steel.

Peter, knock it off.

You knock it off.
You're the one with the magnet.

I'm serious, knock it o...

(GIGGLING)

Peter, no.

Peter, for God's sake.

(PETER CHUCKLING)

LOIS: Oh, who am I kidding'?
I can't fight this anymore.

(BOTH MOANING)

LOIS: I missed you so much.

Lois, I smell whipped cream.
Are you making strawberry shortca...

(SCREAMING)

(STEWIE CONTINUES SCREAMING)

So it's a shouting match you want, eh?

Well, game on, Quahog.

(SCREAMING)

I'm beating you!

Hey, Griffin, your sales are
in the toilet. You got problems at home?

No! What... What would make you say that?

Eh, ex-husband back in the picture.

You're working during the day.

They got time to bump uglies.

That's right, I said, "bump uglies."

Big whoop. Wanna fight about it?

Shut up, Patty, you're crazy.

Lois would never cheat on me.
I trust her completely.

It's 10:30 at night,
and you have a saddle.

Well, it's a... I...

Um... (CHUCKLING)

What's this?
(GASPS) What's this, Brian, huh?

-What's this, huh?
-It's a ball.

Oh, is this your ball?
You want it, huh? You want this, huh?

Yes, I would like...
I would like it, please, yes.

Yeah, you want this, huh?
You want the ball?

-Yes, I would like to have it very much.
-You want it, huh?

You want the ball?

I would enjoy having it, yes.
Give it to me

Go, get it.

I... I'm sorry, Lois. I was mistaken.

I thought you threw the ball in there,

but I can see now you still have it.

Go, get the ball.

-I say, are you blind, or just stupid?
-What do you mean?

Perhaps you'd like to see
what Lois and the fat man

have been up to in your absence.

Hello, MTV. Um, I think I would be perfect
for <i>The Real World,</i>

uh, because I speak my mind
and not everyone likes that.

Uh,

but I'm not afraid to go there.

And, uh, I can be sexy.

Turn around. Look at my fanny.

Look at my fanny. Look at my fanny.

LOIS: Peter, I can't keep sneaking around

with you like this.

It, It's not fair to Brian.

What about me, Lois. I love you, too.

And, And the other thing is,
Lois, uh... Hi, he's a dog!

Please. Please don't
make this any harder than it has to be.

You know, I will always love you,

but I made a commitment to Brian.

I can never repay him
for what he's done for this family.

I'm sorry, Peter.

All right, Simon, do your worst.

Lois, listen.

Uh, I... We... We need to talk.

Oh, my, I better leave you two alone.

What's the matter, Brian?

I've been thinking about us.

And, uh...
I just don't think it's working out.

STEWIE: Oh, my God. No way.

You... You wanna break up. Why?

I, I just don't think
you're the right woman for me.

STEWIE: Oh, bitch. You got jacked, bitch.

Maybe you should see
if Peter will still take you back.

I'm, I'm sorry, Lois.

I understand, Brian.

There's no possible way
I can ever thank you enough for this.

You're a good friend.

You're a good friend too, Lois.

STEWIE: Oh, that's kind of nice.

Well, thank God, everything's
back to normal, eh?

I'll say

And to think, Brian, I was, like,
a day away from having sex with you.

I was gonna push those beds together

and take you around
the freaking world, Brian.

(CHUCKLES)

But a nice pat on the head
is just as good, huh?

You want your ball? You want your ball?

No, Lois, I don't want the ball right now.

-I'll be in the basement.
-Doing what?

BRIAN: What do you think?

Okay, somebody's gonna
have to explain that to me.

Well, that's not nice.

And what's with those Starbucks, huh?

You've been out of work forever.

No.

Do you hate your body so much...

you have to reduce every painting of

Don't you do that.
Don't make this my fault.

-It's your fault. I just wanna come home
-You're the one who hasn't

-and have dinner. And have my wife say,

-it's like living with my brother
- "Hello, how's... your day?" Oh no.

-That's impossible for you. What?

Okay. It's over now because you say it is.

I don't care what she says.
I'm never going back!

Look, you can't run away
from your problems, Chris.

That's what I tried to do.

I joined the Peace Corps and a day later,
I was two continents away.

-Really?
-Yup.

But 6,000 miles
and all the dope I could smoke

still couldn't separate me
from my problems.

And this was good dope.
I mean, it was growing everywhere.

Oh, my God.
This one time, we got so baked

we ended up eating all the food
the World Health Organization

had airlifted in.
Man, those villagers were so pissed.

They tried to chase us, but let me
just say, thank God for polio.

Anyway, my point is that...

Is Peter here? I want to re-hire him.
My new eye isn't working out.

Hey, Wheat Thins! Take your top off.

(SINGING) <i>I like pancakes, I like pancakes</i>
<i>They make me a happy Peter</i>

<i>I am happy, I am happy</i>
<i>la-la-la-la-la</i>

Peter, you seem happy this morning.

You bet.
I'm starting my new job at the brewery.

Finally, I'm one of those guys who can't
wait to get to work in the morning.

Like a dairy cow.

(MOANING EXCITEDLY)

Oh, yes!

Yes!

(GROANS)

Peter, I just found this note
in Chris' room.

-He ran away to join the Peace Corps.
-Oh, my God! Give me that!

No, that.

(LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY)

I'm bored with it now!

Peter, Chris ran off to South America.

Well, where the hell
would he get an idea like that?

Wait a second. Don't we know someone
who was in the Peace Corps?

Yeah, who was that?
Was that Beau Bridges?

-Do we know Beau Bridges?
-No, we don't.

I am positive we know somebody
who was in the Peace Corps.

Look, it's me, all right.
He got the idea from me.

Brian, what the hell is wrong with you?

I didn't do it on purpose.

And before you fly off the handle,
you may want to think about it.

The kid's obviously confused.
This might be good for him.

People do crazy things
when they're confused.

Like the time my agent
dropped that bomb on me.

-No one in this town will hire you.
-Oh, yeah?

Taxi. Taxi. Taxi!

All right, Chris.
We're approaching your assigned village.

Tell the people to work together
and drink clean water.

And by the way, the word colored still
flies down there. So, get your fill.

(SCREAMING)

Hello, I am Chief Oleki.
Welcome to my village.

Our air is clean. Our food is bountiful
and our water is caffeine-free.

Never had it. Never will.

This is my daughter, Loka.

My son, Hidalgo. And my cousin, Vinny.

Hey, how you doing?
Give me a word, any word at all...

and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickel.

(PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-Hi, Mom.

-Chris, are you all right?
-Chris, buddy, thank God you're okay!

-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, this has been driving me crazy.

-Who was the chick on <i>Remington Steele?</i>
-Hello?

-Stephanie Zimbalist?
-No, Stewie Griffin. Who's this?

-Thank you.
-Chris, what are you doing down there?

Relax, Mom. I'm having a great time.

-You people knocked me off the modem.
-When are you coming home?

How's the food in South America?

Do the women there
have exposed clitterati?

I'll be home in a month, after people
have forgotten I'm a freshman.

Well... Please, just take care
of yourself, honey.

Hey guys. Is everyone on the phone?

-I got to go.
-Something's in the oven.

-I lost a shoe.
-Don't leave me on phone with her!

-Stewie?
-Hey.

-How's school?
-Hi, Stewie.

Listen, I am swamped...

but Mom has kept me up to date
on everything you're doing

and I think it's just great.
Hanging up now.

Boy, this place sure has changed
since Pawtucket Pat sold it.

So, this is where you'll be working,
Mr. Griffin.

Oh, and I should mention, employees
are welcome to free Pawtucket Ale.

We just ask that you don't drink
during your shift.

-That won't be a problem, sir.
-Great.

I'll be right back with your ID badge.

Mr. Griffin, what happened to your pants?

Oh, look, who's here.

Mr. I-don't-have-time-for-your-
Little-League-games.

Come here, you son of a bitch!

(SOBBING)

Why do you close your eyes
when we make love?

(SOBBING)

I wonder how your father's first day
at work went?

(HORN BLOWING)

-Dad, what the hell are you doing?
-Yeah, hey, buddy.

I'll have a triple cheeseburger
and a large fries and...

Do you sell pants?

Hey, Meg, what's with all the beer cans?

My dad got a job at the brewery
and he gets lots of free beer.

Actually, he's kind
of been going overboard lately.

-Oh, my God!
-Hey, Meg, you seen my pants?

Lois, by the way,
we're out of toilet paper.

(SNORING)

Chris, thank you for helping bring water
to my village.

-You're a hero.
-No. Lou Gehrig was a hero.

Excellent. As soon as I release
this biological toxin

into the world's water supply,
I will rule the world.

I'll call it, Lou Gehrig's Disease.

I just have to remember to make sure
this cap is screwed on tight.

Well, I guess the joke's on me.

This is a gift from all of us.
Go ahead, try it on.

Okay.

Oh my, Chris, we can see your genitals.

Just kidding.
Everyone's genitals are hanging out.

Really?
(LAUGHS)

Wow, this is just like Bible camp.

Only I'm not crying and trying
to pretend I'm somewhere else.

Mr. Griffin,
since you can't control your drinking

you've been demoted to
the shipping department.

-Come on!
-This is your new supervisor, Angela.

Mr. Griffin, we have different rules here.
For starters, no drinking. Period.

We start work at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

This is your co-worker, Opie.

He is a burden of the state,
deemed unfit for mainstream society.

He is your superior.

(GURGLING)

What'd he say?

He said he wants you
to put your finger in his mouth.

If you value your job, I'd do it.

He bit me!

Mr. Griffin, although I may not fully
understand Opie's management style...

he has proven himself
a more competent employee than you.

So, in my absence, you will listen to him.

Come on, guy.

Damn it! This is worse than being
Kevin Federline's magic mirror.

Magic mirror,
how can I look like a douchebag today?

Well, Kevin, I would say, first of all,
don't shave or shower.

Okay, I won't.

-And you just got out of bed, right?
-Yeah.

I would say, just go ahead
and wear that tank top all day.

Okay.

All right, so we covered the hygiene,
no collared shirts.

Oh, and don't forget to walk around with
an undeserved sense of accomplishment.

(TRIBAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Chris, the festival of the harvest is
the time of celebration for my people.

-Would you like to dance?
-Sure!

No one's ever asked me to dance before.

You've engaged the entire tribe in dance.

According to our customs,
you're now married to my daughter.

I couldn't be happier.

Well, if you're happy then I'm happy,
because after all... What?

My job sucks.

I'm tired of always scrounging around
on the bottom rung of society

getting kicked around by the Man.

Like when I worked in that lab
with Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.

(JABBERING)

Agreed, Peter.

We got a letter from Chris!

Okay, he says he's doing great,
having a wonderful time.

He met a girl. He got married?

He says he's not coming back.

I can't believe Chris got married.

Everybody, this is my wife, Loka.
We're married.

(SNICKERING)

Well, maybe here, but not in America,
where God pays attention.

Now, get your things together.
We're leaving right now.

Mom, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm happy here.

This is my home.

You guys got an ATM?
I only got $37 on me.

What's the matter with them?

We've never seen
that much money before.

-You are richest man in the country.
-Richest man in the country?

Wow, no Griffin's been this powerful
since my ancestor King Arthur Griffin.

Arthur, if you are able to draw
the sword from the stone

and prove to me you truly are
the sole king of Camelot

I will make love to you right here
in the clearing.

What if I can just move it an inch,
will you touch me?

This is amazing. You've got the biggest
hut in the village and all these servants

and you've only spent $1.50.

That's a hell of a lot less than I had
to spend

to go see that piece-of-crap remake
of <i>Bewitched.</i>

-Guess what? I'm a witch.
-Guess what? I'm a Clippers fan.

-Hello.

Peter, this is ridiculous.
We came here to take Chris home.

Why are we staying?

Because I'm tired of being treated
like crap at work.

Don't you see what this means to me?
I'm somebody here.

I'm the richest guy in town.

Dad, don't you see?
This is a wonderful place

and you're just using it to escape
from your problems at home.

What do you mean? Meg's right there.

But Chris, honey,
aren't you doing the same thing?

What do you mean?

I mean, you just came here because
you were being picked on at school.

You're using these people
to escape your problems.

Oh, my God. You're right.

I married this 11-year-old girl
for all the wrong reasons.

I'm sorry, Loka.

I guess I just came here because
I was afraid of being a freshman.

Good evening. We're back.

Peter, to answer your question,

if you want to control content,

you'd have to start

John-Boy?

JOHN-BOY: Damn it!
Can't a guy masturbate in this house?

Peter, look at these numbers. We're a hit.

You know, if I were you, I'd think about
expanding your programming somehow.

Brian, that's a great idea.

That's exactly what we need
to take PTV to the next level.

Original programming.

STEWIE: <i>Cheeky Bastard is filmed</i>

Oh, my God! Where is my roast pheasant?

Hmm, by now I think it's
in my lower intestine.

(LAUGHTER RESONATES)

You ate it? But I told you my boss
was coming here for dinner.

Well, unless he likes pork rinds,

he's going home hungry.

Welcome to <i>Midnight Q.</i>

Tonight we're gonna
enjoy the smooth jazz of Charles Mingus.

Norman Mailer is here
to read an excerpt from his latest book.

And then we also have
a girl from Omaha who's hiding a banana.

We'll find out where.

Giggity, giggity, giggity goo.
Stick around.

So, what do you think?

I'm not sure, Peter.

You gotta be careful about
what you put on your network.

You know how impressionable children are.

I mean, remember what happened
after Chris saw Jackie Mason?

Chris, you should have left
for school already.

Oy, sister, don't start with me.

I didn't go, I wanted
to go, I forgot to go, I should have gone.

Chris, just go.

Mom, relax, you look so hagga-zabba-zell.

You should lie down
or your heart might go pfft.

(GROANS) More fan mail.

Sheesh, Brian, people freaking love us.
We're gonna be huge.

Peter, I really want you to cancel that
show with the animals having sex.

For your information, Lois,
it's called <i>Dogs Humping,</i>

and it is the cornerstone
of our Wednesday night lineup.

Lois, responsibility
lies with the parents.

There are plenty of things that are much
worse for children than television.

Like when Peter babysat
for the neighbor's kid.

All right, I couldn't find your toys,

so why don't you just play with
this blow dryer and these rattles?

Well, guess that's it. You probably
want me to get out of your hair.

So here's the Drano
in case there's a clog.

Uh, soap's right there next to the radio,
and towels are on the roof.

So, good night.

Look, it's one thing
for a network to run inappropriate shows

that I can't do anything about.

But I will not
have it happening in my own house.

Lois, there is absolutely nothing
inappropriate about my programming.

Hi, there. And welcome
to <i>The Peter Griffin</i> -<i>Side Boob Hour.</i>

A wonderful look back
on all the partial nudity

network television used to offer.

Look at that side boob.

Check out this side boob.

How about that side boob?
That turn you on?

Well, it shouldn't,
because that's my side boob.

Good night, everybody.

LOIS: The <i>Side Boob Hour?</i>

Peter, that's it.

I asked you to stop this
and you didn't listen to me.

I'm sorry, but you
left me no other choice. I called the FCC.

Oh, yeah. I know all about the FCC.

(BOUNCY INTRO)

(SINGING) <i>They will clean up</i>

Mr. Griffin, that was terrific.

But I'm here to tell you,
that as of today,

PTV is officially shut down.

Shut me down, huh?

Well, you'll have to catch me first.

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ow! Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah!

(ENGINE SPLUTTERS)

All right, you caught me.

We're tired of you
infecting people with your smut.

This is an epidemic.
And it must be contained.

Well, Mr. FCC, you can stop PTV,

but you can never
stop people from being who they are!

Or can we?

(SCREAMS)

-What are you doing?
-Censoring real life.

His chin looks like balls.

You want me to cover that, too?

How long are you guys
gonna be censoring us?

Until you and all of Quahog
start to clean up your act.

Lois, these eggs are scrambled.

I thought for sure
you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.

(SNICKERS)

Brian, stop writing jokes for Peter.

And, Peter, you brought this on yourself

by putting on those filthy shows.

Oh, Lois, you are so full of...

-(HORN BLARES)

What?

-Now I can't say... in my own... house?

-(HORN BLARES)

That is the best.

What the hell is this?

The FCC has forbidden audible flatulence.

Everyone is now required
to wear this device

that converts all fart sounds
into Steven Wright jokes.

DEVICE: I spilled spot remover
on my dog. Now he's gone.

Oh, this is bogus!

Two shakes, that's it. Move along.

Oh. Why, thank you, tinkle fairy.

Lois, you ruined everything,
you know that?

Peter, I know it's a little extreme.

But when it comes to our children,

it's better to err
on the safe side. Isn't that right?

No. You know, Lois,
if everybody was as closed-minded as you,

the world wouldn't
have some of its most inspired creations.

Man, this chocolate bar is delicious.

Oh, yeah. I love peanut butter.

How about a little angry sex, huh?

Oh, all right.

(HORN BLARES)

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Those actions are highly inappropriate.

What? Wait a minute.
We're not allowed to have sex?

Oh, you can have sex.

Just no moaning, no tongue-kissing,

no thrusting, no movement whatsoever.

Well, this isn't very romantic.

I mean, how are we supposed to...

I'm done. Night, Lois.

(SNORING)

(SIGHS) Oh.

-Come on, you son of a...
-(HORN BLARES)

-Oh... me.
-(HORN BLARES)

Brian, would you mind?

(SIGHS) Yeah, sure.

Oh, sorry.

I haven't had sex in two weeks.

I'm just a little on edge lately.

(SCOFFS) A little? There wasn't this much
tension when the slaves were freed.

Uh, okay, so, uh, you're free to go.

But we're cool, right?

(SIGHS) Peter, we have to talk.

Look, I thought this FCC thing
was a good idea at first,

but it's... it's just gone way too far.

What, uh, are you saying, Lois?

Well...

I don't want to admit it,
but I think you were right.

I don't believe it! Finally I can do this!

(FANFARE PLAYING)

I set that thing up 15 years ago.

Hey, where's the clown?

We've got to do something about this.
Pack your bag, Peter.

We're going to Washington.

Oh, there he is.

Are we there yet?

No, Chris, honey, we're not.

Are we there yet?

No, Chris.

Are we there yet?

Yes, Chris, yes. Okay? We're there.

Liar!

<i>East of Eden?</i>

So you... you pretty much
do whatever Oprah tells you to, huh?

You know, this book's
been around for 50 years. It's a classic.

But you just got it last week,

and there's a giant
Oprah sticker on the front.

Oh, oh, is that what that is?

Let me just peel that right off.

So, uh, what are you
gonna read after that one?

Well, she hasn't told us yet. Damn!

(CROWD CHATTERING)

(FART RESONATING)

Gentlemen, that was a fart.

What's going on out here?

I'll tell you what's going on.

This government's FCC

is trying to take
all the farts away from television!

And all the sex,
and all the nudity, and all the poop.

Well, I say it's wrong.

These things are
part of the fabric of American life.

Well, we appreciate your passion

but this Congress supports the FCC.

Indecency is un-American.

Oh, yeah?

Well, I can prove to you
that that's a bunch of bull.

Look around you.

The Washington Monument.

Looks an awful lot
like a penis, doesn't it?

The Capitol Building,
quite obviously a giant boob.

And the Pentagon?

Well, you look me in the eye and tell me
it doesn't look like a big anus.

My God! How could we have been so blind?

He's absolutely right.

Come to think of it, have you ever looked
closely at the Lincoln Memorial?

Our top story, the FCC's content ban
on Quahog has finally been lifted.

Well, you did it, Peter. You beat the FCC.

(SHUSHING) Lois, Lois,
let's watch <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

Look what I did, everybody.

Isn't it the biggest,
most super-special poop you've ever seen?

Well, Cindy, I guess it's true
that big things come in small packages.

How come you never told us
you dropped out of college?

I saw an after-school special about that.

It didn't work out too well
for Kristy McNichol.

But then again, nothing did.

I was only one course shy of graduating
and I just cracked under the pressure.

And now it just cost me
the best job I ever had.

Well, don't take it too hard.
You're not the first person to get fired.

Look, Louis, the French people really want

Life isn't what you thought it would be.

Boy, I'll tell you, not graduating

But, Brian, if you only had one class left

why don't you just go back and finish?

-Plenty of people do that.

I'm gonna call Lois
and have her pick you up right now.

Hi, I'm your roommate Caleb.
I like cutting myself. I bleed a lot.

Could I have the top bunk?

He already has a roommate. Me.
We're a couple of crazy college kooks.

For example, we're about to make
a hilarious answering-machine message.

You've reached Stewie and Brian.
We're not here right now.

And if this is Mom, send money
because we're college students

and we need money
for books and highlighters,

and Ramen Noodles,

and condoms for sexual relations
with our classmates.

All right, fine. You can stay if you want.
But what do I tell Lois?

You don't have to tell her anything.
Gary Coleman owed me a favor.

Stewie, you want some more strained peas?

It's an MC Escher drawing.

Look, Stewie,
I got to finish this assignment

Stewie, I can't use this.

That sounds like a job for the A-Team.

-Hi, Dad.
-Go to your room.

Okay.

<i>Ah, Brian.</i>

<i>I am glad you could come</i>

<i>Do you think I like hitting you?</i>

<i>I am sorry you had to see that.</i>

Look, sir, I really need to confess
something to you.

-That assignment I turned in...
<i>-You know, Brian,</i>

<i>before you came along,</i><i>I was so depressed,</i>

<i>I was planning to kill myself.</i>

<i>But you have inspired me.</i>

<i>If you can learn,</i>

<i>Now, what was it you wanted to say?</i>

Nothing.

<i>You were supposed to get potato chips,</i>

<i>Damn it, Helen.</i>
<i>Get the hell off my back or so help me.</i>

<i>So help me.</i>

Don't worry.
I hear they have great makeup sex.

(BOTH MOANING)

<i>Not so fast. You are hurting me.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

-All right. All right.
-Stewie, come on. We're going home.

What the devil are you talking about?

My final exam is tomorrow

and the only way I'm gonna pass
is if I cheat.

And if I do that, what was the point
of coming back to college?

We can't leave. It's almost halftime
and we all pooped in the tuba.

(MARCHING BAND PLAYING)

Hey, what are you guys doing?
This is a job site.

No, it's not! It's Roger Williams Park,

and we're here to stop you
from destroying it.

Whoa! Whoa!
What are you gonna do? Kill us?

Oh, no, no. We wouldn't do that.

We'll probably just shoot the ground
all around you to make you scared.

And then you'll jump in your truck
and speed off,

hit something and do a wicked flip
through the air.

-Well, that'd kill us.
-No, no.

You guys will just roll out of the vehicle
and dust yourself off

and lumber back to your hideout, defeated.

Buddy, I had a cousin got in
a fender bender at five miles an hour,

messed his neck up,
he's got partial numbness.

He's just not the same guy anymore.

-Was he wearing his safety belt?
-Thank God.

Yeah, 'cause, you know, I know this guy
who took his car in for an oil change.

And then later he got in a wreck,
and the airbag didn't deploy.

Turns out they stole it,
sold it for spare parts.

-No way!
-It happens.

They call them chop shops.
Makes it harder to track stolen parts.

Jeez, that is awful.

Well, look,
you guys got a lot of work to do.

We should probably get out of your hair.

Take it easy, guys.

CLEVELAND: Don't forget
to put your tools away.

-We blew it, didn't we?
-Boy, you can say that again.

We were right there,
ready to save Roger Williams Park,

and we got sidetracked
by idle conversation.

We're a terrible A-Team.

You know what the problem is?
We didn't stay focused.

That's exactly it. I was gonna...
We didn't stay focused.

I mean, we were right there, you know?
And then we just...

Somehow we just... I mean...

Well, it's already been said.
We didn't stay focused.

MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>And now back to</i> The Facts of Life.

Hey, Mrs. Garrett,
can I ask you something?

What is it, Jo?

Is it a problem if your penis
and your vagina touch each other?

What?

Well, I try to keep them separated,

but I woke up this morning
and they were sort of together.

I just didn't know. Is that okay?

-You have both?
-Well, yeah. Doesn't everybody?

No!

-Brian, what are you doing home?
-I couldn't do it, Lois.

You know, I thought
I'd be able to finish this time.

But I just don't have what it takes
to be a college graduate.

But you're so close.
I mean, your final exam's tomorrow.

You can't just give up.
You could study tonight.

-And I think if you really work at it...
-Lois, it's over. All right?

-I'm not going.
-Well, whatever you say.

Hey, what's in this closet?

-What are you doing?
-Well, my, my!

Mr. Hoover's come to visit.

I don't want to see Mr. Hoover.

I wonder if Mr. Hoover has anything to say
about all this?

Lois, this is not funny.
I really don't want to see Mr...

Peter, you're not wearing

What's the point?

You know, I thought I could help people

But it turns out I'm as useless as that

It's like, yeah, she's naked
but who gives a...

Oh, my God, I overslept.
My final exam's in 20 minutes.

Brian, you'll never make it.

Unless there was some kind of team
of people who could get you there in time.

Peter, do you know anybody like that?

-Well, how'd you do?
-I failed.

-What? You failed?

Then what the hell are you smiling for?

Because I took it all the way.
I didn't give up on myself.

And I didn't cheat.

-Wow. You probably should have.
-Yeah. I was just gonna say that.

Yeah, you would have probably
been better off.

Look, it doesn't matter how it turned out.
I finished what I started,

which means I have my pride.
And that's something.

-No, it's not!
-Yeah! Are you out of your mind?

I mean, I don't understand that.

My lipstick? What?

(CHUCKLING) Oh.

Oh, right, right.
Right, because of my penis.

Yeah, that's... That's...
That's fantastic.

Lois, Brian won't take me to the park.

Then he talked about his ding-dong.

Lois. Lois!

Damn it, woman! Pay attention to me!

Ow! Stewie, that's not nice.

Don't grab Mommy's pants like that.

You could really hurt her.

Yes. Yes, I could, couldn't I?

I could hurt Mommy.

Shame on us, Rupert.

Oh, there you are, Opie.

Congratulations. You made

Man, this is the worst job I've had

Employee of the Month again.

All because my boss hates me.

Maybe you need
to brown-nose her a little bit, Peter.

Really? I thought you said she was ugly.

Oh, oh, oh, you mean kiss up to her.

That's a great idea, Joe.

And if that doesn't do it,

you could always just
work hard and be polite.

That's how I won friends
when I worked for E!

I'm not Seabiscuit. I'm Penelope Cruz.

All right. I'll do
something special for her.

Miss Hobson, Stewie's
really been acting out a lot at home.

And I was just wondering,
how's he been behaving at school?

Hmm. Mrs. Griffin, let me
show you some pictures he drew in class.

-Notice anything unusual?
-I sure do.

-His father's not in any of them.
-Exactly.

Well, Peter's been
very preoccupied with work lately.

I guess Stewie's been missing his father.

Thank you for letting me know.

-(CROSSBOW FIRING)

Well, I suppose it's not the first time

someone's made a miscalculation.

What happens to us in the future, Doc?

It's your kids, Marty.
Something's gotta be done about your kids.

-What do you mean?
-Your daughter marries a black man.

That... That's actually
not a big deal for me

Yeah, me neither.

Well, it... Well, it... You... Really?

Yeah. I mean, w-what's...
What's wrong with that?

Oh, no, no, nothing, nothing.

It's nothing, I guess.
I think... I think it's great.

Congratulations.

I don't think I'm comfortable

Did you know peanut butter was invented

-by a black man?
-Too late, Doc.

Oh, hi, Herbert. What brings you here?

It seems your son's baseball
broke one of my windows the other day.

Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

Chris, this is gonna come out
of your allowance.

Oh...

Perhaps we could work something out.

I could use a strapping young man

to do some chores around my house.

That seems fair to me.

Chris, you have damaged
this man's property.

And until you pay off the debt,

you'll do whatever job he wants you to do.

And at the end of the day,
if you're exhausted

and your face is dripping wet,

well, that just means you did a good job.

That sounds fine.

I don't want to spend my weekend
doing chores.

You know, Chris,
a little hard work can do wonders.

Just look at how they built the pyramids.

They say all peoples
must go through some hard times.

Well, we Jews are getting
ours out of the way early.

From here on out,
it's gonna be nothing but smooth sailing.

I have an announcement to make.

Don't you do it.
Don't you lose a single pound.

I don't care what
those Hollywood image-makers say.

Big women are sexy.

(SIGHS)
I wanted to tell you

that Opie will
not be receiving Employee of the Month,

because he's being promoted!

Oh, yes! That means
I'm Employee of the Month.

No, you're not, Griffin.
I'm giving it to Soundwave.

So, I can just put my stuff anywhere?

My wife, Denise.
We met in a Christian chat room.

Peter, we need to talk about your son.

The fat one or the funny-looking one?

Ha ha ha! Dad called you fat.

Wait.

Stewie's really been acting out lately.

And, I think it's 'cause
he's not spending enough time with you.

It's time that you take
an interest in your son.

Starting today,
I want you to spend more time with Stewie.

Uh... Okay.

You can make a box fort.

See? Here's a box.
You can pretend it's a fort.

Actually, that sounds
like fun. I want this.

PETER: I'm king in here.

Peter, maybe Stewie
would like to play fort, too.

No!

PETER: If you need me, I'll be in space.

Great idea bringing Stewie
to Fenway Park, Peter.

Yeah. There's no better place
for a father and son

to really get
to know each other than a ball game.

Uh, where is Stewie?

(PANTING)

(GASPING) Is that a baby in there?

(SILENCE)

And this is the hand
that caused all the trouble.

(LAUGHS) Got your nose, little guy.

(SCREAMING)

Peter, did you take
Stewie to a strip club?

He smells like sweat and fear.

Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon
is not exactly their "A" squad.

I actually saw bullet wounds.

You can't just take him places
you want to go. He's a baby.

Look, Lois, I think I know how
to spend time with my own kid, all right?

The bond between
a father and son is sacred.

I'm sorry, Jesus. But my house, my rules.

Up yours, Joseph. You're not my real dad.

(BEEPING)

(RINGING)

-Hello?
-Hey, Dad, it's me.

Listen, things here
aren't working out anymore.

And I was just... I was wondering,

can... Can I come live
with you and Janet for a while?

Oh, wow, kiddo. You know, I'd love that,

but I don't know if now is the best time.
Maybe next year, okay?

I'll see you Friday night.

Tell your mother I sent the check.

So, where were we?

Right about here.

-Ah, come on, baby, it's my birthday.
-No.

All I'm saying is
that you just need to find an activity

that you and Stewie can share.

Peter, can you reach that box of rice?

-Ow!
-Oh, sorry, Lois.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, oh, that rice got you, bitch.

Hey, Stewie's laughing.

Hey, you think that's funny?
Hey, you like that?

Hey, hey, Lois, you want
some beans with that rice?

Ow!

Oh! Oh, I misjudged you, fat man.

Damn it. Peter, what's wrong with you?

Wait, wait, wait, Lois, Lois, don't move.
Stewie's loving this.

(SMASHING) (LAUGHS)

See if she's got any cash on her.

(CHORTLING)

Okay, Stewie, get the camera ready.

(SHOUTING)

Peter, stop it!

What the hell are you doing?

What do you think I'm doing?

you weren't coming.

Sorry I'm late, Mr. Herbert.

Well, I guess I'll get started.

You know, if you get
sweaty and want to take your shirt off,

that'd be just fine.

This is not what I had in mind!

I am furious with you!

You can't talk to him like that.

Take that!

Stewie, you're going to your room.

think not, Dad's got my back.

Eh, Stewie, she looks mad.
You better go to your room.

What? What's the matter with you, fat man?

Stop her. Help me, you fool.

You traitor.

Peter, don't forget
you have a physical today at 1:00.

For the hundredth time, Lois,
I won't forget.

Nag, nag, nag.

Sometimes I think
I should have married that woman

I met the night of my bachelor party.

Peter, I can't believe
your friends just left you here.

Let's get you home.

Wow, strange lady. You're so sexy.

I should marry you tomorrow
instead of that pain-in-the-ass Lois.

Peter, it's me.

You know what? Screw it.

I am so gonna cheat on Lois right now.

-I don't care if she finds out.
-Peter...

You got a condom? Never mind.
I got this Milky Way wrapper.

-Put this on.
-Why?

Because I'm skipping my physical
to go have steaks with the guys

and I don't want Lois to know about it.

Um, okay.

Lois, I'm going to my physical now.

Okay, honey. I'll see you later.

Um...

What the hell? I'll just ask it.

Why did we need the horse suit for that?

Okay, all right, that's...

That's seven 16-ounce steaks.

Oh!

Come on, Joe.
You haven't even finished one.

I mean, that guy had two.

I know, I know, I'm terrible.

Which is why I'm gonna order
the cheesecake.

Oh, I can't do it. I'm...

Come on, take the skirt off, you pansy.

Easy, sailor, easy.

Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah.

Too good, matter of fact.

You know what the doctor said?

Doctor said I was too healthy, you know?

In too good of shape.

Don't even know how. Too good of shape.

You didn't go to your physical, did you?

Uh, I did not.

So, Doctor? Is Peter healthy?

My goodness!
You'll be dead within a month.

BOTH: What?

Oh, Hagar the Horrible,
if you keep up that lifestyle

of pillaging and giant turkey legs,
you'll be dead within a month.

Now, on to you.

So, what do you think?
Pretty healthy, huh?

Well, Mr. Griffin, let's take a look

Please. Please.

We can't take any more shtick.

Please, just tell us, is Peter healthy?

Oh, yeah. He's fine. He's just really fat.

Oh, thank God!

Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a second.

Did you just say I was fat?

Well, yeah. You are pretty fat.

Um,

okay. This is news to me.

Boy! This is more awkward
than having sex with a rhinoceros

who doesn't love you anymore.

Why wouldn't you look at me during?

(SOBBING)

Hey, how was your physical?

Stupid doctor said I was fat.
Can you believe that idiot?

Well, Peter, you are on the large side.

Oh, please, Brian. If I was fat,

could I do this with a Hula-Hoop?

No. No, no, I guess
you couldn't do that if you were fat.

That's an old family photo.

My mother gave it to me.

Huh, that's weird.

So there's no worry
if you don't catch the ball in the cup.

Oh, well, that's ridiculous.
Patrick is a very nice man.

And you should be ashamed of yourself
for locking up your own son.

Whose pickle is this?

This just in. The body of a local fat man

was found murdered
in Quahog Park last night.

Police released this sketch
of the suspect.

Oh, my God!

Police also released
this sketch of a female accomplice

believed to be his wife.

Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.

has struck again.

at Quahog Park last week,

a lot like Patrick.

Oh, that's ridiculous.

I don't know. I mean, he's clearly crazy.

Look at that imaginary wife of his.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a relief.

Yeah, the Fat Guy Strangler's living here
and there's a fat guy in the house.

This'll be a bigger disaster

All right, everybody,
just make yourselves at home.

Lois, these are the fat guys.

My God, look at you fat bastards.

I bet none of you

Until they find
the Fat Guy Strangler, we will stay...

So he has pictures of himself
strangling fat guys.

That doesn't mean
he's the Fat Guy Strangler.

Oh, yeah? What about
the dead fat guy under his bed?

Coincidence?

What about the half-dead
fat guy in the corner?

Patrick tried to kill me.

-Well, maybe it's a different Patrick.
-Lois!

Okay, okay. Oh, my God!

-Peter's out there with him!
-Wait!

You gonna eat that dead fat guy?

How are we gonna find them?

Don't worry, Lois.
I'm good at finding people.

I was the one who found Bush
after Hurricane Katrina.

-Mr. President, are you up there?
-Go away!

Sir, there's a disaster in New Orleans.

I'm reading <i>Superfudge.</i>

You got to come down and deal with this.

Don't make me do stuff.

Patrick? Patrick!

Oh, crap! Guess we lost him.

Well, nothing left to do
but finish this sentence uninterrupt...

(SHOUTING)

Patrick, let him go!

Don't come any closer!

Patrick, let him go or Marian gets it.

Nice try. But Marian's over there.

Don't hurt her!

Now, let him go!

Okay! Okay!

-Ah! You missed!
-No, I didn't.

That's for rolling up the damn window
when I tried to jump into the General Lee.

I'm sorry, Lois.
I never meant to hurt anybody.

I mean, I did mean to kill those fat guys,
but I never meant to hurt you.

You may be very sick, Patrick,
but I love you.

You're my brother
and you'll always be my brother.

I have to go back
to the hospital, don't I?

Yeah. I'm afraid so.

Hey, Patrick. Did you see
how that rock hit me in the face?

It was like, pow, right in the kisser!

Pow, right in the kisser!

Pow, right in the kisser!

you know. It's kind of difficult.

I know. I'm just saying,
I'm just saying, try.

Yeah, okay, I'll try.
You want me to wipe your ass, too?

Oh, wow, that's a helpful tone.

I'm just saying, you're
kind of abusing your powers a little bit,

-don't you think?
-Actually... You know what, actually...

This is all time that could
be spent getting me my beverage.

Hey, what are you guys doing?

We got to get ready for
your grandpa's 80th birthday dinner.

Peter, calm down. He's just your father.

Yeah, but I love him.

His folksy racism,
his I-don't-care-where-I-am flatulence.

And the way
it always seems like he's chewing,

even when there's no food in there.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi-ya, Dad.

Francis, it's so good to see you.

Lois, you haven't
changed a bit, you lying bitch.

Ha ha ha. Francis, why
don't you come into the dining room, huh?

The table's all set for
your birthday dinner.

Uh, Lois, actually, Dad said he would
prefer it if you did not join us,

uh, you know, you
being a Protestant and all. Um...

He said it's okay if you
sit at the kid's table.

Peter, I cooked the damn dinner.

Ah! You know, I knew
you were going to react like this,

and that's why I brought Bill Lumbergh
to explain it to you.

Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go ahead

and not complain about this.

Oh, and if you could go ahead
and sit at the kids' table,

that'd be great.

I'm just saying,
'70s boobs were different. I don't know.

You know, it wouldn't kill you
to contribute to the conversation.

Dad, tell us about World War I

and how America defeated
Kaiser Permanente.

Lois, when are you
going to get that baby baptized?

Oh, God, not this again.

Francis, why the hell
is this always an issue with you?

Because I love this family

and I don't want
my grandson to burn in hell.

I love you, Grandpa.

Your toenails
are the same color as my school bus.

He... You really think that

splashing magic water
on Stewie will keep him out of hell?

Watch that kind of talk or you'll get your
heathen head smacked.

Oh, that's very Christian.

"Believe what I say or I'll hurt you."

Now you're getting it.

Peter, we have a problem.

Hey, hang on, Lois. I'm watching a movie.

ANNOUNCER: And now back to
<i>Jaws V: Fire Island.</i>

You think we should be this far out?

Stop worrying, Mark. We'll be fine.

Hey, I'm gonna eat you all.

I'm gonna eat that hairy leg.

I'm gonna eat that one, too.

Oh, I can see right up them shorts.

I got a whole bunch
of rows of teeth to chew you with.

(SINGING <i>JAWS </i>MUSIC)

Oh, now wait a minute.

I did have a chubby kid
on a raft earlier today.

It's okay, though.
I've been swimming a lot lately.

Mm. Yummy. Mm.

Peter, your father won't let up

about Stewie getting baptized.

I am sick of him

always trying to
force his religious views on us.

All right, I'll talk
to him, Lois, but, uh,

you know, when my father wants something,

it's like sex with Kobe Bryant.

You can kick and scream all you want,

but it's... it's gonna happen.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

-(HAMMERING)
-Dad, what are you doing?

There's no cross in here.

Every kitchen needs a crucifix.

Listen, Dad, I... I gotta
talk to you. Um...

Lois was wondering if maybe you could, uh,

I don't know, ease up on the whole, uh,

you know, Jesus-ay Christ-ay,
if you catch my drift.

You're a lapsed Catholic, Peter.

Your wife's a Protestant whore

and your baby isn't even baptized.

All right, all right, look, Dad...

I... I don't want you
to hate me, all right?

So I'll make a deal with you.

If we get Stewie baptized,

you and all other old people

have to acknowledge and be aware

that there's crap in the
corners of your mouth.

I'll think about it. Now let's go.

Old people are gross, no matter how cute

they try to make them look on
<i>Desperate Housewives.</i>

Go ahead. Switch over
to ABC for five seconds.

I'll wait. I'll wait five seconds.

(WAITING)

Oh, my God, did you see?

Did you see how old and ugly they are?

Oh, my God, that redhead looks like

somebody pulled Silly Putty
over their knee.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin,
but I can't baptize little Stewie today.

It turns out our
last shipment of holy water is tainted.

Tainted? Holy water? How did that happen?

(HOLY MUSIC)

(TOILET FLUSHING)

We'll call you when we
get a new shipment in.

There's no such thing as
tainted holy water.

Come on. We'll do it ourselves.

Stewie Griffin, I baptize you

in the name of the Father, the Son

-and the Holy Ghost.
-And Space Ghost.

What are you doing? Oh, my God!

This is almost as
bad as my bath with Kathy Bates.

(WATER BUBBLING)

Yeah, I think I'm gonna get out.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

(MOANING)

Stewie, you don't look so good.

-(MOANING)
-Oh, baby, you're burning' up!

Oh, my God! Stewie, Stewie, speak to me!

Don't... Don't take me to a black doctor.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I've examined your son

and he is suffering from
a temporary toxic anemia

which has substantially
weakened his immune system.

Is he gonna die?

No, but he's highly
vulnerable to infection

and must be quarantined
in a germ-free plastic environment.

My God, you mean
like John Travolta in that movie?

Oh, no, you're gonna take his face off,
like in <i>Face/Off?</i>

Well, it looks like
the operation was a success.

Do you know what the best part of this is?

Try licking yourself.

You bastard!

Peter, he meant,
<i>The Boy in the</i><i>Plastic Bubble.</i>

How could this have happened?

It's obvious to me that Stewie's been
exposed to tainted holy water.

Peter, you had Stewie
baptized behind my back?

Come on, honey. This is no worse

than when I rented out your uterus

to those inner city immigrants.

(LATIN DANCE MUSIC)

(GUNSHOTS)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Peter, you're a complete slave to
your father's religion.

What about your religious beliefs, huh?

You have a choice, you know.

-I do?
-Of course.

You're a grown man.
You can pick any religion you want.

Really? Hah!

You know, Lois, maybe you're right.

Maybe I should pick my own religion.

The question is, which one?

I'll tell you what you can pick.
A tune out on that piano.

(SINGING) Fatty's in a little jam,
dead girl, dead girl

Fatty's in a lit...

Oh, now how the
whiz-bang does the rest of it go?

Quick! Make something up!

(JAUNTY TUNE)

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Peter, what are all these women
doing' in our living room?

Lois, I took your advice and
picked a new religion.

I'm gonna be a Mormon.

A Mormon? Are you sure?

Come on.
Nailing a different wife every night?

That's a no-brainer.

Oh, Lois, this is Kimmy,
the checkout girl from the Korean market.

Uh, Nancy, our postal carrier.

And you know Tiffany, the filthy woman

who stands downtown and
screams at traffic.

I ate a tube of Crest for dinner!

Isn't she funny?

She's definitely the Kramer of
my Mormon wives.

Nancy, get me a beer.

Uh, Mormons aren't
allowed to drink alcohol.

(METAL SCRAPING)

Peter, did you just
throw those women away?

No. Maybe.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

NEWS REPORTER: Also in the news,
some trouble at St. Phillips Church.

That's right, Diane.
A shipment of tainted holy water

could put some local babies in jeopardy.

Sounds dangerous, Tom.

Be careful next time you're at confession
telling the priest

about cheating on your wife with that
Filipino drag queen.

Well, at least you're in no danger, Diane,

since you only visit church to leave
your self-delivered,

unwashed, half-dead newborns on the
back step.

Coming up, how to turn
your unwanted change into folding money.

You know, it's kind of sad seeing
Stewie in that plastic bubble.

I think he looks like a bunny.

Oh, that's it, Chris, keep laughing.

When I get out of here,
you're going to get it.

I'll lull you into a
false sense of security

like those network television announcers.

Hey, finish the job, idiot!

For God's sakes, there's no ventilation!

It smells like Brian Dennehy in here!

I see London, I see France,

Hey, Gay-beau, I'm up here. Up here.

Hi, my name's Peter.

I'm a Jehovah's Witness,

Okay, go ahead.

Wow. Um...

Boy, you're the, uh, first person
who didn't, uh, slam the door on me.

Uh, okay, um, well,

uh, Jesus, uh, was
a miracle worker, of sorts.

Um, he would travel from place to place,

Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment.

It's a portal, an opening through which

all light, goodness, rejuvenation,
joy and ecstasy

may enter the human form.

-A vagina?
-Get out.

Relax, Stewie. The doctor gave me this

so you can get some exercise.

than Dad was that time he took steroids.

What is it, Mr. C?

Fonz, I... I wanted to pleasure Marion
for our anniversary,

but, as you know, I have
erectile dysfunction.

Oh, there we go.

Thank you, Arthur.

Eh!

Brian, will you carry me upstairs?

I want to look at my toys.

No. I'm watching television.

Come on, I'm sick.

All right. Come here.

Oh, Todd,

I feel like we'll never have
a baby of our own!

We will, Kelly.

You just have to visualize it.

Come on, close your eyes.

Picture a happy, healthy baby boy at play.

Now put him in a magic bubble

and release him to the universe.

(STEWIE SCREAMING)

Uh, honey, now I want you to
visualize Lindsay Lohan,

only, naked and
doing a backwards crab-walk.

-What?
-Just do this for me!

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Ah, Peter! Where have you been, lad?

Well, Dad,
I was trying to find my own religion,

but it didn't work out.

I haven't been this disappointed

since I lost my virginity.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Ah! Uh-oh.

You want to get some breakfast
or something?

You want to find religion,

all you got to do is look in your heart.

Who's always been there for you,

offering' wisdom and truth?

You've known him all along, Son.

Now worship him!

Oh, my God! Dad's right!

There is only one person

and it's time for him
to be properly worshiped.

I, Peter Griffin, hereby establish

the First United Church of the Fonz.

Fonzie, if this be your will,
give me a sign.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, I'm Lindsay Lohan.

This is how a crab walks.

It sure is! Fonzie be praised!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, Dad.

Two days ago, this was an old barn.

And now, thanks to you,
it's an old barn with a sign on it.

All things are possible

through the Lord God,
Arthur Fonzarelli, son.

So, you're really going through with this?

Absolutely. You know this place only cost
me 100 bucks?

That's a better deal than that
Aaron Neville megaphone I bought.

Okay, I wanna thank you guys

for making me Activity Director
for the day.

Okay, first of all, can every...

What the hell?

What the hell's wrong with this thing?

Uh, okay, uh,

we're about to start the...

<i>...sack race</i>

Peter, it's not a good idea

to be putting these flyers all over town.

People are gonna think you're crazy.

Hey, how'd you like to
lose a bunch of teeth?

I'm sorry, Lois,

that was way more than
what was called for,

but that's what happens
when you challenge someone's faith.

Oh, Peter, I know this is
important to you,

but I don't wanna see you humiliated.

I don't think anyone's

gonna wanna worship the Fonz.

Is this the Church of the Fonz?

Yes, it is.

I read your flier.

Finally, a religion that
makes sense to me.

Hey, everyone. I found him. Over here.

you're dead, Brian!

Damn it, I haven't been this dizzy
since I did those helium whippets

at that birthday party.

Okay, okay, ready? Here goes.

(IN HIGH VOICE) I'm a female.
I have a high voice.

I have reproductive organs inside of me.

And I buy groceries.

Peter, your religion is an abomination.

I never thought you could ever embarrass
me more in a church

than you did at your
cousin Mary's wedding.

And if anyone knows of any reason

why these two should not be married,

let him speak now.

Really?

Nobody's gonna speak up?

I'm the one who's gonna have to say it?

(SIGH) All right.

Genital warts.

But, Dad, you're the one who said

I should look into my heart

to find my religion.

Yes. Real religion.

What I saw today wasn't religion.

It was just a bunch of sheep,
singing songs

and listening to ridiculous tall tales.

Actually, that is religion.

Shut your trap, Brian.

STEWIE: Hah! You tell him.

Why? I agree with you.
All Peter's done

is found another way to exploit
people's ignorance,

and that's just wrong.

You think I'm wro...

(STAMMERING)

See, Brian,
that's a word the Fonz can't say,

because all is right
when you welcome Fonzie into your life.

Fonzie be with you.

I ought to take off my belt

and slap the crap out of him.

Look, Francis.
I don't like you and you don't like me.

But I suggest we set aside our differences

and work together.

I have an idea of how to snap
Peter out of this.

Work together? You and me?

Sure, sometimes opposites
work well together.

In fact, Peter taught me that.

Reverend Peter, I gotta talk to you.

Last night I had sex with a teenage blond

Well, that's quite a story, Quagmire,

So there's really no reason for
you to tell me.

Are you kidding? I'm telling' everybody!

it's bound to have imitators.

Well, people like that are always

to tell them what to do.

And here I was, thinking
I was making a difference.

I thought I was actually connecting
with people.

Could there be anyone stupider than me?

Madonna?

Oh, yeah. She's pretty stupid.

That... That's something we can all
agree on, right, right?

Absolutely, yeah. Francis?

Oh, major idiot. Major idiot.

Yeah, yeah. Well, gosh!

I guess we do have some common ground here
after all, huh?

Yeah. And La Isla Bonita,
not a real place.

I... I looked it up. Couldn't find it.

Bought a globe. Couldn't find it.

Oh, yeah? That makes her a liar, too.

Oh, everybody. A Canseco? Ew!

Rodman? My God!

I think he lost all his money, didn't he?

Rodman lost?
You sure you're not thinking of MC Hammer?

No, no, I think... Well, him, too.

I read somewhere, I think it was in like,

like <i>Stuff, </i>or is it...

No, no, no. You know what,
it was on <i>Real Sports</i>

<i>with Bryant Gumbel.</i>

And they said that he's in the
poorhouse now, yeah.

You think she'd do him now?

(STAMMERING) I...
What, would Madonna do Rodman now?

Oh, yeah, no, 'cause it's not
about the money.

It's about pissing off Daddy.

That's right. She's got a lot of problems.

-Lot of problems.
-Yeah, we are smarter.

W-W-We are smarter than... than Madonna.

Oh, no question.

Well, I should probably get out of
these robes.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, look at you. You're all better.

That's right, Brian. And you are toast.

I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back

and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai

are gonna take you down, man.

Listen, uh, sorry
I had to rain on your parade, Peter.

It's all right, Brian.

I guess the Church of the Fonz
was just a bad idea.

Not really, Peter.

You were preaching' honesty,
friendship, courage.

And if you manage to inspire even
one person to embrace those values

then you are a success.

Thanks, Lois.
But I doubt there's any chance of that.

Hey, how'd you sleep, Peter?

Uh, Brian, last night
I had this crazy dream.

I was eating a sheep
and now my pillow's gone.

Oh, wait. Here it is.

What the hell was I eating?

(BLEATING)

Oh, sorry.

(DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING)

See you, Lois.

Oh, and like I tell you every day,

if I come back in
the middle of the afternoon

and you're having
sex with somebody, I'll kill you both.

Huh, "Thanks to effective treatments,

Magic Johnson down to one AID."

Oh, God, did I hit that deaf kid again?

They ought to put a bell on that guy

The nurse says
Brian won't be out of surgery

for another three hours.

Oh, I hope he's gonna be okay.

Me, too.

I know we're not here
to place blame or beat ourselves up,

but I can't help feeling like
this is somehow Meg's fault.

Oh, I just can't
stand the thought of losing Brian.

Oh, if he dies, I'm gonna have to start

hanging out with The Rock again.

All right, class, today as a special
treat, I'm going to show you this

fascinating episode of <i>NOVA</i>
that I taped at home for you.

You coming back to bed, Rob?

Uh, hang on, honey. Hang on.

My jaw keeps locking up.

Oh, well, that's not <i>NOVA </i>at all, is it?

That's a sex tape I made with my wife.

Of course, nobody here is interested
in seeing that sort of thing.

Are they? Probably not. No. Okay.

Oh, you kind of looked like
you were nodding? Nope?

Okay. Okay, we should get back to work.

Uh, all right, next up,
does everyone have a lab partner?

-I don't.
-Me, neither.

She can be my partner.

Sarah, that's very irresponsible.

Meg is awful.

-You want to be my lab partner?
-Really?

Sure, you seem nice.

Hey, do you want to join
my after school club?

Sure.

Now, open your books to page...

You know what? Look, I'm sorry.

Can I just go ahead
and show this video of me doing my wife?

Here we are, Brian, safe and sound.

BRIAN: Peter, I don't need
to be in a wheelchair.

Now, now, no arguments, Brian.

I already went through the trouble
of borrowing this ramp from Joe.

I'll see you, honey. I'll be back in a...

(SCREAMS)

Joe, are you all right?

Don't help me up.
I need to retain my independence.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

-You need anything from the market?
-PowerBar!

What's wrong, Brian?

You've just been sitting on the couch

ever since you got back from the hospital.

You need to get out of the house.

BRIAN: I don't know, Lois.
I'm a little depressed.

The accident got me thinking
about how uncertain life is

and how suddenly it can be taken away.

Oh, you're gonna feel
back to normal in no time.

Here, have some food.

BRIAN: (MUFFLED) I'm not hungry.

Here comes the gravy.

(BRIAN COUGHING)

You messy beast.

Well, hello there, Meg.

Um, Neil, I really can't be seen
talking to you anymore.

I have friends now,
and some of them, very popular.

I know. I heard Sarah is your lab partner.

All those years
of you rejecting me finally made sense.

What do you mean?

Oh, my God!

(SIGHS)

Meg! There you are.

Hey, everybody, this is our
newest member, Meg.

-Hi, Meg.
-What's up?

Hi, you gays... guys... girls.

Ugh, look, listen, Sarah,
I can't be in your club.

I'm not a lesbian.

You can't be serious.
We had a whole party planned for you.

Really? A party? For me?

-But I guess if you're not a lesbian...
-Wait, wait.

You didn't let me finish.
I'm not a lesbian.

I'm a super, huge mega-lesbian.

Oh, good. You'll fit in
with the other mega-lesbians.

Hey, do you have any other friends

you want to invite to your party?

Uh, no.
Most of my friends... are out of town.

Oh, this is gonna be great!

We'll stay up late, trade stories.

Hey, how's it going? Good.

Oh, those are huge.

Those are huge boobs.

And you know what's nice?

That... That you don't
have that blue vein up there

that some of the bigger ones get.

What? I said you don't have that.

Hey, buddy, you're not looking so good.

Who cares how I look? Nothing matters.

We... We could all die tomorrow,
every one of us.

Well, isn't that
a damn good reason to live it up today?

Come on, it can't possibly be that simple.

Excuse me. I've got a thing to do.

All right, ladies and gentlemen,

we have a very special guest tonight.

Please welcome
the Member of the Board, Frank Sinatra Jr.

(SINGING) Love is lovelier

The second time around

Just as wonderful

With both feet on the ground

Who can say

What brought us
to this miracle we've found

There are those who'd bet

Love comes but once and yet

I'm oh so glad we met

The second time around

(CROWD CHEERING)

All this singing is contagious.

I'll sing, too.

(SINGING)<i> Adam West</i>

I'll come out when they're all gone.

Wow, Brian, you actually got to sing
with Frank Sinatra Jr.?

Oh, it was amazing.

I... I got to tell you,
he said some things

that were exactly what I needed to hear,

and I... I was just inspired
to get up on that stage.

Got to live life for today, you know?

Uh, Brian, don't you think it's a little
too early to be hitting the booze?

Hey, what's the point of waiting?

You got to live life
while you can and live it hard.

Oh, the Chris Farley method, that's good.

Frank invited me back this evening.

I tell you, I feel
more exhilarated than Peter did

when he swam with the bulls.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

Oh, yeah, that's fair.
No, that's totally a fair score.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

You know, Brian, when you wear that suit,

it looks like you're taking a white poop.

But it's stuck.

Look, Lois asked me to babysit you,

so just stay here and be quiet.

I'll be back after my first set.

What the hell am I supposed
to do to kill time?

Oh, maybe I'll play 52 Pickup.

Ugh, this game's better
if there's someone else here.

'Cause then they can say,
"Oh, I'm not gonna pick up those cards."

And then... then I say,
"You have to, it's 52 Pickup."

And they say,
"Well, what if I just leave them there?"

And I say, "Those are my father's cards.

You can't just leave them there.

He's gonna be mad."

Where am I?

charging them to get out?

That was sensational.

We're gonna be the biggest thing
since Edison harnessed electricity.

Look at Edison over there
with his damn electricity.

Hey, Edison, how about sharing
some of those light bulbs, huh?

Hey, figure it out for yourself, man.

We're freezing our asses off over here.

Hey, man, how do you think
I feel, you know?

You... You get to look at my great house.

I get to look at that dark thing, huh?

What... what is that, a candle over there?
Oh, that's pretty sweet.

Yeah, it's a candl...
We... We're freezing over here.

No one in my family's
taken a bath in a month. We stink.

It stinks over here, you jerk.

I can't hear you over my central heating.

Hey, why don't you go to hell, Edison.

Hey, bite me, man.

Hey, you guys seen <i>The Office?</i>

Oh, no, I guess you haven't,
'cause you don't have a TV.

Hey, how about I come
over there and kick your ass?

Oooh, yeah, come on over.

What is this, Lois?

It's jambalaya. It's a new recipe.

Peter.

-(WHINING)
-Eat your food, mister.

All right, if you don't want it,
put it in your napkin.

-Peter,

put it in your napkin! Put it in your...

-(WHINING)
-I'm not gonna...

-(WHINING)
-Pet... (SIGHS)

You know, some people
would be very happy to have this food.

Like John Goodman's family.

Please, Daddy.

I told you, when I'm finished,
you can have what's left.

There won't be any left.

There's never any left.

(GASPING)

Happy Thanksgiving.

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

Mom, why is the cable guy here?

It's me, you guys,
and I have something to tell you all.

Mom. Dad. I am a lesbian.

-That is awesome.
-Peter.

Meg, you are not a lesbian.

You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

All my new lesbian friends accept me,
and that's all that matters.

Meg, you're my daughter.

I would accept you if you were gay

or blind or retarded, but you're not.

You guys don't care
about me and my struggle!

I hate you!

Oh, Meg, I think you're
just trying to fit in

by pretending to be something you're not.

Like the time Peter pretended to be racist
to get out of jury duty.

Awful lot of honkies in here.

Brian, there you are.

Do you have any idea what time it is?

Stewie was supposed
to be in bed two hours ago.

Oh, yeah, he, uh... He's, um, he's...

He was right here,
right next to me like, four hours ago.

What? Brian, you were
supposed to watch him!

(GASPING) Oh, my little sweetie!

Hey, Brian, remember me?

I'm the guy you left
standing at the counter

at McDonald's with a bag full of burgers.

You know, it's funny,
I tried to walk home and, um,

a lot of hungry deer walking around
at this hour of the night and, um,

oh, here's where the story gets fun.

Uh, you may have noticed
I'm missing an ear.

Managed to, uh, pull it
out of the deer's mouth

and put it in some ice
I got at a 7-Eleven.

So, when you're ready to apologize,
just talk into this cup.

Ugh, Brian, this is inexcusable.

Yeah, what if something
had happened to Stewie?

My ear's in a cup,
I guess that doesn't count.

Hey, hey,
I'm not the kid's babysitter, all right?

I have my own life to live.

You know, this is all because you've been
hanging out with that Frank Sinatra Jr.

I am gonna call his mother Mia Farrow

and give her a piece of my mind.

And you are gonna stop
singing at that crazy club.

Operator, Mia Farrow, please.

You stay out of my life!

(GROWLING)

(SCREAMING)

What the hell is happening to you?

Yeah, uh, don't worry, I don't need to go
to the hospital or anything.

I'll just use this Mr. Potato Head piece.

He bit me, Lois. The bastard bit me.

Oh, honey, I'm sure he didn't mean it.

Brian's going through
some heavy stuff right now.

He almost died.

Listen, Peter, I...

I just want to apologi...
(GRUNTS)

You know what? Forget it.

(STAMMERING)
I don't need this. I'm out of here.

(SIGHS) Look what you did, Peter.

I can't help it.
I haven't been this scared

since I was mugged by Gene Shalit.

Don't <i>Panic Room.</i>

I'm not going to William Hurt you.

I only want your <i>Tango & Cash.</i>

So just <i>Pay It Forward</i>

and we'll all be <i>Happy Gilmore.</i>

What?

So, how's my suddenly
lesbian daughter doing?

Great. We're checking out naked girls.

I am so into girls.

Oh, come on, Meg,
you can stop the charade.

My God, you're as transparent
as your father was

when he pretended to be
a Hasidic Jew to get off work.

Good morning, Hebrews and shebrews.

What a glorious Jewish day.

Hey, how about all those coupons
in the Sunday paper, huh?

Some good deals there.

Hey, you know,
I went into a store last week

and they wanted $800 for a TV,

but I used them down to $500.

(SCREAMING)

It's not a charade, Mom. I am a lesbian.

What do I have to do to prove this to you?

Well, maybe if I'd seen you
kiss your girlfriend.

Fine.

What was that?

What is she, your grandmother?

(SCOFFS) That's no kiss. Watch this.

(MOANING)

(MOANING)

Look, I can't tell you
how to lead your life.

If you don't want to face the truth,

there's nothing I can do about it.

Chris, I'm all out of digital audio tape.

Oh, he's gone.

Oh, hey, can I get you guys
to sign these release forms?

Oh, where the hell is Brian?

I don't know, but I better go find him.

We can't sit here watching
infomercials all night.

Hello. How come I rich and you not?

How come you not sell
real estate like I do?

How come I sleep with
your wife while you at work,

and then I pee in your toilet
and don't flush?

And sometimes I open the back part

and I pee in there,
so that when you flush pee come out.

You know why? Because I'm smart.

I'm smart, you stupid. Call now.

STEWIE: Brian!

Brian!

Brian!

Bria...

Ugh, who am I kidding?

All those buttons,
I'll look like Steve Harvey.

Brian!

Yeah, I'll ask the cashier
if I can put this up in the window.

I definitely need a breath freshener.

Ooh, but that's going to give me 11 items.

-That's fine.
-No, no, no.

Rules is rules.

Let's see what I'm gonna put back.

Okay, I need the Reynolds Wrap
and the bathroom tissue.

I could do without the Triscuits,
but they sure are good.

(SIGHS)

7-Up's the whole reason
I came down here in the first place.

You know what?

I'm not gonna need the V8,

'cause I can just get some tomato juice

at the mini-mart down the street.

It's a little more expensive,
but that's okay.

I like to help out a small business.

I hope it's okay if I pay you in pennies.

(COINS JINGLING)

Oh, God, a gutter? How cliche.

I don't know what went wrong.

I was just trying to
live for the moment, you know?

Because life can end so abruptly

and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

Is that why you've been on
this path to self-destruction?

You know, Brian, as smart as you are,

you've got to accept the fact that

there are some things in life
that you just can't control.

You mean the way... the way you can't
control that messed up way

that you laugh when... when you think

somethings really, really funny?

FAITH: <i>Well, Hope,</i><i>I don't understand why</i>

HOPE: <i>No wonder that priest</i>

(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

Yes, and I accept that.

Your problem is, you think that

just because you're not in control,

nothing matters.
That... That you don't matter.

But you know what?

You matter to someone.

(HOARSE VOICE) You matter big time.

Hey, Meg. What are you doing here?

Listen, Sarah,
I got to get something off my chest.

Yes!

I need to open up.

Sweet.

So get ready 'cause here it is.

My mom was right.

What do you mean?

I'm not gay.

What?

So, all those rounds of golf we played,
those were all lies?

I'm so sorry.

For the first time in my life,
I felt like I belonged,

and I wanted it to be true.

So I pretended to be something I'm not.

You're going to choose to be heterosexual?

I thought being gay wasn't a choice.

Well, not for guys.

It was wrong of me to mislead you.

I should go.

That was awful. That was just awful.

What do you think, Mark?

I don't know, man.
We didn't get the shots we need.

Man, what do you think, Mike?

I mean, if you saw action
going on in front of you,

would you know instinctively
to center it in front of you?

I don't know. Could someone take

my soda out of the icebox please,

so it doesn't freeze?

Hey, Brian, care to place a wager?

Tomorrow night on Fox's <i>Celebrity Boxing,</i>

Carol Channing.

You've got Carol Channing, the actress,

Hell, give me 50 bucks on Tyson.

Well, you're in good company.

Hi, guys. We're back from the mall.

I got new shoes.

The old ones are in the box. (LAUGHS)

They smell, and are old.

Hey, Peter, your 25th high school reunion
is next Sunday.

Throw that away. I don't want to go.

Besides, Sunday's my internet porn night.

Oh, yeah!

You're my Chinese Lois.

Hey, it's me. Knock, knock.

So, you got my money?

Huh? Oh, yeah. I'll pay you soon.

Yeah, well, here's a suggestion.

Have the money by tomorrow,

and there won't be any problems.

-Huh?
-Yeah, 24 hours.

Why? What happens in 24 hours?

Heh. I don't know. (SCOFFS)
Not psychic, man.

I'm just saying
it would probably be better for everybody

-if you had the money tomorrow.
-Yeah, all right.

-I'll see what I can do.
-Sweet. Sweet. Great.

-How's everything else going?
-Good.

All right, all right, see you later.

Don't forget. (CLICKS TONGUE)

Hey, Peter, I was going through
your garbage,

and I noticed your high school reunion
is coming up.

Why were you going through my garbage?

Well, when I stopped over earlier,

I noticed Lois clipping her toenails,

and I thought, "Oh, man, I got to get
in on that."

Huh.

Yeah, I don't think I'm going
to my reunion.

Everybody's all got their nice cars,

and their big, important jobs,

and their fancy hats,

and their fresh strawberries

so big you can eat them like a hand fruit.

Peter, everyone lies at those things.

Just tell them you're a big shot.

Wait a second, Joe, that's a great idea.

Boy, imagine what it would be like
to be a big shot.

-Oh, you know what?

Just give me till next Friday.
I'll have it for you.

Oh, that's funny.

Hey, Mike, long time no see.

Wow. What...

-What's all this?
-Oh, this? I just came from work.

I'm a secret agent astronaut millionaire.

Cool. Where'd you get the cowboy hat?

Space.

Oh, by the way, this is my friend, Tom.

(GASP) You're Tom Brady,
from the New England Patriots!

Oh, man, I got to tell you,
you kick ass, man.

In fact,
I was just saying that the other day

to all the guys down at the brewery.

Brewery? I thought
you were a cowboy astronaut millionaire.

He's a fake!

Look, this cowboy hat comes right off.

(LAUGHING)

Coming here was a huge mistake, Lois.

Peter, I know you're humiliated,

but getting drunk is not the answer.

Uh-oh.
Either my esophagus just got shorter,

or I'm about to throw up.

(OUTRAGED GRUMBLING)

(PETER VOMITING)

Peter, that was amazing.

I've never seen a guy your size
who could move like that.

How would you like to play
for the New England Patriots?

PETER: Oh. I'd love to.

Say, listen, Tom,

could you get me a towel?

-I threw up on the floor.
-Sure.

PETER: And,
could you also get another towel?

I also threw up
on this gentleman's bare lap.

MAN: Could you wet the towel?

PETER: Wet the towel Tom!

For our top story tonight,

we go live to terrific haircut Bob Costas

-Thanks, Tom.

I'm fond of your hair, as well.

I'm standing here with Tom Brady,

and his newest teammate, Peter Griffin.

Hey, Ma! Check it out!

I'm married to a pro athlete!

Ha! What do you think of that?

(LAUGHS)

We're really excited to have Peter.

I think he's gonna make
a great addition to a great team.

I want to thank God.
I want to thank the Lord God.

'Cause it's not really up to me.
It's up to him.

And, I want to thank the devil, too.

You know, 'cause that's...

that's why God's there.

He's minding the fence,

making sure that guy never comes back.

Uh...

You know, if it weren't for the devil,

God would probably go insane.

Blow his brains out from boredom,
you know?

Everybody likes to feel useful.

Make-a-the world go round.

Oh, God. (SOBBING)

Boy, Lois,
I can't believe this is happening to me.

I'm somebody now, you know?

I don't have to lie to people
about my life any more.

Oh, I am so happy for you, Peter.

What the hell happened to you?

I, fell down the stairs.

Oh, you should be more careful.

Yeah, that is happening for real.

you is the worst football team in Europe,

Shut up, Ricky! Just shut up right now!

Unless the next words
out of your mouth are directions

how to get back to the fish skeleton,

I'm gonna punch you right in the stomach!

Joan, it's great to have you here.

No one's cleaned
my belly button in a long time.

Lois is afraid to go near there

and my fingers are too thick.

What is this?

A carton of Parliaments?
I haven't smoked in 10 years.

Hey, keep digging.

Oh, ColecoVision.

Yeah! This could be a fun afternoon.

JOAN: Mr. Griffin,
this is unbelievably humiliating.

Hey, hey, Lois wants me to go to the store
and the car's low on gas.

Oh, crap!

This is truly a sight to behold.
An awesome spectacle.

ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Malcolm</i><i>in the Middle.</i>

And I told you boys
to pick up your clothes!

And who left the wet towel on the bed?

I swear to God, sometimes I feel like
just going on strike!

What would you all do if I went on strike?
Huh? What would you do?

I'm talking to you!
You know what? That's what I'm gonna do!

I'm gonna go on strike!
And you can all try living without me!

You didn't think about that, huh?

That's what I'm gonna do!
I'm gonna do that! I'm gonna do tha...

Kids, we're free.

We're finally free.

LOIS: Ouch. Damn, that hurts.

What happened?

I was breast-feeding Stewie,
and he bit me again.

I think he might have
even broken the skin.

I see. Um...

Maybe I should,
uh, you know, uh, look at it.

I, uh... I, uh...

I have seen a lot of medical shows.

You see, the areola is very tender here.

And I think one of his new teeth may have

bitten down right on a duct.

I'm sorry. What?

I don't know what to do, Brian.

Breast-feeding's just so painful

since Stewie's teeth are coming in.

Now I know how Alec Baldwin feels
when he feeds his brothers.

There you go. There you go.

Eat up, Stephen. You're the weakest.

Well, maybe it's time to wean Stewie.

Huh. I suppose it would
make my life easier.

You know what? I'll give it a try.

-Thanks, Brian.
-No problem.

(STUTTERING)
Uh... Any other problems you have, too,

like, for example, around your underpants

that you want me to take a look at,

-I could take a look at that, too.
-Huh?

Please pull down your underpants.

All right, boys.
It's my maid's last night,

so we got to make the most of it.
Now, I filled

this watermelon with chocolate pudding
and M-80 firecrackers.

Hey, Meg. Will you hold this for Daddy?

Okay. Why?

Uh, it's a present.

It's a thanks-for-being-such-a-sweetie
watermelon.

So you'll hang onto that?

Yeah, sure.

(YELLS FEARFULLY)

This is weird. Am I supposed to eat this?

(scream)

I hate you! I hate you!

Oh, maid!

Oh, my God!

Everybody, this is Joan.

-Hi.
-Hello.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(SPEAKS ELF LANGUAGE)

(SPEAKS ELF LANGUAGE)

Uh, uh, hey, there.

Uh, I mean, it's nice
to pleasure your acquaintance.

Uh, I mean, would you like
to go out to dinner tomorrow night?

I'd love to.

God, he works fast.

Hey, Quagmire,
is that a banana in your pocket

or a (BLEEPS) in your pocket?

Do you want to say 9:00?

Sure. See you then.

Oh, my God! I'm in love.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(SIGHS)

Time for dinner, sweetie.

Very well, then. Take off your shirt.

No, honey. No, no.
Tonight we're gonna have formula instead.

Ah! Ugh! That's more disgusting

than when Peter
went through that Daisy Dukes phase.

So who's up for some hoops
at the park, huh?

Oh, there you are.
Come here, you basketball.

(BOTH SCREAM)

It's like a walrus flossing.

I, I know it's different
than you're used to,

but you'll see it's just as good.

Yes. That's what we were promised

about Jim Belushi
some 25 laugh-free years ago.

Wow, it's so lovely here, Glenn.

Well, this is our
three-week anniversary, Joan.

I wanted this date to be special.

You know, this place is unique
because if you're lucky,

some nights around sunset,

the screaming black dolphins come out.

Oh, wow! Really?
I've heard they're just beautiful.

DOLPHIN (IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACCENT):
What's going on, man?

DOLPHIN 2:
Who's... Oh, what's going on yourself?

(dolphins laugh)

I almost drowned yesterday.

Oh, man! It's wet out here.

Oh, look at them.

They're magical, aren't they?

Listen, Joan...

I have something very
important to ask you.

-DOLPHIN: Hey, James.
-DOLPHIN 2: Mm-hmm.

DOLPHIN: I'm gonna see
how long I can hold my breath.

DOLPHIN 2:
I see you breathing out your hole.

What is it, Glenn?

Joan, I've decided
I want to spend my life with you.

-Will you marry me?
-(GASPS)

Oh! Of course I will.

Nothing would make
me happier than to be Mrs. Quagmire.

DOLPHIN: Hey, man.
I see you got some seaweed on your tail.

DOLPHIN 2: Where? What? Oh!

DOLPHIN: You know I'm
just playing with you.

DOLPHIN 2: Man, you are...

Oh, I thought
you was talking about the other seaweed.

DOLPHIN: You know I got jokes!

(DOLPHINS LAUGH)

DOLPHIN 2: I'm gonna slap you with my fin.

Man, I never would have thought

Quagmire'd get married.

No, no. I know Quagmire.

And I'm telling you,
this has got to be some kind of prank.

You know, like that prank
I pulled on Ashton Kutcher.

Ashton, come here.

Ha ha ha.

You've just been tomahawked.

That's my show. <i>Tomahawked.</i>

So, how's the weaning going?

Oh, it's horrible.

Giving up breast milk
is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

I'll bet the founding fathers

had an easier time
writing the Bill of Rights.

All right, we're done.

You think the language
in the Second Amendment is clear enough?

You know, about the right to bear arms?

Of course it's clear.

Every American has the right

to hang a pair of bear arms on their wall.

How could that possibly be misconstrued?

All right. Fantastic then.

Wait. You know what?
Before we send this to the printer,

let's take that abortion thing out.

Boy, I never thought

we'd be going to Quagmire's
for an engagement party.

I'm telling you guys, he's putting us on.

He's the same old Quagmire.

Hey there, neighbors.
Are you lost? Aha ha.

I'm just joshing.

Of course we're expecting you.
Come on in, friends.

Uh-uh, if you all will just

take your shoes off there.

Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing.

(THINKS) <i>Uh-oh, foot odor.</i>

I have to go.

I have, uh, terrible foot odor.

Glenn, your place looks wonderful.

I feel like
I can touch things in here now.

We brought you guys a bottle of wine.

BOTH: Ooooh, Montrachet!

I like our friends.

So, Joan and I just love
<i>Without a Trace,</i> don't we, honey?

-Yeah, it's all right.
-We think it's all right.

What are you talking about? You hate CBS.

Ooh. "Hate" is a word

we don't use in this house.

Joan and I always say,

"If you don't have
anything nice to say about someone,

don't say anything at all."

We say that, right, honey?

-Sometimes.
-Sometimes we say that.

Hey, Quagmire.

Check out this month's <i>Hustler, </i>huh?

-Quagmire?
-Now, this is neat.

These people have put
an old-fashioned Colonial spinning wheel

in the center
of their living room, as furniture.

Oh, that's what I want in my house.

(POP MUSIC)

All right, Quagmire.
Time for your lap dance.

No, guys. I can't do that.

It's degrading to women.

Come on, Quagmire. It's got to be you.

I'm married, Cleveland's got foot odor,

and Joe's dead from the waist down.

Aaaaagh!

Why do you bring me here?

Oh, Brian, my breasts are so sore.

And they've gotten so engorged
from the weaning,

I've gone up two bra sizes.

What... What did you do with the old bras?

Okay. Got to time this just right.

One, two, three!

(SCREAMS)

Help! Somebody get this baby off me!

Stewie! I'm so sorry.

By the way, you
call those cheap implants boobs?

Those aren't boobs. They are lies!

I can't believe it.

Quagmire's gone
all sissy-man Alan Alda on us!

Well, what can we do about it?

The wedding's tomorrow.

There's only one thing to do.

We got to break it up.

Gosh, Peter, thanks so much
for being my best man.

Oh, it's my pleasure.

In fact, I got a wedding surprise for you.

All right, back it up, guys.

I know you have a foot fetish

so I got you
this Statue of Liberty's foot.

Oh, thanks, Peter.
But Joan's all the foot I need now.

What? But, Quagmire,
that's the real foot from the Statue of...

No, no. I'm okay.

Hey, do you have any idea

what I went through to get this?

A lot. A real lot.

You think this is just,
"Oh, here comes Peter

"with the Statue of Liberty's foot.

Oh, isn't that a gas?"

No. No. The reality, the real reality

of getting this together was staggering.

You know, this cost me $437,000.

Don't ask me how I got it.

I had to call in a whole bunch of favors

from people I've never even met.

So the very least you can do

is just rub up against... I don't know.

Well, if you want I can...

No, no. No, no, it's fine.

No. Whatever.
Whatever. Just go to your wedding, man.

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

No. No. No. No. Take...
Just get it out of here.

Peter, what's the matter?

This is a happy occasion.

No, it's not, Lois. It's horrible.

You don't know what happens to a man
when he gets married.

It's like a disease that rots you
from the inside out.

-I know, Peter, but...
-(SNAPS)

Oh, damn it. I can't believe

how much my breasts have swollen.

(GASPS)

Oh, look out. Champagne.

Peter, stop.

Oh, Lois, you're all wet.

Here, let me jiggle you dry.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

Giggity giggity God!

I've made a terrible mistake!

(SOBS)

Oh, my God! You blew it up!

You really did it!

Damn you all to hell!

Oh, God. I got to get out
of this marriage!

Cleveland, how did you get out of yours?

You slept with my wife.

It's easy, Quagmire.
Just tell her to hit the bricks.

Yeah. You've gotten
out of commitments before.

Wow, that was great.

Sure was. See you.

But you said we were gonna get married.

No. I only said that
so you could googooety my geshmoigen.

(LAUGHS LIKE WOODY WOODPECKER)

So, anyway,
what I'm trying to tell you is,

some of the guys thought
we should get a divorce.

What?

(STUTTERING) But I told them

they didn't know
what they were talking about.

Good. Good.

'Cause if you ever left me,

I'd have to cut myself.

And then I'd cut you.

I love you, Glenn.

I love you, too,

insane-woman-I'm-having-
second-thoughts-about.

-What?
-All right.

(WHIRRING, HISSING)

Yes. Sleep away, woman.

But I'm here to claim
what's rightfully mine.

Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Oh, that's the stuff. Yeah, yeah.

(SCREAM)

Dear God!
I've got to get a hold of myself.

Look at me... sucking pilfered milk
off a dirty carpet.

I'm as pathetic
as the fat man when he tries to read.

-Hey, Lois, what's this word?
-"Evel."

-And this one?
-"Kneivel."

-And this one?
-"Was."

-And this one?
-"Born."

-And this one?
-"In."

-And this one?
-"Montana."

Huh! Hey, Lois. Did you know
that Evel Kneivel

was born in Montana?

You didn't tell her?

Look, I told you
she was gonna kill herself.

What was I supposed to do?

Let her. Ha ha ah. No, that's not funny.

Wait a second.

We know she's gonna be upset
if you dump her.

But if something
happened that was out of your control...

What do you mean?

I mean we're gonna fake your death.

All right, fellas. I think we did it.

This may be the most absolutely
perfect fake death

in the history of fake deaths.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

What do you guys want?

Joan, um, you mind if we come in?

There's, um...There's been an accident.

This is, uh, not gonna be easy,

but it's something you should see.

PETER: So, anyway, here's Quagmire

walking through the park,

minding his own business.

I just happened to be there
with my video camera

when a ninja shows up!

And then a Nazi came!

And then an evil pots-and-pans robot!

-(ROBOTIC VOICE) Destroy. Destroy.
-(BEEPING)

I imagine you're probably wondering

what happened to the body.

Well, we thought of that.

PETER (ON VIDEO): Oh, no! Quagmire's dead!

Wait! We might still be able to save...

Oh, no!

(PETER SINGS <i>JURASSIC PARK </i>MUSIC)

We are so, so sorry for your loss.

Is this a joke?

I wish it were, Joan.
I wish it were a joke.

But these things happen, you know?

You go for a walk in the park one day,

and wheelchair ninjas, and Nazis,

and pots-and-pans
robots show up to kill you,

and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.

You've seen the news.

You're not fooling anyone.

All right, fellows. Plan B.

Plan B, Quagmire.

Hi, honey. I'm home.

(SCREAMING AND MOANING) Heart attack!

Glenn, sweetheart! Is he all right?

No, he's dead.

I can tell. I'm a cop.

Oh, my God! Are you sure?

You know what'll prove it?

When people die, they void their bowels.

I said, when people die,
they void their bowels.

GUYS: Oh. Oh, my God! (LAUGHING)

PETER: What a jackass.

Well, you look a lot better.

I did it, Brian!

Through sheer force of will

I kicked my addiction to breast milk.

I just had to find a way

to make breasts seem repulsive.

Yeah? How'd you do that?

I watched <i>In The Cut.</i>

Meg Ryan topless. No, thanks. No, thanks.

Stewie, Mommy has a surprise for you.

What are you doing?

Oh, Brian, I thought
I was ready to wean him.

But I just miss the bonding.

No, no! No, put me down! I beg of you!

I just kicked the stuff. Damn you!

(MOANS) You sick, twisted...

I hate you. (MOANS)

I love it. (MOANS)

I will kill you!

(MOANS)

You sure Quagmire's okay in there?

No problem! He's got
half an hour of oxygen.

We'll sneak back later and dig him up.

Sorry, I'm late.

I had a meeting over at NBC about <i>Joey.</i>

Death? What are you doing here?
Nobody's dying today.

Not according to my paperwork.

Says here your buddy Quagmire

died of a heart attack.

I got to tell you,

I always thought
it would be rectal trauma.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

Well, Mayor West is afraid of zombies.

So the city says all caskets
must be encased in concrete.

You'll thank me
when no one eats our brains.

You'll thank me.

Hold it! Stop the funeral.

Quagmire's not really dead.

(GASP FOR BREATH)

Zombie!

(SCREAMS)

Glenn, I thought I'd lost you.

Sorry, Mr. Quagmire,

but I still need
a body to take back with me. So...

No, you can't take him!

Uh, You know, um...

this is probably not cool.

Just throwing it out there.

-She was suicidal.
-She was?

-Yeah, absolutely.
-I have heard that, too.

And her last name was Quagmire.

Well, good enough for me.

I got to go. I got tickets to Celine Dion.

I'm not gonna kill her,

I'm just gonna watch her die on her own.

Anyone? Anyone?

Ah, it's good to have you back, Quagmire.

It's good to be back, Peter.

Hey, Uh, Death,

can you leave that body here
for another five minutes?

Ha ha ha ha ha.

That's Quagmire.

Well, guys,
my vasectomy is tomorrow.

You poor bastard.

After all, sex
is pointless without potency.

That's right. You
take the venom out of a cobra

and what do you got?

You got a... a belt.

It's not that big a deal.

A bunch of the guys
on the force have had vasectomies,

and their lives haven't changed at all.

Would you ever have one?

Never!

Well, yeah. But what if me and Lois

do end up wanting another baby?

It'll be too late.

You could freeze some of your sperm

at the sperm bank just in case.

I don't know, Cleveland.

It didn't work out so great

that time I froze my nuts.

(SNIFFING)

No! No! Bad squirrel.

Those are my nuts.

-My nuts!
-(WHIMPERS)

You're just a hungry
little fellow, aren't you?

But those are my nuts!

-(SNARLS)
-No. Oh, God, no!

My nuts! My nuts!

-Hey, Brian. You want to play tag?
-No.

-Freeze tag?
-No.

-TV tag?
-No.

If I can get some
guys, you want to play Red Rover?

No. Maybe. You get the guys first.

We'll talk about it.

No! Jungle gym mine!

Hey, where'd you get
the Pete Rose haircut?

(CRYING)

Anyone else want
to feel my Reebok in their grapes?

Then you'll all do as I say.

-Hi.
-Well, hello there.

(CRYING)

Yes, that's right, cry.

Cry like Sauron
when he lost his contact lens.

Nobody move!
Nobody move!

Does... D... Does anybody see it?

It might be stuck to a tree or a rock.

Anyone?

Oh, I am so grounded.

Hi, there. Peter Griffin.

I've got an appointment

to, uh, banish
a White Russian from my Kremlin.

Well, we don't have empty rooms right now,

but if you'll have a seat...

Yeah. I kind of warmed myself up

in the car if you catch my drift.

I could put you in
the storage freezer.

That'll work.

Nurse, I've got a splinter.

Just come out whenever you're done.

Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

(PETER YELLS)

PETER: Oh, God! I...

I think I feel them moving.

Hi. My partner and I
want to have a baby.

We'd like a vial of sperm

and an applicator that looks like

Jodie Foster's knuckles.

Certainly. Let me
just go to the freezer.

Mr. Griffin,
y-you were in there an awfully long time.

Are you all right?

Yup, yup. Fine, fine.

And just so you know,
everything in there

is exactly the way
it was when I went in.

There is absolutely zero chance

that I spilled all the jars

and had to refill them
with my own sperm.

Zero chance!

(THUNDER)

It's a boy!

Peter, we have to talk.

We haven't had sex
since your vasectomy.

Yeah, I just don't
feel like it, Lois,

seeing as how I'm not
a real man any more.

Honey, it was just a simple operation.

It's no reason
to give up on your sex life.

I don't know, Lois.
I'm just not feeling it any more.

Besides, it gives me
time to try new things,

like that time I tried
wearing adult diapers.

Hey, Lois. Hey, kids.

Oh, boy, that smells delicious.

You know, I'd love to
stay and eat with you,

but I got to go meet Cleveland,

Joe, and Quagmire down at...

the bar.
So just put my dinner

in the fridge and I'll heat it up later.

Love you.

You, go get me an ice cream.

You, clear the slide.

I'm going down in five minutes.

You! Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?

You're my boyfriend.

Yes, dear.
Of course I am.

Now, where's Lloyd with our Fun Dip?

Good God! Running an empire

is harder than finding diversity

in the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog.

STEWIE: Ooh! Ooh!
There he is. There he is. Right there.

BRIAN: Ah, found him.

That was a tricky one.

(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

GIRL: No kidding.
He looks weird.

What the deuce is all the commotion?

All right. Out of my way.
Move aside.

What the hell is so
bloody fascinating?

(GASP) You!

Well, well, well.

If it isn't my
half-brother Stewie!

Bertram! I haven't
seen you since our microscopic encounter.

How the deuce
did you get out of Peter's testicles?

-He donated sperm.
-Gross.

Well, I don't
mean to be a discourteous host,

but this is my playground.

I rule this territory.

My, my! What
an amusingly misguided view.

Very well, then.
You leave me no choice

but to declare war!

So be it.
I'll do to you

what <i>BC </i>does to

alone... again.

Night!

You know, Lois has gotten kind of fat

since you guys stopped having sex.

It might be
time to, you know, have some sex.

You know, at first I didn't want to do it
'cause of the vasectomy.

But now it's just...
I mean, look at her.

She's got elbow cleavage.

You know, that little wrinkle

that fat people get on their elbows

that looks like a schwa?

I mean, you wouldn't
have sex with her, would you?

-Oh, yeah, I would.
-Really?

Oh, yeah. Oh,
yeah. I would do everything to her.

I don't care what she looks like.

I would wreck that chick.

Well, you are a trooper.

Sorry. Fat wife coming through.

Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. Fat wife.

Oh, hold on a sec.

All right, bring her through.

Peter, stop it.

For God's sakes,
you're embarrassing me.

Not as embarrassed as I was

when I got that
job entertaining prison inmates.

Do it again, Griffin.

Come on. I just did it,
like, five times.

Do it!

(SOBS)

Look, honey, with all due respect,

you've gained some weight recently.

It's five pounds at the most.

It's not a big deal.

It's a slippery slope, Lois.

You start with five pounds
and then one day, boom!

You wake up
and you're on <i>The Practice</i>

-with 16 rings in your ear.
-(SCOFFS)

You're one to talk.
Look how fat you are.

Lois, men aren't fat.

Only fat women are fat.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I have to go warn
the chef that you've arrived.

He wants fat?
I'll show him fat.

The only reason
I'm eating anyway is because of him.

He won't touch me.

Do you think I'm fat?

Only if you think
I'm a serial killer.

-What?
-Nothing.

Attention, all hands.

We're going to launch
a massive air strike

against Bertram and his army.

Behold the armada.

It's quite simple, actually.

You press the smiling
duck to take off,

the cow with the bow
tie to fire weapons,

and the clown face
is just a clown face. Enjoy it.

Now, battle stations, everyone!

(ENGINE REVVING)

At my signal,
unleash hell!

What took you so long?

What took you so ugly?

Well, now what?

-You want to play 20 questions?
-Sure.

-Uh, is it a man?
-Yes.

-Is he famous?
-Yes.

-Is he under 40?
-No.

-Over 40?
-Yes.

-On television?
-Yes.

-On television now?
-No.

-In the past 20 years?
-Yes.

-Is it Richard Mulligan?
-Yes!

Up until now,

we've been fighting Bertram on his terms.

Whoa, easy.
Easy, girl. Easy, easy, easy.

But I propose an invasion.

We've got to
fight him over there by the swing set

so we don't have to
fight him here at the sandbox.

Stewie?

What's this?

A letter of surrender. We did it.

Whew! It's a good thing too, because

I really didn't have an exit strategy.

Yay, Stewie!

Oh, thank you, darling. I...

What is this? Makeup?

Why are you wearing makeup?

(GASPS) Chicken pox!

Damn you, Bertram.
I thought we called no biological warfare.

You swore on the seesaw.

Ah ha ha ha!

Stewie, there you are.

Oh, my God. Your face.

Oh, sweetie. You got the chicken pox.

Come on, we got to
get you out of here.

No. No, damn you,
I've got to finish what I've started!

No... My God, you've put on weight.

You're like one of those
Memory Foam mattresses.

Look, there's my face.

Here you go, sweetie.

A couple more oatmeal baths

and you'll be all better.

Well, no need to clean up when I'm done.

You'll probably just
slice a couple of bananas in here

and chow down, huh, porky?

So what happened
with that kid on the playground?

He won this round, Brian.

But I'm going back tomorrow.

And when I've carried out my plan,

he won't know what hit him,

like that baseball team
that Peter coached.

Well, kids, just when I thought

we'd never find an assistant coach,

I ran into this drifter hanging out

near the elementary
school playground.

He's got a clown costume
in his trunk,

so we know
he's good with kids,

and pictures of boys
in their underwear,

so he's probably had
some medical training.

Well, I'm gonna take off
while he fits you

for cups in that
windowless supply shed.

See you.

Oh, hey, Hogzilla.

You happen to

No, I haven't.

Maybe she's out
looking for a man who can satisfy her.

Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Do me a favor.

When you go to
sleep, aim your butt the other way.

Last night,
for God's sake, you farted.

I felt like somebody was sticking me

with a cigarette
lighter from the car. You're fat.

Shut up and go to sleep!

(BOTH GRUNTING) Ow! Ow!

Lois, you weigh a ton!
Get off me!

-I'm trying, I...
-Try harder!

Ow! Peter, if you just

-Ow! Ow!
-Lois, that hurts. Ow! Quit it!

(MOANING)

Peter, are we having sex?

Let's check.
Just lift up that fold right there.

Uh, yup.

Lois, last night was amazing.

It was, wasn't it?

Fat sex is the
hottest sex we've ever had.

There were so many boobs,

I didn't know whose
boobs I was grabbing,

your boobs or my boobs.

I know. It was amazing.

Much better than that
night you pretended

your penis was Danny Aiello.

Oh, that is so
interesting, Danny Aiello.

You've got the best
Spike Lee stories.

What's that?
You want to meet my wife?

Peter, stop it.

Lois, just say hello.

You're embarrassing
me in front of Danny Aiello.

Now, come here,
my fat concubine.

(MUFFLED)
Peter, I'm not even hungry.

I want you bigger.
I want you fatter.

It will please me.

With Stewart out of the picture,

this whole playground
is under my control.

I sense something.

A presence I've not felt since...

Aah!

Stewie, you're alive!

Yes, Bertram, I'm alive.

And I think you'll find
all your guards quite incapacitated.

You have an annoying habit

of turning up
where you're not welcome.

Well, when I'm done
with you, you're going to hate me more

than the other
vowels hate "Y."

If you'll turn to
Page 34 of your blue books,

you'll see

-Okay. Okay. Yeah, all right.

You know what?
I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back.

Well, well, well.
Look who decided to show up.

-So, what are we talking about here?
-Well, before you...

Oh, I'm sorry. "F," what's up?

No, no. I can talk.

Any last words?

You wouldn't kill me,
would you?

Thanks for helping me

dig this hole,
Mr. Moltisanti.

Hey, no problem, Stewie.

This can be a pain in the ass

when you got to do it
all by yourself.

You're telling me.
All right. Go ahead and drop it in.

Oh, boy. That's
gonna be beautiful

when it reaches adulthood.

Yeah. I love plants.

So what happened
with that kid

you were telling me about?

He admitted defeat and ran off.

What a mook!

Oh, Peter,
I love you so much.

PETER: Oh, Lois.
I have no idea if we're doing it

or if that's
just the back of your knee,

but either way, it feels so good.

LOIS: Ow, Peter,
you're on my arm. It hurts.

Oh! My chest hurts, too.

Oh, my God.

Peter, I think
I'm having a heart attack.

PETER: Oh, me, too,
sweetie. Me, too.

LOIS: No, no, Peter,
I'm really having a heart attack.

PETER: Oh... Oh, my God!
You're serious?

Oh, we should
get you to the hospital.

All right, hold...
hold on a sec.

All right,
almost done. Almost done. Almost...

-Peter!
-Almost done. Almost done.

Almost done.
Almost done. Okay, let's go.

Well, it was a tough job
removing all that fat

to get to your heart,
Mrs. Griffin.

But you came
through it beautifully.

Honey, I'm sorry

I tried to make you into
something you're not.

I love you no matter
what size you are.

Although, I got
to admit,

I'm gonna miss eating cereal
out of the dimples on your ass.

Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you rest up

for a few days and
you'll be just fine.

Thank you, Doctor.

I realize now that eating is not the way
to solve my problems.

You hear that, Meg?

For your information,
Mom, I don't eat to solve my problems.

I cut myself.
Is that better?

Chris, we all
love your hat.

Thanks, Mom.

Hey, Doc, what did you
do with my mom's fat?

Oh, it's right here
in this storage closet.

Uh...

It's exactly
what it looks like.

Wow, congratulations, Meg.

Yeah, it was a really

Lois, I don't want to ruin your morning,
but I flushed a diaper.

It's a mess up there.

Brian, what is this?
You're driving a cab?

Well, Lois,
I realized you were right.

I mean, it's time I went
out and got a job.

For God sakes,
I'm seven years old.

Seven? That's not bad.

You know,
Todd was 15 when he died.

The dog we had before you.

Hey, Peter, did you call me?

Yeah, I thought we'd
go to the park, Todd.

Oh, you're not taking me
to the vet, are you?

No, no, just a nice day at the park.

I'm a little worried that
you're gonna have me put down.

I know there's been some concern

about my sphincter's low shutter speed.

No, no, we're just going
to the park, Todd.

Oh, okay, well, I'll enjoy the ride, then.

Around the park
one more time, Bitterman.

Peter, I'm not your chauffeur.

Not for long
with that attitude, Bitterman.

(GROANS)

Ah! This is living, Bitterman.

This set of wheels is even better than
those talking cars on that commercial.

Hey, how you doing there?

Listen, uh, I couldn't help but notice
you across the parking lot and, uh...

Yeah, they had me painted.

I'm so embarrassed.

-Hey, how do you think I feel?

-No, no, that, too, but...
-It's not all about you, you know.

Morty, oh, my God,
what are you doing? Look at you.

Think I was like a birthday present
for the kid or something like that.

Oh, my God, look at you.
You're... you're... you're hot.

I know.
I would've taken you...

You know what I would've
done to you back there?

-Yeah?
-Why didn't you say something earlier?

I said all that stuff. God!

Let's not rule anything out.

-Hey, look, there's Lois.
-Yeah.

Hey, honk the horn.

That's how come they call them accidents.

Well, Lois, I thought you and me
could do a song for the talent show.

It could be just like
the old days when we used to play.

You remember, Lois?

Remember our band,
Handful of Peter?

Hi, there. I'm Peter,
and this is Lois.

We want to talk to you
about a friend of ours.

He's not here tonight.

Although, you know,
he's kind of here, Lois.

You know, you're right.
He kind of is.

Yeah, because he's in our hearts.

This is a song about that man
and his world

that was taken from him.

They're gone now.

How could this have happened?

BOTH: How?

Oh, I haven't thought
about that in years.

You know, it would be fun
to write some new songs.

You know what else is fun?
Watching <i>Mr. Belvedere</i>

Hello. Hey, Lois,
what's up?

Milk? Yeah, I'll pick some up
at the end of my shift.

Oh, gotta go.
First fare of the night.

I should really pick up
that milk now before I forget.

You son of a bitch!

Hey, Brian,
you see that magazine cover right there?

See who's on it?

Yeah, that's Jessica Alba.

Yeah, you want to know
a secret, buddy?

-What?
-I would do her.

-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

I just wanted you
to know a little bit about who I am.

Thanks for the milk, Carl.

What the hell? $400?

My God, this is a bigger rip-off than

Peter's <i>Sounds of the Rainforest </i>CD.

This will help us fall asleep, Lois.

MAN 2: Hey, what's that song
he does that I hate?

MAN 1: Uh, "Desert Rose."

MAN 2: Yeah, yeah,
that song sucks.

Meg, I'm going to lunch now,
and I'm having pizza.

So if you see the Noid running around,

tell him if he ruins
my pizza's freshness,

I'll snap his neck.

Hey, Meg, I need to see
the Mayor about this $400 parking ticket.

Brian, you can't just barge in here.

You have to make an appointment.

But this is flat-out extortion.

No, it's not. Adam can charge
whatever he wants for a parking ticket.

You know, Meg,
that guy's been playing fast and loose

with his position
for years now, and I've had it.

He's a corrupt bastard.

That is not true.

Yes, it is.

Somebody's got to stand up
and prove to this town that he's a crook.

And it looks like it has to be me.

What was all the commotion?

Oh, nothing,
it was just...

(GIGGLING)

(SHOUTING)

(GRUNTING)

(NECK SNAPPING)

Perhaps it was the Noid
who should've avoided me.

Oh, you know what, Brian?

It took me two hours
to spell "hat" with these things.

I finally got the "T" right side up,

and then you come in here...

You're a bastard.
Where are you going?

I'm going to expose Mayor West
as the corrupt politician that he is.

I'm on my way to meet a source
who won't talk to me over the phone.

Ooh! Scandal in Quahog.
Count me in.

Thank you for coming,
Deep Throat.

You'll understand
if I don't come out from the shadows.

My identity will be safest
if you never see my face.

Uh, okay.

Mayor West hasn't slept
at home for three nights.

Kermit the Frog?

(GASPS)
Somebody talked! No one is safe!

I'm getting out of here!

(SCREAMING)

What's his appeal?

(SINGING) <i>They should make a tube</i>

<i>But I guess there'd be</i>
<i>a lot of tubes</i>

Well, that wasn't
very good.

We're never gonna win that talent show.

Hey, now, Peter,
you gotta remember

that when we used
to write the old songs,

we had a lot
of "inspiration," huh?

You know, I think Brian
may have some inspiration

in a cigar box under his bed.

I don't know, Lois.
I don't think this is gonna work.

Come on, we can't give up on our goals.

What if Jesus had done that?

(CHILDREN CLAMORING)

Why is the ironing board still out?

That's... That's my favorite
picture of Brian over there on that wall.

He wants to have sex with me so bad.

(LAUGHING)

He's not...

He's not gonna get to.

(LAUGHING)

All right. There he goes.
Let's move.

I say, what are we looking for?

I don't know, some proof
of Mayor West's corruption.

What are you doing here, Brian?

Still trying to smear my boss?

No, no, no. I actually came to my senses

and realized I was out of line.

Uh, I'm just here to apologize.

Oh, and, uh,
you're so pretty.

You're always pretty.

Oh, you guys are so sweet.

Oh. Well, it's my pleasure.

Hey, can you guys hold on a sec?

I gotta get this to Helen in Accounting.

Okay, bye.

(RETCHING)

Aha!

The Mayor's date book.

This should tell us what we wanna know.

All right, let's get out of here.

Oh, God, I feel more delirious
than my cousin, Stewie Cruise.

I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
I'm in love with Katie Holmes!

I'm not gay!
Go see my new movie!

I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
I'm not gay!

All we need is
one incriminating entry in this date book,

and that's our ticket to...

Hey, Brian. What's up?

Uh, hi, uh,
Lois, Peter.

Brian, did you know
this couch was here?

It's so comfortable.

Hey, Lois,
look how short Stewie is.

(GIGGLING)
He's so short.

Oh, my God.
He is short.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Well, uh, you two are busy being nude.

So, um, we'll
just, uh, head out and, uh...

let you be nude.

Who were those guys?

I don't know.

Room for one more?

(VOCALIZING)

Well, this is
the last entry in the date book.

"Super-secret meeting
at motel. Inform no one."

I think we got him now.

You know, you really shouldn't
lie on that bedspread.

I saw this report
on TV about how filthy hotel rooms are.

In a moment,
we will use the special lights

to see just how filthy
this seemingly clean hotel room really is.

(ANIMALS CALLING)

Well? What do you see?

Oh, Jem, you are truly outrageous.

Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

I see a grown man
enjoying cartoons.

(SIGHS)
Well, that's it, then.

The only thing this guy
is guilty of is being a whack job.

Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody's coming in.

Oh, it's just some fat hooker.

Oh, my God, it's Meg!

-What?
-Meg and Adam West.

Ew!

-(SHEEP BLEATING)
-Oh, oh. Sorry, sorry.

God, this is incredible.

The Mayor is dating
a teenage intern, and it's Meg.

What a story.

This is the perfect scandal
to take him down.

All we need is taped evidence.

Well, I've got the disguises right here.

I thought you were
supposed to get the suit and the top hat.

I liked this one better.

Anything to wear a dress, huh?

Gosh, you're swell, Meg.

I really have a great time
when I'm with you.

Oh, Mayor West, I feel
exactly the same way.

Oh, please, please.
Call me Mayor Chapstick.

Well, we should probably go.

(GASPS)
Here they come. Kiss me.

Come on, we gotta follow them.

Stewie?

Huh? Oh. Oh.

-Everything all right?
-Uh, yeah. Uh...

Hey, listen,
freaking shot in the dark.

You wanna do
something sometime?

Great practice, Lois.

We are totally ready
for that talent show.

Oh, my God, Peter,
I am so wasted.

All I want to do is make cookies.

(GASPS)
Oh, my God, I have a great idea.

Let's make cookies.

We don't have to, Lois.

Look, there's a magical land
of desserts right behind you.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(CRYING)

Help! Stop!

(GASPS)

Oh, Brian. You scared me.

Another late night, huh?

Yeah, Mayor West
keeps me pretty busy.

Yeah, I noticed.

(GASPS)
Where did you get that?

Meg, what the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

You realize he probably
does this with every new intern.

That's not true.
Adam and I are in love.

Oh, don't be ridiculous.

Listen, I'm warning you
because I care about you.

I am going to the press
with this story, and when it hits,

it'll be bigger
than Uncle Sam's nipples.

Jeez! What the hell?

Uh, they're called nipples, guys.

They're freaking huge.

You know what? Maybe we can just all relax
and enjoy the sauna.

(TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PLAYING)

I have to tell you something, Adam.

You're an alien. I know.

No, no, my dog is gonna expose
our relationship to the press.

Well, so what?

You and I know
that we haven't done anything wrong.

I told you that I'd
wait for you until you're 18 or 21.

Or maybe 25,
when you can legally rent a car.

They don't care.

They're gonna make you
look like a monster.

I see.

Well, Meg,
I'm a public figure.

I'm used to the tabloids' doodie.

It's you I'm worried about.

You're just a sweet young lady
with her whole life ahead of her.

This story could ruin your future,
and I can't let that happen.

I'll take the fall,
no matter what.

Good-bye, Meg.
I'll always value your friendship.

I love you, Mayor Chapstick.

(SIGHS)

(CLEARS THROAT)

(GASPS) Brian?
What are you doing here?

I, uh, just wanted
to give you this.

I don't think
I'll be needing it anymore.

I got so caught up in
taking down Mayor West

that I just lost sight of right and wrong.

Oh. Thank you, Brian.

Well, can I give you a lift home?

My cab's right outside.

(SHOUTING)

(ROARS)

Good evening.
I'm Diane Simmons,

and I'd like to welcome you
to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.

Let's have a round of applause
for our first performer.

(SINGING) <i>There's no mustache</i>
<i>like my father's mustache</i>

<i>That's the biggest mustache</i>
<i>in town</i>

Play me off, Johnny.

(PLAYS PIANO)

Huh, what else be funny tonight?

Uh, Star Jones got married.
That was in the news.

Married a Black fellow,
which is quite a surprise

because I'd call her
quite a catch.

And Black guys, by and large, they're not
so helpful on a fishing vessel.

Now, Portuguese,
absolutely, absolutely.

I even had a couple
of Japanese guys who worked out great.

Thank you very much.
You guys have been terrific.

And now, our final performance
of the night.

Let's hear it for Handful of Peter.

(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

(STRUMMING GUITAR)

(SINGING) <i>In God's eyes,</i>

<i>God would totally do her</i>

<i>He'd do her all the way</i>
<i>Even call her the next day</i>

<i>To see how</i>
<i>her work was going</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

I can't believe we lost the talent show.
What'd we do wrong?

Well, Dad, I think I can shed
a little light on that.

You guys were so baked,

you didn't sound anywhere
near as good as you thought you did.

I was in the audience.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Oh. And here we thought
the weed was inspiring us.

Well, that's a popular
misconception, Mom and Dad.

But the fact is
the chief ingredient in marijuana is THC,

a mild form of acid,

prolonged usage of which
can cause adverse effects

to your sexual potency,
short-term memory loss,

and can also severely damage
your brain tissue,

central nervous system
and basic motor skills.

To put it simply,
Mom and Dad,

there's a reason
that they call it dope.

the two of you would be...

No, it's pretty clean.

Carol Burnett works

You know, when she tugged her ear
at the end of that show,

she was really saying
good night to her mom.

to say good night to her dad.

Oh! Giggity,
(SCATTING) Goo.

What you staring at, Joe?

These dolls all look
really surprised for some reason.

I wonder
what they're all so surprised about.

They're polyurethane sex toys, Joe.

Hey. Hey!

(HISSING)

Wow, Peter!
That's a book, isn't it?

That's the first time
I've seen you reading something

that didn't later
turn out to just be a sandwich.

Yeah. It's an erotic book.
I bought it at that sex shop.

I got to tell you though,
I've read four chapters

of this, and it's not sexy at all.

<i>"Much Ado About Humping."</i>
Well, sounds sexy.

Peter, would you put that away?

I don't like you
reading smut at the table.

Yeah. If only this were smut, Lois.

"He rubbed her shoulder sensually."

What the hell is that?
That's not sexy.

You can't do somebody
in the shoulder.

Why don't you and that book get a room?

Did you hear what I said, Brian?

I said... I said,
"Why don't you and that..."

-"That book get a room."
-Yeah.

Okay. I just want to make sure you heard.

Hey, guys.
Tell me if this letter sounds all right.

"Dear Reek Publishing,

I was highly disappointed
by your erotic novel.

Here's what I would have wrote.

It was past midnight when the blonde,
smoking-hot lab assistant,

who looked a little like Heather
Locklear, only with bigger jugs,

was grabbed and thrown onto the lab table.

He ripped off her lab coat
and she grabbed his metallic extension.

Oh. Did I mention he was a robot?

Cause that's kind of important.

Yeah, a robot. Awesome."

Whoa! That is hot.
I got to get a copy of that.

Yeah. You got some
serious talent there, Peter.

-Really?
-I'm no school administrator,

but there's an extension program
going on in my trousers.

"And then Captain Leroy Hot Dog

Zanzibar and Gina,
from my work

got in the backseat
of his really cool spaceship.

Gina was finally wearing that tank top
I got her and nothing else.

Zanzibar knew he couldn't control

his space horniness any longer,

and then they totally did it.

And if I'd have been there,
I would have been, like,

Oh, sweet."
Huh? What do you think?

You certainly do
paint a picture, Peter.

I felt like
I was right there on Planet Niptune.

You're not the only one.

Everyone down at the bar wanted a copy.

Wow! Maybe you should
think about publishing it.

Hey, if you ask Daddy, he might even

give you some money to do it yourself.

That's a great idea, Lois.
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

If this works out, I could make more money

than when I had
that rat farm in the basement.

Armando, do you have the rent?

We are trying, Senor Griffin.

But the land, she gives us nothing.

There is no sunlight.

It's been two months, Armando.

You're putting me
in a real awkward position here.

Oh, please, Senor Griffin.

Just one more week.
I will pay you double.

Perhaps we can work out
another arrangement.

Oh, please, Senor.
Not my beloved!

it is for the children.

I sure did, Kathy. That was impressive.
Here comes the dismount.

Hey, Stewie, I just took a nap.

You want an eye booger?

I'm training for the Olympics,

what are you thinking about right now?

What do you want, homo?

Listen, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

You're a businessman.
I'm a businessman.

And I've got a proposal
that I guarantee you can't refuse.

See, I wrote this erotica book.

And I was hoping you could loan me
$7 billion to publish it.

How about I loan you five dollars?

It's at the bottom
of this jar of barbed wire and salt.

Ah! Ow! Ow!

Why do you keep these things together?

All right. Who wants to buy
some Peterotica? Ten bucks a pop.

-I'll take one.
-Me, too.

Hey, give me one of those.

I look forward to having a raging semi.

Wow, Peter.

You're going into the publishing business?

Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt
gave me five dollars for these Xeroxes,

and I haven't looked back.

(MURMURING)

I'm such a huge fan of Peterotica.

There you go.
Thanks for reading.

Hi. Would you be offended
if I told you

your prose suggests a male,
working-class version of Emily Bronte?

No. Would you be
offended if I said

I'd like to use
your ass as a bongo drum?

Yes.

Well, then we are
on two different wavelengths.

-Yeah. I'm going to kill you.

Daddy, what are you doing?

Your fat, bastard husband ruined me!
I lost my home, my money,

and perhaps just as serious,
my wife left me!

Mom left you?

Yeah. She ran off with Ted Turner.

God only knows what they're doing.

-Should we give Elmo a bath?
-Yeah.

-Should we give Telly a bath?
-Yeah!

-Should we give Ernie a bath?
-No.

Ernie doesn't like the monsters.

Look, you can stay
with us if you want, you filthy hobo.

You shouldn't be embarrassed

about mooching off your kids at age 70.

Go to hell, fathead!
Have I used that one?

No, I haven't.
Yeah, fathead.

Daddy, don't talk to Peter like that.

All you've done
his whole life is treat him like crap,

and now he's offering to help you.

The least you can do is be grateful.

Oh, all right.

Then it's settled.
You're staying with us.

I promise you'll love it here,

even more than
Julia Roberts loves herself.

Hi, I'm Julia Roberts.

You know,
a lot of people died in the tsunami.

But don't worry. I didn't.

And I'll be here
to entertain you and love my life

for many, many years to come.

Me!

Me!

Me!

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

Daddy, you're not dressed!

Huh? Oh, yeah.
Couldn't figure that one out.

Used to have a guy for that.

Mom, I can't believe
you came out of that belly.

Um... (SNIFFING)
what is that?

Daddy, did you, um,

use the bathroom this morning?

Yeah.

And did you remember
to clean up afterwards?

Uh, no.
I was hoping you would...

-Oh, Daddy. No. No.
-Okay. Brian?

-Oh, God! No. No. No, no, no.
-I'll do it.

Daddy, I never thought
you'd be so lost without your money.

(SIGHS)
You're right, Lois.

Who the hell am I kidding?
I can't live like this.

I should never have come here.

Oh, I hate to see Daddy like this.

Maybe there's something
you can do to help cheer him up.

Don't worry, Lois.
I know just what to do.

I am gonna teach your father
how to be a regular guy.

You think you can do that?

Sure. I've steered our family
through bigger problems.

Like when we were cartoon sketches
on <i>The Tracey Ullman Show.</i>

Well, that's the end of Puss.

He was the best cat anyone ever had.

Hey, Lois, what do you say
we go downtown and buy a dog?

Hey, wait a minute.
You already have a dog.

So long, Puss.

We'll miss you.

It's gonna be quite a different place

with him gone.
That's for true.

All right, Kathy.
It looks like Stewie Griffin

is preparing to begin
the floor routine. That's right, Mitch.

And as we watch Griffin doing this,

I want to remind everyone
that this is absolutely not gay.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Boy, that was really gay.

No, no!
Didn't you just hear the announcers?

They said it's not gay.

Ha-ha!
Stewie one, you zero.

What are we doing here?

Listen, I know you're upset
about losing your money,

so I wanted to show you
it's not so bad living like a regular guy.

-So these people live here?
-No, this is a bus.

People ride it to get places
that they need to go.

You look familiar.

I was your gardener for 12 years.

Oh. You look different
without my lawn under you.

I don't take the lawn with me when I go.

Well, I was right
to trust you with it then.

And this is called
waiting in line at the movies.

It's what us regular people do.

Trust me.
It makes it that much more special

when we finally get inside
and see Renee Zellweger

doing her whole scrunch face routine.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming this March,</i>

<i>Jude Law and Renee Zellweger</i>

<i>in The Picnic.</i>

Oh, no. These ants
are ruining our picnic.

You mean this picnic is ruining our ants.

<i>Look around your world,</i>
<i>pretty baby</i>

<i>Is it everything</i>
<i>you hoped it'd be?</i>

You know, Peter,
what you showed me today was just awful.

What are you talking about?

I really don't see what's so great
about being a regular person.

The bus smells like crap,
the movie theater is sticky,

and Renee Zellweger
should only be the cute friend at best.

You know,
I never thought about it till now,

but maybe being
a regular person does suck.

My God. Is this what my whole life
is destined to be?

Not unless you do something about it.

Yeah. But what?

Carter, hand me my thinking grenades.

Where did you get these?

Shh. Carter, I'm thinking.

-(EXPLOSION)
-Uh-huh.

-(EXPLOSION)
-MAN: Oh, my God! He's dead!

That might work.

-(EXPLOSION)
-MAN: What's happening?

I got it!

Carter, somehow you and me
are gonna find a way to get rich.

Now you're talking my language.

All right, then, let's do it!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi. I'm Betty White.

I just got a subpoena
regarding an erotic novel,

and I'm looking
for the son of a bitch responsible.

All right, Peter, how are we gonna
do this? How are we gonna get rich?

Well, I say we start out small, Carter.

Here's my plan.

I'll distract Lois
while you steal money from her purse.

Lois, look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

(LAUGHING)

(HUMMING)

Cacaw! I've got
her wallet! Cacaw!

Daddy, what are you doing?

Look at the unicycle!

Well, she's got ten dollars in here,

and it cost me $900
for the six weeks of unicycle lessons.

So we're a little in the red right now,

but you got to spend money
to make money, champ. Moving on.

All right.
Now we play it cool.

Hey, Meg.
Uh, we're trying to make some money.

And, um...

Would you like to buy some pot
from your granddaddy and me?

Um, wow! Sure.

Oh, fantastic.

What the hell was that for?

Now we have the pot
and the money.

You sure this is gonna work, Peter?

All I know is
there's a lot of money to be made

in these stupid teen dramas
they keep putting on TV.

And we're gonna get our share.

(HUMMING)

Dawson, I'm just not ready

-Come on.
-No!

I promised myself
that I'd save it for the man that I marry.

Come on. That's stupid.

I'm... I'm just
not comfortable, you know?

Well, I don't...
This... This is like the '90s, man.

I mean, like, everybody...

Come on. You saw me on that boat.
I was wearing a blazer.

-Huh? Come on.
-No! I just...

I... I don't want to! All right?
I don't want to right now!

I told you I'm not comfortable.

I think you could respect that.

-You know?
-I do respec... I totally respect it.

That just makes me
want you more, you know?

Come on, man. Let's just...
Let's just go nuts. Let's just...

-No, I said... I don't...
-Come on!

I don't want... No!
No! Peter, stop! Just stop! All right!

Turn off the camera!

God, I'm sorry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

I don't want to
do this anymore, all right?

You know what?
You went too far.

-What?
-You went too far.

That's his character.
That's how...

I mean, he's that kind of...

No! Forget it. Forget it.

You know what?
It's just weird, man.

It's just weird.
You're weird.

All right?
Just get off it.

Let's just do something else
to make money.

And we will be back.

Stand back, Brian.
I'm preparing for my vault.

You can't vault inside the living room.
You're gonna get hurt.

Yeah. I'll get hurt
right onto a Wheaties box.

I don't see that happening.

Yeah?
Who cares what you say?

You're a dog.
You can't see colors.

Which means you can't see
the colors of the American flag.

Commie.

(GLASS BREAKING)

(SIGHS)
I think I'm okay.

(SCREAMS)

Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!

Oh, God! Somebody!

Do I take it out,
or do I leave it in?

Do I take it out,
or do I leave it in?

(SCREAMING)

Got it! We'll rob a train.
Love it.

All aboard!

PETER: All right, everybody. This is a...

Hey, where the hell is everybody?

Oh, we haven't had
a paying customer in months.

Nobody rides the train anymore.

Oh, well, for God's sake!

Uh, are...
Are you robbers?

Yeah.

Well, you could...
you could take my wallet.

My MasterCard's in there.
Although, to be honest,

I'll probably just cancel it
before you can use it. So...

Oh, um...

Give me that hole punch!

(SNICKERS) Yeah!

Is this... Is this your hole punch
or the... or the train company's?

Well, that's...
You know...

I got... I got to pay for that.

That... That comes out
of my paycheck if you... if you take it.

Oh, oh, really?

-Uh...
-Yeah.

Well, I can't
in all good conscience take that, then.

Oh, oh, good. Uh, thank you.
Thank you, that's...

Yeah. Yeah.

No. I'm... I'm,
I'm a working man myself.

-No. It's tough out there.
-Yeah.

You know, you can't...

-You got to find a way.
-It's tough, it is.

All right.
Well, uh, can you

stop this thing so we can get off?

Uh, no. I mean,
I... I'd love to.

Uh, but it... it stops at
the predesignated stops.

You know, I don't...
I don't have control, you know, over that.

-Oh. Well, how...
-That's the engineer who does that stuff.

Uh, well, how much are our tickets?

Well, for this, this is a
first... first-class cabin.

It's, uh, 25 bucks.

Wow! And we're the robbers.

Um, okay, uh, uh.
How much is coach?

Uh, $12 for coach.

Well, he's a senior...

You know what?
That... That's fine.

Just give me
two coach tickets.

All right, thank you.

Oh, wow! When did <i>Mamma Mia!</i>
come to the Oakdale?

Oh, yeah. What...
Just a week ago, I think.

Oh, wow! We... We should go.
Do you want to...

You want to
go see <i>Mamma Mia?</i>

Peter, could I speak to you
over by the door?

Good as new.

Oh, come on!

I give up.

We're gonna be
lower middle-class Americans forever.

A fate worse than death.

Seriously, we may as well just be dead.

You know what, Peter?
That's not true.

In the time we've spent together,
I've learned something.

When you're rich,
you don't own your possessions,

your possessions own you.

Oh, Carter, darling!

Babs, sweetheart!

Honey, we're rich again.

I divorced Ted Turner
and took half his money.

We own half of CNN.

-Hey, hey! Neat!
-And TNT.

-All right, buddy, we did it! We're rich!
-"We"?

Go to hell,
you fat peasant!

Aw, crap!

Peter, listen to me.
Money doesn't matter.

Ten years ago Daddy offered
to give us $10 million,

and I turned it down.

-What?
-Yes.

And I'll always turn it down,

because money just
complicates everything.

We don't need money,
because we have each other.

Happiness isn't about
buying expensive things,

it's about being together.

It's not about taking expensive trips.

It's about
holding each other during a thunderstorm.

And we have that kind of happiness, Peter.

Real happiness because we have each other.

Yeah.

It's about time you two settled down.

Oh, you hear that, Meg?

Guys can marry other guys now.

So... This is awkward, but, uh,

I mean, if they can do that,
that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?

I mean, you might as well pack it in.
Game over.

Uh, Alyssa, hi.

I, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to...

-...do something sometime?
-Sure, Chris.

I have a Young Republicans
meeting after school. You wanna come?

Oh, sure. What do you do
at a Young Republicans meeting?

We help those who already have
the means to help themselves.

Also, we perpetuate the ideal

that Jesus chose America to destroy
nonbelievers and brown people.

the town's treasury on a gold frog.

I don't like it.

And I don't like

his name is Dig Them.

You're not welcome here, Dig Them.

I stand behind my decision.

I can't hear you now. You're not here now.

that I'm not the only Mayor West
who's facing difficulties.

Hey, I didn't start this war, but it's on!

Oh, Lois, there you are.

Listen, Ricardo and I wanna thank you

for letting us have the wedding here.

Oh! You're...
You're having the wedding here?

Yeah. I hope that's okay, Lois.
I offered them the house.

Oh, uh, sure. No problem.

Hey, McButt the Crime Dog,

I heard you and your little chew toy
getting it on last night.

-Keep it down.
-Sorry, little man.

Ricardo and I were playing <i>Clue,</i>

and he got me in the bedroom
with a lead pipe.

Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable

having this wedding at the house.

Lois, I don't know
what the big deal is. So they're gay.

It's not like we're gonna have
a gay sex orgy in the living room.

That's not what I'm talking about.

I've got nothing against homosexuals.

I mean, I'll watch anything
with David Schwimmer.

But the idea of two men
actually getting married,

it just doesn't seem right.

Hey, I say who cares, you know?

If gays wanna get married
and be miserable like the rest of us,

-I say we should let them.
-JASPER: Oh, no!

-What's wrong?
-Look.

Some breaking news today
when Mayor West announced he will sign

a citywide ban on gay marriages next week.

While controversial, it has nonetheless

effectively distracted all of us
from the Dig 'Em fiasco.

-The what?
-I don't know. Something about a lizard.

And now this.

Look at that.

In the '30s, they called this
an Uncle Spinny Dervish.

-Really?
-I don't know. I'm just bored.

A ban on gay marriage? Oh, my God!

(DOOR BELL RINGS)

Matthew McConaughey?

Yeah, I'm looking for a guy named Stewie.

Ow!

Chris, grab his legs.
I gotta bury this thing.

-But I...
-(SHOUTS) Grab his legs!

I can't believe the wedding's off.

All I ever wanted was to get married

and make a home
with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy.

Isn't that the American dream?

Oh, don't give up yet, Jasper.

Mayor West only banned gay marriage

so he could distract
from the Dig 'Em scandal.

-He won't get away with it.
-Mmm.

Oh, Jasper, where'd you get
these brownies?

They're from a bakery
in the West Quahog gay district.

I thought they'd help my depression.

Oh, I can see why. Oh, my God,

they pack so much fudge into these.

And, and look at this. There's even
a couple of nuts lodged in there.

I'm going upstairs.

Oh, I've got to do something.

Jasper's always
been there for me when I've needed him.

I am gonna make Mayor West
change his mind.

But, Brian, the Bible
says gay marriage is an abomination.

Oh, don't give me
that Young Republican crap, Chris.

The Bible also says
a senior citizen built an ark

and rounded up two of every animal.

-Hey.
-Yeah?

What the hell is this?

Oh, you didn't really give
any specific guidelines about mating.

-Did you name it?
-What?

-Did you name it?
-Uh, yeah, he's Paul.

Yeah? Well, it's gonna be
a hell of a lot harder for you now,

because he's going the (BLEEPS) overboard.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Hi, Glenn.

Uh, hey, will you sign
a petition to overturn

Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?

Gay marriage? Oh, come on,

two halves can't make a whole
without a hole.

Giggity, Giggity, Giggity, Giggity.

Chris, did you hear?

Some dog is going around town
trying to get support for gay marriage.

Oh, that's Brian. He's got a petition.

Really? Chris, you've got
to destroy that petition.

-Why?
-Because if you do,

I'll let you touch my boobs.

Is, is, is that good? Do, do I want that?

Oh, yeah, you want that.

Well, fantastic then.

How can I help you, Mrs. Griffin?

Well, I'm having a bit of a crisis.

I'm a very open-minded person,

and I've never
had any problem with gays before,

but something about
two gay people getting married,

I, I just don't think it's right.

Well, these questions are too big

to be decided by human beings.

Which is why God made this film.

(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)

You know, there's been
a lot of talk lately about homosexuals,

but how do you know what to believe?

Well, here are a few tips that may
help you tell when you've got a gay.

So, uh, what's your favorite
Madonna album?

I like her early work.

MAN: <i>If his answer is anything but</i>
<i>"I've never bought one,"</i>

-(BANGS)
-<i>you've got a gay.</i>

Let's take a blood sample, Mr. Braga.

(SIZZLES)

MAN: <i>If instead</i><i>of human blood,</i>

-<i>you've got a gay.</i>

(SCREECHES)

MAN: <i>Not this time, nancy boy.</i>

Well, that was interesting.

I also have <i>My Giant</i> with Billy Crystal.

Oh, God, no, no.

Well, we almost have enough signatures,

thanks to Quahog's gay district.

Lois, how'd you like to be
signature number 10,000?

-Brian, I can't sign this.
-Why not?

Well, because I don't believe
in gay marriage.

You don't believe...
Lois, that's ridiculous.

Gay people have every right
to get married.

Well, they certainly
have every right to be together,

but marriage should be
between a man and a woman.

Well, that's not how they
do it in West Quahog.

By the way, Lois,
I got a piercing over there.

I'm not gonna tell you where,
but I'll give you a hint.

It wasn't my nose or my ear,
and it was one of my balls.

Well, regardless of what you think,

this is going to change Mayor West's mind,

and we are gonna have
Jasper's wedding here.

Fine. Then until this is all over,
I'll stay somewhere else.

Come on, Stewie, we're going
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

Fine, I'll go, but I'm not missing
that gay wedding.

I still kick myself for missing

that topless cheerleader parade

with the 100-foot chocolate teddy bear

and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics,

choreographed to the music of Queen.

Oh, I remember that day.

Huh. Should have gone to that thing.

-(GASPS)
-(FLICKS)

My petition! What the hell are you doing?

I'm going to get to touch
right-wing boob because of this.

You idiot! Now I'm going
to have to get 10,000 more signatures

before tomorrow morning.
What were you thinking?

You don't understand, Brian.

When was the last time
you were even with a woman?

-Uh, when did the <i>Challenger </i>blow up?
-'86.

Yeah, it was like three years before that.

Mayor West, here's the gay marriage ban
for your approval.

Excellent. This is so important,

I'm going to sign it
with all capital letters.

It's going to say, "Adam West"!

That's what it's going to say, you'll see.

Hey, buddy, you can't go in there.

(PANTING)

Mayor West, you have to look at this.

Ten thousand signatures.

I've been up for 24 hours,

I paid off a few people

and I did a few things
in West Quahog I'm not proud of.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

So, it's a show
about three hookers and their mom?

This is very impressive,
but my decision stands.

No!

Come on, buddy, you're leaving.

No, I can't let Jasper down!

-(GUN COCKING)
-I'm not going to let you sign that.

Go on, get out of here!

I should warn you,
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield,

the exact size of a bullet,
somewhere on my body.

And if you hit it, I'll be unharmed,
and your plan will be foiled.

You'll be the laughingstock of me.

I don't want to shoot you, Mayor West.

Good, because I'm incredibly crafty.

Hey, what's that on the ceiling?

(LAUGHING)

Now I'm over here.

Look, this has gotten out of hand, I know.

I, I, I don't want anyone to get hurt.

But you can put an end to this right now

by tearing up that gay marriage ban.

You won't break me.

15 years ago
I swallowed everything I needed

to escape from a hostage situation.

(HACKING)

(GASPS) A wall!

Well, no matter.

I'm prepared
for a lengthy captivity as well.

(HACKING)

I swallowed this <i>People </i>magazine in 1989.

All right, Paul Hogan,
tell me about the real <i>Crocodile Dundee.</i>

It's so nice to have you home, dear.

I can take it or leave it.

God, this is such
an old-people house, you know.

I mean, look at this candy jar.

Let's, let's, uh, take a look in here.

Let's, let's see
what you got here. You got...

You got licorice.
Oh, that's, uh, that's...

Oh, Freedent. Oh, that's good.

Yeah, yeah, I got a...
I got a sweet tooth,

I think I'll have some Freedent.

Yeah. Oh.
Oh, what's this? Oh, a cough drop.

A Luden's cough drop.

Is that candy? No, I don't think
that's candy. I think it's a cough drop!

Uh, what else we got?
Oh, oh, oh, look at... Look. Look at this.

There's a fishing lure in here.

There's a fishing lure in the candy jar.

(STAMMERS) What?
Am I supposed to eat this?

Eat a fishing lure?
Hey, look, Brian's on TV.

FEMALE REPORTER:
<i>And now, some Channel 5 exclusive footage</i>

<i>of the crazed homosexual gunman</i>

<i>who's taken Mayor West hostage.</i>

Oh, my God!

Brian's taken the Mayor hostage?

Is this an eyeglass lens?

I didn't realize how strongly
he feels about this.

(SCOFFS) Gay marriage.

Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.

Oh, oh, look at this. A spare key

for a Volkswagen Scirocco.

They, they don't even make this anymore.

They don't even make this car anymore.

Whose key could this possibly be?

What if Brian's right?

I mean, certainly the love between a man
and a woman should be sacred, but...

Who's talking about love?
We're talking about marriage.

Well, don't you love Mom?

Come on, Lois, look at her.

So two straight people who hate each other

have more of a right to be together

than two gay people who love each other?

That's what we raised you to believe.

Oh, my God! I've made a terrible mistake!

I've been brainwashed,
like Elizabeth Smart.

It's so wonderful having her home again.

She's brought music back into the house.

Playing songs on the harp.

Of course most of them
are about rape, but it's still nice.

I think I made Brian crazy.

Maybe I shouldn't have
burned that petition.

Oh no, Chris, you did the right thing.

It's only a matter of time
before Mayor West signs that bill,

and you'll get to touch these.

Oh, boy, I got a feeling
that before the end of the day,

I'm going to be burying my dog.

Whoa, whoa. I said you could
touch my boobs. Let's start with that.

Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian
to come out peacefully,

we're going to have to take him down.

Don't worry, Joe,
I'm good with tight situations.

Like when I saved Luke Skywalker's life.

Okay, Luke, this'll keep you warm

until I get the shelter built.

You're sure this is okay?

Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.

All right, Brian, Peter's coming in!

I'll relax him by using my catchphrase.

(MIMICS ITALIAN ACCENT)
Hey, what's up with you?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-What the hell was that?
-My catchphrase.

You don't have a catchphrase.

(MIMICS ITALIAN ACCENT)
Why you gotta say like that?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Excuse me.

(HACKS)

Would anyone like to play <i>Stratego?</i>

I have <i>Stratego.</i>

Oh, Peter, I never meant
for this to happen.

This, this whole situation
has totally spiraled out of control.

Brian, listen to me. I was wrong.

If two people love each other,
they should have the right to get married.

But you have to come down
and give yourself up.

If you drag this out any longer,

you're only hurting your own cause.

(SIGHS)

She's right. I'm sorry, Mayor West.

Well, you were only doing
what you thought was right, Brian.

And, hey, you've distracted everyone
from the Dig 'Em statue,

so I guess
we don't need this bill anymore.

(MIMICS ITALIAN ACCENT) Everybody happy!

<i>(BRIDAL CHORUS </i>PLAYING)

Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West

to drop the kidnapping charges.

It's amazing. All he asked for in return

was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.

You're welcome.

Listen, Lois, I, I really appreciate

you putting your discomfort aside,

so we could have the wedding here.

Oh, please, I'm over all that now.

Two men getting married
doesn't bother me in the least.

They deserve happiness.

It's gonna be tight, y'all.

I built it myself with supplies
I got at the Home Supply downtown.

Hey, between you and me, I think Joe's got
a little free time these days.

I hear he hasn't touched Bonnie in months.

Peter, you just whispered that to me.

Shh. Here he is.

Joe, what a great job you've done here.

For some people, it's easier than others.

Some people just get lost
on the way to the light.

They're walking along, they stop and say,

"Oh, is that a new restaurant?

"That place must've just opened up

"'cause I remember there was
another place there a few weeks ago.

"I went in there once and there was a guy
with a harelip eating soup,

"and I was like ew!

"It wasn't the restaurant's fault, I know.

"But I still never went back there.

"I mean, I guess there's only, like,
a 1 in 50 chance

"of me getting the same spoon that he had,

but I still don't like them odds."

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Oh, I can't bear this anymore!

If Stewie can't find
his way out of Meg's ass,

we have to enter
the other realm and get him ourselves.

Lois, I told you it ain't safe.

I'll tell you what's not safe.

Going hunting with Dick Cheney.

So, you all set to go hunting?

Sorry, I thought you were a deer.

Be careful, Lois.

I will, Peter.

I don't feel anything!

Now she knows how I felt
when I was at her piano recital.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

No, you're doing fine, Meg.

Oh, Stewie, you're all right!

Oh, thank God you guys are...

Ew, you're covered in slime.

Ugh! This must be how
Tom Arnold felt on his wedding night.

(MEG SCREAMING)

Holy crap! Let's get out of here.

Wait a minute. Where's Meg?

I don't know. I didn't see her.

Yeah, I kind of thought
you guys would attend to that.

-Peter, you got to go back and get her.
-Oh, yeah, right.

-Like I'm going back for Meg.
-Peter!

Lois, damn it, we both agreed, remember?

If we could only save two, we leave Meg.

-I know, but...
-You bastard!

How could you leave me in there?

She's... Okay, see? It resolved itself.

Oh, I forgot one thing.

A bit of breaking news.

A local family is forced
out of their home by ghosts.

Who are they gonna call?

Ghostbusters, Tom?

No, Diane, their insurance company.

That's just stupid what you said.

And now back to Disney's
<i>Too Many Ostriches</i> starring Don Knotts.

There's way too many ostriches.

Why are there so many ostriches?

The brochure said
there'd only be a few ostriches.

This is a terrible vacation!

So, what was it like on the other side?

Well, I met Jesus up there.

Wow, what's he like?

Uh, believe it or not, he's Chinese.

-Really?
-Yup, Jesus is Chinese.

In fact, his last name is Hong.
Jesus Hong.

Says he has no idea
where people are getting Christ.

Quagmire, you got to help us.
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts,

and now our house is gone
and we got no place to stay.

Uh, Peter, this is not the best time.

WOMAN: Glenn, are you coming?

Yeah, honey, I'll be right there.

(MIMICKING BABY CRYING)
I'll be right there.

Peter, I'm really slammed right now.

Can you give me the short version?

Uh, what's, uh...
What's going on in there?

Nothing.

(DONKEY BRAYING)

So, uh, as you can see, my family's here.

And, uh it's, it's game night.

We're playing...sex.

Ugh, a soup kitchen, Dad?

Isn't there any other place we can go?

We're homeless, Meg.

This is where homeless people go.

Well, it'll just be good
to get some food in us.

Hi, welcome to the soup kitchen.

I'll just start you off with this basket

of pizza crusts and apple cores.

Oh, and we do have one special today.

It's an avocado pit
with a little bit of avocado still on it,

and that comes on
a ripped pair of boxer shorts.

Now, I'm trying to decide between

the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper

and the half yogurt
with the balled-up tissue in it.

Hi, there. Do you have any books
on how to get rid of ghosts?

Have you tried telling them
you're ready for a commitment?

(LAUGHING)

Oh, like a relationship.

Exactly.

That'll send them running, huh?

(LAUGHING) I like her.

Oh.

Here you go. Maybe this'll help.

All right, here it is.

"To vanquish poltergeists,
one must restore all disturbed remains

"to their original resting places."

So all we got to do is
bring the skull back home and bury it.

What are you doing?

You said you were using
the skull as an athletic cup.

I was, but don't you remember,
I threw it in the garbage?

Oh.

-So, you're not wearing it now?
-No.

That's, uh, pretty much
just me you're grabbing.

That's how my old scoutmaster
shakes hands.

(MOANING)

Ew! That is vile.

I know. I hate myself, but it's so good.

(MOANING)

Can I help you folks find something?

No, we're just browsing.

God, I hate it
when they pester you like that.

Peter! Yes, we need help.

We're looking for a skull
that my husband threw away.

A skull, huh?
Then you want the human remains bin.

But I should warn you folks,
we're pretty cleaned out right now,

'cause Carrot Top comes by every morning
to rummage for new props.

Well, then we'll just have to pay
this Carrot Top a visit.

He's funny.

Except for that one show he did

in Ohio after the airline
lost his luggage.

MALE ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, Carrot Top!

All right, you guys
look like a good crowd.

I hope it goes well,
'cause I don't have my prop trunk.

I normally have,
like, a, a case with all my little props

and gadgets and whatnot,

but, it's okay,
you can use your imagination,

like maybe a piece of luggage
that shoots dog biscuits.

So, like, if you had, like, weed
in your bag and you went to the airport,

you could shoot the dog biscuits out,

and then the drug dog would be...

Would go away from your bags.

Kind of if you can imagine the dog...

(MIMICKING DOG BARKING)
and then, the dog...

Man, it's a lot funnier if I had my prop.

LOIS: Well, there it is. Carrot Top Manor.

So, you having a good time there,
Chief Diamond Phillips?

Oh, that's funny.
He came up with the same thing that...

All right, Carrot Top, I want that skull.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Peter Griffin,
and that skull belongs to me.

Well, it's hardly
just a skull, Mr. Griffin.

I put it on my head, and it's a skullcap!

(LAUGHING) It's a...

Put it with David Duchovny,
and it's Agent Scully.

You got to appreciate that...
Hey, don't distract me.

Now, hand it over, Mr. Top.

Very well, Mr. Griffin,
I'll give you the skull,

but you have to catch me first!

Looks like you found me, Mr. Griffin.

But which one of us is
the real king of prop comedy

and not just an illusion, huh?

That's right, Mr. Griffin.

Just a little further.

(SCREAMS)

(CHORTLES)

Sucker.

What the hell?

How'd you get through the trap door?

I found this saw with glasses on it.

Oh, that's my see-saw.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

You are so (BLEEP) funny!

You are so...

(BLEEP) you for being so funny!

Oh, my God! Oh, oh, God. You know what?

Here, here, just, you know what?

Keep it, keep it. You deserve it.

Just take it.

No, no, I need it. I need it.

Well, Chief, time for you to go back
where you came from.

Peter, you did it.

What the hell?

Oh, Peter, I'm so proud of you.

Once again you brought our family
to the edge of the abyss,

and at the very last minute,
you saved us all.

I love you, honey.

And I've grown fond of you, Lois.

Let's go home.

Then how come no one buy Peter wheel?

Maybe sales pitch not good enough.

Brian help.

Okay, sell wheel just like practice.

You so money. Don't know it.

Right, good thinking.

Meg, go get us some sandwiches.

Wait a minute, that's a great idea.

If Meg can get through the vent,

she can sneak out and go get help.

Dad, I can't go through the vent.

Yeah, she's right. We need
to grease her up so she doesn't get stuck.

Everybody, spit on Meg.

-(SPITTING)
-Stop! Ah! Stop! Okay!

I meant I can't do it
because there are burglars down there.

Come on, they're not gonna touch you.

You're covered with spit.

Be careful, Meg.

(SCREAMING)

MEG: I hate you all!

Hey, I hate you too, bitch.

Oh, no, I'm just kidding. Can you imagine?

You think Meg made it through the vent?

Well, let's find out.

Oh, there she is. She's in the kitchen.

Hey, Meg. I see you there in the kitchen.

Put my sandwich on whole wheat, please.

No, don't use that mustard.

Use the other mustard.

Oh, God, Meg, they know you're there.

Quick, scrape that mustard off.

Use the other mustard!

Oh, no. The burglars got my baby.

I think they're making a sign
to tell us something.

Better not be
using my crayons, mixing them up.

We have your son.

Meg's our daughter.

Peter, do something!

You know, Meg being captured
by evil men reminds me of another story.

It's distracting.

Um, this is the story
of my ancestor Nate Griffin.

Of course,
Nate Griffin was his slave name.

His real name was Richard Bachman.

And, this is the story of his roots.

<i>It all began in Africa</i>
<i>in the tiny village of Quahogswana</i>

-(WHIP CRACKS)
-What's your name?

Tobi with an I.

With an accent over the I,

And sometimes I like to dot the "I"

Something to brighten the reader's day.

I asked you what your name was.

Honey, you keep that up,
it's whatever you want it to be.

PETER:<i> Of course,</i><i>back then, the South</i>

<i>was a very different place</i>
<i>than it is today.</i>

<i>A backward place</i>
<i>where they didn't believe in science</i>

Yeah, the quarters are too crowded,

At some point, that horse is going to have
to stop and eat some grain.

We gotta get outta here!

Oh, yeah? Over Meg's dead body.

Hey! A flare gun. Good idea, Peter.

If we angle it through the vent,

we might be able to alert the authorities.

Oh, my God! We're gonna drown!

We'll be fine. Here, put these on.

Pardon me, madam. I'm the truant officer.

I found these two children of yours
playing hooky from school.

Oh, my! This will never do, will it, dear?

(BABBLING) Chris, you gotta...
You gotta...

It's important for you
to get an education!

Get in there and finish your homework!

It was a simpler time.
It was a better time.

Well, no matter what happens to us,
I just hope Meg's okay.

So, Is this, the part

-where you guys have your way with me?
-What?

You know, where I'm, like, helpless,

and you guys take turns. You know?

Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, no!

BURGLAR: What did she say?

She asked
if we were gonna have our way with her.

-Ew!
-Seriously. I won't scream or anything.

No! I... no. No sale.

Come on! I'm pretty!

(SCREAMING)

(PANTING)

Are you okay?

Yeah. I was so scared.

Well, it sure would suck if you guys died

without hearing the story
of my great-uncle, Peter Hitler,

who was Adolf's favorite brother.

Hey, there you are.

Hey, you ready to go check out that
new skin flick over at the Boobengarden?

Peter, can't you see I'm busy?

Yeah? What are you doing?

-Stuff?
-Yes.

Nazi stuff?

Yes, Peter. Nazi stuff.

Can I help?

No, Peter. Just let me work, all right?

All right. Okay. All right.

(SPUTTERING)
(SLAPPING)

Hey, Addy. Addy, look.

Addy, I'm Tojo.

Addy, look. I'm... See, look. I'm Tojo.

(HUMMING)

I am from Japan.

(IMITATING GONG)

(GROANS)

Oh, sweet!

(IMITATING GUNFIRE)

That's what a gun sounds like.

Will you stop that?

Hey, can I borrow 50 Marks?

Oh, what happened
to the 50 Marks I gave you last week?

Oh, come on. Your girlfriend's not cheap.

Ooh! (LAUGHING)

Just kidding. Oh, look at your face.

Hey, whatever happened
with that art school?

You ever gonna take another crack at that?

Look, I'm going to do a rally.

I'll be back in an hour.

A rally? Sweet.

(CROWD CHEERING)

The days of despair and hardship are over!

Today begins a new order!

All of Europe will tremble

as Germany takes its rightful place
as ruler of the world!

Oh, yeah!

Yes. As I was saying,
the time for victory is upon us!

Victory up the ass, baby! Yeah, come on!

A new world! A better world!

A German world!

Yeah! Germanator!
I'll be back! Whoo! Yeah!

We will emerge as the dominant people!

And it's all 'cause of you guys.
You know what?

You guys, with your marching,
and your letters, and your phone calls...

This is all thanks to you.

You made this happen, you guys.

You know... My God.

Give yourselves a round of applause.

Come on. You deserve it.

Hey, what do you say
we all head over to the Boozenpuken?

Free beer on this motherfuhrer! Come on!

(ALL CHEERING)

Well, that's pretty much
all there is to tell, kids.

The Griffin family history
is a rich tapestry.

But, since we're all gonna die,

there's one more secret
I feel I have to share with you.

-I did not care for <i>The Godfather.</i>
-What?

Did not care for <i>The Godfather.</i>

How can you even say that, Dad?

Didn't like it.

Peter, it's so good.
It like the perfect movie.

This is what everyone
always says whenever...

Robert De Niro, Al Pacino...

I mean, you never see... Robert Duvall!

(STUTTERING) I know. Fine, actor.

Did not like the movie.

-Why not?
-Did not... Couldn't get into it.

Explain yourself.
What didn't you like about it?

-It insists upon itself, Lois.
-What?

-It insists upon itself.
-What does that even mean?

'Cause it has
a valid point to make, it's insistent!

It takes forever getting in,
and then you spend, you know,

like six-and-a-half hours,
and then, you know,

I can't even get through it.
I can't even finish the movie.

-I've never even seen the ending.
-You've never seen the ending?

Well, how can you say you don't like it

if you haven't even given it a chance?

-I agree with Stewie. It's not fair.
-It's outrageous.

I have tried on three separate occasions
to get through it,

and I get to the scene where all the guys

are sitting around on the easy chairs...

-That's a great scene. I love that scene.
-It's noted in every annal.

I have no idea what they're talking about.

It's like they're speaking
a different language.

-That's where I lose interest and go away.
-They're speaking Italian!

The language they're speaking
is the language of subtlety,

something you don't understand.

I love <i>The Money Pit.</i>

That is my answer to that statement.

-Exactly.
-Well, there you go.

-Whatever.
-I like that movie, too.

Thank God, you guys are okay!

Wow! You saved our lives, Mr. Swanson!

We've captured the burglars.

Oh, thank God.

Unfortunately,
they're pressing sexual harassment charges

against your daughter.

Well, that was a close call.

You know...

Meg should probably get a lawyer.

Oh, sweetie, thank you for keeping
our spirits up with your stories.

Your daughter's a sexual predator.

If you don't do anything,
she could go to jail for a long time.

Don't thank me, Lois. Thank my ancestors

for living lives of greatness.

All right, guys, just take her away.

Dad, help!

(MEG SCREAMING)

-Dad!
-Have fun at the dance, Meg.

I hope she does.
That kid really deserves it.

No, I don't want to die! I want to live!

Peter, stop it.
He's never gonna learn like that.

Well, I guess it couldn't be worse than

What happened to Sal's Video?

We bought them out two weeks ago.
Welcome to Lackluster Video

50,000 stores nationwide.

Yeah, well, uh, you know, I used to come
into Sal's once or twice a week

to rent movies from his back room.

You know what I mean?
Room for adults only.

Catch my drift? The kind of movies
where there are X-rated pornos

and fully nude people
fornicate for the camera.

-Get my meaning?
-Oh, I'm sorry, but Lackluster Video

takes a strong moral stance
against pornography,

open-mindedness and non-Christians.

Oh, yeah?
Then why do you rent <i>Prince of Tides?</i>

Barbra Streisand is Jewish.

We edit some of our movies.

I think I'm in love with you, doctor.

No, Tom, you're wrong. You don't love me.
You love the idea of me.

Hi, I'm Tom Tucker.
Do me a favor and fill this bag

with a sampling of motion pictures

featuring women-on-women
or anything with an amputee.

Save your money, Tucker.
This place doesn't have porn.

They think it's immoral.

You know, that really grinds my gears.

Where exactly in the Bible does it say,

a man can't fire off some knuckle-children

in the privacy of his own neighbor's
living room, while his neighbor's at work

because I don't have a DVD player?

Well, I don't know where it says it
because the Bible is way too long to read.

Hey, that was quite a rant there.

You know, we're looking for an everyman
to rant about petty, nonsensical irritants

to replace our Spotlight
on the Middle East segment.

Hey! I'd be great at that!

I've been dying to get back on television
ever since I stopped hosting <i>Family Feud.</i>

How are you, Betsy? Welcome to the show.
You are a lovely young woman.

And let me just stick my hand up there
and feel that one.

-(GASPS)
-And that one.

We're looking for something
you shop for at the mall. Three seconds.

Come on, Stewie. Don't be afraid.

It's just water. It's not gonna bite.

Shut up! I know
it's not going to bite, stupid.

What a stupid thing to say.

You drown in it, you moron.
It doesn't have to bite you.

Hey, little guy. Take a look at Brad
over there. He's my star pupil.

-See how brave he is?
-(SCOFFS) He's not brave.

I'll tell you who was brave, Gandhi.

And the Americans
are always like, "hey, bitch."

And the Indian people,
we do not call our women in such a way.

MAN: Boo! You suck!

So, is it just pool water that turns you
into a sniveling girl, or is it all water?

Mom! Brian's asking me
if it's just pool water that turns me

into a sniveling girl
or if it's all water!

I heard that Olympic swimmers
shave all the hair off their head

and their private areas

to make them move faster.

I don't need some stupid gimmick.

Soon as I improve my technique,
I'll outswim Brad

as easily as I took care
of that other boy.

-Casper, go long!
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

-(CRASH)
-Ooh, sorry about that, man.

-Are you dead?
-Yeah, whatever.

I was gonna off myself on Tuesday anyway.

Hey, Peter, shouldn't you be getting ready
for your first news segment?

Yeah. I'm a little nervous,
though. I'm not sure what to talk about.

-You could talk about me. Okay, honey.
-I'll talk about you.

(LAUGHS) "Hey, I'm Meg.
I go to school. I wear glasses."

(ALL LAUGHING)

Spot on. Spot on.

In other news, after several grueling days
of frightening uncertainty,

I finally get my period.

Well, Diane, I'm sure you and your brother
must be devastated

by the loss of the two-headed offspring
that might have been.

We now go to Peter Griffin for
<i>You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?</i>

Thanks, Tom. You know
what really grinds my gears?

Nobody's come up with a new
priest and rabbi joke in, like, 30 years.

You know? I mean, okay.

A priest and a rabbi go into
the supermarket and, the priest

wants to buy a ham and the rabbi says,

"I can't eat it. It's forbidden.

Couldn't eat it. Not allowed."

Pigs are like superheroes to them.
Is it perfect? No.

But, I don't see you
coming up with anything.

And that, people,
is what grinds my gears. Tom.

Come on. You gonna be all day?

-STEWIE: I'm brushing my teeth.
-You only have, like, two of them.

-I mean, how long could... Oh, God!
-Oh, hey.

Uh... Wow.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
You doing a little hair removal there?

Oh, yeah.

You know, feel free
to say "no" to this, but...

would you shave my coin purse?

(LAUGHING)

Oh, no! No way, man!

(LAUGHS) Holy freaking God!

-Oh!
-(SCOFFS)

Don't have to be so uptight about it.

Okay. We're gonna have
our first fun little race.

When I blow this whistle,
I want all the parents

to throw their children into the pool.

If your child doesn't resurface
right away,

they're probably just trying
to get attention.

-Ready?
-Good luck, Stewie.

(IMITATING BRAD) "Good luck, Stewie."

That's you. That's what you sound like.

-COACH: (BLOWS WHISTLE)
-STEWIE: You're mine, Brad!

Damn! Damn! Damn!
Damn! Damn!

Ew! A band-aid.

-I've got ya, sweetie.
-(COUGHING)

-(CHATTERING)
-(GIGGLES)

(CHEERING) Good for you, Brad!

-Oh, isn't he adorable? He's much better
-than my kids.

So, you think you can make me look
like a fool, do you? You little bastard!

Well, guess again!

Oh, Brad! There's a piece of marzipan
over here for you.

-(BEEPING)
-What the deuce?

(BEEPING)

(GRUNTS)

-(BEEPING CONTINUES)
-(EXPLOSION)

(SCREAMS)

(CRASH)

Hell? Now, that's a bit much,
don't you think?

I mean, sure, I've spent my entire life
trying to kill my mother. But who hasn't?

You know, really, for hell
this isn't that bad.

-Hi, there. I'm Steve Allen.
-Oh, hello.

-All right. Let's do this.
-(SCREAMS)

-(GASPS) Ah!
-(PANTING)

I'm alive. I'm alive!

Oh! Stewie! My baby.

I thought I'd lost you. Oh!

I can't believe it. All these years
I thought I was living in hell,

but it gets so much worse.

This is a sign.
Well, from this day forward,

Stewart Gilligan Griffin
will be a good boy.

I don't understand.
I was only gonna ask him to fix my collar.

Huh! Well, I wonder
what they got on TV in hell.

(TV PLAYING) <i>There's a time for love</i>
<i>and a time for living</i>

Morning, Brian.

Beautiful day, isn't it? Kind of day
that makes you glad to be alive.

-I made fudge.
-Uh... Okay.

(CHAIR BEING DRAGGED)

What?

-What are you doing?
-Well, from the feel of it,

working through
quite a few years of stress.

The thing is, when I died,
I got a glimpse of where I was going

and, well, I did not like it one bit.

Wow. I am so uncomfortable right now.

So, I've resolved to change my ways,

because I know now who I want to be.

<i>I have confidence in sunshine</i>

<i>I have confidence in rain</i>

<i>I have confidence</i>
<i>that spring will come again</i>

<i>Besides which, you see</i>
<i>I have confidence in me</i>

There you are. Drink plenty of water.

-Hey, Brian.
-Yeah?

Thanks for listening.

Boy, that was more disturbing
than that cartoon I saw the other day.

Shh! Be very, very quiet.
I'm hunting rabbits.

Nyah, what's up, doc?

-(GUNSHOTS)
-(GROANING)

Oh, God! Oh, God!

(GROANING)

(BONES CRACK)

Shh! Quiet! Quiet! Your father's on.

You know what really
grinds my gears? This Lindsay Lohan.

Eh? Lindsay Lohan
with all those little outfits,

jumping around there
on stage half-naked

with your little outfits, you know.

You're up there jumping around
and I'm just sitting here with my beer.

So, you know, what am I supposed to do?

What do you want? Are we gonna go out?

Is that what you're trying...
Why are you... leaping around there,

throwing those things
all up in, over there in my face?

Huh? What do you want, Lindsay?
Tell me what you want!

Well, I'll tell you
what you want. You want nothing.

You want nothing. All right?

Because we all know that no woman anywhere
wants to have sex with anyone

and to titillate us
with any thoughts otherwise is just bogus.

Oh! He is so right-on.
Women are such teases.

That's why I went back to men.

Okay, mom. Thanks for that. See you later.

Go on.

Another thing that grinds my gears

is when I can't find
the droids I'm looking for.

STORM TROOPER: Yeah, me too.
What gives with that?

And that's what really grinds my gears.

-CAMERAMAN: <i>Clear.</i>
-Remove my microphone.

-Great job, Mr. Griffin.
-Great job, Peter.

ALL: Just terrific. Just fantastic.

Oh boy, this gig is even better
than that job I had

providing nighttime heat
for Lara Flynn Boyle.

Thanks so much, Peter.

-I was getting a little chilly.
-No sweat, Lara.

Hey, you have yourself a fine sleep.

-Hey, Lara.
-Yeah?

-Is Dylan McDermott nice in person?
-Yeah.

Good.

I feel ridiculous.

Well, I can't very well
fit you up here, can I?

-Where are we going?
-There is the most absolutely perfect

spider web in the bushes
by Cleveland's house,

-and you have just got to see it.
-Oh, for God's sake.

-Hey, Brian, Brian.
-What?

-Knock-knock.
-Oh, come on.

-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

Your friend, Stewie
and he's always gonna be there for you.

-Yes. Table for two.
-I'm sorry. We have a 45 minute wait.

Oh, isn't that too bad, honey?

Because I know waiting
in line at a restaurant

really grinds your gears.

Oh, my God! It's you!

I loved your rant about
how bread is square and baloney is round.

Oh, a table just opened up.

-Hey! We've been waiting.
-Shh! That's Michael Moore.

Mr. Tucker, we need this table.

But I've already ordered.

Oh, we have a private
booth set up for you. This way.

-Griffin.
-Diane.

I can't believe we got a table
at the hottest restaurant in town,

without a reservation.

We really are moving up in the world.

Yeah, but I'd love to see
what those private booths are like.

-(DOOR SLAMS)
-(SHATTERING)

This is totally unacceptable.

How long are you going to be?
I'm very hungry.

Hey, B! Rupert and I were just about to...

Excuse me. Did you just call me B?

Yes, B. Rupert and I
were just about to dine

on this mixture of Play-Doh and rug hair.

-Care to join?
-Oh, no, thanks.

I just thought
you might be interested in seeing this.

This is the most
absolutely perfectly destroyed spider web.

-(GASPS) Where's the spider?
-Knock-knock.

-Who's there?
-I ate him!

You bastard!
Who the hell do you think you are?

Ha! I knew it.
I knew you hadn't really changed.

Okay. So, I was faking being nice.
It's not the worst thing I've done.

-(CHEERING)
-(BAT HITTING BALL)

Ooh! Steve, it's coming
right at us. Grab it!

-I don't wanna get in the way.
-It's a foul ball.

What harm can it do?

Look, I really don't want to go to hell,
but I can't fight my nature.

I'm just a hateful person.
You're not hateful.

You just need to control
your anger like I do.

(SCOFFS) You mean by being sauced all day?

Wait a minute. Of course, that's it.

If I'm drunk, I'll be calm.
If I'm calm, I'll be nice.

If I'm nice, I won't go to hell.

Fix me a highball.
I'm going to get good and tight.

Look, you can't drink.
You're an infant, all right?

Besides, there are
better ways to solve your problems.

Oh, I suppose you're right.
Thanks, Brian. I was weak.

No problem.

Oh, my God! Do you know
what it's time for?

A sexy party!

-(1960'S POP MUSIC PLAYING)
-(ALL GIGGLING)

(GIGGLING)

-So, Brian, I... What?
-I didn't say anything.

I thought, you interrupted me.

-Don't interrupt me!
-Are you okay?

I'm as okay as your face.

(LAUGHING)

(WHEEZING) I'm sorry.

So, honey, what are you
going to rant about today?

-Could we get a little preview?
-Oh, I got a good one, Lois.

Parents who let their kids
do anything they want. I hate that.

You know? Like, when I'm in a restaurant
trying to enjoy my dinner

and little baby junior son-of-a-bitch
over there is screaming his head off.

Parents need to control their kids.

Hey! Everybody, look!
I'm gonna do something

that's gonna freak you out.

I'm gonna jump from this shelf
to my high chair.

I'm gonna jump. Are you are watching?
Are you?

Stewie, don't interrupt.
It grinds my gears when you do that.

(SCREAMS) Oh! He said it!

(LAUGHING)

You're gonna miss it.
You're gonna miss it.

STEWIE: (GROANS)

(LAUGHING)

Oh, dude! Did you see that?

Did you guys... Oh, man. Look at this...

Look at this gash. Look at this gash
right up the side of my leg.

Oh! I cut myself deep.

-Oh! It doesn't hurt though.
-Uh, all right. Time for your nap.

Don't worry, Lois.
I'll take him. Let's go.

God! What the hell?

Why are you drag... why are we in here?

It's rude to the other people.

-You're drunk.
-You're sexy.

Listen, you have to
stop this, all right? No more drinking.

-I'm sorry I even put it in your head.
-I don't know.

I don't even know what your problem is.
I've never felt better.

(VOMITS) Okay, now I've never felt better.

You know, Peter, there's gonna be
a lot of people watching tonight.

Better keep your balls
on the prize... eyeballs...

On the ball. Eyes on the ball.

(CLEARS THROAT) Take two.
You know, Peter, there's gonna be...

a lot of people watching tonight.

Better not screw up. Use take two.

Don't worry about me, Tom. I'll be fine.

We're on in three, two...

And now it's time for,
<i>You Know What Really Grinds my Gears?</i>

-with Peter Griffin.
-Thanks, Diane.

-You know what really grinds my gears?
-Hey!

Those x-ray specs
you used to buy out of the comics.

-Hey! Screw up!
-I save up forever to buy these things,

and when I finally get them yesterday,

I couldn't see the inside
of my son's belly.

Blah! Blah! Blah!
(BLATHERING)

See, I wanted to see
if he'd eaten the last Nilla wafer...

'cause I told him I wanted it.

-I tell ya, that really grinds my gears.
-Pay attention to me!

I'm trying to ruin you!

-(DOOR OPENS)
-You wanted to see me, sir?

You're fired, Tom. Turn in your press pass

What are we doing here?

So, you like being drunk?
Fine. I'm gonna get you so drunk

you'll never wanna drink again.

Come on.

(UPBEAT BLUES PLAYING)

Cold. It's so cold.

-Thanks, Horace.
-Hey, is he 18?

-Horace, the drinking age is 21.
-Oh.

Okay. Uh, uh...

to the black man.

Thanks for taking it all in stride.

(SINGING) <i>'Cause suicide is painless</i>

<i>It brings on many changes</i>

<i>and, I can take or leave it</i>

<i>If I please</i>

Was that good?

Oh, God. Thank you, man.

I can't believe you saved all those.

Lois... You think Lois will like these?

-You love Lois!
-Shut up!

You know what? Give me your keys.

-Oh, no. I'm fine.
-No. Give me your keys.

(STAMMERING) I'm driving.

-Give me your keys. You're too drunk.
-I'm okay.

Peter, Meg, Brian.
You're too drunk to drive.

(STAMMERING)

You're right. Here you go.

-(ENGINE STARTS)
-(TIRES SCREECH)

(SCREAMING)

Shh!

And that's it for sports.

Now let's go to Ollie Williams
with the adopt-a-pet of the week.

-Who wants this dog?
-Thanks, Ollie.

And now let's go to Peter Griffin
with, <i>You Know What Really Grinds My...</i>

Tom! What are you doing?
You don't work here anymore.

Well, Diane, I have an exclusive story

and I can't figure out
how to check my e-mail from home.

OLLIE: <i>Did you check your TCP/IP settings?</i>
-Yes, I did, Ollie.

-OLLIE: <i>Enable cookies?</i>
-Yes, Ollie.

-OLLIE: <i>You want this dog?</i>
-No, thank you, Ollie. Roll tape.

TOM: <i>This was the scene</i>
<i>at the Drunken Clam last night,</i>

<i>as a car driven by an intoxicated infant</i>

<i>caused thousands of</i>
<i>dollars-worth of damage.</i>

Put this on my tab.

It was like all slowed down.

You know? And I was,
like, "whoa!" But I couldn't stop it.

And who is the father
of the child in that car?

Ooh! Tom! I know this.

Tom, over here. Tom! Ooh!

The man you all respect so much.
Your beloved Peter Griffin.

Good thing he didn't call on me.
I was gonna say Grant Goodeve.

Thanks, Tom. And now, neglectful father
and Quahog's newest social pariah,

Peter Griffin, with another
segment of Grind my Gears.

-Peter.
-Thank you, Diane.

You know what really grinds my gears?
People in the 19th century.

Why don't they get
with the freaking program?

It's called an automobile,
folks. It's much faster than a horse.

Oh. Well, it appears I've been fired.

Well, as long as I'm no longer
working here, let me tell you something.

You know what really
grinds my gears? You, America.

(BLEEP) you! Diane.

Hey, Tom. Catch!

(INSPIRATIONAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Did you miss daddy?
Did you miss daddy?

Oh, no. It's all right.
It's... Oh, you're shaking.

-Go away.
-Huh. Little hung over?

I am never going to drink again ever.

Well, I hope you learned something
from all this.

I most certainly did, Brian.

It seems I'm still finding myself.

But, for the moment,
I've just got to accept the fact

that I'm an angry boy who'll occasionally
try to burn down a house

or toss a poison dart at his mother.

After all, I can't let one near-death
experience change my whole life, can I?

I'm glad you finally figured that out.

-You gonna be okay?
-Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

I just wish I could remember
where I was last night.

And who the hell RM is.

Oh, got to play this one right, Roger.

Can't seem desperate.
Wait three days, that's the rule.

Oh, God! I want to talk to him now!

(DIALING)

(RINGING)

Damn!

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

Wow, this must be one of them
new plasma TVs.

Would you like something to drink?

I'll have water, please.

I'll have water, too, but with lemon.

I'll have a Sam Adams.

It's 9:30 in the morning.

And don't you have an outstanding DUI?

Yeah, but I got to get the taste of weed

and hooker spit out of my mouth.

I'll have a Sam Adams, too.

Samuel Adams. Always a good decision.

Okay, now, if I get a fax,

can I stay on-line and still receive
the fax without a dedicated line?

Yeah, you can put a piece of paper in here
and make, like, a phone call,

and your friend will get another

piece of paper with the same picture.

Can I possibly speak to someone

who didn't come to this country
on a floating door?

Can I help you?

Yes. We're here to replace our VCR.

Yeah, don't try any

Like that guy who convinced me
to buy that pet tyrannosaurus.

Okay, Patches, now fetch!

(ROARING)

(MAN SCREAMING)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Drop it!

Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!

Ew! It's got spit all over it.

A VCR? Let me show you something.

It's called TiVo.

It always records what you're watching,

so you can re-watch anything you missed.

Oh! Sounds fancy. How does it work?

I'll tell you how it works.
Easy as pie is how it works.

(BEEPING)

I'll tell you how it works.
Easy as pie is how it works.

Should I ring it up? Hold on, hold on.

I think we should discuss it first.

(BEEPING)

Some kind of palsy.

Anyway, that's how I saved Christmas.

Yeah, go ahead and bag this thing for us.

Sweet, Quagmire! You got a Winnebago.

You mean a wanna-bang-o!
(CHUCKLES)

(CHUCKLES) Oh, how clever.

Yeah, I'm gonna take her
across the country

and nail a different broad in every state.

Also gonna go to Vegas.

We went to Vegas once. Remember, Lois?

We saw the Jew Man Group?

Dad, what are you doing?

I'm fast-forwarding
through these pesky TV shows,

so I can get to the commercials.

Hi. I'm Wilford Brimley,
and I have diabetes.

It hurts me to pee, and it causes me
to be short with my family.

I can't sleep at night.

The other day, I stubbed my toe
and took it out on the dog.

And two weeks ago, I ran out of

vanilla ice-cream and struck my wife.

And then I find out
my wife's been dead for six years.

Who the hell did I hit?

(NARRATOR)

Lunch is ready! Come and get it!

Hey, what do you think it is,
boogers on a biscuit?

(LAUGHING)
That's probably what it is, yes.

We now go live
to the streets of San Francisco

with Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.

Diane, is she Chinese or Japanese?

She's Japanese, Tom.

Wow! I know a Japanese woman.

Tom, I'm standing here

amidst the heated debate
over a recent petition

to change the name of the city

from San Francisco
to something a little less gay.

Excuse me, sir, what would you
like to rename San Francisco?

Well, given the wonderful shoe shopping,

I would cast my vote for "Heaven."

-Who the hell was that?
-What?

I say, press the button, make it stop.

Oh, my God. He looks just like me.

You know what? He does.

Almost looks like he could be your father.

(GASPS) He could be my father!

My real father! I knew it!

Lois must have mated
with this poor fellow.

I've got to get out to California.

I daresay I'd fit right in
with the kids from <i>90210.</i>

Even the older-looking one.

Boy, that test sure
is gonna be hard tomorrow.

You said it, Donna.

Hey, Andrea, can you help me study?

-What?
-I said, "Can you help me study?"

Dylan, I fixed your socks!

Hey, Andrea,
are we still going to the concert?

This used to be all orange groves,
far as the eye could see!

Okay, so I'll pick you up at 7:00.

Barbara Stanwyck and I
used to take the trolley!

You will be missed.

There we are. What are you doing?

None of your beeswax, Ramona.

But if you must know,
I need a plane ticket to San Francisco.

Good luck.
Plane tickets are about 450 bucks.

400...
Brian, hit me in the mouth.

What? Why?

I hear this tooth fairy gives you

money for your teeth. Have at it.

Uh, okay.

No, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't, stop, stop!

-Why did you stop? I said hit me.
-You flinched.

Well, of course I flinched.
You were going to hit me.

Make up your mind.
What do you want me to do?

Hit me. No! No, no, don't, don't!

I'm sorry.
Look, I know I'm being hard to read.

Hey, you there. Buy this yellow drink.

Hey, preggo. Preggo!

Hey, hey, I'm talking to you, tubby!

Oh, don't you ignore me.

Pardon me, sir. Sir? Sir?

Oh, the hell with this.

(GROANING)

So, we had to do it the hard way, hmm?

Six bucks?

Nice-looking wife you've got.

Maybe I'll look her up
while you're in the hospital.

Don't forget your lemonade.

Oh, there you are. I thought you should...

-What are you doing?
-Paying bills.

What bills? You have bills?

Well, there's cable and...

Peter pays for the cable.

(STAMMERING) It's at this girl's house.
Do you want something?

Yes, I'm still short for my trip.

I've only got $200.

I suggest you pony up
the difference immediately,

or I'll e-mail the contents
of your hard drive to the FBI.

What are you talking about?
There's nothing on there.

Stewie, why is it so hard
to accept that Peter's your real father?

Because he's an idiot.

Do you remember that time
he went to the <i>Today Show?</i>

Coming up on <i>Today,</i>
Tom Cruise has a new movie.

-We're gonna be talking to him.
-Katie!

and more coming up in the next hour.

Oh, well, never mind.

Care to join me, Lois?

Peter, how am I supposed to...

Oh, sorry, sorry. Where are my manners?

Oh, what a gentleman!

PETER: There you go!

- (EXCLAIMS) Oh, God! Oh, you okay?
- You all right, honey?

Yeah, I'm all right.

Oh, this is nice.

Mom, Meg says Omar Sharif is dead,

but I think
she's thinking of Anthony Quinn.

Chris, your father and I are in the tub.

And, Meg,
you are thinking of Anthony Quinn.

Now, get out!

Peter, this is ridiculous.

We have no privacy here.

We got to get those
kids out of the house once in a while.

I mean, shouldn't they be dating?

That doesn't solve the problem, Lois.

If they start dating, I mean,
their rooms are right next to each other,

they'll start having sex,
we'll never get them out of the house...

No, no. You idiot,

I'm talking about them
dating other people.

Look, I'm gonna
start spending some time with Chris,

and I'll show him how to attract a woman.

Yeah. And I'll spend some time with Meg.

I've spent lots of time with her,

like when we went on our last crusade
to find the Holy Grail.

Choose wisely.

I choose this one.

How did you know?

Well, I kind of figured the coffee mug
that says "Jesus." I mean...

Oh, right, right. Yeah.

Pretty obvious.

Great. Let's kiss on it.

Come here, you!

(GRUNTING)

Oh, you bleeding? Yeah, you're bleeding.

Don't tell me you're
going to California on that.

Bicycling is hard,
but it has its benefits.

Did you know Lance Armstrong
is dating Sheryl Crow?

You know, it really
speaks to her character

that she can get
past the whole he-had-cancer-thing

and still find him sexually attractive.

Really speaks to her character.

I respect that.

Hey, Brian, what do you think of my sign?

Quagmire's cross-country tour.

Uh, isn't there an "o" in country?

Nope.

Look out, California, here I come!

(GIGGLING)

(GASPS) California!

What are you doing?

Well, you heard Captain Syphilis.

We're going to California.

Come on, you can't go alone with Quagmire.

Look, I'll tell you what,

if you're serious about this
I'll go with you.

Although I should probably ask
Peter and Lois if it's okay.

Oh, they won't even know we're gone.

(IN ELECTRONIC VOICE)
Damn you, vile woman.

Blast. What the deuce?

I am a tool.

Stewie is much better
than me at everything

I have no friends.

Glad you guys are joining me.

see <i>Three Men and a Baby?</i>

-BRIAN: Yeah.
-STEWIE: Did you know there's a ghost

in there behind the window?

BRIAN: That's an urban legend.
It's just a piece of cardboard.

STEWIE: No, it's a ghost, I heard.

BRIAN: You heard from who?

STEWIE: From, uh, Lois.

-BRIAN: Yeah, right.
-STEWIE: Cleveland?

-BRIAN: No. No.
-STEWIE: Death?

-STEWIE: Greased-up deaf guy?
-BRIAN: He said that?

Your knight was at king's rook six.

No, my bishop was at king's rook six.

My knight was at queen five.

No, no, no. It was...

Yes, yes, yes.

In your dreams your knight was at...

I was...

I saw... Yeah, yeah...

Look at that. Look at that.

Now your knight is at refrigerator five.

You know, San Francisco is a big place.

Have you thought about
how you're gonna find this guy?

Simple, Brian. Look at this.

My God, this poor fellow
had relations with Lois.

That's more disgusting
than my cousin Quark Griffin.

I'm watching your every move, Quark,

so don't think
you can get away with any law-breaking.

-Yeah, yeah. Whatever, man.
-I mean it.

You'll have me to deal with.

Oh, I'm really scared.

I could morph
into a giant python and eat you alive.

Hey, here's an idea.

Why don't you morph into a guy

with something interesting to talk about?

Kids, your mother and I have decided

that we're going to help you two
get out in the dating world.

That's right.

Chris, I'm gonna show you how to be

an affable, desirable young man

who doesn't smell
like the inside of a wool hat.

Why you got to break balls?

And, Meg, when I get through with you,

you're gonna be
beating guys off with both hands.

This is gonna be so fun.

Hey, zip it.

Rule number one,
no speaky until the man speaky to you.

I say, are we moving on yet?

Just hang out, little guy.

I'll see you in a while.

Oh, very well.

I suppose I'll go
pump the chemical toilet.

Apparently you're about to do the same.

What the hell is taking him so long?

I'm missing precious time with my father.

Which one of these is the horn?

That's not it. That's not it either.

Do something.

I'm afraid to press anything else.

Okay, Meg, lesson one
for attracting a man.

I want you to shave my back.

Ew! Why would I want to do that?

Trust me, Meg, shave a man's back for him
and he'll purr like a walrus.

(PURRING)

All right, Chris, now that we've
talked about kissing and cuddling,

it's time to practice eating out

at a fancy restaurant.

All right, that's it.

Listen, you pervert,
what the devil is taking so long...

Good Lord!

Oh, Stewie, thank God.

That cleaning lady cleaned me out.

She took all my money.

Hey, do me a favor.
Grab those keys over there, will you?

Oh, what, these keys?

Hmm? These keys here,
these the ones you want, hmm?

These ones right here? Up yours!

What the hell are you doing?
Where's Quagmire?

He said to go on without him.

We're stealing the Winnebago, aren't we?

Oh, you can read me like a book, Brian.

Breaker, breaker, Sidewinder,
this is Party Pooper.

Don't want to be a ratchet-jaw,

but it looks like we've got a seat cover

<i>loaded up and trucking</i>

<i>We're gonna do</i>
<i>what they say can't be done</i>

Dad, why are we just sitting here?

Just give me a minute, Meg.

What am I supposed to be learning
about dating from...

(SIGHS)

Oh, my God, Dad, you farted!

That is so nasty!

No, no, no, Meg.

Meg, this is crucial, all right?

The sexiest thing a woman can do

for a man is learn to love his gas.

Love the gas, Meg, love it!

(FARTS)

(GROANING) No, no, no, Meg, no, no.

This is why we're here.

This is why we're here.

(SOFTLY) This is why we're here.

Chris, you've got to learn
how to talk to girls.

So, I'll ask you again,

what are the names of the women
on <i>Sex and the City?</i>

Uh...

Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and...

Uh...

Scrappy-Doo?

Hit him, Endo.

(SCREAMING)

Bosley? Tootie? Sheena Easton?

(SCREAMING)

(RATTLING)

-Are you all right?
-(YELLING) Never better!

I got some pep pills
from a trucker at the last stop.

Keeps me awake.

You took pills?

West coast turn-arounds.

Trucker said to only take one,
but I took all of them.

Look, maybe you should slow down.

Why? We're making good time.

We're not even on the road. Huh?

I said we're not even on the road.

Don't need to be. Compass says west.

That's where we're headed.

Stewie, we're in the middle of the desert.

I know.

Imagine the nads
on those guys who did this in a wagon?

Pioneers, Brian. We share their spirit.

Manifest destiny.

All right, that's it, give me the wheel.

Go to hell!

(SNORING)

This is horrible. I'm so thirsty.

Oh, my God, Brian, do you see what I see?

BRIAN: A Dr Pepper machine?

Yes. Oh, I can taste it now.

(BOTH LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

Damn it. It was a mirage.

An RC Cola machine.

Oh, that's it, I give up!

What do you mean?

I never should have attempted this

in the first place. It was stupid.

Hey, hey, come on now.

You've come this far, haven't you?

It's no use!

Even if my real father is out there,

he probably doesn't want to see me.

(SOBBING)

Stewie, you've got
to see this through to the end.

Look, maybe this guy is your real father,

maybe not, but if you don't find out,

you're gonna spend
the rest of your life wondering.

Maybe you're right.

Come on, I'll stick by you the whole way.

Just like I did
when we were Siamese twins.

Hey, hey, look at that woman, Brian.

She has no business in shorts.

Hey! Hey, you have no business in shorts!

Oh, tortillas.
Let's do soft tacos tonight.

Well, we've taught you well, children.

It's in God's hands now.

Now go to the mall
and find yourselves some dates.

Chris, find a girl who smokes.

Remember, if she smokes, she pokes.

Bye, kids.

Do you think they're ready, Peter?

I don't care.

All I care about
is that we have our alone time.

Me, too.

Are we terrible people?

No, no. We're not terrible people, Lois.

Horses are terrible people.

(CHOKING)

Murder! Murder!

All right, let's split up
and try to find him.

Hey, yeah, I just checked in.

Yeah, I might lose you.

I just got in the elevator.

Yeah, I'm gonna grab a shower.

Did you guys eat yet?

No, no. No, I'll just take a cab.

You got your car?

Do you want to pick me up?

Do you want...

Do you want to pick me up?

Do you want to pick me up?

Do you want to pick me up?

I feel like I've searched

I suppose this means I'll never find

the answer to who I really am.

Oh, well, see you gents later.

Of course.

(GASPS)

My God!

Oh, dear.

Oh, dear, oh, dear. This is not good.

This is very bad, very bad.

Oh, Daddy, I knew I'd find you!

I knew Peter couldn't be my real father.

No, no, no, you've got
it all wrong, Stewie.

Stewie? How do you know my name?

Because I'm not your father.

I'm you.

KIEFER SUTHERLAND:
<i>Previously on</i> Family Guy.

Maybe this summer
he should take swim lessons.

Would you like that, Stewie?

(SCREAMING)

(GASPS)

I'm alive. I'm alive!

Who the hell was that?

Well, given the wonderful shoe shopping,

I would cast my vote for "Heaven."

Oh, Daddy, I knew I'd find you.

I'm not your father. I'm you.

Oh, God,
I have so many questions about the future.

Is all food in pill form?

Do they have flying cars?

Did they ever find
a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?

I can't answer those questions.

I'm not even supposed to be talking to you

It's a violation
of the terms of my vacation.

Vacation?

Yes, you see, in the future,

people take vacations not to destinations,
but to periods of time.

In fact, just last summer
I went back to visit Jesus Christ.

Turns out his abilities
might have been exaggerated a bit.

(SINGING SHOW TUNE)

Look, I've already said enough.

I really should be getting back.

You can't just leave me.
I must know my future.

Sorry, it's against the rules.

Goodbye, Stewie.

Surprise!

Oh, this is just great.

I can't believe it. This is the future.

Wait a minute. Everything looks the same.

Well, of course, it's only been 30 years.

But, I say, where are the monuments to me?

Where are my legions of followers?

I thought I'd be
absolute ruler of the world by now.

Far away from that house full of idiots.

(SIGHS)

Sorry, Stewie, I abandoned
my quest for world domination long ago.

Well, am I at least
a city councilman or something?

Sorry.

Oh, this is nothing like I imagined.

I thought the future would be different,

with jet packs, eco-domes, and TV

they can beam right into your head.

Uh, give me <i>Mork & Mindy.</i>

(ELECTRONIC HUMMING)

(LAUGHING)
That's not how you sit in a chair.

Now I'm late
to Sunday dinner with the family,

so you'll have to wait in the car
until I can send you back.

Wait in the car? I shall do no such thing.

Oh, hey,
did they ever unfreeze Walt Disney?

Unfortunately.

Welcome back, Mr. Disney.

Are the Jews gone yet?

Uh, no.

Put me back in.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, Stu, my big boy!

Hello, mother.

She's still alive?

What the hell, man?

I hope you don't mind,
but I brought a guest.

This is, uh, Pablo, a child from Nicaragua
that I've been sponsoring.

My, how wonderful.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Yes. Is that where you got
that leather handbag?

Oh, I'm sorry, that's your face!

(LAUGHING) Oh, got you!

30 years later, I still freaking got you!

Oh, God.

Oh, I feel as invincible as Superman.

Hey, there, Wonder Woman.
Flying your invisible plane, I see.

Uh...

Boy, this is awkward. I'm...

I'm actually in the lavatory
of the invisible plane.

Oh, you mean right now you're...

Yeah.

(FLUSHING)

So I couldn't help
but notice you didn't wash your hands

in the invisible sink.

Hi, everybody. Sorry we're late.

Stop (BLEEP) apologizing.

You sound like a (BLEEP) woman.

Oh, I suppose one of you has to.

Oh, what a nice blouse, Vanessa.

Chris' wife. Oh, thanks.

I'm not sure my tiny brain
could've put that one together.

Hi, Vanessa. Well, don't you look nice?

Oh, no, I broke my hip!

You need some help, Dad?

No, I'm good.

Oh, are these the pictures
from your trip to Sonoma?

Oh, my God.

Oh, look how beautiful the countryside is.

Oh, I would love to
get a house out there if I had the money.

Knock, knock.

Oh, hi, Ron.

Who's that fellow? He looks so familiar.

It's Meg.
She had a sex change right after college.

Wow! She went to college?

I can't stay too late.

I gotta go shop for a razor.

You know, for my face,
where I grow my beard.

Okay, we get it, Ron. You're a guy.

Well, there he is.

Oh, this is fantastic!

That's not really appropriate, Stewie.

Oh, of course it is. I loathed
that know-it-all, flea-bitten mutt.

No, no, it's just
that the meaning of that word has changed

ever since President Douchebag.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Thank you. I just received a call
from my worthy opponent,

Senator Daterape.

(CROWD BOOING)

No, no, he ran a good campaign,

but the people of America have spoken,

and they're saying
they want four more years of Douchebag.

CROWD: Douchebag! Douchebag! Douchebag!

That is some (BLEEP)
good dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

Thank you. Excuse me.

I'm gonna go help Peter with the dishes.

Ron, Stu, I need your help.

I need you two to tell
those parents of yours

they're moving into a retirement home,

'cause Mr. Empty Sack
over here won't do it.

Stu, you don't want Mom and Dad

to go to a retirement home, do you?

Well, it's...

Uh...

(IMITATING LOIS)
Stu, could you help me with the dishes?

Oh, be right there, Mother.

Well, actually, Vanessa, I'd...

(IMITATING LOIS)
Oh, Stu, I need your help.

There are dishes everywhere.

Oh, sorry, must go.

Well, I can't do it to them.

They're my parents.

Don't you ever want
to inherit this house, you fat (BLEEP)?

Or am I the only one
who has any desire to move out

from under the (BLEEP) power lines?

What's that? Oh, it's cancer!

Can we please not do this
in front of Pablo?

That kid's from Guam.

Probably only speaks
Spanish or some (BLEEP).

Let me tell you something, Nessa.

A bullet sounds the same in every language

So stick a (BLEEP) sock in it, you cow!

Well, welcome to Chez Stu.

Dear God, this is where I live?

All alone in a filthy hovel?

Well, I wouldn't exactly say alone.

Let me introduce my roommate.

He's sometimes late on the rent

and never shy about sharing the gas bill,

if you know what I mean.

Did you just make a fart joke?

Hey, Stu, got big plans for tonight?

Sure do, Rupert.

I'm finally going to organize
my photo albums.

Yeah, right.

I say, what happened to his leg?

Oh, wait, now I remember.

You are really
going to sit there with a straight face

and tell me a flat tax
doesn't favor the wealthy?

Not one bit.

And it saves millions of man-hours

that the complexity
of the current tax code wastes,

which you would realize
if you weren't retarded.

Hey, give him back!

Stop that! What are you doing?

Give me back his leg!

Oh, you'll get it back.

And this is my bulletin board
where I put all my favorite comic strips.

See? Look, here's the Lockhorns.

See, Mrs. Lockhorn is saying,
"We're never going to another yard sale,"

because Mr. Lockhorn
has clearly purchased a tuba.

(CHUCKLES) And from
the look on her face,

I'd say he's not
playing it very well at all.

(LAUGHING)

You get it?

You got these from <i>Parade</i> magazine?

You read <i>Parade</i> magazine?

(GROANS)

Hey, Stu. It's Monday,
which can only mean one thing,

-Go-Gurt day!
-Go-Gurt day!

Oh, Fran, this is Pablo, from Nicaragua.

Pablo, this is Fran. She is hilarious.

Hi, Pablo.

Just kidding.

(LAUGHING) I told you. She's so twisted.

Well, I'd better get back to my department

before Genghis,
the day manager, makes his rounds.

Genghis, the day manager?

Is that from something
or did you just make that up?

I just made it up.

(LAUGHING)

All day long.

Well, I guess it's not all bad.

What do you mean?

Don't be coy, you dirty horndog.

You're nailing Fran.

Tell me, how many times have we gotten

into those Lane Bryant stretch pants?

What? Never!

Damn right never...

What do you mean, never?

(SIGHS) Stewie, I've never
slept with any woman.

I've never had sex.

All right, that's it!

I could handle the crappy apartment
and the pedestrian job,

but now you're telling me

I'm a 35-year-old,
<i>Parade-</i> magazine-reading virgin.

Well, you, sir, are pathetic!

So forget about
sending me back, because I'm not leaving

until we do a complete overhaul

on this sad thing you call our life!

Can I still read <i>Parade?</i>

No, you cannot still read <i>Parade!</i>

So, what do you think, mmm?

My word,
I've got to hand it to you, Stewie,

it really is an improvement.

And you haven't even seen the best part.

Stress-release candles
for those extra-tough days at the office.

Oh, you don't know the half of it.

On Tuesdays I work Returns.

Yeah, I bought this boom box here,

and it's got this high-pitched whine.

Well, let's have a look.

(BABY CRYING)

(LAUGHING) It's yours now, sucker!

All right, now that
you've got a swinging pad,

it's time to
bring Fran back here and, you know.

What?

Well, I have no idea. I thought you knew.

No, I have no idea.

Well, come on, man. You're the adult here.

I was counting on you to
know the mechanics because...

Well, let's face it, as a baby,

all I've got to go on
is beer commercial innuendo

and that myth about where babies come from

Oh, my God, the stork!

Where's my baby?

(IN DEEP VOICE) Sweetie, you and me
are gonna make the baby.

(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING)

Kids, what are you doing here?

Mom, Dad, Vanessa wants us
to put you guys in a retirement home,

but I think it's ridiculous.

A retirement home?

Now, Vanessa says it's not that bad, Mom.

She says they have people there
who will wipe your bottom.

You gotta be yanking me! That is sweet!

Yeah, that doesn't
sound ridiculous at all, Meg.

My name is Ron.

Oh, I wish Brian were here.

He'd never let you put us in a home.

Oh, but at least he's
in a better place now.

Wow, look at me.

Hanging out,
drinking with Ernest Hemingway,

Van Gogh, and Kurt Cobain.

Still, it feels Like we all got here

a little earlier than we should have.

Yeah, well, I finally collapsed

under the weight of my own genius

and shot myself.

I could not reconcile my passion

with the way people around me were living,

so I shot myself.

I hated the thought of my music

becoming part
of some bland, corporate mechanism,

so I shot myself.

Yeah, I got into the garbage
and ate some chocolate.

-My word!
-Yes, evidently the razor wasn't invented

till sometime in the late '80s.

Okay, then, let's begin.

And here we go. And watch my hand.

And one, two, three,
and in and out, and in and out.

(SINGING) <i>I am the monarch of the sea</i>
<i>The ruler of the Queen's Navy</i>

<i>Whose praise Great</i><i>Britain</i>
<i>loudly chants</i>

<i>And we are his sisters</i>
<i>and his cousins and his aunts</i>

Good, good. You've got the rhythm.

Now, let's try it with the Swiss cheese
and take it from the top.

I really enjoyed the movie tonight
and I'm not tired at all.

Oh, yeah, good, good.

I enjoyed the movie, too.

Oh, hey, I hear they're
extending our store hours until 9:30.

Oh, that's... That's great.

-Let's have sex!
-What?

Definitely, I'll be right back.

What the hell is
wrong with you? I can't do this!

I can't go through with this.

Why? Why the hell not?

I'm too nervous.

FRAN: I'm getting my diaphragm!

See, I don't even know what that is.

-Get in there! Get in there right now.
-I can't.

-Get in!
-No, no, no.

Listen to me. You listen to me,
Stewart Griffin

You march in there right now and

"insert your penis into her vagina." Go!

I'm sorry. That's...

That's never happened to me before.

Which part? The eight seconds of sex
or the 40 minutes of crying?

Uh, I guess both.

Do I... Do I give you money or something?

Yeah, I'm gonna go.

Eight seconds! That's twice as good
as you did in rehearsal.

Stu, I heard from Juan
in Car Stereo Installation

about what you did to Fran last night.

You know, intra-office sex is prohibited,

regardless of how
hilariously brief and unsatisfying it was.

-You're fired.
-(GASPS)

Oh, cheer up!
You didn't need that crappy job anyway.

You are not allowed to speak.

You have ruined everything.

Oh, nice, I donate my time
trying to fix your pathetic life

and this is the thanks I get?

Good Lord! My apartment!

Looks like the cause of the fire

were these stress-release candles, sir.

Huh. Irony!

LOIS: I don't know, Peter.

This place is pretty depressing.

What are you talking about?
It's just like old times.

Hey, Cleveland.

(EXTREMELY SLOWLY) Hello, Peter.

Hey, Joe,
how are things since the operation?

Oh, great, Peter.

(CHUCKLES)

Who would've guessed
I'd be one of the few not in a wheelchair.

I sure do miss Bonnie, though.

Well, it's amazing
they were able to give you her legs.

Who wears short shorts?
I wear short shorts!

Hey, Glenn. How's the arthritis?

Not bad.

Of course, since you walked in,
I'm feeling a little stiff.

Giggity Gi... Oh, I just pooped a little.

(VERY SLOWLY) Oh, that's nasty.

Um...

Hey, you know what I do
when I'm feeling down?

I play the Glad Game.

I think about all the things
that make me glad. Let's try it, shall we?

Um...

Pinwheels.

A big wedge of cake from the fair.

A doodad to wear in your hat.

All right, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

(SIGHS) No, it's my fault.

My whole life's been a mess
ever since that near-death experience.

I mean, nothing goes right...

Wait, wait, wait.

Near-death experience?

At the community pool?

But... But that was nothing.

Well, that's what I thought at first.

But around the time of my 20th birthday,
I started having nightmares.

And then my therapist
said I'd been suppressing

some very complex emotions

that may well have caused me
to take fewer risks.

Well, then, it seems
there's only one thing to do.

I must return to the past
to ensure that I never have the close call

with that lifeguard tower
in the first place.

Oh, I just thought
of another one for the Glad Game.

The first scissor cut
into a fresh piece of construction paper.

Oh, yeah.

All right, here's what we do.

You buy me
one of those time-travel watches,

and I'll go back to my own time

and stop that near-death experience.

I can't afford one.

I don't have a job, thanks to you.

I say, how hard is it to get a new job?

Even I had that job at the airport.

Jonny Quest. Okay, welcome aboard.

Dr. Benton Quest.

All right, have a good flight.

Hadji!

Hmm. Uh...

Listen, you've been randomly selected
for additional screening.

But you didn't even type anything in.

Look, if it were up to me,
you'd be right there on that flight.

But I'm gonna need you to take off
your shoes and that lovely hat.

Sim, sim, salabim!

Yeah, I'd cut back on that.

We'll have to
borrow the money from Mommy and Daddy.

(SCREAMS) Never call them that again!

It's Lois and the Fat Man, do you hear me?

Yes, yes!

Smells like Head & Shoulders,
but you don't have dandruff.

Exactly!

Ah!

Oh, hey, you two. What brings you here?

Lois, Pablo here needs your help.

Stu, can we drop the whole Pablo thing?

Do you think
I don't remember my own little Stewie?

You clever, clever shrew.

Stu, you could get in
a lot of trouble for this.

You need to take him back to his own time.

Well, that's why we're here.

-I need a loan.
-Done.

This is a secret account
Peter can't access.

I never could trust him with money.

Like the time he spent Meg's college money

on that medieval catapult.

(PETER LAUGHING)

Excellent, these dominos are set up
exactly as I want them,

right next to the good china.

Now, I'll just place
this priceless Faberge egg

in the center, right next to
my newborn hemophiliac baby.

(THUD)

-Hey, those yours?
-Yes.

Oh. Those are all really nice things.

Thank you!

You hear that, Evan?

We were complimented.

Well, I suppose this is it.

Wow!

You know, it just hit me
that if you are successful

in preventing our near-death experience,

it'll turn me into
an entirely different Stu.

Then you know what you should do?

Since the timeline is gonna change anyway,

you should get really fat.

Like, just go buy
a whole pint of ice cream

and shovel down the whole thing.

I mean, just really pig out.

Ooh, that's brilliant.

Hey, and if the city
thinks I'm paying this parking ticket,

they are dreaming.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

No, I'm not really gonna do it.
You know, just in case.

Goodbye, Stewie.

So long, Stu.

Damn! I overshot it.

1974, University of Denver.

I say, Condoleezza Rice goes here.

Damn, I am never gonna
let the Man get me down, crazy crackers!

Black Panthers, stand tall!

Blast! This isn't the pool either.

But at least I've arrived
on the correct date.

But there are only 30 minutes
before the tower falls.

Damn, I've gotta get to that swim meet.

Hi, Stewie Griffin.

Stewie Griffin, hi, how are you?

Smells good. Dinner's ready.

(PANTING)

Probably shouldn't
have milked that landing.

Don't press that,

future 35-year-old virgin.

Fran! Fran!

Fran...

What the devil?

Yes, I did it!

I stopped the tower from falling!

-Who are you?
-I'm you from the future.

From the future?

My word. Did they ever find
a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?

Oh, that's so funny.
I asked that very same question

and never got an answer.

Well, then, you're as
disposable as she is!

Oh, come on, my little champion.

Oh, my God, at least have the decency
to carry me, you lazy skank.

Of course, it is comfortable.

(SNORING)

Hey, thanks again
for explaining football to me, mister.

I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

You can call me Ron.

Ron, huh?

You know,
I've always really liked that name.

Ron.

-Help us! Oh, my God!

(PANTING) Hey, don't worry. I'm here.

-Robin? They sent you?
-Yeah.

Everyone else was busy, so they sent me.

What the hell are you gonna do?
You don't have any superpowers.

Uh, I got a cell phone.

Oh, no bars.

-All right, who's next for a flu shot?
-Oh, that's me. I'm Peter Griffin.

Mr. Griffin,
these flu shots are in short supply.

We need to save them for the elderly.
Like these folks here.

Oh. Okay.

Well, I guess
I'll be heading out then and...

(EXCLAIMS)

Oh, look at that.

Oh, well, since it's already in there,

you might as well push down
on the old plunger there.

You're a monster.

You know what was a monster?
<i>Frampton Comes Alive,</i> 1976.

Is there anyone you knew
who didn't have that record?

I don't think so. Bam!
All right, have a good winter.

(SIGHS) Very well, Mr. Griffin,
you got your flu shot.

Now, if you'll just sign here.

-Well, this is odd.
-What?

Well, you're 42 years old and it says here
you've never had a prostate exam.

No, but I've had other exams.
Like that one in college.

Damn it, this is too hard!

Here's what I think of your test,
Mr. Teacher.

You just stood up to me. Congratulations.
That was the test.

(GASPS)

<i>Heaven helps the man</i>
<i>who fights his fear</i>

Yeah!

Okay, heart sounds good.

All right, Mr. Griffin,

I'm just going to need you
to drop your pants,

and we'll check your prostate.

Uh, what?

Drop your pants, turn around,
and lean forward.

Um, okay.

So, how's this work,
you just feel my pulse or...

(SCREAMING)

(PANTING)

-What the hell was that?
-Mr. Griffin, that's a prostate exam.

-Shut up! You had your finger in my ass!
-That's how a prostate exam is performed.

-Now, if you'll just let me...
-Get away from me!

(BAWLING)

(BAWLING CONTINUES)

Ugh. Get a tan.

Peter, my God, you look terrible.
What happened?

I was raped.

(CHUCKLING)

-What?
-Dr. Hartman violated me.

He took my innocence.

(LAUGHING) What?

(WHISPERING)

Peter, that's a prostate exam.

It's an important part
of a physical for men your age.

You sound just like him!

(SOBBING)

(BLEEP) idiot.

Hey, Peter, buddy. How about some TV, huh?

-Peter...
-(WINCES)

(SIGHS) I'm trying to be supportive,

but after all,
it was just a prostate exam.

You weren't there, Lois.
You weren't there.

Who's that? Who are you? Where's Peter?
Where is he?

You're a whore.
Wear your whore makeup, you whore.

-CHRIS: Is somebody in there?
<i>-Ocupado.</i>

Filthy whore.

You're somebody's father,
you filthy whore.

Hi, sweetie.

Look at her staring.
What are you looking at, huh?

God, I should take her out
right here with these, man.

Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring?
Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?

(EXCLAIMS)

Yeah, you want some of this,
Maury Po'bitch?

(EXCLAIMING)

Oh, oh, what's that?
Oh, you come back for more, huh?

(EXCLAIMING)

I'd freaking drop her ass.

Oh, an unfamiliar dog.

Why don't you go away?
I don't want to be your friend.

(GROWLS)

Rupert! Oh, dear God, somebody help!

Rupert!

Give me that bear!

(SNARLING)

Oh, honey,
I'm afraid Rupert had a little injury.

Oh, Rupert, please live.

Please, I'll never be short
with you again. We'll go away.

We'll go to Hawaii. Would you like that?
I always envisioned how it would be.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(SIGHS)

I never knew there could be such a thing
as a perfect day.

Don't frolic too much, Rupert.
Save some energy for the hula contest.

Stewie, I have a surprise for you.
Good as new.

Rupert! It's really him.
I don't believe it.

You... You did this for me?

And to help you feel better,
I made your favorite dinner.

Cut green beans.

Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged
according to size from largest to smallest

and a Scooby-Doo yogurt
with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.

Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.

Lois, I was wrong about you.

You're... You're my everything.

Mommy loves you, sweetheart.

(TAUNTING) Stewie loves Lois.

-(TAUNTING) Brian loves Olympia Dukakis.
-Oh, yeah, I do.

Peter, what's the matter with you today?
You're not yourself.

Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman yesterday,
and he did things to my fanny.

(GLASS SMASHING)

(SOBBING)

Peter, it's okay.

It's not okay.
You don't know what it's like.

You're wrong.

I, too, have felt the cold finger
of injustice on my insidey parts.

He... He did it to you, too?

I have something to say.
Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.

I only went in there
for a physical/guinea pig removal,

but I turned out to be the guinea pig
for his sexual experimentation.

You guys are a bunch of queers.

(SOBBING) And so am I!
Oh, God, it was horrible!

I scrubbed, and I scrubbed, but damn it,
they don't make water hot enough!

My God, we've all been victims
of Dr. Hartman's "prostate exam."

Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here.
I will not turn a brown eye to this.

I am going to sue that bastard
and make him pay out the ass.

No ifs, ands, or buts.
I'm going to be really anal about this.

Sphincter.

Good morning, Lois.

My, Stewie, you're in a good mood today.

Well, why shouldn't I be?

You saved Rupert's life,
and I love you for it.

So, warn the villagers.
Here comes the cuddle monster.

(YAWNING)

Oh, Lois, your breasts are great.

Well, good morning, Mr. Nipple.

Hey, there. Must be cold in here.

Peter, you're going to sue Dr. Hartman?

You can't do that,
all he did was give you a prostate exam.

Are you saying I asked for this to happen?

You know, Dad,
there's this lawyer at the mall

who says he'll take any case,

no matter how frivolous.

Yeah, yeah,
and they also have an Orange Julius.

Just... Just trying to keep
the conversation going.

(IMITATES DRUM ROLL)

Well, whatever happens,
I'm not going to stand for this.

Too many people get away with injustice.

Like the folks you meet
in those Louisiana swamps.

Excuse me, do you know how to get to town?

-Yeah, it's back the way you came.
-(GUN COCKING)

I love you, Lois.

You know that, right? Just in case,
I'll say it again. I love you.

Oh, you are just so cute, sweetie.
Look at that little foot.

I'm gonna eat that foot.

-Give me that foot, it looks delicious.
-(LAUGHING)

Don't... Don't eat my foot. Oh, God.

Oh, it is so hard to find funny women,
and you are hilarious.

Oh, you're like a female Bonnie Hunt.

Sit right there, honey.

Mommy will go get Rupert
so he can eat with you.

Oh, God. Thoughtful.

Oh, hey, Lois,
I made coffee if you want some.

Oh, thank you, Brian. That'd be nice.

Uh, hey, Brian, listen,
I've got a favor to ask.

Could you...

-Could you not talk to Lois anymore?
-What?

You know, it's just I'm tired
of you hitting on her. That's all.

It's... I mean, it's not cool.

I was just making coffee.
I didn't hit on her.

Besides, Lois is my friend.
I'll do whatever the hell I want.

I'm asking you nicely, Brian.

-Stop hitting on her.
-That's ridiculous.

-I see the way you look at her.
-Just 'cause you're a mama's boy now.

-It's gotta stop! Lois is my queen, man.
-Kissing up to her,

monopolizing all her time,
so no one else can have a shot.

-Keep hitting on my woman...
-You know what, fine! I do hit on Lois!

(YELLING IN SPANISH)

And another... What?

Sorry, I fell asleep
watching <i>Sabado Gigante</i> last night.

(LAUGHING)

(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

(BOING)

Lois, you know what we should do
right now?

We should play restaurant
with my Play-Doh.

I'll make you a hamburger.

Perhaps I'll make it blue.
Oh, can you imagine such a world?

Uh, Stewie, I love you,
but you're wearing Mommy out.

Now, it's time for bed.

Hey, Lois, I have a secret for you.

(GIGGLING)

Is it not true that you went to see
Dr. Hartman for a simple prostate exam?

No, I went for a flu shot.

At first, I thought he was nice
and that he was kind of handsome.

I trusted him,
and then he told me to bend over.

And then, I just felt
like something was wrong.

I tried to get him to stop,
but he kept saying, "Relax, I'm a doctor."

-This is ridiculous. That never happened.
-Sit down, you rapist!

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm supposed to wait

Your Honor, I can't believe
you're even listening to this.

For God's sake, you're a patient of mine.

I gave you a prostate exam last year,
don't you remember?

Come to think of it,
I remember it as a pretty standard exam.

Are you sure, Judge?

Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy
and black and white? Think about it.

(ECHOING) Relax. I be a doctor.

Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty!

Dr. Hartman,
your medical license is hereby revoked.

That's outrageous!

God, I've looked forward to this moment
more than the second coming of Jesus.

Okay, everybody, I know
you were expecting something else,

but as science will tell you,
people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago,

so let's try to be adult about this.

Uh, no snickering and...

-(WOMAN SNICKERING)
-Hey!

That's exactly what I'm talking about.

Okay, so if we can all be mature...
Give me the gum.

We can all get through this a lot faster.

I have so much fun when we hang out, Lois,

and I love your hair.

We should make up a name
for your hair color.

We could call it, like,
strawberry sunset or ginger maiden,

or one of those hair color names
that's a random noun, like temptress.

Oh, at some point,
you have to let me braid it!

Lois, what are you doing?

(SCREAMING)

(GASPS)

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

I'm like that Texas woman
who gave her son brain damage

by holding him underwater.

I'm just like Barbara Bush!

Brian, what kind of a mother
has homicidal thoughts

about her own baby?

I'm a horrible person.

Lois, you're just exhausted.

Somehow, you've got to break Stewie
of this new overdependence on you.

Well, it's worth a try.

Lois, I've got a surprise for you.
You and I are going to see Eddie Money!

Two tickets, won them on the radio.
We're gonna have a ball.

God, he's like a totally different person.

those chemicals.

(LAUGHING) Hello.

Peter, congratulations on taking down
that monster, Dr. Hartman.

Yeah, what'd you do with your pain
and suffering money?

I got collagen.

Hey, Lois, want to make out?

Yeah. What do you think
of new sexy-lips Peter?

Yeah. This is your life from now on.
Enjoy it, lucky wife.

I tell you, boys, this is a victory
not just for my anus, but for anuses...

Oh, hang on, I got to go pee.

That's a lot better.
So, anyway, this is a...

Oh, I got to take a leak.

There we go. Oh, pee time.

Peter, you're urinating
unusually frequently.

Yeah, what gives?

If it's gale-force peeing you be doing,

it could mean you've got barnacles
on your prostate.

Best have sick bay check below your decks.

Wait a minute.
Are you telling me I need a prostate exam?

Aye, and soon,
before your rudder jams with flotsam,

and you're dropping anchor
without an order from the Captain.

How're you liking all these nautical puns?

-Cute.
-Not bad.

-Somewhat entertaining.
-My God, I'd better see a doctor.

But no doctor in town will see you
after that lawsuit.

Well, then, I'll just find a doctor
out of town.

Listen, I know I'm not a regular patient,

but I think I have some trouble
with my prostate.

So, can you help me out, Dr. McCoy?

-What, so you can sue me, too?
-Oh, come on, it'll only take a sec.

Forget it. I'm a doctor, not a patsy.

Hello.

Lois, what are you doing?
I want to sleep in your bed.

Oh, good night, honey. I love you.
This is for your own good.

Lois, where are you going? Lois?
Lois? Lois, answer me!

Damn you, I will not be ignored!
Get back in here!

Get back in here and love me!

(SHOUTING)

Lois!

Maybe I should go in. He's so upset.

He's just being melodramatic.

You've got to ignore it
if you really want to help him.

-Are you flexing?
-What, me? No. Why would I be flexing?

I mean, I have sort of been
hitting the gym,

so if you wanted to see how it's going...

(GRUNTING)

What am I going to do, Seamus?

Dr. Hartman is my only hope,
and there's no way he's going to see me.

Well, you best come up
with something, Peter.

Otherwise, this will happen
to your prostate.

You just carry a picture
of a diseased prostate around with you?

Never know when it's going to come up
in conversation,

and then who's the one who's prepared?

I've also got a map of Middle-earth,

a cat doing a pull-up,
and the guys from Primus.

These poster jokes doing anything for you?

-Eh, hit and miss.
-We should hang out more.

I need her love.
I need her love, and she's ignoring me.

Well, let's see her try to ignore this.

Lois, help!

I ate this whole jar of pills
that look like candy and now I feel sick.

-You look like a jackass.
-Can't hear you, Brian. I'm dead.

All right.

What did you do?

Oh, that is so not cool.

(GROANING)

(GASPS) Oh, my God. Stewie,
are you all right? Oh, my sweet baby.

And to think I ignored your cries
for attention.

I'm so sorry, honey. Never again, Stewie.

I'm going to give you all the love
you could ever want.

Ugh!

Forget it, you neglectful,

You had your chance and you blew it.
Well, now you're too late.

I hope they charge you with child abuse
for my broken arm.

I'll testify against you,
just like I did against Michael Jackson.

Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave
inappropriately toward you?

Well, yes, but the worst part
was he never called back.

(ALL LAUGHING)

No, but in all seriousness,
yeah, he was actually pretty aggressive.

Wait a minute,
there's something strange about this.

I wasn't expecting any package.
Who are you?

-Griffin!
-You got to help me, Dr. Hartman.

I think there may actually be
something wrong with my prostate.

Well, don't look at me.
I lost my license, thanks to you.

Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but you're the only one I can turn to.

So, I'm asking you,

as a man with no more options,
will you take a look in my ass?

(SIGHS)

Despite everything that's happened,

I suppose I can't ignore
my Hippocratic oath.

All right, drop your pants.

Oh, well, this is nothing,
just a little swelling.

Probably a minor infection.
Looks like there's some blockage.

-What the devil is that?
-SULU: Hello.

Dr. Hartman,
your license is hereby reinstated.

(ALL CHEERING)

Oh, I'm so glad you two worked things out.

And to think I actually thought
you raped me.

Well, I was going to,
but you ran out of the room.

-What?
-Ha!

Ah!

Let's hear Weenie's catchphrase.

"They no funny."

(BELL RINGING)

I think we have a wiener!

(DONKEY BRAYING)

And that's Dicky, the Punch Line Donkey,
on 97.1.

<i>Ray Romano and Kermit the Frog.</i>

-Thelma.
-Hello, darling.

My God, what a pleasant surprise.

-Mom, what are you doing here?
-Peter, I left your father.

-What?
-Wait, wait. Hang on a second.

I never see you,
and then you finally come visit me

and you drop a bombshell like this?

This is just like what happened
at the Peanuts reunion.

Stupid song.

What are you looking at?

Yeah, it's me.

Your old punching bag, Charlie Brown.

Everybody wish Snoopy was here?
And Woodstock?

Everybody wish Snoopy and Woodstock
was here? Well, they're dead.

And guess what? I sold Snoopy the junk.

That's right, he got it from me.

I swear I didn't know how strong it was.

And now he's dead. They're both dead.

I don't give a crap about Woodstock,
but Snoopy...

(SOBBING)

Get off me, you skank.

-I can't believe you left Dad.
-I have needs that he didn't satisfy.

And I'm still a young woman, Peter.
82 is the new 74.

I'm putting my fine ass
back on the market.

Boy, this is really going to upset my
evil brother, Thaddeus.

Nyah, this will surely affect
my inheritance. Nyah!

Hi, there, I'm Brian Griffin,

and you're listening to <i>The Lunch Hour,</i>
serving up food for the mind.

Today's entree is politics.
What's on your mind today?

The governor's budget?
Stem cell research?

Give us a hot spoonful of your opinion.
Okay, we have a question from Quahog.

Caller, you're on <i>The Lunch Hour.</i>
Can I take your order?

STEWIE: <i>Yes, I'll have a big helping</i>
<i>of the pretentious crap.</i>

Whoa.
Sometimes the crazy ones get through.

Okay, we have Rose from Cranston
on the phone.

Welcome, Rose, can I take your order?

STEWIE: <i>Yes, that turkey,</i>

<i>that raw turkey that you ate off</i>
<i>the counter last week that got Lois mad,</i>

<i>when you pooped that out,</i>
<i>was the timer still in there?</i>

And we're out of time.
This has been <i>The Lunch Hour.</i>

Join us next week,
when our guest will be Gore Vidal.

And remember, life is full of entrees,
so don't fill up on bread.

I'm gonna throw you now to
Weenie and the Butt in the afternoon.

MAN: (IN DEEP VOICE)
<i>Weenie and the Butt.</i>

<i>-</i>WOMAN:<i> 97.1.</i>
<i>-In the afternoon.</i>

<i>In the afternoon.</i>

<i>-Oh, my God.</i>
<i>-WQHG.</i>

<i>Turn it on and rip the knob off.</i>

<i>You're listening to the radio</i>

Sir, I'm very sorry.
That was this guy I know.

-He thinks he's hilarious.
-He is hilarious.

I was on my way in here
to cancel your show,

but the banter you did with that guy...

Well, as we say in the radio business,

"If you put that on the radio,
people will listen to it."

Make him part of the show.

You don't want him.
He's not really a professional like me.

Listen, you get that kid in here.
We need more laughs on the show.

(SIGHS) Well, I guess he couldn't be
any worse

than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.

In my view, as good as the Yankees
were in the first half of this game,

that's how as bad they've been now.

Poor Peter. I know he's having a hard time
with this whole divorce thing.

I feel kind of guilty that I'm here
looking for a date.

Thelma, stop that.
You have a right to be happy.

And there's a lot of great people here.
Why don't you mingle?

-Oh, my God, Lois, you single now?
-No, Glenn, I'm here with Thelma.

-Who's Thelma?
-This is Thelma.

Ew!

I don't know if this is gonna work, Lois.
I'm a little shy at these types of things.

You can overcome shyness.

Think of the spider in <i>Charlotte's Web</i>
who had to overcome Tourette's.

I don't know, Lois.

I haven't met a single interesting person.

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker,
trying to get back on my feet

after having my ass handed to me
by my bitch of an ex-wife.

-I'm Thelma.
-I'll just be going.

Can I get you some punch?

Oh, no. You see, if you're
one of 10 million Americans like me...

-Like me.
-Like me.

...with a bladder control problem,
punch just goes right through you.

Ew!

I didn't hear you come in last night.

Did you have a good time
at your prostitutes' convention?

Peter, I was just trying to help your
mother meet some new friends.

Lois, you're too nosey.

Like that waiter at that restaurant.

And who had the prime rib?

I hardly think that's
any of your business.

Come on, Mom,
you can't stay in bed all day.

You gotta call Dad
and get back together with...

(SCREAMS)

Holy crap!

We'll have more on these new
developments after this.

I can't believe what I saw in there.

You were messing around in what was
basically my first apartment.

Peter, you should be happy for her.

-She's just having fun.
-I don't see what the problem is.

Tom is a wonderful man.

I don't see the problem, either,

but let's go to Ollie Williams
for the in-depth analysis. Ollie?

-Lady's old.
-Thanks, Ollie. Over to you, Peter.

Tom Tucker, I forbid you
to see my mother.

Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.

He won a local Emmy
for his work with the retardeds.

They certainly wanted to hug me.
Maybe, in time, you will, too.

Thanks for watching. I'm Tom Tucker.
Good night.

(NEWSCAST THEME PLAYING)

(INAUDIBLE)

All right, look.
Let's get one thing straight, Stewie.

The only reason you're here is that
my boss ordered me to bring you on.

All right? This is my show, and it's a
serious, intellectual hour of discussion,

-and I want to keep it that way.
-Hey, no problem.

All right. In three, two, one.

This is <i>The Lunch Hour</i> with your host...

Hey, what's up, Quahog?

From the station that reaches the beaches,
you're listening to Dingo and the Baby.

WOMAN: <i>Dingo and the Baby</i>

<i>97.1, Quahog</i>

MAN:<i> Oh, baby.</i>

(MAN BURPS)

What the hell are you doing?

What the hell does that have to do

They're just wacky sounds,
you know, to liven things up.

<i>Oh, sexy girlfriend.</i>

Peter, would you stop spying
on your mother's date?

I can't stand it anymore, Lois.
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

(PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
<i>-</i>PETER: <i>Hello, yes.</i>

<i>This is Tom Tucker's personal physician,</i>
<i>Dr. T and the Women.</i>

<i>Could you tell Tom his contagious</i>
<i>penis cancer medicine is ready?</i>

-Is this Peter?
-No, it's Lois.

Lois, don't crank call my mother.
I'm gonna have to pinch you for that.

Ow, Peter, don't pinch me.

(BOTH GROANING)

-Stop that.
-Knock it off, damn it!

Cut it out. Maybe I'll tickle you,
huh, how about that?

-No, don't.
-Here you go.

-Tickle, tickle, tickle.
-Cut it out. Stop it.

I mean it. I mean it.

(GROANING)

Well, I told you to stop.

I tickle you, you hit me in the head
with a frying pan?

-I told you to stop.
-I taste blood.

Well, there's a lot of it.

Hey, there, champ.

Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment
for you,

but all I want is for your mom
to be happy.

Well, why can't she go back with my dad?

Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna
do my best to make her even happier

than those kids on <i>Three Wishes</i>
with Amy Grant.

-What's your wish, Billy?
-Can you cure my cancer?

No, but how about if Spider-Man gives
you a $50 gift card to Sears?

Here. Get well.

You know,
I heard a rumor about you today.

-You did?
-Yup. I heard you like milkshakes.

-Oh, boy, do I!
-Let's go get ourselves a shake, huh?

Yeah.

-I want to get a milkshake, too.
-Too bad. Go get your own father.

(HUMMING)

Hey, Carl,
can I get a carton of smokes, please?

Sure, Brian.

And what's that little rubber
mailman you got behind there?

-Oh, you like that, huh?
-Yeah, does that thing squeak?

Yeah, it does.

(SQUEAKING)

All right, I'll take that, and I'm
gonna hurry home and show it to Lois.

Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

You're Dingo, that dog that plays
all those fart sounds on the radio.

Awesome!

Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that,
the show's gotten a little lowbrow.

What are you talking about?
It's, like, the most hilarious show ever.

-Hey, could I get your autograph?
-My... Really?

Wow, you're...

Gosh, you're making me feel more
important than a dwarf among midgets.

-Hey, can you reach the Crispix?
-Yes, I can.

How awesome is this?
Going out to dinner with my new family.

Hi, can I help you?

I want... I want that one.

All right, hold on,
we'll get you that one.

-I want straws.
-We'll get you a straw.

-You want a kid's meal?
-No.

-Do you mean "yes"?
-Yes.

Okay, one kid's meal.
And what'll you have, honey?

I'll have a fish sandwich and a Sanka.

Oh, he's adorable.

Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.
Oh, he's shy.

<i>Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that,</i>

<i>and I'll meet you up there</i>
<i>in, like, five minutes.</i>

Peter, I've never seen you so happy.

Well, Lois, I never realized
what it was like to have a real dad.

I mean, my own dad
was such a ballbuster,

I guess I just always thought
that was normal.

But Papa Tom is so different.

For the first time in my life, I feel
like I have a real family, you know?

I mean, I'm not just going through
the motions like I do around here.

Hey, champ,
you want to watch <i>Chicken Little?</i>

-(LAUGHING) Yeah.
-And what does a chicken say?

"Moo."

Why not?

Come on, Ma.

Hey, what gives with the suitcase?

Tom, there's no easy way to say this.
I'll just come right out with it.

-I'm leaving.
-What? Leaving? Why?

Tommy, this has been great,

but I wasn't looking
for anything long-term.

I just needed someone to clear
all the bats out of my plumbing.

-What do we do now, Bill?
-We write, Tim.

We write our story.

Goodbye, dear.

It's all my fault!

(WAILING)

(LAUGHING) Nyah!

I know it hurts right now, Peter,
but we'll get through this.

-You're still my little buddy, right?
-Yeah.

-Then we'll be okay. Goodnight, buddy.
-Goodnight Papa Tom.

-Goodnight, son. Goodnight, Lois.
-Goodnight.

Peter, this is a little strange.

No stranger than when
Darth Vader was a meter maid.

Come on, man. Cut me a break. I was
only in there for, like, five minutes.

I already started writing the ticket.

You know,
I make your annual salary in a week.

Are you happy doing what you're doing?
'Cause you're pathetic.

I gotta do it, Karen.
I just gotta take a shot.

That guy... That guy just got to me today.

You do whatever you think is right,
and I'll support it.

I don't really understand it.
What do you want this loan for?

I want to build a giant space station
that can destroy a planet.

I don't know that that would be a good
investment on our end.

I mean, I want to open a sports bar.

Don't you... Get down from that chair

You put that ice cream back right now.

No, it wasn't worth it. I'm sorry, Stewie,

I'm more of a sellout than you were when

Nobody better lay a finger

D'oh.

-What's your problem?
-Papa Tom's being a jerk.

At least he talks to you.

He's my dad and he hasn't
paid attention to me in weeks.

Well, all in all, you should be thankful.

I think the Kennedys had a kid like you,
and they had it put to sleep.

Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about that business
with the ice cream.

I guess I'm just still a little torn up
about your mom.

But, hey, I'll make it up to you.
Let's play catch.

Okay.

Wait a minute. You know what?

-I think you should play catch with Jake.
-Really?

Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like
to have a real father.

I can't make him share his.

Well, all right, Peter. Come on, Jake.

I guess I've learned a little something
about what it means to be a good dad.

Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?

-No!
-We're just getting started!

Meg is my least favorite
of all your children.

It's all right. We'll just move the party
to the skating rink.

Who's sober enough to drive?

Okay, who's drunk,
but that special kind of drunk

where you're a better driver
because you know you're drunk?

You know, the kind of drunk
where you probably shouldn't drive,

but you do anyway because,

I mean, come on,
you gotta get your car home, right?

I mean, what do they expect me to do,
take a bus?

Is that what they want,
for me to take a bus?

Well, screw that. You take a bus.

-I'm that kind of drunk.
-Shotgun.

Dad, where have you been?
I've been waiting for over an hour.

Grab some wood there, bub.
Daddy and his friends have been drinking,

and we're gonna keep on drinking
until we each uncover repressed memories

of sexual abuse
by a trusted religious official.

Oh, that's crazy talk. Oh, my God!
Minister Washington, how could you?

Man, look at all these chicks.

Oh, wow.

Wow, if I were a woman,

I would press my bare boobs

Hey, baby, how'd you like

you want to go somewhere?

No, no, no! Wait. Wait. Quagmire,

<i>-What kind of music do you like, Gloria?</i>
<i>-Hippo-hop. Woohoo! Yeah, baby!</i>

Dude, those animals are so (BLEEP) funny,

they make me want to merge
without looking!

Yeah! Rumsfeld!

Hi, there, can I help you folks?

Yeah, my daughter's looking for a car
that goes with her personality.

Yes, are the new bulimic-cutting mobiles
in yet?

This is a 1996 sedan.

Excellent gas mileage, air bags
and AM-FM cassette.

-I love it! Dad, this is the car.
-Hang on a second, Meg.

What can you tell me about this one?

Oh, that's just an old tank I use
for those commercials

where I declare war on high prices.

Now, about that sedan...

Hang on there, slick. Now I see your game.

We come in here wanting a practical car,

but then you dangle this tank
in front of me

and expect me to walk away.

Now, I may be an idiot,
but there is one thing I am not, sir,

and that, sir, is an idiot.

Now, I demand
you tell me more about this tank.

Well, if you're looking for quality,
then look no further.

That's more like it. Tell me,
what are the tank's safety features?

What a good-looking question.

Three inches of reinforced steel
protects your daughter

from short-range missile attacks.

I see, and does the sedan protect
against missiles?

-It does not.
-You hear that, Meg?

Yeah, it does not protect
against missiles.

See, these are the questions.
This is why I'm here.

Peter, you can't be serious.
This is a 30-ton war machine.

I'm still not sure.

-Did I mention the tank is a tank?
-Sold.

PETER: Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.

-Bocce balls!
-I bought a tank.

Are you out of your mind?

Let me show you how the gun works.

(SCREAMING)

(LAUGHING)

What the hell?

No, no, no, no!

Hey, Peter, can you blow
that towel rack down here?

Thank you.

-I ordered a pizza. I hope that's okay.
-Sure, I love pizza.

This half of the apartment is mine,

but if you want to come over here,
that's okay, too.

This isn't spaghetti. It's linguini.

You're right. It is.
I always get those confused.

-Hey, all of us are human.
-I'm glad we're friends.

Yeah, this is really working out.

There's no conflict in this movie!

When are you gonna get rid of that stump?

I've been asking you for months
to get rid of that stump!

I'll do it, all right?
Just get off my back!

She's gone. We can finally be together.

But, Tim, I'm rooted the ground.

We'll find a way. We'll find a way.

My God, it's hot. Brian, did you
turn off the air conditioner?

Just open a window. Air conditioners
are harmful to the ozone layer.

Brian, please, save your hippie BS
for the winter months, okay?

Morning, civilians.
General Griffin reporting for breakfast.

Dad, it's not fair.

My money paid for that tank,
and I haven't even got to drive it yet.

Jeez, Meg,
you always gotta ruin my good time,

just like basic cable.

<i>MAN ON TV: We now return to</i> Showgirls...

Yeah!

<i>-...on TBS.</i>
<i>-</i>Aww.

All right, Meg, you got a feel for
the controls. Now give it a little gas.

Oh, great, it's here.
That mirror I bought on eBay.

Oh, my God!

(SCREAMING)

Joe, my God, what happened?

You just ran over me, you bastard!

I don't know where you got that thing,
but I'm impounding it!

You look like a half-empty toothpaste.

<i>We just trust you.</i>

I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson

confiscate the closest thing
I had to a car.

Relax, Meg.
It's not the worst thing I've ever done.

You remember that favor I did
for that park ranger?

Hey, Boo Boo, let's see
what we got in this pic-a-nic basket.

(GROANING)

(SHUSHING)

Tell the other bears what you just saw.

Well, I don't care

'cause you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.

You know, I read that they're opening
a Superstore USA across town.

Maybe you could get a job there.

No. No, no way.
You cannot work there, Meg.

Giant megastores like Superstore USA
are ruining this country.

They don't pay their employees
a decent wage

or give them health benefits.

-Yeah, all gay guys hate Superstore USA.
-What?

Welcome to the Superstore family, Meg.
Glad to have you.

Thanks. I'm really excited to get to work.

Now, let me just go over a few basics.

You'll earn minimum wage,
no overtime, no health benefits,

and every day at 3:00,
you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.

Oh, it's nearly 3:00 now.

-Here you go.
-You're beautiful.

I would go out with you if I wasn't
already in a committed relationship.

Hey, guys, what's going on?

Oh, Peter, Superstore USA
has taken all my business.

Mine, too. In fact, the only guy in town
making any money

is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.

Y'all laughed at me. Y'all laughed at me.
Well, who's laughing now?

(LAUGHING)

What do you think of this?

-That makes you attractive.
-Yeah!

Well, maybe now you guys are seeing
what I've been trying to explain to you.

That megastore is a big, evil corporation

that means nothing but trouble
for this town.

Oh, man, this is the worst thing
to happen to this town

since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.

Looks like someone's a little lost.

Everyone, I have some bad news.

Superstore USA
has their own brewery on site

and can sell beer at a much cheaper price,

so management has decided
to close down.

-You mean I'm out of a job again?
-I'm sorry, Peter.

Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday
at Richard Gere's house.

Okay, find the Easter egg.

-I know where it is. It's in your butt.
-No.

Yeah, I know the story. It's in your butt.

Mr. Griffin, if you'd just
look on the ground for five seconds,

I'm sure you'd find it.

-Nope, in your butt.
-Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor.

-In your butt.
-Mr. Griffin...

-Butt. Butt.
-Mr. Griffin...

You know what?
Just get the hell out of here.

Fine. Weirdo.

So how was work today, Meg?

Peter, you lost your job
because of the Superstore.

You shouldn't blame Meg.

And you can stop making that fart sound
every time someone says, "Meg."

So how was your day
exploiting the town's resources, Meg?

(LAUGHING)

Meg.

Meg.

(RAZZING)

Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg!

(WHISPERS) Meg.

I'm not gonna sit here and take this.

I'm the only one in this family
who has a job.

Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.

-What did he just say to you?
-Nothing, there was...

Well, it's like if you were...
Forget it. It's nothing, Meg.

<i>-Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>
<i>-And I'm Diane Simmons.</i>

Great, rolling blackouts.

Now, Superstore USA
is siphoning off all the city's power.

-And they cost me my job.
-Mine, too.

Superstore USA
has their own paper route.

That new paperboy done gone
and broke my sternum.

(BOTH MOANING)

(SNORING)

This sucks. That damn Superstore
is ruining everything.

You know,
instead of sitting around complaining,

why don't we go down there and protest?

That's a great idea, Brian.

All we need is some magic markers,
poster boards, some plywood...

Actually, Superstore USA has
all that stuff. We can just get it there.

(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

There's one of them now.

Take that for stealing jobs
from hardworking people!

(SCREAMING)

Dad, what the hell are you doing?

We got a message for you.
"We're here. We're queer. Get used to it."

-Actually, Peter...
-Gattaca! Gattaca!

Peter, I don't think it's working.
People are still going into the store.

Well, fine, then I guess I gotta go
in there and drag them out one by one.

All right, who the hell is in charge...

What is that I'm feeling?

That's our
industrial-sized air conditioner.

When I walk into Superstore USA,
I get the sensation

that I'm standing on a mountain top
with the wind blowing through my hair!

My God,
look at this wonderland of treasures.

What would a guy like me have to do
to be part of this magical world?

You are trespassing on private property,
and I must ask you to leave.

What? Are you out of your mind?

-Leave this lot, losers.
-Unless you want a licking.

And we'd love to deliver that licking,

-right, fellows?
-Yeah.

-Love it.
-A lot.

I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop
in Lillehammer.

God, I wish the power
would come back on.

Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward
to this job.

Peter, I can't believe
you're working for Superstore USA.

How could you sell out like that?

Because, Brian, they have
an industrial-sized air conditioner,

Look, Dad, this isn't gonna be
a cake walk, all right?

I'm your supervisor.

Meg. Meg, I promise, I'll do better
at this job than I did on the SATs.

Come on, do math.

Dad, I need you to...
Dad, what are you doing?

Meg. Meg, look. Meg, look.
I am so freaking good at coloring.

I know I'm not supposed
to go outside the lines,

but I do anyway
because I like being myself.

Dad?

(PETER WHINING)

Dad?

Dad?

(PETER WHINING)

Oh, God, it's so hot.

Brian, spit on me.

Oh, that's nice. Now tell me I'm scum.

How will that cool you off?

God, it's awful in here.

This is even worse than getting herpes
from a toilet seat.

Joanie, it's me.

Oh, hey! You know, I had
such a great time with you last night.

Listen, there's something
I have to tell you.

I just got back from the doctor.
I have herpes.

I think you should
get yourself checked out.

Oh, my God.

-Will you stay?
-What?

Will you stay with me
even knowing that I have herpes?

Yes, I will.

-Joanie?
-Yeah?

I don't have herpes.
I just needed to know that you'd stay.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>You say I only hear what I want to</i>

I've had it. The only place in town
that's got power is Superstore USA

while the rest of us
are left to bake in the heat.

There's gotta be something we can do
to take that place down.

Don't worry, Brian.
I think I've got an idea.

BOTH: Uh-huh.

Oh, yeah!

Meg, you're doing a great job.

In fact, I'm promoting you
to assistant manager.

Really? Oh, my God! Thank you so much.

Now, your first responsibility
is to fire that employee.

Boy, I'm a little chilly.
I hope no one notices.

(ALL LAUGHING)

But that's my dad.

What's more important to you,
your job or your family?

And don't pick the obvious one.

Oh, hey, guys. I was just catching up
on some plunger nipples.

Dad...

Go on, Meg. What are you waiting for?

Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,

but you're a fat-ass

who's completely incapable
of performing the simplest tasks,

but you're also my father,

and you're the only one I'll ever have,

so I'm not going to fire you.

Mr. Penisberg, I quit.

-Penisberg?
-Yeah, get it all out of your system.

Meg, that was a wonderful thing
you just did for me.

I can't believe this is coming out
of my mouth, but I love...

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

(GASPS)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

So you got a tank, big whoop.
Want to fight about it?

Well, I'm glad
that Superstore USA is gone.

That place was nothing but trouble.

And I think we learned something.

Any problem caused by a tank
can be solved by a tank.

Dad, you were about to say something
in the store.

-No, I don't think so.
-No, I'm sure of it.

I don't know. Something about
<i>Hardcastle and McCormick?</i>

No, you were going to say you love me.

You love me, and you know it.

Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.

Well, you think
you'll look for another job, Meg?

CHRIS (groaning):
Oh...

(loud techno music plays)

What's up, y'all?

I'm Sergeant Extreme!

And I'm Major Awesome!

We're here to tell you how
much the army kicks ass!

Check this out!

(NARRATOR READING)

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(NARRATOR READING)

The army sounds awesome!

And the recruiter said,
with any luck,

I could the clap
from a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.

Wow, that's great.
You'll be serving your country,

just like American
film legend Mickey Rooney.

Hi. I'm former biggest star
in the world, Mickey Rooney.

And as you may know, I am
totally and completely insane.

I like to yell at mice
with my shirt off.

(YELLING)

Sometimes I like to steal
other people's scabs.

(YELLING)

How do I stay so crazy?

Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!

Take one with breakfast,
one with lunch,

and before you know it,
you'll be up on your roof,

pooping in the chimney.

Hold out your stockings, kids!

Chris, you can't join the army,
you're too young.

Besides, the army is weak.

Now, the marines, those are the men
you want to (bleep).

Are you kidding, Lois?
The army's great!

You get to save money
for college,

there's free food, and all
the brown people you can rape.

I am sorry, but he
is not joining the army-- case closed.

I can't believe they're
brainwashing kids like Chris

to serve in the military.

Ah, yes,
the bottom ten percent

of our high school class
is off to fight another battle.

-You stole that from <i>The Onion.</i>
-What?

You stole that...
I read that in <i>The Onion</i>

About the war in Iraq.
Well, if that's true, then I'd say

they've got some sharp cookies
over at the, uh...

What is it again? The Onion?

So if I go up to
your room right now,

I'm not gonna find a
copy of The Onion, right?

No.

-Ow! Damn it!
-That's what I thought.

TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Coming this fall,</i>

<i>if you loved</i>
Everybody Loves Raymond,

<i>then you'll love his brother,</i>
<i>Robert, even more,</i>

<i>in </i>Robert.

I bet you Debra really
gave it to Ray today.

I bet you she made a sandwich
that wasn't very good,

but he ate it anyway.

And then she got mad at him
'cause he gave her a funny look.

I miss Ray.

Aw...

I can't believe Chris would just buy
into that army recruiter's sales pitch.

We can't let him enlist.

Don't worry, Lois, all he needs

is an after-school activity
to get his mind off the army.

Just something
to distract him.

You know, like all
of America gets distracted

whenever a cute
white girl dies.

We regret to report
that not all the children

onboard the school bus
survived.

We have identified
the body of one victim,

nine-year-old, Becky Gunderson.

ALL:
Aw...

No, wait, that's, uh,
Becky Gutierrez.

-ALL: Oh.
-That's not news.

Brian, wha... What are you doing?

Gymboree is that way.

Brian, it's parachute day!

I just want to swing by
the army recruiting center

and give a piece of
my mind to that jerk

who tried to brainwash Chris.

We are gonna be so late.

I'm not gonna have a partner.

I'm gonna have to be partners
with the teacher.

It's just wrong for the military
to mess with kids' minds.

They're all gonna wind up
in therapy, like Peter was.

Every time my daughter opens
her mouth,

I just want to punch her in the face.
she's really annoying.

Uh-huh. All right, let's explore that.

What the hell's
wrong with you?

Your skin's, like, moving
around or something.

I believe I'm having
some sort of seizure.

What kind of after-school
activity should I do, Dad?

Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun
activities out there.

For example, I used to
be a horse whisperer.

(WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)

Pfft, maybe if she
spent some time

on the treadmill
and I was drunk.

I wouldn't, either.

I don't think any of this stuff
is right for me, Dad.

Let's just face it--
I suck!

(rock music playing)

-PETER: Sounds like you guys
-could use some fresh blood.

This is my son, Chris--
you should hear his voice.

It's absolutely gorgeous.

Like Laura Dern if she
didn't look like a banana.

He can sing?

Yeah, runs in the
family. See, look.

<i>I am Peter Griffin,</i>
<i>I like fancy food</i>

<i>I like reading comic books</i>
<i>and dressing like a dude.</i>

Yeah, rock and roll!

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Did you hear that?

Guys, I think we just found
our new lead singer.

Awesome! I'm gonna be
a famous music star,

like Muddy Waters!

Muddy? Baby?

Everything all right in there?

MUDDY: Oh, I think I'm about
to pass a kidney stone.

(PLAYING BLUES RIFF)

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMS)

(SCREAMS)

Boy, I can't wait
to lay into that recruiter.

Yes, you'll be
about as effective

as the Wizard of Oz was
at granting wishes.

And, Dorothy,
you wanted herpes,

but little did you know,
you've had herpes all along.

I didn't want herpes!

Oh.

Well...
you've got it.

Yes, uh, I'd like to see
the army recruiter.

Oh, you'll have to have a seat,
there's a 25-minute wait.

Twenty-five minutes? Oh, God.

All right, I better go put
more money in the meter.

Peggy, would you send in
the next...

Oh, you're already here.

Say, aren't you a little young
to join the army?

No, I have that, uh,
Webster disease.

Hey, is that the M9
double-action pistol?

Sure is.
Standard issue in the army.

Where do I sign?

Right here.
Did I mention

there's a hundred-dollar bonus
if you sign up a buddy?

Really?

Well, I think I have
a surprise for somebody.

(sighs)
There you are.

Congratulations,
you are both in the army.

We're both in what? That's ridiculous.

I'll tell you what's ridiculous,

him on a roll.

We're not gonna be
seeing them again.

My God!

You are the sorriest bunch
of rejects I ever seen.

And I've seen the Bengals
in concert.

You! Where are
you from, boy?

Quahog.

They only got two things
in Quahog: steers and queers.

I don't see no horns
on you.

What does that
make you, boy?

-Queer?
-Right!

Oh, I got it?
Yeah.

-(BRIAN CHUCKLES)
-You find something funny, Private Dancer?

Dancer for money?
Any old music will do?

Well, actually, yeah,
your last little, uh,

back-and-forth there with Stewie,
that whole queer thing,

that was actually
pretty funny.

Oh, God!

Ooh, that's got to hurt worse

than getting a birthday telegram
from Zinedine Zidane.

Yes?

Bon anniversaire.

Yo, yo, what's up,
James Woods High?

I'm Chris, and this is our band,
Splash Log!

And we are gonna rock
this place until...

Un... Well, until about 9:30,

'cause that's when
the dance is over!

Now, I'll ask again.

If I order a pizza, will
anyone else have some?

I might have a slice.

Well, you know, I'm gonna need more
of a commitment than that, Mark.

ALL: Mambo!

(GROANING)

Griffin! You got four legs there!

You better start
using them! I'm trying, sir.

You got five seconds to get
to the head of the pack,

or this entire
platoon is gonna scrub

the latrines with
their toothbrushes.

Aw, come on, Brian!
Don't screw us, Griffin!

Yeah, come on,
don't screw us, Brian Griffin!

Bill, how about thinking up
your jeers for a change, huh?

(PANTING)

Four! Three! Two!

Oh, come on, Brian, get up!

Time's up!
You're pathetic, Griffin!

Pathetic!

Whose half-eaten dead bird
is in this footlocker?

Let's say hypothetically
that it does belong

to someone in here.

Would admission of that
allow that person to keep it?

Private Griffin,
just for that,

you have to listen to one track from this
Chris Gaines album.

Don't you think that's a little extreme?

Two tracks! It's so stupid, it's just
Garth Brooks in a wig.

Three tracks! Come on!

-We can go all day with this!
-Yeah, but...

That's it! Every single track,

plus the hidden bonus track!

There's a hidden bonus track?

Oh, I hope it's a ballad.

Huh. Should I follow the
knight into the dungeon

or should I go back
the way I came?

Eh, I'll follow
the knight.

Page 37, page 37.

Aah! Aah! I mean, go
back the way I came.

I didn't take my
hand off the page.

You seen it, Lois, right?

You seen my hand
on the page.

Yeah, Peter, I seen it.

(BAND MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, no, not again.

You know, I'm glad Chris
found an activity he likes,

but why do they have
to use our garage?

Come on, Lois, sometimes
kids can be a handful.

Look at Gregory Peck's kids.

Are we there yet?

It's crowded
back here.

Stop touching me.

Your leg is rubbing
up against mine.

Hey! Quiet down
or I'm pulling over.

Stop breathing
on the window.

You idiot,
that's condensation.

It's on the outside.

That's it! I will
come back there

and, so help me God,

I will hit you
with my ring hand.

(THUDDING)

What the hell are you doing?

What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

You can't leave, man. That's desertion.

They'll come after you like Peter
went after that hockey coach.

Oh, no clip?
Oh, thought we had a clip.

Nope. Okay.

Uh, you can't
leave, Brian.

You'll get life in prison.

I'll take my chances.

Let me ask you this,
when was the last time

you saw something
through to the end?

-Well, I, uh...
-Never, that's when!

You need this, Brian.

You dropped out of college.

You still haven't
finished your novel.

Do you know what you lack?
Discipline!

And so you know
where you'll get it?

Right here in the army!

Boy, you know what,
you're right.

Everything I've ever done

I've crapped out on
halfway through.

Well, not this time.

I am going to finish
what I started.

That's the spirit!

You can do anything
you put your mind to.

hard to masturbate

with you guys talking.

Chris, will you knock
that off for two minutes?

We want to talk to you.

Take five, guys.

What do you
buttheads want?

You've been playing with
your friends long enough.

Now it's time for you to come
inside and do your homework.

It's time for you
to piss off, redhead.

-What?
-Hey, hey, Chris,

don't talk to your
mother that way.

Oh, way to stand up for
your woman there, fatty.

Chris, what the hell
is going on with you lately?

Ever since you hooked up
with this band,

you're like a completely
different person,

and I don't like it one bit.

I am expressing myself!

Now, get out of my way!

I'm going to the park
to loiter.

What the hell
is his problem?

I don't know.

He's acting worse
than you did

when you tried to cover
your farts by coughing.

Okay, welcome
to the PTA meeting.

On the subject
of school lunches,

I know there's been some concern
about nutrition.

(FARTS)

We've had complaints
about the soda machines.

(FARTS)

And I have spoken with
the school board

(FARTS)

(SIGHS) Is there something you'd like
to say, Mr. Griffin?

Uh...

(FARTING) No.

(QUICK FART) No.

No, I'm good. (FARTS)

All right, men.

This obstacle course
represents

the final test
of your training.

Almost all of you
have completed it

in the allotted time.

But as you know,
as a unit,

you either all graduate,
or none of you graduate.

Griffin, it's up to you.

All right, you can
do this, Brian.

Come on, pray with me.

Dear Lord,
just stay out of our way.

Okay, good luck.

And go!

bigger accomplishment

than getting Minnie Driver's
head to fit onscreen.

Okay, back up.

Okay, have her enter.

Damn it. Cut!

Congratulations, men.

You've all passed
basic training.

I'm proud to call you soldiers.

I'm sure you'll do your country
proud tomorrow morning,

when you're all shipped off
to Iraq.

What?
Oh, don't worry.

I'm sure he means
Fraggle Iraq.

Well, this isn't so bad.

Yes, the people
are friendly.

I say, the media
has totally

blown this whole thing
out of proportion.

Okay, I go in store,
I throw backpack.

Big boom.

No, no, no, you
are big boom.

-Big hero.
-Okay, right,

so I throw backpack,
come back

and have big hero party
with many virgins.

No, no, no, no, no. You, boom.

Oh, okay, okay.
I put on backpack, boom.

Then I come back,
big hero, virgins.

Okay, yeah.

See you in a few
minutes, big hero.

(SCREAMS)

Chris, your father and I
are very upset

by this new attitude
of yours.

I don't care
what you think of me!

Oh, God, I envy that.

I am so self-conscious

about what people
think of me.

I am out of here!

You know, I think
I may have an idea

what's causing
this behavior, Peter.

Look at all this stuff.

Listen to these lyrics.

"I rip it hardcore
like porno-flick bitches,

I roll with groups of ghetto
bastards with biscuits."

Oh, look, they've got a
translation for white people:

"I give 110 percent when it
comes to helping my community

"even though I
occasionally associate

with some less than
reputable characters."

Peter, these lyrics
are filthy.

All this violent music
is what's screwing Chris up.

What the hell?

Marilyn Manson!

Is that who's causing all this?

Yeah, it's all him
or her's fault.

Who does he or she
think he or she is?

Look, you can totally
see his or her nipples.

That's obscene, maybe.

There's only one thing to do.

You're right, we got to
find this Marilyn Manson

and I got to give
that bastard or bitch

a piece of my
mind or penis.

All right, it
shouldn't be too hard

-to get ourselves kicked out.
-Right.

We're just got to convince them we're
not army material.

-Ready? All right,
-let's do it.

Wow, look at
how gay we are.

I am so gay,
with my gayness.

Me, too.
I'm... I'm a homo.

Any room
for one more?

Hell yeah!

All right, last resort.

We get injured and go home
with purple hearts.

Shoot me in the foot.

What? Shoot yourself
in the foot.

No, no, no, they can
tell by the angle.

Here, you shoot me
and I'll shoot you.

I don't think
this is gonna work.

Of course it'll work.

Ready?
One, two, three...

Aah! Damn it!

Oh, my God! That hurts!

I think you missed me.

All right,
I'll try again.

Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on.

-That looks like it's painful.
-Of course, it's painful!

There's a bullet in my foot!
Now get over here!

No, no, no, no, no!
I changed my mind!

-I don't want to do it!
-Come on, we had a deal!

No, no, no, no,
don't point that at me!

No, no, no, oh, come on,

this is flat out just not safe!

Ooh. Ow. Ow.
Oh, you got me.

-Ow. Ow. Ow.
-Let me see.

No, no, it's gross.
Let me see it.

No, no, I don't want
to gross you out.

Oh, ow, oh, we are in
so much pain right now,

the two of us. Oh, ow...

(SCREAMS) Okay, that was real!

Hey, hi, um,

I'm Private Stewie,
and this is Private Brian.

Uh, we both got shot in
the foot, so, uh, we figured

an honorable discharge
would be in order and, uh,

you could just send us
back to the States.

Getting shot doesn't get you
out of here anymore.

-What?
-Yeah, we take whatever we can get.

I mean, we got two dead guys
guarding the ammunition.

Sorry, guys,

you are here until
the job is done.

Great news, everybody.

something like this.

Laura!

And the Grammy for Biggest Posse
goes to...

Ja Rule.

What?

No, Madonna. "Posse." "Posse."

Oh.

All right, Marilyn Manson
has to be here somewhere.

Good thing we distracted
the guard with that riddle.

What gets wetter as it dries...

A towel.

Hey, I've been had!

Hey, look,
right over there.

Hey, Manson!

What in the world
was that for?

Oh, it's a guy.

That's for
ruining our son.

He used to be a sweet boy
until he heard your music.

(CHUCKLES) This old story.

-(ALL GASP)
-Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson!

Hey there, Chris.

You working hard or hardly working?

So I see you're in a band.

-Yep.
-Listen, your parents tell me

you've been acting out a little bit.

And I just wanted to tell you,

rock n' roll music is cool,

but respect for your elders

is a tune we can all dance to.

-Really?
-Sure.

And the best way to start
a fun-filled day

of being a good citizen
is with a healthy breakfast

rich in breads and grains.

And fruits are important, too.

You mean like apples,
oranges and bananas?

Any of 'em, Chris.
You can't miss.

And now, I think your parents
have something to say.

Chris, you don't
really believe

all the things in those
song lyrics, do you?

No.

Then why you been acting
like such a punk?

I guess I don't
really know.

I think I have an idea.

Peter, when was the last time

you and Chris here
did something together?

Boy, I guess
it's been a while.

Here's something
you might not know--

children crave structure.

They enjoy the fun
of planned activities

in which they and
their parent or guardian

can share a common goal.

Maybe you could
take Chris fishing.

What do you say, Chris?

You want to go fishing
with your old man?

Do I?

Can't go without these.

That was Roy.

a minute, and that's it.

In and out.
Oh, don't worry, Brian.

If she's as ugly
as I think she is,

I'll look at her once
and then I'll go...

(MAKES VOMITING NOISES)

All over the place.

Then you'll wipe it up
and then we'll go.

Hi, Brian.

Oh, my God.

Who's your cute
little friend?

Oh, my.

Hello. Stewie. Charmed.

I'm Jillian.

Come on in.
Who wants a drink?

So, you gonna take
back what you said?

Brian, she's stunning.

Okay, you met her,
you can scram now.

I shall do
no such thing.

Now, why in the world
would you be embarrassed

about dating her?

Oh, my God, Brian.

I was watching something on TV
about this guy named Hitler.

Somebody should stop him.

Are her parents
brother and sister?

Can you please
leave now?

Oh, now I get it.

She's a moron.

But a moron with large breasts
you can use as mountains

for your Matchbox cars,

or whatever it is grown-ups
do with large breasts.

Shut up, that's
not it at all.

Say, Jillian, I love what
you've done with the place.

What is it?
One bedroom, one bath?

No, it's a whole apartment.

Oh, God, outstanding.

So, Stewie.

Do you work with Brian
at the detective agency?

Why, yes,
as a matter of fact, I do.

At the detective agency.

That's got to be a tough job.

I know Brian's work
has him coming and going

at all hours of the night.

I bet it does, I bet it does.

Okay, well, Stewie
has to go now.

What are you
talking about?

I want some more of
Jillian's delicious lemonade.

I know,
it's good, right?

I just wish
they didn't have to kill

so many lemons
to make it.

Oh, this is fun, eh?

(GROANS)

So, wait, Dupree moves in with
Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?

But they're newlyweds, right?

Well, that's no time
to have a houseguest.

Oh, gotta go.

Sorry, Angela.

Every Tuesday morning,
I call my friend Cleveland

and he describes every scene
from <i>You, Me, and Dupree.</i>

Griffin, your work
output this week

is even worse
than usual.

Where the hell are
those purchase orders?

Eh, it's this bum hand.

I can't type with it.

Well, that's not my problem.

I need to see some improvement
by the end of the week

or you're finished.

Don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

(PHONE RINGS) Oh, that's going to be
Quagmire with <i>Along Came Polly.</i>

I gotta take that.

All right, so as you know
by this point in the story,

Ben Stiller doesn't
like spicy food.

Well, guess
what's for dinner?

No way.

Boy, Lois,
thanks so much for coming in

and helping me
get my work done.

Without you, Angela would
have been all over my case.

Oh, it's all
right, Peter.

I know it's tough for you to
work with your hand injury.

Hey, you know, uh, with you
sitting there, it's, uh,

it's kind of like
you're my secretary.

Well, let's not get
carried away, Peter.

Now, please, I'm trying
to finish your work.

You know, Lois,
if I'm your boss,

I gotta look like a boss.

Finally, I have a reason to
wear this big bowtie and cigar

I bought at the
Dress For Success store.

Peter, if you want this
work to get done...

Lois, take a letter.

"Dear Life Cereal,

"Where do you get off?

"Part of a balanced breakfast
and delicious?

"Who do you think you are?

"By now, you may have guessed
I'm speaking ironically

"and have nothing
but good things

"to say about what you do.

"Life Cereal,
do not change a thing.

"Signed, Peter Griffin.

Dictated but not read."

Lois, read that back to me.

Oh, hey, Brian.
Back from a hot booty call

with your idiot
girlfriend?

You know, think what you want,

but you don't see the side
of Jillian that I do.

Face it, Brian, she's dumber
than a Boston-area book report.

The novel I chose to address

is Oliver Twist
by Charles Dickens.

Queer name, right?

The book was actually not bad.

For your information,
Jillian is very bright

and she happens to be
a very talented photographer.

Oh, that is so lame.

Every hot girl who
can aim a camera

thinks she's
a photographer.

Ooh, you took a black-and-white
picture of a lawn chair

and its shadow
and developed it at Sav-On.

You must be so brooding
and deep.

-Knock it off.
-No, I want to know, Brian.

What, specifically,
do you talk about?

Uh, a lot of things.

Um, food, um...

The new seat covers
she just got for her Jetta.

Um, <i>Real World Road Rules Challenge.</i>

You hate MTV.

Pot helps.

Look, you know,
I don't have to justify

anything to you,
all right?

All that matters is Jillian and I

have a great time together.

-We make each other laugh.
-Fine.

But just tell me this, Brian,

does she laugh on her own

or does she laugh
only when you laugh?

I thought so.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Hey. Yeah.

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Uh, you gotta hit,
uh, DVD and then menu

and then select. Yeah.

Yeah, the DVD needs
to be face up

when you put it in.

Uh-huh.

You should be able
to see the words Mr. 3000.

Yeah, still nothing?

Is it plugged in?

Okay, so plug it in.

Okay. You got it?

Is it... uh, okay. All right.

No, no problem.
All right.

Uh, love you, too,
Jilly bean.

Okay. (HANGS UP PHONE)

-What? Nothing. I didn't
-say anything.

(SIGHS) I need a drink.

(altered voice):
Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean?

Hey, it's Brian again.

Uh, so, yeah, um, so I figured

we could get together
tonight and maybe, um,

do all those things sexually
that we usually do.

Um, what were those again?

No way, gross!

Oh, I mean, I mean,
oh, oh, no.

Yeah, I totally love
how that feels.

Hi.

You know, I've been
noticing you

around the steno pool.

You look good enough
for a promotion.

Peter, cut it out.

Hey, that's no way
to talk to your boss.

(SNIFFS) Mmm, is that Pert?

You know it is.

Smell my Speed Stick?

(sighs)

Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

Lois, I'm gonna come
right out with it.

I think it would be
so hot for you and me

to have sex in my office.

Oh, my God.

There is no way that
is gonna happen.

You know, it's no wonder
you're so far behind

in your work if this is how you behave
at the office.

Come on, just touch it.
Touch yours.

Peter, no. I
have work to do

so you can
keep your job.

Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.

I'm a worker.
I make stuff on things.

Oh, I'll file these later.

Oh, I got a phone.
Nope, that's it.

Geez, Lois,
I thought having you here

was gonna be fun, but so far

you're a bigger buzzkill
than Buzz Killington.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, man, this is the best
party I've ever been to.

(LAUGHS)

Evening, everyone.

I thought it would
be very droll

if we all sat down
and looked at etchings.

Would you like
to join me, Peter?

Uh, well, we're
kinda partying here.

Good! Hold this up.

Now here's a fellow
attempting to ride a bicycle.

But he's having some
trouble, isn't he?

Would you like to know why?

(SIGHS) Why?

Because he's a Scot!

(CHUCKLES)

Now, who here likes

a good story about a bridge?

Ahh!

What the hell?

Jillian, what...
what are you doing here?

Oh, hi, Brian.

It was so nice of you to invite

your girlfriend over for dinner.

I invited her for dinner?

Yes, you did. You wanted
her to meet the family.

Now, come here, Brian.

Come sit by your friend, Stewie.

And then, think
about this:

have you ever seen
the sun and the moon

in the same place
at the same time?

(GASPS) They're the same person!

I know, right?

You're brilliant!

Hey, Oogie!

So tell us, Oogie,

where'd you find
this one, huh?

You two meet at
a Mensa meeting?

No, at a Quizno's.

We both ordered the Turkey Ranch
and Swiss, no onions.

Can you believe that?

(SARCASTICALLY) No, wow.

What are the odds?

Well, hey, what are the odds
of finding true love

anywhere in the world
says this observer.

Hey, you wanna
know something cool?

I threw up a lot
in high school,

so I don't get
my period anymore.

Wow, this is the one you've been
waiting for, huh, Brian?

(LAUGHING)

Are you serious?

Are you serious, Brian?

All right, you know
what, Lois, don't judge.

Because you don't
know what two people

are like when
they're alone.

Come on. Let's
go out dancing.

I don't know, I'm feeling
kinda cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.

I just really want
to go dancing--

(gasps):
There it is again!

What is that?

So, Jillian, what
are your views

regarding homeland
security?

Do you think we should support
what the president is doing?

Well, I just think,
for starters,

that sometimes
the government has things

they can't tell us
and, truthishly,

we should just
accept that.

-Okay, goodnight, everyone.
-Oh, say, Jillian,

before you go. I forget.

Do you know what the capital
of this state is?

-Um, Rhode Island City?
-(DOOR SLAMS)

(LAUGHS)

It's like she's (BLEEP) five!

Thanks for hanging out
with my friends, Brian.

Hey, come on. We're
a legitimate couple, right?

I should be able to
talk with your friends.

So then the valet
pulls up and I'm all,

"That is so not my car."

But then it totally was.

That's happened to me!

-Me, too.
-Cars go fast.

(LAUGHS) Oh, God.

Yeah, I tell ya,
if I had a nickel

for every time that happened.

-Yeah?
-What?

What if you had a nickel

for every time that happened?

-No, nothing. It's just an expression.
-A what?

Well, I was just saying I do
my share of dopey stuff.

Like, oh, this one time

I attended a speaker's
colloquium on federal judgeships

and without realizing it,
I kept calling William Rehnquist

"William Rhinequist."

(LAUGHS) Come on.

I mean, how... Doi.

Anyone else have to go to the little
girls' room?

I have new gloss!

-I love gloss!
-Oh, that rocks!

Gloss rhymes with hair!

(SIGHS)

STEWIE:
Dude, that was painful.

What are you doing here?
Did you follow us?

Brian, why can't you just admit

what's going on here?

(SIGHS) Okay, okay. Fine. Fine.

I'm gonna have
to break it off.

But, boy, it's gonna be
tougher than the reviews

for <i>Our American Cousin.</i>

Blah, blah, blah,
"Lincoln assassinated,"

blah, blah, blah,
"tragedy for our Republic."

Uh... oh, look!

"Ably performed
by the entire ensemble."

OTHER ACTORS:
That's us! That's all of us!

Morning, Lois, I need
you to proofread this

and collate it for me.

Peter, did you
Xerox your penis?

300 times. It's
a flip book.

Flip through it
or you're fired.

Oh, my God!
This is disgusting.

Peter, for the last time,

I'm not having sex
with you in this office.

Why the hell are you
pushing this so hard?

Because, Lois, I already
wrote the letter

to "Penthouse Forum,"
and I don't wanna be made a liar

in the nudie magazine of record.

(SIGHS) All right.

If I give you
30 seconds of making out,

will that shut you up?

Let's see where it goes.

(SIGHS)

(BOTH MOAN)

Oh, God, you know
this is pretty hot.

Yeah, what'd I
tell you, huh?

(BOTH MOAN)

Oh, God, Peter,
let's do it.

Let's do it
right here, right now!

Lois, Lois wait. Wait.

Opie's right there.

I want him
to look, Peter.

(SHOUTING GIBBERISH)

Well, that is
the last of it.

You are now all caught
up with your work.

Lois, I really
appreciate you

helping me out this week,
and I really appreciate

you having sex
with me in my office.

Well, that was my
pleasure, too, Peter.

Haa, I knew I'd get you.

Just like Danny DeVito
got Rhea Perlman.

I don't know, Danny.

-Look, it's either me or nobody.
-Sold.

All right, Brian,
you can do this.

You can dump her.
Because once it's done,

never again will you
have to listen to her

talk like this?

You know, where
everything has

a question mark
at the end of it?

With an upward inflection?

At the end
of every sentence?

Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking?

Oh, damn it. Now
I'm doing it, too.

Oh, hey, Oogie.

Ooh, you look tense.

Well, uh, Jillian,

there's something we
need to talk about.

What is it?

I uh...

just wanted to spend
some time with you.

(mumbles)

What the hell?
It took you

three hours to break up with her?

Uh, not exactly.

Well, what were you
doing in there?

(sniffs):
What's that smell?

-It smells like sweat and anger and shame.
-Yep.

STEWIE: Life's confusing

when you grow up, isn't it, Brian?

-It is.
-Can we play my mix tape?

Yeah, go ahead.

Come on, Fluffy.
Come on, Mittens.

Come on, Paul.

(LAUGHING)
What a ridiculous name for a cat.

Paul!
That's a person's name.

A person's name.

(LAUGHING)

Oh, Paul.

Oh, man, this is
going to be great.

Oh, are we watching
a movie?

The lab results are back.

You've tested positive
for nymphomania.

Oh, no, what
should I do?

Take two of these and
call us in the morning.

(zippers whizzing)

Oh, now that's not going
to help her nymphomania.

It's only going
to exacerbate it.

Oh, my God, what are
you kids doing?

Out. Everybody out.

(ALL GROANING)

STEWIE:
That's bogus.

Chris, what is this?

Genital Hospital.

Yes, and it's inappropriate
for someone your age.

Now, if you're curious
about sex,

you should talk
to your sex ed teacher.

We don't have one.

The principal cut sex ed class
to save money.

What? Well, that's crazy.

Without sex ed, kids can
wind up sexually confused.

Just look at
Michael Jackson.

The kid in me likes
the frosted side...

but the grown-up in me
likes the kid in me.

Peter, do you know

they're not teaching sex ed
at Chris' school?

Eh, let them figure it
out the way I had to,

with a can of Crisco
and a shot glass.

That's the natural
way, Lois.

That's the natural way.

Well, somebody's got
to step in.

Tomorrow, I'm going down
to James Woods High

and offer to teach
the class myself.

Hey, you could really
make a difference.

Like I did when I taught
money management

to those drug addicts.

There's a lot of ways
for you guys to save money.

For example, you're
all shooting up,

why not share needles?

That's a no-brainer.

More money in your wallet,
more drugs in your veins.

My second piece of advice,
have as many kids as you can,

'cause that makes it
more likely

that one of those kids'll grow
up and make it big in Hollywood.

Then who's paying
the bills, eh?

Hollywood kid.

Class dismissed.

Good morning, everyone.

I'm Mrs. Griffin, your new
sex ed teacher.

Now, you've probably heard
all those rumors

that condoms make sex
less pleasurable.

While that is a fact,
they also make sex safer.

Sorry I'm late, Lois.

Peter, what are
you doing here?

Lois, do you think I'm going
to miss a chance to share

my knowledge with these
fresh young minds?

Forget it, I've missed
too many other opportunities.

There he is.
Took you long enough.

Just what we need.

PETER'S VOICE:
Hey, guys, I'm coming in.

(PIECES GROANING)

Oh, God. Oh, boy.

I am not going
to hear the end of this.

You jackass.
Now you've done it.

Idiot.

I know I don't
fit here,

but I'm just going
to settle right in.

All right, Peter,
you can stay,

but remember,
this is my class.

Now, there are
a number of natural ways

that males and females
interact, and...

That's right--
allow me to demonstrate.

Hey, Rainbow Brite.

Hello, Shakespeare.

I am all done writing
plays for the day,

perhaps we could have
sexual intercourse?

Count me in.

I say, look at this.

This toy has small parts.

Why the devil would they
include small parts?

Unless...
I'm supposed to eat them.

Of course, it all adds up!

Ow!

Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.

Dude, you're lucky.

If you put that
under your pillow,

the Tooth Fairy will come
and give you a dollar.

What? Did you say
the Tooth Fairy comes here?

To our house?

She just breaks in
like some hood?

Yeah, she creeps into
your house at night

and comes into your
room while you sleep.

Oh, my God!

And sometimes, just
for the hell of it,

she cuts off a piece
of her armpit hair

and places it gently
on your tongue.

Oh, oh, God! Oh, God,
I got to get out of here!

-I got to get out of here!
-Stewie, calm down.

Get a hold of yourself.

Here, Brian, let
me handle this.

Calm down. Everything's
going to be all right.

Chris, you're wanted
on the phone.

Everything's going
to be all right.

(STEWIE WAILING)

Hey, Lois, I wanted to
get some K-Y Jelly

for the class today,

but they were all out
so I got Smucker's.

Peter, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

but you ruined
my sex ed class.

There's on way you're
coming with me again.

Fine, but without my advice,
those kids are going to be

as hopeless as Liam Neeson

when he tries to play
an American cowboy.

But, Montana,
when will you be back?

(DRYLY) That's none of
your concern.

You got to take care
of the offspring.

Gonna take a fortnight at
least to get this herd down

to St. Louis
on Mississippi.

This glen's gonna be
tough to traverse,

and that river's got to
be 50, 60 meters wide.

And God knows
how many fathoms.

To hell with
parliamentary procedure.

We've got to wrangle
up some cattles.

What is going on here?

We're all protesting
the sex ed class

that's being taught
to our children.

Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

but the school board has voted
to cancel your sex ed class.

Look, Principal Shepherd,

I know my husband
acted inappropriately...

Oh, it's not because
of your husband.

It's because you're teaching
those kids about condoms.

What?

That's ridiculous.

These students have the right
to information about safe sex.

Well, these parents
don't think so.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

You're fired.

Fired? Oh, no.

(KNIGHT RIDER PRE-COMMERCIAL
THEME PLAYING)

I can't believe
they fired you.

Can't you go down
the school

and try to reason
with them?

No, I'm banned from
school property.

The PTA doesn't want me
around their children.

Well, Lois, I think
you did the right thing

by trying to inform
these kids about safe sex.

And if the parents don't
like it, that's their loss.

That's the problem, though.

It isn't their loss,
it's the kids' loss.

I just hope they're getting
the information they need.

All right, students, we have
a special speaker today

who's going to educate you
about sex.

Please welcome from
the First Evangelical Church,

the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood
and the Opal Ring Crusade.

Hey, kids, put your Walkmans
down and listen up.

'Cause we're going to talk
about sex.

(DEEP VOICE OVER SPEAKER)
<i>Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.</i>

God, what are you doing here?

GOD: <i>I was just passing through</i>
<i>on my way to see The Matrix.</i>

-(LAUGHING) We can relate to that.
-No fake.

Well, God, I am here
to talk to these kids about sex.

GOD: <i>Uh-oh.</i>

And why they shouldn't
be having it.

<i>That is boss.</i>

Hey, you kids like Mad TV?

Well, we've got something
almost as good.

Here they are,
The Opal Ring Players.

Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor
tonight, Debbie.

Yeah, Matthew, that
pizza pie was delicious.

Hey, watch out,
crazy driver.

That joker must have been
from Jefferson High.

(LAUGHING) They're our rivals.

Well, here we are
at the make-out point.

Yeah. You want
to go all the way?

Freeze!

Now, who can tell me what
Matthew just did wrong?

I mean, besides not running over
that yahoo from Jefferson High.

(LAUGHING) They're our rivals.

He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex
and he's not married.

Bingo.

Wow, you're pretty smart.

Thanks. My name's Doug.

I'm Meg.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC SWELLS)

Now, look, let's rap
for a second.

He's sitting informally
like us.

Let's hear what he has to say.

Jefferson High
is our rival.

Sure, sex is fun,
but you can't have it

before you're married,
even if you use a condom.

Because not only to condoms fail
100% of the time,

they're also majorly unsafe.

Hey, you wouldn't put
a plastic bag

over your grandmother's head,
would you?

MAN: No.

And that's why we're gonna be

handing out these opal rings.

These rings are a symbol of your
commitment to refrain from sex

until you're married.

So what do you say?

Who wants to be joyful?

Who wants to be pure?

Who wants to be abstinent?

(cheering)

Wow, he makes
so much sense.

I know, he's a visionary,

like Gandhi or Mozart
or Picasso.

Ladies and gentlemen,
my newest work.

Now, I know this person
looks a little mixed up,

but, watch carefully.

If I move this down here,
and this over here

and this part here...
anyone tell who it is yet?

No? Okay, well, what if I move
this here and this here...

Then it's Dianne Wiest.

All right, men,
your mission tonight

is to stave off the invading
forces of the Tooth Fairy.

SpongeBob, you watch the East.

StarScream, you take the West.

And Man-E-Faces,
you take center patrol

since you have many faces.

(GASPS)

(SCREAMING)

Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay.

It's morning.
Is it?

Ha! I knew it!

I scared her off.

Uh, you might want to check
under your pillow.

(STEWIE GASPS)

How did she get in?

She must have been quieter

than Britney Spears'
dietician.

(wimpish): Ea-Easy
on those trans fats.

N-Not everything
needs gravy.

You know, there's some carrots
down at the other end.

That-that cheesecake
was for everyone.

Her hand was right
beneath my pillow.

She could have snapped my
neck if she had a mind to.

Don't worry about it.

I'm sure it will be a while
before you lose another tooth.

I can't wait for that.

I have to lure her back
on my terms

and kill her myself!

But to catch a fairy,
I have to think like a fairy.

We now return to Laguna Beach.

-Like, right?
-I know.

-Whatever, because duh!
-I know, right?

Whatever, because I mean,
like, totally full out.

-Full on.
-Right?

I guess it's not easy
growing up anywhere.

Hey, Dad, check out
my abstinence ring.

It means I made a
pledge not to have sex.

That's crazy!
You can't give up sex.

You've got a responsibility.

You see, Meg, you're what
they call a "practice girl."

Dad, look at the
facts about sex.

"If you have sex,
your penis will fall off

"and land in another dimension
populated entirely by dogs

who will eat it."

Well, that's something
I'd like to avoid.

Well, this changes everything.

From now on,
I, too, will be obstinate.

-Abstinent.
-Absinthe.

-Abstinent.
-You're grounded.

All right, getting a tooth
to lure that damn fairy back

shouldn't be too difficult.

(SNORING)

I'd love to dance,
Fred Savage. Mm...

Gosh, Meg, I really wish

we could take our relationship
to the next level.

I know, I feel
the same way,

but we made a decision
to be abstinent.

Of course, there are ways
we could keep our pledge

and still do
other things.

You're right.

Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

Uh-huh.

Oh, there it is.
I see it.

You know, Roy,

I hope you play squash
better than you pass.

Well, we'll find out
this Saturday.

(BOTH LAUGH)

LOIS:
All right, Peter,

you ready for
role-playing night?

Here comes, Grimace,

You got some burgers
I can steal, huh?

Lois, the Hamburglar
steals hamburgers.

Grimace is Ronald McDonald's
autistic friend.

Oh, come on, you love the
dirty-talking Grimace.

You... Peter, what
the hell is this?

My chastity belt.

A chastity belt?

What in God's name
is that for?

I'm abstinent, Lois.

It's all in these pamphlets
Meg brought home from school.

Sex turns straight people gay
and turn gays into Mexicans.

Everyone goes down
a notch.

(SCOFFS) This is nonsense.

You can't force
abstinence on kids.

Lois, what possible
harm can abstinence do?

Meg Griffin,
we need to have a talk.

(GASPS)

Mom!

Oh, my God!

You kids were doing it in the ear!

Hey, my sandwich
tastes funny.

Is there something
wrong with the Smucker's?

PETER:
Yeah, it's been on my crotch.

Meg, I still cannot believe

what you and Doug did
last night.

Mom, you don't understand.

Doug and I are abstinent,

but if we have sex in the ear,
it doesn't count.

We're still pure
in the eyes of the Lord.

Meg, when I was your age,
my parents tried to feed me

the same nonsense
about premarital sex.

You're lying to yourself.

Well, I don't care
what you think!

Doug and I are part of
the Opal Ring Crusade,

and this is how we choose
to express our love.

Look, Meg, A, ear sex is just unnatural,

and B, how do I say this?

Vaginal intercourse is...
It's just tops.

It's the bee's knees, Meg.

Oh, when you rattle it around
just right, oh, my God!

I mean, you remember when we had
that old car with the bad shocks

and I used to take
the old dirt road on purpose?

Meg... Meg?

I love you.

In local news,
a sexy new trend

has emerged
at James Woods High.

That's right, Tom.

It appears that students
have taken to having ear sex

in lieu of traditional
intercourse.

Over 200 reports of ear sex
have been confirmed so far,

prompting a new slogan,

"Once you go black,
you go deaf."

Brian,
I'll be right back.

I'm going to use
the little girl's room.

All right, baby.

(GROANS) An entire week
and still no teeth.

And it turns out
these teeth I got

from the old man
are phony.

Brian, Brian, look,
I'm Gary Busey.

I'm frequently aggressive

in situations
that don't call for it.

(GIRL VOMITING)

What the hell is that?

Ah, it's Jillian.

She's, uh... She has
this eating disorder.

She's bulimic.

My God, that's horrible!

I know, it really is.

I mean, her hair
is falling out.

Last week she
lost a tooth.

Really?

But man, I'll tell ya,
all that purging

just makes her body
look fantastic.

I mean, that's what
the supermodels do.

And so many of them
just look so great.

(VOMITING CONTINUES)

Karen Carpenter
overdid it,

but I think Jillian's
found a good balance.

I'm really surprised you invited me out
for dinner, Stevie.

Oh, well, you know,
I just wanted to touch base,

see how everything's...
It's "Stewie," by the way.

Just to check in, make sure
everything's going well

with you and Brian.

It's going kickass!

Well, you look
fantastic.

Got some meat on your bones,
which is great.

What?

Just saying
you look jolly,

like Ruben Studdard
or John Goodman or Santa.

Oh, my God. Are
you saying I'm fat?

No, I'm saying
Santa's thin.

-Get in there and throw up!
-(GASPS)

Excellent. Now I'm prepared
to fight the Tooth Fairy

just like Gerri fought comedy
on The Facts of Life.

Hey, Blair, did you find
a purse at the mall?

Actually, I
found seven.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

One for every day
of the week.

(AUDIENCE GROANS)

I'm wide awake, Peter.

You want to
mess around?

Lois, you know
I'm abstinent.

(SCOFFS) Come on.

Can't you break your stupid
pledge for one night?

Well, I guess we
do both have needs.

(BOTH COOING)

Oh, Peter.

(LOIS LAUGHS)

Wh-What are you doing?

What? Peter, what are
you doing to my ear?

Get off of me!

What the hell
is wrong with you?!

This is all I can do,
Lois; I'm abstinent.

That is it.

I am going to have
regular sex with you

whether you like it or not.
No!

I wasn't asking
your permission.

No, no, no!
I'm abstinent!

This is an affront
to the Lord!

No! No!

(WEEPING)

No!

Oh, I see what
you're driving at.

Oh, that was fantastic.

Hey, when'd you get that tattoo
on your lower back?

I don't know, Peter.

-Meth is a hell of a drug.
-What?

I'm just glad to have
you back on my side.

I only wish I could convince Meg and her
classmates, too.

We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.

I'll be more convincing
than Mel Gibson

when he apologized to the Jews.

I'm really, really sorry
about your big noses.

I'm really sorry
about how greedy you are.

But most of all,
I'm really sorry

about your dirty, underhanded,
backstabbing ways.

Your number-one dirty Jew fan,
Mel Gibson.

(LOW HUMMING)

All right, Tooth Whore,
do your worst.

(ALARM RINGING) Aha!

Stewie, what the hell?
Get me down from here.

No, way, man! How
do I know you're

not the Tooth Fairy
in disguise?

Your middle name
is Gilligan. Not good enough!

You think my girlfriend's
a moron.

So does everyone!

You have a picture
of Chris Noth in your wallet.

Okay.

Stewie, this is ridiculous.

There's something
I have to tell you.

The Tooth Fairy
isn't real.

What?

Look, I didn't want
to burst your bubble

since you're just a kid,

but, yeah, she's all smoke
and mirrors

just like Harry Houdini.

But I don't want
to play bridge

with the Petersons
tonight.

Harry, we agreed weeks ago,
and we're going.

All right, fine,
let me get my coat.

Oh, wait a second!

Damn it! I am not going
by myself!

Ah, you bitch.

Oh, very well then.

I suppose that bile-
spewing skirt of yours

can have her tooth back.

What? It's gone!

Whoa, I wonder
what happened to it?

(SNIFFING)

Ah...

(BLEEP) yeah!

Peter, how are we going
to get past the guard?

Lois, I think I
just got an idea.

You see that guy
with the overcoat?

He's tall enough for us to sneak
in behind him.

Come on!

So remember, sex is bad,
immoral, and wrong.

And if you have sex,

you're automatically
in Al Qaeda.

Kids, do not listen to this man.

He is wrong.
He is feeding you lies.

Now, look, it's true.

You shouldn't have sex
until you're ready.

You should wait
until you're in love.

But I mean, hey,
we're all human, huh?

We have urges,
and they are perfectly natural.

And if you do make the choice
to act on them,

make sure you protect
yourselves,

use a condom.

I'm going to
use condoms.

Me, too!

Maybe I'll use two
condoms at the same time.

Why would you do that?

Oh, I mean, just
one, just one.

Doug, my mom's right.

If we really care
about each other,

it's okay to have sex.

We'll be safe.

We'll use a condom,
and it'll be wonderful.

Wow! Does this mean
I'll see you naked?

-Yeah.
-Oh, boy, I can't wait.

I'm sorry Doug
dumped you, honey.

It's all your fault!

I'm proud of you,
sweetheart.

Me, too, Lois.

You stood up
for what you believe in.

I just wish
I could have been there

to hear the speech you made.

You think you could
give me a little taste?

Oh, that's perfect.

Brian, we have to go
down there this weekend

and heckle her roundly.

I'll humiliate her worse
than Luke Skywalker did

to that Rebel pilot.

The exhaust shaft is only
two meters wide,

so you'll have to use
proton torpedoes.

Well, that's impossible.
Even for a computer.

It's not impossible.

I used to bull's-eye wamprats
in my T-16 back home.

They're not much bigger
than two meters.

Hey, uh, can-can I talk to
you privately for a second?

Sure.

That, uh, that was unnecessary.

What's the problem?

Well, you just
kind of called me out

in front of everybody back there.

-I was just making a point.
-I know, I know,

but you like just kind of
sandbagged me in front

-of everyone we know. Oh, oh,
-I sandbagged you?

In front of all of
our friends, yeah,

you sandbagged me.

I sandbagged you.
You sandbagged me, yes.

Well, here I am trying
to help you with something.

You know what, you know
what, you know what,

I don't need your kind
of help, all right?

Have a great assault.

Jerk.

Lois, I don't understand
why I got to sit through

a chick flick.

Peter, you promised
you'd come with me

to see Autumn's Piano.

Besides, you owe me big after
the way you embarrassed me

in front of Sandra Oh.

Oh, my God, Sandra Oh.

-We loved you in <i>Sideways.</i>
-Thank you.

We see you in many movies.

I think about you
while having sex with my wife.

I thank you with one dollar.

That's a lot of money to them.

Lois, I'm just warning you,

if this movie turns me gay,

I'm going to start
bringing gay guys home.

And I don't mean the classy,
"Maybe they are,

maybe they're not," gay guys.

I mean those big, "Oh, my God,

"here they come, floatin' around,

making noise" gay guys,

not the "fix up your house" gay guys.

Peter, shh, it's starting.

You must be Autumn Daniels.

welcome to Barncliffe
school for girls.

We're your roommates: I'm Sassy,

that's Pouty,
and this is Suicidy.

I got a bad feeling
about Suicidy.

<i>Ain't no mountain</i>

(LAUGHING) Yeah!

You can tell all the girls
care about each other,

'cause they have so much
fun cleaning the dishes.

AUTUMN: I have to leave,

and I'm taking my piano with me.

No! Why?

Why?

She chose the piano
over her insulin.

You could've had both.

(CRYING)

See? That wasn't so bad.

Oh, you know, Lois,

this movie has helped me
understand a lot of things.

Like that foreign guy at work

who helped me
understand sarcasm.

Huh, nice day
we're having.

-Oh, ho-ho! Yes!
-What?

He say "Nice day,"

-but he covered with rain.
-So?

So, he say this when your brain
know is not really nice day.

-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Ha-ha. Yes.

He say the opposite.
Is funny.

Oh, yeah, I get it.

-"Nice day."
-Oh, ho ho.

Now you funny, too.

Oh...

There she is, Brian.

Oh, boy, I am going to
take her down right

in front of everybody.

All right, Olivia, get ready to...

-Good Lord.
-What is it?

Brian, she looks...

She looks fantastic.

And now TV's Olivia Fuller
will cut the ceremonial ribbon.

I hope I'm allowed to do this.

Oh, my God.

Wow, this is... It's been a while.

Yeah, no, it has.

Uh, what, so you back in town?

Yeah, we're, um, uh,

we're moving back
into the old house.

Oh, that's, wow... God,
you look great, I mean,

y-you're all, you're
all in shape.

My God, California's
been good to you.

I mean, I guess, I guess
you should be looking good

'cause everybody's a health
nut out there, right?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Yeah.

Well, anyway, it was
nice seeing you again,

-so...
-You t... Hey, uh, listen, um,

maybe you want to
come over on Friday,

it's, it's my
"Bernie Mac" night.

Um, it's a fun show
if you haven't seen it.

I can't understand what
the devil he's saying,

but you know, there's,
there's a lot of movement,

and it's bright
and colorful,

it keeps my attention.

Look, Stewie, you're sweet,

but since I moved to Hollywood,

I've done a lot of growing up.

I'm dating more sophisticated men now.

But it was good to see you.

What happened?

She shot me down, Brian.

What do you care?

You came here to gloat
about her contract cancellation anyway.

Yes, but that was before
I got a look at her face.

I mean, she's a woman
now, Brian.

So sophisticated,
so grown up,

and she says
she wants a grown-up man.

But, apparently,
that's not me.

Ya think so?

I love it.

Would Howard Hesseman lie

We don't think so. Order now.

There we go.

You are ready for your date.

Yeah, that's a bed head.

Yeah, hey, look at you,
you just got out of bed.

You're the underachiever every
woman wants to sleep with.

Hey, big date tonight?

Uh, yeah, yeah.

Hey, listen, I'm, uh,

sorry about Olivia
rejecting you.

Oh, I haven't given
up yet, Brian.

She says she wants a more
mature, grown-up man,

so all I've got to do
is be more grown-up.

-What are you doing? Just cleanin' out
-your brush, man.

(doorbell rings)

Hi, Jillian.

Hi, Brian, ready to go?

Hey, baby.

Hi, Stewie.

What the hell are you doing?

Eh, not much, really.

Just me and my pubes,
ha...ngin' out.

Oh, dear God.

Boy, I am so beat

from doing adult stuff all day.

So am I.

I, just kind of feel like
kickin' it tonight.

Oh, look at that.
I'm growing all the time.

-Hey, uh, Jillian, can you give
-me a minute?

You ever just let
your balls hang out, B-Ri?

You ever do that,
B-Roney?

Drove my Chevy to the levee,
but the levee was Bri?

Give me my hair back.

Ow! What the hell, man.

Stewie, this is not
going to convince Olivia

that you're grown-up
enough for her.

Oh, yeah, what do you
know about women?

You want to know
how to get women?

There's only one place
in town you need to observe.

Just watch.

I am not doing
that, Glenn.

Come on, beautiful,
keep an open mind.

You're a sick man.

Hey, keep it down.
I don't want my neighbors

seeing a fat, old,
dirty whore screaming at me

on my front lawn.
Whore?

Well, maybe I
should come inside.

Well, maybe you should.

What the deuce?

Why the hell would
she respond positively

to such a negative comment?

Unless...

Brian, do women like it

when you treat
them like crap?

Well, I-I don't know
if you want to be

that black-and-white
about it.

That's it, isn't it?

Women respond when you treat
them like crap.

Well, Olivia, prepare to meet
a much darker Stewie Griffin.

Hey, babe.

What do you say,
we going out Saturday night?

Stewie, what are
you doing here?

I told you, I'm just into
a different type of guy.

Oh, yeah? I'll tell you
what you're into.

Being ugly.
Stewie, you're being mean.

No. If I was being mean,

when you opened the door
I would have said,

"Oh, hey, Ray Liotta,
is Olivia home?

Oh, wait, you're Olivia."

You see, I thought
you were Ray Liotta

because your skin
has the texture

of a decorative
autumn squash.

(crying)

So, I'll pick you up
at 7:00?

That sounds wonderful.

She said yes.

My God, I'm cooler than that
cheetah from the commercials.

(Rush's "Tom Sawyer" playing)

(grunts)

Oh, God, there is no (bleeping)
drummer better than Neil Peart!

It ain't easy bein' cheesy.

Oh Smilla,

your sense of snow is equaled
only by your sense of love.

Peter, have you
been up all night

watching chick movies?

Lois, before I found
these movies,

women only made me cry
through my penis.

Now they make me cry
through my eyes.

I've decided.

I'm making my own chick flick.

What? You don't
know anything

about making movies.

Are you kidding? I got lots of
experience in the film industry.

I was the original
"Pretty Woman."

You look beautiful,
but there's something missing.

(cackling laughter)

This is a beautiful
spot, Stewie.

I know. I love coming
here because you can just

sit here
and people-watch, you know?

Oh, oh, look at this.
Look at this guy.

-Look at this. Wha-What is that?
-What is he doing?

Just standing there
sm-smelling his hand?

(laughs)
"Wha-What is that?

"What is that
on my hand?

"Is that... is that
barbecue sauce?

When was I near
barbecue sauce?"

-(laughs): Oh, look, look!
-Jewish cowboy!

Jewish cowboy!
Yeah.

Not gonna be so
tough when

the sun goes
down, are you?

(both laugh)

Better go rassle up
some Chinese food,

Hopalong Nussbaum.

(both laugh)

You know, Stewie,
I'm really glad

I gave you
another chance.

-You're a really special guy.
-I know.

No, no, I'm kidding--
I'm not really

that self-centered,
but, you know, Olivia,

I can't think
of anyplace I'd rather be

than right here,
right now with you.

Oh, look at this guy.

Now, there's someone
who cuts his own hair.

Yeah, no kidding.
Oh, my God.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, check
out this uptight

Asian guy,
look at that.

<i>I work really hard,</i>
<i>'cause I'm no fun.</i>

(imitates gong)

(laughing)

Boy, this is-- this
is a great city.

I don't care what
anybody says.

I know. Look
at that sunset

against the skyline.

I know. Wow,
look at that.

A perfect end
to a perfect day.

Yeah. Well, we should
probably get home.

This area gets really
dangerous at night.

(metal clanking, roaring)

Okay, everyone, welcome
to the first day

of shooting for Steel Vaginas.

Peter, this movie doesn't
seem to make any sense.

It makes perfect sense, Lois.

This the scene where
our heroine, Vageena Hertz,

is told by Dr. McNugget here

that she has
uncurable chick cancer.

-All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair
-and shoot this thing.

Peter, I can't lose
the wheelchair.

I need it to move.

Okay, yeah, but your
character can walk.

Peter, I'm handicapped.
I can't walk.

Okay, Chris, roll film.

And... action!

Joe, get out of
the damn chair.

Chris, get the
cattle prod.

(zaps)
(screams)

Okay, now give him
some peanut butter

so we can make it
look like he's talking.

God, I hate
these things.

Sweetie, can't you
just have a good time?

-I don't know anybody. These are
-all your friends.

Just relax. Have some
cake or something.

Hey, hey, who do
we have here?

Oh, my God! Victor?

Hey, kiddo,
how are you?

Great! Great! Wow!

Stewie, this is Victor.

We did a Flintstones vitamins
commercial together.

-BOTH: Ten million strong
-and growing!

Oh, yeah, good to-
good to meet you.

How are you?
Victor's such a good actor.

He played a dead baby
on CSI: Miami.

Yeah, I-I'm more
into writing now.

Oh, hang on a sec.
Uh, idea for a short story:

guy picks his nose,
then eats it.

Yeah, good luck with that.
Uh, hey, uh, Olivia,

why don't you and I
go get some punch?

Oh, actually,
would you mind getting some

for Victor and me
while we catch up?

Or-or a third option.

-Why doesn't Victor go get some punch
-for you and me?

Or maybe you and I
could go away

from Victor and
go get the punch?

Or-or none of us
could have punch.

But still Victor
could go away.

Victor, would you
excuse us for a second?

Uh, sure.
Idea for a novel:

guy loses
his favorite blankie,

goes looking for it
and finds it in the kitchen.

Is that--
I amaze myself.

Is that-- I-It's genius.
It's unbelievable.

I don't know
where I get it from.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

You're acting like a jerk.
Oh, I'm acting like a jerk?

What about Phony Curtis
over there?

He happens to be
a very intelligent, successful actor.

And, you know, he's
done three national diaper commercials.

Yeah, let's put a
diaper on his face.

That's where the
crap is coming out. You don't own me.

I can talk
to whoever I want.

I don't see a ring
on my finger.

(wedding bells ringing)

I, Stewie, take
you, Olivia,

to be my lawfully
wedded wife.

Uh, what's
that, Rupert?

Oh, oh, kiss the
bride. Yes.

(congregation oohs)

Hi, honey! I'm home!

Hi, sweetie, how
was your day?

Well, I was an astronaut
for a while,

then I was a cowboy,
and then all afternoon

I was a fireman,
so it's been, uh...

it's been a long one.

Uh, what's for dinner?

Playdoh spaghetti.

Oh.
What?

No. No, I-It's nothing.

Just had Playdoh
spaghetti last night.

And that's all
we had last night.

What does that mean?

Oh, I don't know,
Olivia. Uh, maybe

that we are
in a sexless marriage.

We have yet
to have sex.

Do you even know
what sex is?

That's not the poi--
Don't change the--

-It's a kind of cake? Look, can we
-just drop this

-and have a normal pretend dinner?
-Fine, fine!

Uch, some days
I think it was easier

being Q-Bert's roommate.

God, it's all night
with this guy.

Hey, if you're gonna leave
all those lights on,

I'm not gonna split
the electric bill.

-(sighs): Sorry we're
-late, everyone,

but JonBenet here took
forever with her makeup.

Uh, yes, and we
probably would've shaved

a few minutes off our trip,
but Mr. Cheapo here

refused to let the valet
touch his Big Wheel,

so we had to drive
around the block six times

till we could
find a spot.

-But to his credit, it is a great spot
-to get mugged.

Oh, wouldn't that
be a shame, if they took all my money

out of both
our wallets.

Well, it's just good
to have you guys here.

Can I get you folks
something to drink?

Uh, yes, I'll just
have flat water.

Um, do you have
Hi-C Tropical Punch?

And it begins...

What? I can't have
a drink with dinner?

-Oh, so dinner started at 2:00 this
-afternoon, did it?

Yes, about the same time

you decided to hole up
in the bathroom

for three hours
waxing your eyebrows.

You swore you
would never--

I have a
prominent brow,

and I do what I
can to get by.

-Well, hey, what's important
-is that you're here now.

Let's just enjoy dinner.

Yeah, can't we just
have a good time?

Uh, ask Olivia.
Olivia, the three of us

are having a great time.
What's your problem?

My problem is you.

You're acting like a baby.

And we come
to the center

of the shrubbery maze.

That's what it all
comes down to, isn't it?

I'm not grown up
enough for you.

Well, you are a
baby, aren't you?

Stay out of it.
Stay out of it.

Well, if you
think I'm a baby,

then perhaps I should
act like a baby.

Waaaah! Waaaah!
Waaaah!

-MAN: Hey, could you
-keep that kid quiet?

Oh, oh, oh,
what's that?

What's that, sir?
What's that?

I-I'm sorry, am I
being too loud for you?

You wanna come
over here and quiet me down?

Oh, let's
not do this.

Oh, God.
Stewie, come on.

I'm scared.
No, it's okay. It's okay.

-Sir? You feel strong? You wanna
-come over here?

-MAN: No, I want to stay here
-and have my steak.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

-What is that, the porterhouse?
-Yeah.

How is it?
What do you care?

If we weren't fighting,
would you recommend it?

Yeah, I would.

(singsongy): Well, I know
what I'm getting.

Hello, everyone.

Well, here we are--
opening night.

You know, somebody once told me

that making movies was easy.

Yeah. Yeah, you know
what else is easy?

Open heart surgery.

MAN:
Oh-ho-ho! Yes!

Yeah, th-thanks
for coming, Fuad.

Oh! Is funny because
open heart surgery

not easy at all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Calm down, Fuad.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

So, without further dudes, ah,

-let's, uh, watch this thing. FUAD:
-Oh-ho-ho.

-PETER: At first I didn't believe
-in women and unicorns,

but that was before I knew
about the power of chick stuff,

and before I knew
Vageena Hertz.

(thuds)
CLEVELAND: Sorry.

When Vageena was first born,

I had a small heart
and a lot to learn.

Push, honey!
Hurry up

and give me
my baby boy!

(squishing)

-(whispering): Cleveland, more
-Spaghetti-O's.

Oh, good, a baby.

Oh, no, it's a girl.

And I hate girls.

But one day,
Vageena went swimming

too soon after eating
a sandwich...

and this happened.

Help! Help! I'm drowning!

(coughing):
Help!

We gotta get this woman
to surgery time.

Right stat now!

But it was too late.

And she died
from an angry hymen.

Fin.

-(weak applause) Wow, that was
-the worst

piece of crap
I've ever seen.

Oh, horrible.
Oh, my God,

that was an
abomination.

That was awful.
Awful.

Awful, awful.

My ass is actually sore.

Hey, where's Olivia?

Oh, she's probably
up at the house.

Stewie?
Yeah?

-It's not your fault.
-What?

It's not your fault.

I know.

It's not your fault.

I know.

No, Stewie, Stewie.
It's not your fault.

Don't do this
to me, man.

Not you, man.
It's not your fault.

Screw you!
Cut it out, man!

It's not your fault.

(crying):
Why is it so hard?

I didn't know it was
gonna be so hard.

(crying)

Look, Stewie, you
stood up before God

and all your toys
and you took an oath

to stick it out when
things got tough.

You want her to see
you as an adult?

Well, this is adulthood.

You're right, Brian.

I can't hide
from this relationship.

It's my responsibility
to deal with it.

I mean, what kind
of a man would I be

if I ran off now?

Well, you'd be
a black man.

Wow! Wow!

Whoa, what was that?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

That was my
father talking.

You, uh...

you gotta work
on that, man.

Bad dog.

Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I...

(all gasping)
Oh, Stewie! I-I thought

you were at Chuck E. Cheese
with your mom.

No. A four-year-old died
in the ball pit.

We had to cancel.

Is that the Silly Putty
I bought you this weekend?

Stewie, this isn't
what it looks like.

Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie,
I-I just dropped by to...

Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody
talking to you.

Is... that
the Silly Putty...

I bought you
this weekend?

I, you know,
I-I'm really,

I'm sensing something
here, that, uh...

-I-I should be going. No, how about you
-stay here

and I leave and never
come back again?

Stewie, this isn't
how I wanted it to end.

But you did
want it to end.

You've made
that perfectly clear.

Uh, listen, are-are you
gonna be all right?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

(sniffs):
Is that smoke? (gasping)

Idea for a farce:

cheating wife
and pompous ass burned alive.

(maniacal laughter)

So what happened?

Well, you wanna know what
I learned this week?

Being a grown-up sucks.

Women, Brian. What a
royal pain in the ass.

It's like, it's
like, why can't

you just hang out
with guys, you know?

Just live with someone
of your own sex.

Just do what you
would do with women,

but with your buddy, you know, w-why don't
guys just do that?

They do, it's
called being gay.

Oh, that's what gay is?

Oh, yeah, I could
totally get into that.

Good God, Joan Wilder's sister
is being held hostage

in Cartagena, and there's
not a policeman in sight.

I guess it's up to me.

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

And I'm Diane Simmons.

Our top story,
Mayor West has dispatched

the entire Quahog police force
to Cartagena, Columbia,

to assist in the rescue of fictional
1984 movie character, Elaine Wilder.

More on that later.

Now let's go to Ollie Williams'
Cooking Corner.

-What are you making, Ollie?
-Eggo!

Thanks, Ollie. And now this.

PETER: Lois, can you come
out here for a second?

(GASPS)

Hey, Lois, can you run inside
and get me some oranges

or whatever it is
these things eat?

Peter, what is that?

Uh, this would be a giraffe,
Issac Newton.

I stole it from the zoo.

What with Mayor West sending
all the cops away,

everybody can do whatever
they want.

Peter, I don't care what
Mayor West has done.

You can't just break the law.

Sure, I can.
I've been doing it all week.

Like yesterday, I started
a lovable gang

of cockney pickpockets.

All right, boys,
the best targets are old, rich people.

There's one now. Go get him.

Oh, no, there's no police
here to help me!

I hope you don't find the money
strapped to my thigh.

Peter, you take that thing back
where it belongs immediately.

All right, I guess we gotta go back

to the zoo, Allison Janney.

Allison Janney?

QUAGMIRE:
Oh, good morning, honey.

That feels really good.

What... Hey! Hey! Hey!
What the hell?

You're not the same giraffe
from last night.

Get out of here.

What the hell?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

I gotta stop taking my baths

during Peter's shenanigans.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

Oh, hey, Jillian. What's up?

Brian, are you coming over
to watch Laguna Beach tonight?

Uh, what time does it start?

10:00 Eastern
and Specific time.

What?

What did you say?
Specific time?

Don't you mean Pacific Time?

No, I think it's called
Specific time.

They mean it starts
specifically at 10:00.

-(STEWIE LAUGHING)
-Stewie, are you on the line?

Yes.

Jillian, I'll talk to you later.

(SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY)

Uh, so...

Meg,

how was school?

Horrible.

There's a dance Friday night
and no one wants to go with me.

Even my backup guy had plans.

Hi, Jimmy.

Um, I heard you didn't
have a date to the dance,

and I was wondering if
you'd like to go with me.

Oh, uh, I, uh... Hang on.

(TWO GUNSHOTS)

I'd love to go, Meg,
but I have to go

to my little brother's
funeral that night.

Aw, I'm sure you'll find
someone to go with you.

No, I won't.

I'm so fat and gross.

Aw...

I should just kill myself.

Aw, that's... Come on.

I'm gonna do it.

I'm gonna kill myself 'cause
no one will go with me.

Aw...

Meg, stop it. Come on.

All right, all right, Meg, look,

what if I... What if I drove you
and walked in with you or whatever?

(GASPS) Brian, will you
go with me?

Are you going to kill
yourself if I don't?

Yeah.

Well, then my hands
are pretty much tied.

Oh, Brian, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

Oh, I have to buy a new dress.

All the ones I have
make me look fat.

Aw...

The story on everyone's mind
continues to be the absence

of police officers in Quahog.

Sir, as a citizen,
how has this affected you?

The police are gone?

Oh, my God, we're finally safe!

<i>Freedom you see</i>

<i>Has got our hearts</i>
<i>singing so joyfully</i>

<i>Just look about</i>

<i>You owe it to yourself</i><i>to check it out</i>

<i>Can't you feel</i><i>a brand-new day?</i>

<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

<i>Can't you feel a brand-new day?</i>

Hey, Joe, where you been?

We haven't seen you in days.

Ever since Mayor West
deployed the police

to Cartagena, I've been working nonstop.

The only reason I didn't
have to go myself

is that South America isn't
wheelchair accessible.

Hey, you guys, we
should help Joe out.

We could be cops, right, Joe?

Well, we have started
an emergency training program

at the Police Academy,

but I'm not sure that you're
cut out for the job.

Come on, we'll be great cops.

Besides, it's bound to go better
than my deep-sea training.

Well, we've got long time
in this decompression chamber.

You guys mind if I turn on the radio?

(HISSING) Peter, don't!

Oh, nice going, jackass.
Look what you did.

Hey, hey, excuse the hell out of me

for trying to brighten
your day with music, all right?

You idiot, use your brain.

You're an idiot.

(ALL SHOUTING)

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

Oh, man, we're going to need
some butter or something.

Oh, Brian, it is so nice of you

to take Meg to this dance.

It really means a lot to her.

You got any weed?

I put it in your coat pocket.

Here she is.

Brian, I present to you your polished turd
for the evening.

How do I look, Brian?

Aw, you sure do, Meg.

FYI, the carpet matches the drapes

in color and length.

Well, Brian, here we go.

Oh, this is going to be so much fun.

God, this is going
to be a long night.

Oh, Brian, let's dance.

This song kicks ass.

<i>Hold on to the night</i>

<i>Hold on to the memories</i>

Man, I got to tell ya, I can see
why you'd be insecure, Meg.

Some of these chicks are unbelievable.

Brian, can I ask you something?

Are you drinking so much
because you don't want to be here?

No, no, Meg.

It's... That's...

My God, look at these chicks.

You know, the best thing
about these girls is,

even if you're terrible,
they don't know the difference.

You know, Meg, there's
no dogs allowed here,

so you're going to have to leave.

But Brian can stay.

(CHUCKLES)

You know, Connie, I think
I have a theory

about why you're such a bitch.

-Excuse me?
-Brian, let's just go.

No, no, no, no, no. Now hang on,
hang on, Meg, hang on.

You see, Connie, you're popular
because you developed early

and started putting out
when you were 12.

But now you can't stand
to look at yourself in the mirror

because all you see is a whore.

So, you pick on Meg to avoid
the inevitable realization

that once your body's
used up by age 19,

you're going to be
a worn-out, chalky-skinned burlap sack

that even your step-dad won't want.

How's that? Am I in the ballpark?

(CRYING)

Brian, that was amazing.

No one's ever stood up
for me like that.

Hey, no problem.

She's a... She's a skank.

You know, you don't...

You don't deserve all the crap you get,
Meg, you know that?

Thanks, Brian.

<i>Tell me why...</i>

(RETCHING)

Sorry, that was the booze, not you.

You gonna eat that?

Oh, yes, the day can begin.

Good morning, Brian.

Now we can do this
one of two ways.

I can bust your balls
to pieces right now,

or we can spread it out
over the course of the day.

I don't want to talk about it.

Well, I do, so tell me everything
that happened at the dance.

Morning, cutie.

Uh, hey.

I had so much fun last night, Brian.

Hey, I thought maybe we could
go get some coffee later.

I don't think so.

Oh, come on, who's a good boy?

Who's a good boy, huh?
Who's a good boy?

Me.

Oh, yes, yes, yes,
who's a good boy?

I am. I'm a good boy.

But no, no, no, look, look...

-I got stuff to do today.
-All right? Sorry.

Well, we should hook up anyway.

I'll bug you later.

Well, she seems to have
taken a shine to you, Brian.

With a little encouragement,

you might get her to put
her cankles behind her ears.

Stewie, shut up.

(PHONE BUZZING)

Who the hell is texting me at 8:00 a.m.?

Wait a minute.

Something did happen last night.

Look, it's, it's not that
big a deal, all right?

We just... We just made out a little.

Ahhh! Tell me about it! Go.

It didn't mean anything.

I had a few too many and

it's not even worth going into.

Oh, this is even a bigger jackpot

than when the Emperor
figured out the formula

for great Star Wars dialogue.

(SONOROUSLY) Something, something,
something, dark side.

Something, something, something,
complete.

Well, this is it.

Our first day of Police Academy IV.

Welcome to the Police Academy.

We're going to start by learning
how to do a cavity search.

Peter, you will be the police officer

and Quagmire, you will be the suspect.

Begin.

Sir, I suspect you are in
possession of drugs,

and I'm going to have to give
you a full cavity search.

Drop your pants.

JOE: Uh, Peter, you don't have
to pull your pants down.

Oh, sorry. I'm still learning.

All right, start the search.

I think that's everything.

MAN:
You want me to double-check?

Hi, honey.

What?

I was thinking about our kiss last night.

I never knew how flat
and wide your tongue was.

Yeah.

You know, I thought about how you stood up
for me at the dance,

and all the nice things you said.

We should totally
be boyfriend and girlfriend.

Well, Meg, uh, you know what's
strange?

I think I might be gay.

Um, I saw this penis
on the Internet today

and I thought to myself,

"Well, that's just fine."

I'm going to the mall later.

Maybe you can come and help me pick out
some underwear.

Uh, I don't think that's gonna be
a possibility.

I have plans, um,

with Chris./

-Chris and I have plans this afternoon.
-We do?

Yeah, yeah, we're doing,
we're doing that thing.

We're doing what you usually do

on a Thursday afternoon.

Masturbate?

That's it.
That's what we're doing together.

Well, maybe back to back,
but I gotta tell you

I'm not 100% on this.

Oh, there's the cute prom couple.

Hi, Mom. Is it cool

if Brian and I go
to the mall this afternoon?

Actually, I thought I was pretty clear.

Oh, of course it's okay.

Ever since that dance, you two have become
such good friends.

Who would have thought?

Oh, we're more than friends, Mom.

Last night at the dance, Brian...

Last night, we decided to be best friends.

Right, Meg? Come on. Let's go to the mall.

We'll get ya, get ya a big ol' pretzel.

I want a pretzel, too!

CHRIS: Brian, I'm ready?
You in or out?

Everyone, this is Brian.

Oh, this is Brian.

He does look like Ben Affleck.

He looks just like Ben Affleck.

-Is that Ben Affleck?
-Hey.

So, how did you guys meet?

I'm, uh, a friend of her dad's.

Ooh, he's older.

He's cute.

Do you have a brother?

Makeup and stickers
and ponies and mySpace.com.

Brian's the first serious
boyfriend I've ever had.

Uh, Meg, can I talk
to you for a second?

Look, this has gone a little too far.

I like you. I think you're great,

but what happened at the dance was...

I mean, that kiss was just a mistake.

Oh, no. Did I do something wrong?

Was it because I didn't sniff
your butt first?

What? No!

I mean, yes, that's, that's how I would
know you're interested,

but Meg, the fact is that
you and I are friends,

and that's the way it needs to stay.

Besides, I have a girlfriend.

I'm dating Jillian.

All right, Brian. I understand.

Good. I'm gonna grab Stewie,

and then we can go.

What's that, Brian?
Oh, you were just kidding.

I know you were. I love you, too, Brian.

And you love me.
You do love me, Brian.

Hey, Brian.

Oh, Meg, hey.

Hey, listen, I hope
you're feeling all right

about out little talk the other day.

You know, about us being
just friends and all.

Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

And hey, look, I wanted to thank you
for being so great to me.

So, I baked you a pie.

Oh, wow.

Hey, that looks delicious.

Mmm, oh, this is good.
What's in there?

Well, there's some
apples and some cinnamon

and my hair. What?

My hair's in the pie, Brian.

And now it's inside of you.

Part of me is inside of you, Brian.

Do you feel me, Brian?

Do you feel me inside of you?

Ooh, you got some pie, huh?

-Can I have a piece?
-Uh, sure.

Ooh, let me have
some of that Cool "Hwhip"?

What'd you say?

You can't have a pie
without Cool Hwhip.

Cool Hwhip?

-Cool Hwhip, yeah.
-You mean Cool Whip.

-Yeah, Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

-Cool Hwhip.
-You're saying it weird.

Why are you putting so much emphasis
on the "H"?

What are you talking about?
I'm just saying it, Cool Hwhip.

You put Cool Hwhip on pie.

Pie tastes better with Cool Hwhip.

-Say "whip."
-Whip.

Now say Cool Whip.

-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

-Cool Hwhip.
-You're eating hair!

-Well, Lois, I am now a graduate of the
-Quahog Police Academy.

and an official on-duty cop.

-(PURRS) I can't believe
-I'm married

to a big, scary police officer.

Just keep your eyes
on the eggs, ma'am.

(SHRIEKS) Yes, officer!

(SHRIEKS)

You are such a dirty cop.

Don't break those yolks, ma'am.

Oh, my God, Lois, I hit you!

I know. Now stick your finger in there
and twist it!

Hey, uh, Lois, can I talk to you
for a second?

I think we may have a problem with Meg.

You're telling me.

She's been locked in her room all day.

Who knows what she's doing up there.

(MELANCHOLY ARIA PLAYING)

Yeah, well, the thing is,

Meg is becoming a little enamored
with me,

and I'm kind of
losing control of the situation.

Oh, she's just grateful
you took her to the dance.

Well, uh, I think it's more than that.

Uh, so, here's the thing,
and don't get mad.

And that part I can't stress enough.

That's a great shirt, by the way.

Um, I may have made out with Meg.

-(GRUNTS)
-Okay, I had that coming.

What the hell is wrong with you,
you sick bastard?

Look, I was drinking...

Oh, what a shock!

Oh-oh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

Look, the short version
is, this morning,

she made me eat the hair in her pie.

No, it's not what you think.

Stewie had some, too.

Stop punching me!

Look, Brian, I don't know

what the hell happened
between you two,

but you'd better go upstairs
and straighten it out right now.

Ugh! This is even worse
than when you ate that bubblegum

out of the garbage.

Brian, did you get into the garbage
last night?

Uh, no. Why?

Don't lie to me, Brian.

I'm not lying. (FARTS)

Uh, Meg, you got a minute?

What the hell?

I made that for you, Brian.

Meg! Look, you obviously

didn't hear me yesterday,
so I'll explain it again.

And here to assist me is headmaster

of the New York School
For The Hard of Hearing,

Mr. Garret Morris.

Meg, we're not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

(YELLING) We're not boyfriend
and girlfriend!

I will never be
attracted to you.

I will never be
attracted to you!

You're acting like
a psycho bitch.

You're acting
like a psycho bitch!

Good night and have
a pleasant tomorrow.

Good night and have a
pleasant tomorrow!

I won't be ignored, Brian.

Mm, I like your ass.

Joe, I gotta tell you,

this whole cop thing ain't as exciting

as I thought it was gonna be.

When do we get to shoot
some bad guys?

Guys, it's not all about action.

It's about staying vigilant
until you're needed.

What are you doing?

I'm watching Bonnie undress.

Bonnie's your wife.

I know. I like to watch her strip

and pretend she's a woman
who I've never met,

but who looks just like Bonnie
and lives in my house.

Get naked, you strange whore!

Peter, I haven't
seen Meg or Brian since last night.

I think something may have happened.

Mom, is it bad if I saw
Meg tie up Brian

last night, put him in
the trunk of his car

and then drive away?

What? Chris,
why didn't you say anything?

I dropped the ball. I'm sorry.

I have just been
buried in paperwork

for the past 72 hours.

Oh, my God, Brian was right.

Meg really must be obsessed
with him.

Oh, Peter, we got to find them.

Don't worry, Lois, we're the police,

and we'll do our very best
to find Brian and girl Chris.

I'm really having

a great time tonight, Brian.

I can't believe you went to all
this trouble.

Well, you know me.

Oh, I do, Brian.

I know you so well.

So, are you ready?

For what?

For the fun we're gonna have, Brian.

We're gonna have fun tonight.

Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

Listen, Meg, I'm not
gonna lie to you here.

I'm a little uncomfortable.

Oh, just relax.
We're gonna be here

for a "hwhile."

Well, I don't know if... Wait. What?

We're gonna be her for a hwhile.

-A hwhile?
-Yeah, a hwhile.

You mean, a while.

-A hwhile.
-A while.

-A hwhile.
-A while.

-A hwhile.
-A while.

Brian, you're
acting "wheird."

Oh, come on. That one doesn't
even have an "H" in it.

Don't move, dirtbag!

Holy crap,
what the hell is this?

Brian, she's a teenager!

Yeah, Brian, you're doing
the same thing

that Mia Farrow
did to that Oriental guy

that Woody Allen
brought home from the circus.

Peter, hold on to that thought,

because I'm gonna
explain to you when we get home

all the things that are wrong
with that statement.

But first, Meg,
you need to let Brian go.

But, Mom, I love him!

Honey, you're just confused.

I'm not confused!

I've never been more certain
about anything in my life!

I need him!

Meg, I know that's what you think
right now, but you're...

Oh, God, I wish
I could make you understand.

You don't know what you need.

I know what she needs.

You do?

You bet. Bring her by my house

around 8:30 tonight.
I'll take care of her.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, Mr. Quagmire. Mom said I should
come over here.

Have a seat, Meg.

Soon it'll all become clear.

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYS)

Excuse me, while I get
a little more comfortable.

Meg, I've watched you grow up
from a playful little girl

into a very special
young woman.

Now you probably just think
of me as square old Mr. Quagmire

from next door, but I've been around
the block a few times,

learned a couple things,
and I can tell you this,

there's no reason
to grow up too fast.

Teenage girls are exposed
to so much these days.

I can see why a relationship
looks glamorous,

but you've got all
the time in the world

and a lot of wonderful
experiences ahead of ya.

Hang on.
I want to give you something.

This book helped me
when I was about your age.

It let me know that as long
as I kept on rolling,

I'd find that one person
who would make me whole.

Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

You don't have to thank me.

Now get on out of here,
you little scamp.

All right, ladies, you ready for action?

We sure are, Glen.

Do you have the "hwhip"?

Got it right here... wait. What?

Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.

Coming up at 11:00,

Quahog police return
to active duty

after giving up the search

for fictitious Romancing The
Stone character Elaine Wilder.

Plus, in national news,

America's scoutmasters are asking,

"Why are the kids so shy in the shower?"

And in entertainment,

is Annette Benning made of leather?

A local tanner
has a surprising revelation.

We'll have all this and what else, Ollie?

-Sports!
-And sports.

Join us at 11:00.

Oh, Peter, you're selling your anvil?

Yeah, I've had a lot of good times
with this thing.

(CHUCKLING)

Oh, a dollar!

-Hey, there, Chris.
-Hi, Mr. Herbert.

-Selling your old hand-me-downs?
-Yep.

You got anything
you used to wear in the summertime?

-Just these old shorts.
-Sweet Jesus.

-Give you $1 for this.
-Sold.

Brian, where's Rupert?
I just left him here to watch my things.

Uh-oh.

-What?
-Nothing, I haven't seen him.

It's not like him to wander off.
Rupert? Rupert! Oh, no.

-What if he's been kidnapped?
-Well, let's just calm down.

I've got to save him, Brian.
What if he's dead?

I don't think I can handle a funeral.

Of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels, his was the most

human.

MAN: Orders.

(BAGPIPE PLAYING
<i>AMAZING GRACE)</i>

Holy crap. Evel Knievel gloves.

I bet I could do a wheelie with these.

-How much for the gloves?
-Peter, those are yours.

$10, $2, $7, $4, $5.50, $10. Sold.

Sucker. I would've gone to $15, easy.
I am so stupid.

Awesome.

Peter, you can't drive a car over that.
You're gonna get hurt.

Lois, I don't come down to Burger King
and tell you how to do your job.

Peter, I don't work at Burger...

"I don't work at Burger..." I'm busy.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some death to defy.

Wow. This is just like what happened with
Matthew Broderick, except no one's dead.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

-Hey, Joe.
-Good morning, Peter.

-I'm here to revoke your driver's license.
-What? Why?

We got reckless driving,
disturbing the peace,

plus the driver of one of those other cars
was a virgin

whose hymen was busted by the airbag,
so rape.

Okay, well, I guess
you can take my license.

-'Course, it's all the way up here.
-Peter, knock it off. Give it to me.

-Right here. Here you go, Officer.
-Give me the damn license.

Don't you want it? Here.

-This is in poor taste, Peter.
-Having some trouble there?

-You're starting to piss me off.
-All you gotta do is take it.

-You're starting to piss me off!
-It's right here.

Oh, man, this sucks. I got no license.
I can't go anywhere.

Well, this is your own fault, Peter,
and if you want my opinion,

a little time away from the bar
will do you some good.

I'll show her.
I'll just go to another bar.

<i>MAN ON TV: We now return to</i> Cheers.

<i>I can't find the on-ramp, Woody.</i>

He was talking to me, Norm. Quit stealing

That show stopped being funny
after Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.

Oh, man, now I can't even watch TV.
What the hell am I gonna do all day?

That's all right, that's okay.
I don't need TV.

I'll just make my own sitcom in my head.

And I'll give it
an upbeat '80s sitcom theme.

Why have you brought me
to the toy store, Brian?

I'm buying you another Rupert.

Hey, this one's cute, huh?

And if we buy it,
they save a real gorilla in the wild.

And if we don't, they kill one.
Wow, these guys are playing hardball.

You can't just take some Korean-made
velveteen primate and call it Rupert.

Now, come on, this is all time we could
be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.

Look, I may as well come clean with you.

Rupert wasn't kidnapped.

I accidentally sold him at the yard sale.

You son of a bitch!

(WAILING)

Come on, Stewie,
I'm really sorry. It was an accident.

Damn you, Brian.
How could you sell Rupert?

What you've done is more horrible
than sex with Sharon Stone.

Wow, that was great.

One minute I'm filling up at Chevron,

and the next
I'm having sex with Sharon Stone.

Yeah. Now comes the best part.

-Get out of the fridge, Peter.
-There is no Peter, only Zuul.

-I said get out of the fridge.
-All right, all right.

Jeez, Lois,
I'm just trying to amuse myself,

since I don't have
a damn driver's license.

Look, Peter,
it's getting a little annoying

having you around the house all the time.

So you'll be happy to know
I got you your own personal driver.

My own driver?
Holy crap, that's awesome.

-Where is he?
-She's right here, Peter.

-Meg?
-Yeah, Dad.

I don't mind driving you around
till you get your license back.

What? Lois, this is the best you could do?

Well, it was either Meg
or a talking monkey smoking a cigar,

but I didn't think you'd like that.

I've already accepted another job.

Lois, you picked the opposite thing
that I would like.

It's all right.
I would've driven you bananas.

Oh, and he makes jokes. Nice going, Lois.

Dad, are you ready?

-What exactly are you trying to do?
-It's very simple, Brian.

I've taken DNA from the dollar bill
you were paid for Rupert.

Now to check that DNA
against the federal database.

We have a match.

"Stanford Cordray, 89 Spooner Street."

Well, that's only a few blocks away.
Let's go!

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Hello? Hello?

It can't be. This house is deserted.

He moved. He's gone.

-Rupert's gone.
-Wait a minute. Look! The moving truck.

-We're not too late.
-Hey! Hey!

Can I help you, gentlemen?

Follow that truck.

Didn't you hear me?
I said, "Follow that truck."

Oh, I heard you.
What I didn't hear was "please."

-Please follow the truck.
-Please follow the truck.

I always enjoy traveling companions.

Let's play 20 questions. Am I Bo Bice?
Yes, I am.

Well played, worthy adversary.

We're gaining on him. I'm coming, Rupert.

-I'm sorry, but I can go no further.
-What? Why not?

If I enter Connecticut,

I'm entering every state
that Connecticut's ever been with.

Good luck, brave travelers.

No! We were so close.

I say, what a bit of serendipity.
Now we've got that fellow's address.

Let's see. "Aspen, Colorado."

Well, you can forget that.
We're not going all the way to Aspen.

What? But I can't leave Rupert to perish.

For the rest of my life,
I'll be as lonely as Pat Robertson

and Jerry Falwell, after the rapture.

Damn it, Jerry,
why are we the only ones still here?

I don't know.
We hated all the right things.

Now there's nothing left to hate.

-I'm gonna hate that rock.
-No, I'm gonna hate that rock.

Let's both hate that rock.

-I hate you.
-I hate you, too.

Look, Stewie.

Don't you think at some point
you're going to have to let Rupert go?

I mean, you are getting a little old
to have a teddy bear.

Brian, I'm one.

-Still?
-What?

Look, I'm not going to Colorado.
I'm turning around and going home.

Fine, then. I'll go by myself.

See you from the back of my milk carton.

Want that on your conscience, Brian?
Try explaining this to Lois.

You'll wind up in a dumpster

with a bunch of slow,
unadoptable greyhounds.

Don't joke about that.
That's like the holocaust to us.

Yeah, well, when greyhounds
start running the <i>New York Times,</i>

and the World Bank,
I'll be more inclined to believe you.

-Now, are you coming or not?
-Fine.

<i>Take to the highway</i>
<i>Won't you lend me your name</i>

-Who sings that song?
-James Taylor.

Yeah, let's keep it that way.

This sucks.

Can you believe I'm stuck with Meg
driving me around?

Dad, it's just you and me in the car.

Yeah, don't remind me.
It's bad enough I got a suspended license.

I gotta ride around town
with Stinky McPoop-Pants.

-I want apple juice.
-Dad, you left your apple juice at home.

I want apple juice!

-You wanna watch SpongeBob?
-Yes.

With apple juice.

(GROANS EXASPERATEDLY)

Thanks for the ride, Bandit.

Good luck tapping some of that
hot, hot Sally Field tail.

Knock it off.
I don't like it any more than you do.

Where the hell are we?

Oh, this is history right here, Brian.
Gettysburg. Billy Yanks.

The 20th Maine. So many lives lost.
All in pursuit of the ideal that

no man should be subjugated
because of the color of his skin.

These boys paid the ultimate price here.
For equality. For humanity.

-You're welcome.
-I'm sorry?

I'm just saying,
make it worth our while, you know?

We wrote a pretty big check
for you folks here, so...

You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine.
Doesn't matter. Just...

I just hope you're making the best
of what we gave you here.

I would say that
given the events that preceded it,

the couple hundred years or so,
maybe we're about even.

Yeah, no, no. We gave more.

Hey, Cleveland, who would you rather do?

Queen Latifah or Halle Berry,
but she's been dead for six hours?

Oh, man, that's a tough one.

God, will you guys
just shut up back there?

(ALL SNICKERING)

Gross! Would you stop it? Stop it!

Hey, guys, check this out.

-Hey, Meg, don't be such a hothead.
-What?

-Hey, Meg, you sure look hot today.
-What?

Hey, Meg, I lit your scalp on fire.

(SCREAMING)

Don't worry, I'll put it out.

(GROANING ANGRILY)

What the hell is your problem,
you dumb bimbo?

(GROWLING)

Oh! Oh, God, stop!

(SCREAMING)

Meg, that was awesome.

If we wanna get to Aspen,

we're gonna have to get over
those mountains somehow.

Excuse me, how much is it
to rent a helicopter?

It's $10 an hour.
But there's a $100,000 deposit.

Oh, God. Looks like we're walking.

Wait a minute, it says here
you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.

Well, this rental agreement
was drafted back when

musicals were culturally relevant.

Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.

Well, I can prove to you
that's a whole lot of nonsense.

Okay, you can have the helicopter.

Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains

-What?
-I said,

"Be careful 'cause the mountains

(PANTING)

Oh, my God. Brian, look.

It's Aspen. We made it.

Well, it looks like you're gonna
be reunited with Rupert after all.

And just in time, too.
I can't keep my teeth from chattering.

(CHATTERING)

Isn't that fun?

I got these at Jack's Joke Shop
in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Remember, if it ain't funny,
it ain't worth jack.

Bitch.

Why, you should have seen
what our amazing freaking daughter did

to that guy, Lois. She kicked his ass.

It was like what life did to Dana Plato.

Meg, how could you do that?
You should call that man and apologize.

Hey, hey, hey,
don't you talk to her like that.

Meg's as cool as the other side
of the pillow.

-Billy Dee Williams.
-Hello, Peter.

Welcome to the cool side of the pillow.
You've had a hard day.

Rest that weary head of yours
and drift on off to dreamland.

Works every time.

Well, this is the place.
Looks pretty fancy.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

-Can I help you?
-Yes, my name's Brian.

Look, to make a long story short,

I accidentally sold you a teddy bear
back in Rhode Island,

and I kind of need it back.

-Rupert! It's Rupert.
-Stanford, who is it?

It's nothing, dear. I'll handle it.

I'm sorry, but that bear belongs to Timmy.
Now, please leave.

-Wait, wait, how about a ski-off?
-What?

You heard me.
First one down the mountain wins.

-If I win, I get Rupert.
-Interesting. What do I get if I win?

-My dog.
-What can he do?

If you put peanut butter anywhere
on your body, he'll lick it off.

Anywhere.

Hmm, well, I did go to Choate.
All right, it's a deal.

You know, Dad, it's been really great
hanging out with you.

I know there's probably a million things
you'd rather be doing.

Are you kidding, Meg?
I've had more fun with you than I did

going to see <i>Lost in Translation</i>
with Cleveland and Quagmire.

-What do you think he whispered to her?
-I'll bet it was just right.

Look, I know sometimes I give you
a hard time. You know, calling you names,

reading your diary, farting in your cereal
when you go to get milk

and then laughing,
"She doesn't know she's eating my fart".

But, you know, Meg,
I'm starting to realize

I got a really wonderful daughter.

Thanks, Dad.

Peter, good news. Your suspension is up.
You can have your license back.

You mean it? I'm free?
No more getting driven around? Sweet.

So, I guess this means
you don't need me anymore.

You'll probably go back
to treating me like crap, huh?

Well, maybe just to keep up appearances
in front of the family.

You know, peer pressure and all that.

But from now on, Meg,
you and me are secret best friends.

-Who wants a glass of fresh lemonade?
-Not me.

What I want is a fresh glass
of better daughter.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Hey.

Stewie, do you really think
you can beat this guy?

Trust me, Brian, I've got
a few tricks up my sleeve.

Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.

Oh, wait, I totally have rockets
in my skis.

And now I just sit back,
relax and watch my progress.

-Tea, sir?
-Oh, thank you, Crone.

You're so pleasant.

-Would you like to check on the race, sir?
-Yes, why not?

(SCREAMING)

(LAUGHING)

Well, that's it, I suppose.

Listen, I'm really sorry, Stewie.
I know how much Rupert meant to you.

I don't know, Brian.
Maybe this is a sign that you were right.

Maybe I am getting too old for Rupert.

I guess I've just got to let him go.

Wow, that's very grown-up of you, Stewie.

Hey, dog, let's go.
My dad won you fair and square.

You're not really gonna live with them,
are you?

No.

-You are not really over Rupert, are you?
-No.

-That's what I thought.
-Oh, Crone.

(SCREAMING)

-How are we gonna get out of here?
-You still got the starting gun?

-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

Get out of the fucking car!
Get out of the fucking car right now, man!

-Get out of the fucking car! Do it, do it!
-Oh, my God.

-I'll do whatever you want!
-I'll fucking kill you!

Get out of the fucking car!

-BRIAN: Did we just carjack someone?
-STEWIE: We sure did, Brian. We sure did.

All right, fine, I'll come to Meg's party.

No, you have to call the RSVP line.

Well, find out, would you?

-Who is this?

-Hi, Stewie.

-What can I do for you?
-I'm coming to Meg's party.

Oh, splendid. Just give your information

-I didn't know what to tell him.
-You're asking me?

Yeah. How old is Meg?

I don't know.

Well, my God, Lois,

I thought you were the one
keeping track of that.

No, no. I have no idea.

Hey, maybe we should just cut off her leg
and count the rings.

Yeah. Or maybe try carbon dating.

-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, Meg.

Huh?

Uh, Meg, uh... I got 16 candles
for your birthday cake.

How does that sound?

That's not right.

So... Less?

More?

Too many?

Not enough?

You stupid son of a bitch!

You didn't even know how old I am!

Meg, that kind of language
is not appropriate for a girl your age.

Or is it?

I'm gonna be 17, you jerks!

She's the jerk.

All right, come on in, everybody.

Have a seat anywhere.

Meg's gonna open her presents
in a little bit.

Oh, Francis, I'm glad you could make it.

Here! Here's this for Megan!

Oh. What is it?

It's a cookie
from lunch period at the home!

Well, I'm sure she'll love this.

I want to see her eat it!

So, the man asks the bartender
to recommend a good drink.

The bartender says, "A Grasshopper."

So the guy orders a Grasshopper.

Then he's walking home and along the way,

he notices a grasshopper on the ground.

So, he says to the grasshopper,

"Hey, you know there's a drink
named after you?"

The grasshopper says,
"You mean there's a drink named Irving?"

Meg, your father worked very hard
to put this party together.

And he says he's got
a big surprise for you.

Hey, kids, I'm Peepants,
the inebriated hobo clown.

I'm an adorable tramp
who wears found clothing,

and eats out of your garbage can.

A clown? Dad, I'm 17!

Meg, guess what Peepants got you
for your birthday.

A scarf.

I don't want a scarf, Dad.

Well, then how about...

A dozen scarves?

I'm here, Dad. What is it?

Peter.

You're a fat, stinking drunk.

Oh, my God, he's dead.

He can't be dead.

There's got to be something I can do.

Maybe I'll bury him in the Pet Sematary.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Okay, I'll bury him in a regular cemetery.

I can't believe Grandpa's dead.

Well, he did kind of treat us like crap,

but, yes, it is a tragedy.

It is a tragedy.

-Excuse us.
-Yeah, we'll be right back.

-We're all gonna miss him.
-Tragic.

You know what the worst part is?

All I wanted was for my dad
to tell me he loved me.

But instead, he called me
a fat, stinking drunk.

Those were his last words.

Well, I hate to side
with your father, Peter,

but you do kind of drink a lot,

and, you know, sometimes,
it affects the people you love.

Oh, my God. Lois, you're right.

Booze made me fall down all those stairs.

Booze killed my father.

Well, from this day forward,

I, Peter Griffin, will never drink again.

-Peter, what are you doing?
-Crack.

What the (BLEEP)?

Hey, at least I'm not drinking, Brian.

Yeah, this isn't exactly
a good substitute.

Where'd you get crack?

-From Blacks.
-What?

Yeah, right behind Black's Hardware Store.

There's a white guy selling it.

Look, doing crack is not the way

you feel the need to drink,

What's a "bonner"?

Stewie, what are you doing
with my jewelry box?

You give that back to Mommy.

No! Go to hell!

Stewie, I have had just about enough
of this new selfish attitude of yours.

Now, give that back to Mommy!

Very well, then.

If I can't have it, nobody can!

-That is enough!
-(GROANS)

You... You struck me!

(GASPS) Oh, my God.

Stewie, honey, I am so sorry.

Are you okay, sweetie?

(WAILING)

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

Mommy would never hurt you.

Let me give you a hug.

(SCREAMING) No!

(SOBBING)

I haven't been this scared
since Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.

She is messed up, man!

Shut up! Just shut up!
Let me (BLEEP) think!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

-Push her out.
-We can't leave her alone.

Push the bitch out!

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Okay, now let's go back
in your mind to your childhood,

to some of your deepest memories.

Yeah, I'm getting something.

Happy Father's Day, Dad.

I'm not your father!

Oh, my God!

Francis Griffin wasn't my real father!

I wonder what else I've repressed.

Oh, my God!

I could've had a V8.

It was horrible, Rupert.

It was like a nightmare.

Lois came at me like a wild animal.

I had no way to defend myself.

Mother, I'm sorry
I went against your wishes.

(GROWLING)

Ow! Ow, ow!

I'm sorry I misbehaved, Mother!

(GRUNTING) I'm sorry I misbehaved!

-(GROWLING)
-It'll never happen again!

(WHIMPERING)

I love you, Mommy dearest!

-(GASPING)
-(GROWLING)

Oh, it was awful, Rupert.

I felt terrified and brutalized

and humiliated and... And...

And alive.

My God, I...

I haven't felt that alive in years.

Rupert, you know, I think perhaps
I may be one of those people who...

Gets a jolly out of being hit.

Oh, Stewie, there you are.

Mommy is so sorry she hit you.

I promise I will never lay a hand
on you again.

Well, let's not make any rash decisions.

I mean, I did provoke you.

Come on, Lois, hit me!
Beat the crap out of me!

Step on my cubes.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, hi, Peter.

Are you here to bring back the TV set?

No, I sold it for crack.

But listen, Mom,
I've got to ask you something.

Who's my real father?

(SIGHS) I knew this day would come.

All right, Peter, here it is.

About 40 years ago,
I was vacationing in Ireland,

and I met a young rogue
named Mickey McFinnegan.

Peter, Mickey is your real father.

Oh, my God! I gotta find him!

To Ireland!

Sweetheart, when will you be back?

I don't know, Lois.

All I know is somewhere
in the great land of Ireland,

is a big, fat bastard who looks like me.

Call me as soon as you can, Peter.

And I really hope
you find your real father.

We're gonna miss you, Dad.

Come back soon, Daddy. I love you.

That'll do, pig. That'll do.

There she is, Rupert.

Oh, if I can just get her
to hit me one more time,

it'll give me the rush
I've been looking for!

(MOANS)

(LAUGHS)

What's next? What's next? What's next?

Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty.

Oh, I need to be taught a lesson
and you're the one to do it.

-(SIZZLES)
-(SCREAMING)

Oh! Thank you!

Thank you!

Yeah, all that stuff.
Let's make that happen.

Oh, hi, sweetie. You want some juice?

Ooh, that'll be lovely.

-Oh, Stewie!
-Yeah?

(SIGHS) Look at the mess you made.

Oh, I've made a terrible mess, haven't I?

Yes, I made you take time out of your day
to clean up my mess,

and I should be punished for it. Go!

Well, I guess it's not that big a deal.

Accidents happen.

I don't know. Don't you think
you should spank me,

or slice my nostril?

It's all right, Stewie. Now go play.

All right.

Look! I've drawn heavyweight pugilist,

David Tua on the wall. Punish me!

Uh, sweetie, you've really gotta stop...

Huh, looks like David Tua...

You've really gotta stop misbehaving.

You're getting on Mommy's nerves.

Well, you know what'll ease your stress?

Slap me across the face like a bitch!

(SIGHS) It's all right.
I'll get some Windex.

Come on! Discipline me!

Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my eye,

violate me with a wine bottle.

My God,
I really do have problems, don't I?

PILOT OVER PA: <i>Welcome to Ireland.</i>

<i>We'll be landing in five minutes.</i>

This is quite a country, Brian.

You know, Ireland has more drunks
per capita than people.

Oh, that's a negative stereotype.

I don't think the Irish drink as much
as people say they do.

(BOTTLES CLATTERING)

Uh, excuse me? Is this McSwiggen Village?

Ah, dibble a man
who say a word aginit, hmm?

Is that a yes or a no?

Aye, 'tis McSwiggen Village.

Where the hills are green,
the streams are clear,

and the sweaters are so thick,

even the boniest-fingered nun
could poke you in the chest

and it wouldn't bother you none.

Don't be so bold with your dark hair
and your proud ways!

I can't feel a thing!

Hey, uh, you heard of a man
named Mickey McFinnegan?

Have I heard of him?

Of course, I've heard of him!

He's the town drunk!

Town drunk?

Oh, my God, you mean
he's the disgrace of the whole town?

(ALL LAUGHING)

You lads aren't from around here, are ya?

Top of the morning, ladies!

Let me cut you an Irish rose.

(FARTING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Whoo!

I don't know exactly
where the County Cork is,

but I know where it should be!

(LAUGHING)

Around here, the town drunk
is a person of great honor.

Uh, excuse me, sir?

-My name is Peter.
-Pleased to meet you, lad.

-Name's Mickey.
-Listen, uh...

This may be hard
for you to believe, but...

-You're my father.
-Oh, am I now?

Yeah, I came all the way
from America to find you.

I suppose it's money you're wantin'.

I owe you some allowance and so forth.

(LAUGHING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, no, I don't want money.

I just want to get to know you
and be friends,

so I can finally have a real dad
who loves and respects me.

You can't be me son.

You and me are nothing alike.

Just ask me sheep, O'Brian.

Whose leg do you have to hump
to get a pint of Guinness around here?

Boy it's amazing, isn't it?

You get two fathers,

and neither one of them
wants anything to do with you.

There's got to be some way
I can make him see

that I'm worthy of being his son.

About the only way I can ever impress him
is if I was a fat, stinkin' drunk.

FRANCIS:<i> Peter!</i>
<i>You are a</i><i>fat, stinking drunk.</i>

What?

You're a fat, stinking drunk!

Yes, from what he's told us,
that's right on the money.

Challenge him, you must.

And I'm Hayden Christensen.

Wait a minute, Brian, that's it!

I'm a fat, stinkin' drunk,

because my father
is a fat, stinkin' drunk.

And I gotta prove it to him.

I have gotta drink him
so far under the table,

he'll have no choice but to respect me.

Get me a beer, Brian.

And I am going to prepare for this

as thoroughly as Ben Affleck prepares
for a role.

Whoa! I've got to be Henry VIII
in 20 minutes!

Hello... Hello...

(IN BRITISH ACCENT) 'Allo, 'Allo.

Got it.

Mickey McFinnegan, I challenge you
to a drinking contest.

(CROWD GASPS)

Ha! And what makes you think
you can hold your own

with the likes of me?

Because I'm your son! And I'm tough.

I made it halfway
through <i>Failure to Launch.</i>

<i>I just never managed</i>
<i>to get my life together.</i>

<i>Isn't that hilarious?</i>

(LAUGHS) <i>You're cute.</i>

Done!

As we say in Ireland,

let's drink until the alcohol
in our system

destroys our livers and kills us.

I've got 20 on the fat one.

BOTH: Which one's the fat one?

(BOTH LAUGH)

(BLEATING)

(SLURRING)

(SLURRING)

(SLURRED GIBBERISH)

(GRUNTS)

-What happened?
-Peter, you won!

My God, nobody's ever beat me
at the game of drink.

Now do you believe that you're my dad?

Nobody but a McFinnegan
could handle that much of the creature.

You're the broth
of me own stubby shillelagh, all right.

Welcome to me family, Peter.

You hear that, Brian?

I'm a McFinnegan now!

I can forget all about Francis.

You know, there's something
you should always remember, Peter.

Francis may not have been your father,

but he raised you as if you were his own.

And if that isn't love,
I don't know what is.

Wow, I guess you're right.

But there is one thing, Mickey.

You knocked up my mom
and never called her again.

Yeah, so what?

So what? So, let's dance!

(SINGING)

Peter, are you sure you're allowed

to bring a baby onto the golf course?

Well, Lois asked me to watch
Stewie for the afternoon.

It's all right, I don't
think the club will mind.

It's Cleveland I'm worried about.

Peter, is this really necessary?

I can't hardly see anything.

Hey, look, it's President Nixon.

No, wait, it's a black guy.

No, it's Nixon.

Oh, boy, that was close.

Hey, do you think it's time

I just tapped my ball, Quagmire. Relax.

Oh, relax? Oh, okay.

Oh, oh, look, I just tapped my ball.

Oh, just tapped it again.

Oh, oh, tap, tap, tap.

Oh, where is it? Oh! It's in the hole.

Eagle. Yay, Quagmire.

Hey, Quagmire, you know
it's not fun when you're like this.

You want fun? Go home and buy a monkey.

-What does that even mean?
-I don't know.

Boy, we've got a beautiful day for this.

Hi, Mr. Herbert.

Here's your paper.

Oh, sorry, Chris, but I'm afraid

I'm going to have
to cancel my subscription.

Cancel? But you love this paper.

Listen, I think you're a real nice guy,

but I've just decided to go
with another paper.

Hello, there, Kyle.

You look nice today.

I see you're wearing your big shorts

with the baggy leg holes
that flutter so carelessly

in the breeze.

Here's your paper.

What are you doing here?

-Beat it, nerd.
-Thank you.

Well, Lois, you tied
my golf shoes a little tight

before I left the house.

Had to deal with that all day.
Thank you very much.

Oh, my God, look at Stewie!

Peter, you took him out
without any sunscreen?

Maybe.

You know the sun is dangerous
for a baby's skin.

Peter, this is more irresponsible

than when you fed your mogwai

Peter, didn't the little

Oh, that's terrible.

You're a wonderful paperboy, Chris,

Oh, my God, Chris, what happened?

Kyle beat me up.

You let that little punk beat you up?

Peter, you should be more sympathetic.

Remember, you had a bully, too,
when you were his age.

Yeah, you're right.

Randy Fulcher used to pants me

Hey, ladies, you mind if I park here?

I'll only be a few minutes.

Stewie, what is that on your lip?

I drew a pencil mustache.

I like it 'cause it's just above my lip.

The kind of mustache that says,

"Yeah, I've been nude
on camera. What of it?"

Come here,
I'll take care of that, sweetie.

Ew, ew, it's got spit all over it.

Now I know what it feels

Yeah, maybe we could talk
about something else?

You know my wife and I
are very involved in Planned Parenthood.

Which provides possibilities

Devon just finished directing a movie.

Oh, dear, they're not getting along?

Sir, will you please stop staring at me?

Where's the rest of ya?

So, listen, Chris
is pretty upset about what happened.

Would you mind if I had
a word with your son?

Not at all. He's up in his room.

Hey, there. Kyle?

Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.

(MOCKING TONE) Hey,

That's not very nice.

I don't sound like that at all.

what you did the other day was wrong.

You're not making this easy, Kyle.

You're not making this easy, Kyle.

You're damn right I'm gonna yell at you.

You beat up a 13-year-old boy!

He called me names!

You're 43, and you
just assaulted our neighbor's child!

This is a very serious situation!

Well, maybe you should
have just had an abortion, Lois!

Would that make
you happy if I was never born?

What?

I'm going to prison, aren't I?

What are you doing?

Got to keep the tan up.

It's not a skin color,
it's a lifestyle, Brian.

See, you wouldn't know that

I can't do it! I can't do it!

Get the lotion! Put the lotion on me!

Brian!

Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Furley.

Never mind! I'll come back later!

Now be polite, Peter.

Kyle's mother agreed not to press charges

if you apologize.

Hello, Lois.

Hello, Claire.

We just came by because there's something

Peter would like to say to Kyle.

Go on.

-(MUMBLES) Slorry.
-Say it right, Peter.

Ow! Ow! Sorry!

Thank you, Peter.

Now what do you say, Kyle?

Apology accepted.

Good. Now why don't you patch things up

with Mr. Griffin
by showing him your Legos, hmm?

You got Legos? Aw, sweet!

Lois only buys me Mega Bloks.

They're the same thing, Peter.

You know what, Lois?
They are not the same thing.

And the sooner
you get that through your thick skull,

the sooner we can get
this marriage back on track.

Hey, listen, uh,
sorry about beating you up.

I felt pretty bad about it.

Hey, this look like a spaceship to you?

-Sorta.
-Huh.

Well, I never was
very good at building things.

Like that time I built
that handmade electric razor.

By gluing many razor blades
to this ordinary desk fan,

I'll save time in my morning routine.

-(WHIRRING)
-(SCREAMS)

Lois, I done it again.

You don't have to apologize.

I would have done the same thing.

I mean, bullying makes you
feel pretty cool.

Yeah, guess it was kinda cool.

You know, I always used to be the nerd

getting bullied,
but doing it to someone else

was pretty sweet.

And the more you do it,

the sweeter it gets.

(OIL SIZZLING)

(SHRIEKS)

Cook much? (LAUGHS)

Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

You're the one punching yourself
in the face. (LAUGHING)

Peter, stop it.

Hey, Lois, how come you keep

-punching yourself in the face?
-Cut it out!

-Peter, knock it off!
-You're gonna hurt yourself.

Ha! You're getting her good!

Hey, Stewie, nice sunburn.

God, you horse's ass!

(RIPPING SOUNDS)

Ew!

Hey, Brian, you want some Stewie jerky?

Oh, God, that is disgusting.

I'm finally starting to peel.

I'm telling you, Brian,
my tanning days are over.

I'm just glad I stopped

before I did any real damage to my skin.

I wouldn't be so sure.

I don't remember you having
that mole before.

What the devil? Where did that come from?

Brian, what is that?

I don't know.

Of course, your sunburn was pretty bad.

I suppose it could be the "C" word.

What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

No, cancer.

Oh, oh, oh, I thought you meant...

It's not important.

Oh, no! Cancer!

Well, the mole looks benign,
but we won't know for sure

whether it's cancerous
until the tests come back in a few days.

A few days? I could be dead by then!

Relax, Stewie. He said it looks benign.

We'll just have to wait and see.

Jim Henson had a wait-and-see attitude

and look what happened to him.

Now we've got wrong-sounding Muppets!

(GRUFF VOICE) Hey, Swedish chef.

(LISPING) Oh, hey, Kermit,
what's going on?

-I'm hungry.
-Oh, that's no problem.

I could cook you something.

You want some spaghetti?

That's, like, my specialty and junk.

Yay...

Ow!

Dad, what's wrong with you?

Why are you acting like such a bully?

'Cause there are two kinds of people
in this world, Chris.

There are bullies and there are nerds.

And there are hot Asian chicks.

They'll do what you want.

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

You better believe it, buddy.

They will do what you want

because they know,
they know what you want.

"Oh, oh, oh, don't be afraid.

"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

"I won't hurt you.

"Me big American man."

My point being
that I'm a bully, not a nerd.

Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

-(FLATULATING CONTINUOUSLY)
-(SCREAMS) Dad, get away from me!

-Dad, come on!
-Oh, Peter's farts are coming to get you!

-Peter's farts are coming to get you!
-Dad, stop it!

-Dad, come on!
-Here come Peter's farts!

They're coming to get you!

Oh, in the kitchen, Meg?

Brian, I may only have one week to live

and I've got to make the most of it.

Now, I've made a list of things
I want to do before I die

and you've got to help me
since this is all your fault.

"Visit Chicago Museum of Art."

Okay, we can do that.

(POP INSTRUMENTAL PLAYS)

Next on your list,

you want to learn to ballroom dance.

(ELEGANT MUSIC PLAYS)

All right, if you're
gonna make me do this,

-at least let me lead.
-Fine, you lead.

All right, then.

I love you.

What? What'd you say?

Uh, olive juice.

Olive juice?

(WHISPERS) Olive juice you, too.

PETER: Hey, you nerds wanna
see a puppet show?

Peter, put me down!

I told you, not until you sing.

<i>High on a hill was a lonely goat herd...</i>

<i>Lay-hee-oh-da-lay-hee-oh-da-lay-hee-hoo!</i>

Dad, what are you doing to Mr. Swanson?

Peter, put him down right now!

Beat it, Lois.

Peter, stop it!

Joe is your friend.

Shut up, ya nerd!

Hey!

Peter, look at yourself.

You are no different than that bully

who used to pick on you.

Are you kidding?

I'm nothing like Randy Fulcher.

Oh, no? Does that look familiar?

Oh, my God, you're right, Lois.

I shouldn't be bullying
the people I care about.

I should be bullying Randy Fulcher!

He's the jerk in all this.

Like Dick Cheney
when he was a Wal-Mart greeter.

Go (BLEEP) yourself. Go (BLEEP) yourself.

Go (BLEEP) yourself.

Well, that's it for the list.

Not quite, Brian.

There's one more thing
I need you to do before I die.

Write down my final thoughts.

Oh, come on!

(RASPY VOICE) I don't have much time!

(SIGHS)

Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid,

I see you there

lurking on the periphery of my vision,

but when I try to look at you,

you scurry away.

Are you shy, squiggly line?

Why only when I ignore you

do you return to the center of my eye?

Oh, squiggly line, it's all right.

You are forgiven.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello. Oh, hi, Dr. Hartman.

All right, I'll tell him. Thanks. Bye.

You don't have cancer.
You're gonna be fine.

Really? Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God!

Wait, wait.

Look, there's no reason

we can't finish the memoir anyway.

Let's see what you've got so far.

Oh, you are just the worst type of person.

Dad, what are we doing here?

Chris, I'm gonna show you
how to stand up to a bully.

Hey, Fulcher!

Griffin?

The feeling's mutual.

What are you doing here?

I'm here to kick your ass, Fulcher.

I'm gonna beat ya,

and then my son Chris is gonna beat ya.

It's gonna be an old-fashioned
father-son beat-off.

Wait a minute, Dad.

You can't hit him!

Yeah, I have MS.

Oh, you hear that, Chris?

This guy's got a monkey scrotum

and he's bragging about it.

Now you really got me mad.

No, Dad!

Ow! Ow! Oh, God! Ah!

(BOTH SOBBING)

Sorry I had to do that, Dad.

But you wanted me to learn
to stand up to a bully.

Well, I'm standing up to you.

Stop bullying people, Dad!

My God, Chris, you're right.

Look at me.

Look what I've become.

I thought it'd feel good to be a bully,

but all I did was make people feel as bad

as Randy made me feel.

I'm just a big jackass.

It's all right, Dad.

I forgive you.

As long as you promise
never to bully anyone again.

I promise, Chris.

I mean, you know,
unless I get really stinkin' drunk,

in which case all you got to do
is outrun your sister.

Oh, I like that.

That's nice.

That's a warm family moment.

I agree. We can all learn
something from that.

He's right.
Who knows how that got in there?

Peter, can we please go now?
This is excruciating.

Are you kidding, Brian?

These men and their redneck
lifestyle really speak to me.

This is the greatest show
I've seen in years.

Not like the last time
I was at a comedy club.

I hear this guy's hilarious.
He played Kramer, you know.

Oh, this is gonna be fun!

(CAR HORN PLAYING "DIXIE")

Peter, what the hell are you
doing with a pickup truck?

Wait. Let me guess.

This is because of the Redneck
Comedy Festival, isn't it?

(SOUTHERN ACCENT) Oh, that dog of mine.

Peter, you can't suddenly decide
to be a redneck

just because of some show.

Some show?

Lois, those men showed me
the way to an identity

I've been searching for my whole life.

I am going to do everything
a redneck is supposed to do.

Ugh! This is going
to be more painful to watch

than when he ate
half a Fudgesicle in one bite.

Oh, boy! A Fudgesicle!

Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat.

(YAWNS)

Dad, what are you doing?

Meg, I'm a redneck,

which means I am about
to do something to you

that you will not remember

Powerful stuff, you'd
have to be made of stone

not to feel saddened by that.

Boy, Quagmire, I'm really
sorry they fired you.

I feel like this is partially my fault.

No, Peter, it's perfectly
normal to siphon jet fuel

from an active runway with the intention
of flying a pickup truck.

Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble,
but my redneck days are over.

No more crotch shots
of me getting out of a car.

Well, what are you gonna do now, Quagmire?

Hey, it's all right.
I got enough in my savings

until I find another job. I'll be fine.

(SQUEAKY VOICES) Three weeks later.

Well, you're gonna have
to help him find one,

him living in this house.

Eh, you're overreacting, Lois.

And you can't spell "overreacting"
without "ovary."

Hey, uh, just an FYI, really no reason
to go into any greater detail than this.

never use this pacifier again.

Okay, so I'll talk to him tomorrow?

(CANNED AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)

(UPBEAT SITCOM MUSIC PLAYING)

So how's the job hunt going?

It's awful, Cleveland.
Quagmire blew every gig we got him.

It's too bad. I really liked that job
working on the Starship Enterprise.

Dude, you got to introduce
me to that black chick.

Guys, the only thing I know
how to do is fly a plane.

That's what I was born for.

And I'll never be happy
unless I can do it again.

Then that's the only answer.

Somehow we've got to get
Quagmire his job back.

Fellas, I think I have an idea.

Okay, guys, let's go over
the plan one more time.

<i>Quagmire will pose as an airline passenger</i>
<i>on the 6:00 flight to New York.</i>

<i>Then Joe and I will sneak into</i>
<i>the flight attendants' lounge</i>

<i>while Cleveland distracts</i>
<i>the security personnel.</i>

(PLAYING BLUEGRASS TUNE)

<i>Once we have the uniforms and credentials,</i>

<i>Cleveland, Joe and I will board the plane</i>
<i>posing as flight attendants.</i>

<i>Once we're in the air, we drug the pilots.</i>

<i>At which point, Quagmire is forced</i>

<i>to step in and land the plane</i>
<i>safely, making him a hero.</i>

Everybody clear?

Boy, this sounds like more trouble
than a moose on the interstate.

Hey, can you help me out?

I'm trying to get a couple of bucks
for something to eat.

What's "moose stuff"?

Whatever you want it to be.

I could have sex with you
or I could just stand over there

and drink from the lake.
And everything in between.

Get in.

(PLANE ENGINE HUMMING)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

All right, I'm gonna go bring
the pilots their coffee.

Hang on to something, 'cause
this ride's about to get rougher

than dating a hot girl with a bad laugh.

I really like you, Sandy.

I really like you, too, Peter.

Yeah.

Uh, Peter, I don't see Quagmire.

-Oh, that was great.
-Thanks.

I know you have a choice in airport sex,

All right, I got a plane to catch.
Say, which gate is flight 209?

209? That flight left half an hour ago.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
That plane's going down!

My friends are on that plane!
They're all gonna die!

What? Oh, no!

And that's not the worst part.
Here's the condom I said I put on.

Aren't I just the worst?

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

More trouble in the skies
over Quahog tonight,

apparently out of control.

Channel 5 has this exclusive recording

Hey, there, son. Mind if I have a seat?

Hugh Hefner?

You look like you got
something on your mind.

Ah, who the hell am I kidding?
I don't deserve to be a pilot.

I've let everybody down.

Did you do the best you could?

No. I was gonna,
but I ended up getting laid instead.

That reminds me of a guy
you might've heard of.

-(POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYS)
-John Holmes.

Greatest porn star who ever lived.
You know what he once said?

He said, "You know,
I've got a 13-inch member...

and Glenn Quagmire is the best
damn pilot I've ever seen."

John Holmes said that?

You bet he did...

right before he died a very
painful, AIDS-related death

from having unprotected sex
with so many people.

Stand aside, sir. I'll take it from here.

Peter, this is Quagmire.

Now I want you to listen very carefully
and do exactly as I tell you.

Take a firm hold of the throttle,
and pull the red mixture knob out slowly.

-Okay.
-All right, now do you see a button

that looks like a drunken gay guy
eyeing you from across the bar?

Um...

uh... Yeah, I see it.

All right, press the button
right above it.

Some new developments
in the flight 209 drama.

Recently discharged pilot,
Captain Glenn Quagmire,

is apparently talking the plane down.

Ollie Williams has the story. Ollie?

I'm at the wrong airport.

Oops. Well, thanks, Ollie.

Coming up... Why calling
every Asian man you meet

"Chung King" can land
an anchorman in hot water.

After this.

QUAGMIRE: <i>All right, Peter, slide</i>

<i>you hit the emergency brake.</i>

Oh, no, she di-in't.

Oh, yes, she did.

No, she di-in't.

Yes, she did.

-No, she di-in't.
-Yes, she did, Peter!

I just saw it!

All right, take it easy.

Ah, Glenn, we are so thrilled for you.

Yeah, guess it didn't take too much

for you to get your job back,
now that you're a hero.

Yeah, and I'm so happy for you,

I don't even mind that I was
raped in a federal prison

after I was arrested for hijacking.

Well, I couldn't have
done it without you guys.

You put yourselves on the line
and you gave me my life back.

I'll never forget that.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I got to go to work.

How's the hernia, Peter?

You know what

I thought I was just out of shape,
but that ain't it at all.

I gotta face the fact
that I'm just getting old.

CLINTON: Knock, knock.

Mr. President, what are you doing here?

Well, I felt so bad
that Peter hurt himself fixing my car,

I wanted to stop by

Sure.

Dude, come on.
We could totally eat that pig.

We could... We could do it, man.
We could. It'd be so easy, man.

-It would take, like, a minute.
-Could it really be that fast?

Peter, that pig could be in our stomachs

-Yes, but I'm a baby.

"That dog is sick. He must be dying.

I'd probably welcome that.

We lived, Lois. We lived our lives.

Peter, that former President Clinton
is nothing but a bad influence!

I forbid you to hang out with him anymore.

No way.
Bill Clinton makes me feel young.

Not like you,

Well, if he won't listen, I'm just going

Mr. President, I need to have
a word with you!

Wow! You certainly are very persuasive.

So I've been told.

Hey, you wanna give me that cigar?
I'm ready to smoke it now.

What the hell was I thinking?
I don't know what came over me.

Oh, God! What am I going to do?

Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling?
I swiped some money out of Lois's purse.

I don't think she'll notice because
she's here humping you!

Peter! Look, I know this looks bad,
and I feel horrible,

and I know nothing I could say to you

could possibly justify
why I slept with Bill except...

I mean, Peter,

the man presided over the longest
economic expansion in US history,

and he reduced
the percentage of Americans on welfare

to its lowest level in 33 years.

-35 years.
-35 years, Peter.

Well, well. I learned something today.

Apparently, there's the side
of Bill Clinton the world knows,

and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side
only I know.

I'm so sorry, Peter.

Lois, I think maybe it's better
if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.

I understand.

Hey, Lois, you up

I can't believe Lois would cheat on me.

Look, Peter, I know this is
a very difficult time for you,

but I want you to know I'm...
I'm here for you if you need anything.

Quagmire, I know your heart's

Honey, I just feel awful

Peter, I think I've got a solution
that'll make things right for both of us.

I'm listening.

Well, the way I figure it, the only way
to even things out between us

is if you have sex with someone else, too.

You want to get me laid?

Yes, Peter,
because I don't want to lose you.

Well, it would make us even. All right,
Lois, if you really think it'll work.

Trust me. It'll work better
than the first telephone.

Well, we did it, Watson.
What an afternoon.

We've finally perfected
the first telephone.

Yeah. Hey, listen,
somebody called me today.

Whoever it was said some
very sexual things.

Some very angry, sexual things.

Oh, really?
Probably just some teenagers somewhere.

I haven't been so struck

No. You can't promise something like that.

I have no idea

So you can go ahead

I wouldn't have kept my promise.

PETER: Hang on!

Okay!

Well, Lois, this is
an unexpected surprise.

You and Peter should drop by more often.

Well, we were in the neighborhood,

"Let's stop in." Wasn't that thoughtful?

Will you people quiet down?

to make things right seems to be...

It... It's, uh...
Oh, boy, what's the best way to say this?

Mom, would you have sex with Peter?

-Of course, dear.
-Really?

Carter's been most insufferable lately,

I like your freaky spirit,

I'm physically starved.

Your father's utterly lost interest.

He won't even look me
in the back of the head anymore.

I see.
Well, I guess we're good to go then.

Peter, are you sure this is what you want?

Yeah. I'll see you at home.

(SIGHS)

PETER: Lois, wait!

I can't do it! I can't go through with it!

You have to, Peter,
for the sake of our marriage!

-Screw our marriage! I love you!
-Really?

Absolutely. And I don't care
that you slept with Clinton.

We'll get past it somehow.

All I know is, I don't want
to do anything to hurt you.

Oh, Peter!

Why are you naked in my house?

Why aren't you?

You're all right, Griffin.

Well, Peter, our marriage
has suffered a serious trial,

but I think we can get through it.

Me, too, Lois.
It's just going to take a little work.

In the meantime, I guess
I better clear the air with Clinton.

Hey, listen, Bill,
you and I need to have a talk.

Boy, you are good. You are really good.

Well, look at you using the toilet.
I am so proud of you.

Hey, well, you deserve all the praise
for encouraging me to do it.

Well, still, good for you.

So where are you really doing
your business?

Oh, I found a place.

Well, I'll be damned.
And they called me crazy.

You can't plant sausage seeds, they said.

Well, look at this.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Hey there, Mort.

Hi, Lois.

Neil's doing a report
on Christianity at school.

Do you have any crucifixes
I can borrow?

Preferably one without
the little fellow on it?

Oh, of course, there's
one in the den.

Help yourself.

God, I'm sick of Mort
always borrowing our stuff.

He's a bigger mooch
than the Mexican Super Friends.

Hey, Mexican Superman,
can I talk to you for a sec?

When you signed the lease,
you said there was

going to be like five
of you living here.

Oh, no, they're not
all living here.

They're just visiting.

(CAR HORN BLARING

Hey, Mexican Superman,
I got the keys made.

Hey, Mexican Batman,
get out of here.

What? I got like 60 keys.

<i>-Evición.</i>

(TIRES SCREECHING)

That ought to keep Mort away.

Peter, what the hell is that?

Lois, I'm tired of Mort
always mooching off us,

so I made a scare-Jew.

Peter, we're not gonna have
this in our front yard.

It's racist, and for God's sake,
you ruined your best suit.

Now we're gonna have
to get you a new one...

Shh-shh.
Lois, Lois, look.

Hey, guys, I just wanted
to return your...

Oh! Oh, my God,
it's Hitler!

He's back! He's back!

Hurry, protect Jon Stewart!

He's our most important Jew!

Why do we have to get
me a suit here?

Well, since you keep
ruining them,

I'm not going to buy
you a brand-new one.

Yes, I'll take this teddy bear,

this ruler, this piece of string

and this cardboard box.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, look,
an "On The Raggedy Ann" doll.

It's water weight,
you bastard!

Get off me!

I'm not your whore.

(SOBBING)
I'm sorry, I'm just so sad.

Well, I guess
I can still play with it

three weeks out of the month.

Hi, there. See anything you like?

Oh, I'm just browsing.

Say, you look like you
could use an activity book

with half the
activities done.

Wow, that would save me
half the time.

Connect the dots?

Ha! More like set the book
down and have a beer.

You got yourself a deal.

(CELESTIAL MUSIC PLAYING)

What... are those!

Oh, that's a pair of red
flannel feety pajamas.

Good Lord.

See, they've got a flap
that opens up in the back.

Are you telling me I
could be pooping and warm?

Exactly.

No longer would I have
to make a choice between the two.

Sir, here is a check
with my name on it.

Write down any number
on this piece of paper, and I will pay it.

All right, so we roll the dice

and then we both have to
yell "Yahtzee" really loud.

-At the same time?
-Yeah.

And you have to flap
your wrists like this.

-And you'll do it, too?
-Of course, that's how it's done.

-Okay.
-All right, ready?

-Okay, you gonna do it with me?
-1Oh, yeah.

Yahtzee!

-Gay.
-You suck!

Hey, everybody,
I'm home from work.

My God, Peter, you wore
those pajamas to your office?

Hey, at least
I'm mixing it up a little bit.

Green shirt, tan pants,
that's refreshing.

Oh, boy does
it feel good

to undo my butt flap.

Ew, Dad!

We don't want to sit here
and look at your ass.

Yes, I'd rather look at Meg
toweling off after a shower

when she does that
butt floss thing.

Ew, ew, that's so disgusting.

Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever
accidentally use that towel.

(YELLS)

Lois, I have never
been more comfortable

as a person than I am
in these feety pajamas.

All warm and furry.

This is what it feels
like to be a bear.

You remember what I used
to say, Lois, when we first got married?

You remember? I used to say,
"What would it feel like to be a bear"?

Well, this is it.

This is it...
I'm living it, baby.

No, you're not.

You've been wearing those
things for three days.

You can wear them to bed,

but tomorrow we're
getting rid of them.

(SIGHS)
Fine.

Screw up all
my fuzziness.

-(ELECTRICAL SNAP)
-(YELLS)

What the hell was that?

-(ELECTRICAL SNAP)
-(YELLS)

Oh, my God.
Lois, don't get alarmed,

but I think I might be Jesus.

I'm Jesus.

Peter, that's
a static shock.

Your pajamas created
a charge of electricity

when you dragged your
feet across the carpet,

and when you touched
Chris, you passed it on.

Kneel before Christ!

Ow! Damn it,
Peter, stop it!

I got to tell you,
you're pissing me off

worse than when I watched
the O.J. verdict

with my old roommate.

WOMAN: (ON TV)
<i>We the jury find the defendant</i>

<i>Orenthal James Simpson,</i>
<i>not guilty...</i>

-Yes!
-What the hell?

-What?
-What?

Maybe we should
get new roommates.

Yeah, maybe we should.

(PETER GIGGLING)

Peter, I know you're in here.

Yes, I am, Lois.

But where?

Peter, if you shock me,
I swear to God I'm leaving you.

You'll have to find
me first, Lois.

Where could I be?

Well, there's a Quonset hut

that I've never seen in
this room before.

I got to figure
you're in there.

How do you know, Lois?

I could be in that New York
style magazine kiosk.

Peter, this all
looks very expensive.

Yes, you might say
it was...

shockingly expensive.

I'm going to try
the Quonset hut.

-(ELECTRICAL SNAP)
-(YELLS)

(LAUGHING)
I was in the bathroom.

The hut and the kiosk...
decoys, Lois, decoys!

Glen, thank you so much
for helping me tear up my carpet.

Well, you know, Lois,
I got to confess,

when you called me I sort
of misunderstood

what you were asking for.

That's why I rushed over.

But, uh... well, it's fine,
it's fine, whatever,

I'm happy to help.

What the hell is this?

Peter, I've had it
with all your shocking.

Since you won't get rid
of those pajamas,

I'm getting rid
of the carpets.

Hey, Lois, you want me to leave
a little strip in this thing?

Maybe a lightning bolt,
unicorn, something like that?

No, I want it all gone, Glen.

All right, we're going Brazilian.

Hey, what's this?

Some kind of really old coin.

Huh. Let me see that.

Wait a minute, do you know
what this is?

This is an 18th-century
Rhode Island ship token.

This thing's got
to be worth 50 grand.

50 grand!

Oh, my God!

I can finally afford
that operation

to swap my vocal cords
with Patrick Stewart.

(PATRICK STEWART'S VOICE)
Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon

making a list of famous Armenians.

Eric Bogosian, Andre Agassi,

Jerry "The Shark" Tarkanian.

That is all.

Peter, you've been sleeping
with that money for the past week.

Don't you think it's time
we did something with it?

Buy a bolt and shut
that trap of yours?

-What?
-What?

'Cause I had an idea.

Remember when we
first got married...

And I said, "I wonder what
it would be like to be a bear"?

No, no, no, I'm talking
about that dream we had, Peter.

Remember? We tried to
open that restaurant,

and we never quite got it going.

Yeah, we got shut down
'cause of my exploding cupcakes.

Mmm, I hope these taste
as good as they look.

(GASPS) Gerald!

(CHUCKLES)

The secret is in the frosting.

But I'll never tell.

Well, here's another chance
to open a restaurant.

You're right.

Ooh, and I'll make
my special cupcakes.

-No, Peter...
-Oh, yeah, right, that was the problem.

All right, everybody,
only three hours till opening.

Oh, this is going to be
the coolest place in Quahog.

All the movers and shakers
and bigwigs

are going to eat here...
but not the small wigs.

Hey, I'm hungry.

I got a credit card.

Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

I hope it goes well.

Oh, yes, I'm sure it will go as well
as Liza Minnelli's <i>Playboy</i> shoot.

Oh, God, please put
your clothes back on.

Mama... Mama...

Do you love me now, Mama?

(SOBBING)
Please love me, Mama!

Good evening.
Welcome to Big Pete's House of Munch.

May I help you?

Yes, do you accept
the Discover card?

Ha! Hey, Lois, Diamond
Jim Brady over here

just asked if we accept
the Discover card.

LOIS: <i>Oh, they're in an exclusive</i>
<i>club called anybody.</i>

Yeah.

No, no, no, I don't think so.

You know, you know,
I would rather take two live chickens

than your fly-by-night credit card.

I would rather take
a jar of pennies

that's value was less
than that of your bill.

Look, you don't
have to insult me.

No, no, no, you are going
to sit there and listen

to the funny things
I would take

instead of your credit card.

The guy at table seven
complained

there's not enough juice
on his prime rib.

Oh, did he, now?

Let me take care
of that for him.

(RAT SQUEAKING)

(RETCHING)

Tell him, bon appétit, douchebag.

Oh, look, it's one of those
early <i>Maude</i> episodes

with the really long
opening credit sequence.

(THEME FROM <i>MAUDE</i> PLAYING)

<i>Lady Godiva was a freedom rider</i>

<i>She didn't care if the whole world looked</i>

<i>Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her</i>

<i>She was a sister who really cooked</i>

<i>Madame Curie was a strong woman character</i>

<i>Working all day in a science lab, yeah</i>

<i>Clara Barton was a famous nurse</i>

<i>Who was rapping with the</i>
<i>soldiers and bandages, too</i>

<i>Susan B. Anthony always out doin' stuff</i>

<i>Marching around</i>
<i>and holding up signs...</i>

And then there's Maude.

<i>Pocahontas had it all goin' on</i>

What the hell?

<i>An Indian guide</i>
<i>with lots of Indian pride</i>

<i>Indira Gandhi ran a whole big country</i>

<i>That isn't easy even</i>
<i>if you're a guy...</i>

And then there's Maude?

<i>Babe Zaharias was a good athlete</i>

Aw, come on!

<i>Good at track and field</i>
<i>and professional golf, too</i>

And then there's Maude!

<i>Amelia Earhart flew</i>
<i>a lot of airplanes</i>

<i>Except for that one time</i>
<i>when she didn't come back</i>

<i>Cleopatra lived out in the desert...</i>

And then there's Maude! Come on!

<i>But still found a way to keep</i>
<i>herself looking fine</i>

<i>And then there's Maude...</i>

Ah! Ah! There we go!

That was an ordeal.

Well, Peter, this has
been an amazing week.

You and I own
a restaurant.

Can you believe it?

I know. I feel like I'm dreaming.

Wait. Maybe I am dreaming.

That means I can do whatever
I want without consequences.

(LAUGHING)

What are you doing?

I just adopted 30 puppies!

(LAUGHING)

Who's a (BABY TALK)?

Who's a (BABY TALK)?

(LAUGHING)

(PUPPIES GROWLING, BARKING)

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

You guys, I have some bad news.

I just finished
going over the books,

And this restaurant
is hemorrhaging money.

What? Well, how
is that possible?

Isn't it obvious?

We're not getting
enough customers.

This place is like
a ghost town half the time.

Yeah. Maybe somebody
should have asked me.

After all, I'm the only one
in this family

with any business experience.

All right,
Violet and Pigpen,

you've been seeing each other
a few weeks now.

What seems
to be the problem?

I keep getting
bladder infections,

and I don't know why.

Really?
You don't know why?

I don't know
what to do, guys.

The House of Munch
is going down the tubes.

Maybe you need
to do a little advertising, Peter.

Well, I tried.

I even hired M. Night Shyamalan
to direct my TV commercial.

(WHISPERING)
I have a secret to tell you.

-What is it?
-Come closer.

I see good food
at competitive prices.

At Big Pete's House of Munch!
Stop on by!

Unfortunately,
they couldn't air it,

'cause it turns out
M. Night Shyamalan

was involved with September 11.

You know, Peter,
my buddies and I

have been looking
for a new hangout.

Our usual doughnut shop
has gotten a little...

Puerto Ricany.

What if we made your
place our new spot?

Joe, that's a great idea!

Fantastic! We'll see you tonight.

This is awesome!

Bunch of cops in uniform
hanging out in my restaurant?

This is going to be
cooler than that time

Ben Stiller taught me
how to be myself.

But how can you
leave me now, Ben Stiller,

when I need you
more than ever?

I've taught you everything
you need to know, Peter.

Now it's time for me
to go help another child.

I guess
I just fooled myself

into thinking
you'd always be with me.

I will, Peter.

I will always
be with you.

His movies are terrible...

Lois, roll out
the red carpet.

Here comes Joe
and his cop buddies.

You got tables for 30?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe!

I thought you were bringing
your cop friends over.

What are all these
parallelograms doing here?

You mean paraplegics.

These are my friends, Peter.

Come on, guys. Let's eat.

Oh, God. I hope
there's not one of those angry,

handicapped Vietnam guys
with the bandana on his head.

Oh! There he is.

I've seen some things,
man, and some stuff.

I wouldn't recommend it.

Peter, isn't this wonderful?

The place is packed.

Uh... Lois, uh...

aren't you a little
freaked out by this?

Why? Everybody's
having a great time.

Besides, think of the
money we're making.

I don't care about that.

I wanted a cool restaurant,

not the cafeteria
at the veteran's hospital.

This is weirder than
that rap video by M.C. Escher.

<i>Going up the stairs</i>
<i>and going down the stairs</i>

<i>And going up the stairs</i>
<i>and going down the stairs</i>

<i>And going up</i>
<i>the sideways stairs</i>

And, in local news, a new restaurant
is taking Quahog by storm.

That's right, Diane.

If you're handicapped,
or know someone who's handicapped,

or just happen
to be a fan of the circus,

then come on down
to Big Pete's House of Munch,

where the elite without feet
meet to eat.

Lois, this is insanity.

I think we should shut
down the restaurant.

But... why?
We're doing so well.

Lois, let me explain
something to you, all right?

Cripples are not cool.

Hang on. I'm going
to get the picture.

Oh, Peter, don't...

(SHOUTING GIBBERISH)

What do you
see here, Lois?

Do we have to...
What do you see!

(SIGHS) A picture of Mark Harmon.

A picture of Mark Harmon,

the greatest actor
who ever lived.

Do you see a wheelchair
under Mark Harmon?

-Peter...
-Lois,

do you...

see a wheelchair...

under Mark Harmon?

-No.
-No, you do not,

because Mark Harmon
is cool.

And I know what
you're thinking.

"Oh, Peter, this is just
like your Gil Gerard speech."

And you can stop
right in your tracks, because it is not.

Granted, it is similar
to the Gil Gerard speech, but it...

Peter, I like our restaurant
the way it is,

and if you don't,
that's your problem.

Fine. Then I'll deal
with this myself.

All right, here they come.

Hey, Peter,
we're here for dinner.

Oh no, you're not, Joe.

We have a new policy.

Can't you read the sign?

Peter, what the hell
is that all about?

It's a message, Joe.

I don't want you
and your kind eating here anymore.

You're ruining what was supposed
to be a cool establishment.

Peter, you're one
of my closest friends.

Are you... you telling me
that you have a problem

with me being handicapped?

As a matter of fact, Joe, yes.

I think it's immoral.

It's a lifestyle choice
you're forcing on America.

We handicapped
are a proud people!

Yeah, when you're not
drinking and gambling

on your reservations,
which we gave you.

Fine, if that's
the way you want it,

but we're not going
to go down easy.

Okay, that was easy.

But I'll be back
with more handicapped guys!

Dad, look! Here they come!

Peter, we'll give you
one last chance to let us in!

(SNICKERS) What are you
going to do, Joe?

I'm up here.

(IN A HIGH-PITCHED, SING-SONGY VOICE)
AND YOU'RE DOWN THERE.

Very well, Peter,
you leave us no choice.

Men, form up Crippletron!

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

(SCREAMS)

Help! Help! Somebody help me!

Ben Stiller, help me.

No, Peter. I heard what
you said about my movies.

How did you hear?

Hello!

Go to hell, you
mutant offspring of comedy people.

Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
he'll never walk again...

-(BOTH GASP)
-...without remembering how lucky he is

that he'll only be in this
wheelchair for two weeks.

That leg should heal up just fine.

Peter, you do realize
you deserve this

for the way you treated Joe.

I think you owe him an apology.

Are you kidding, Lois?

It ain't my fault that him
and all his gimpy friends

don't fit in with regular society.

But I'm gonna be different.

I'll be a dignified cripple,

and I'll show them all
how it's done!

("I Guess That's Why They Call
It The Blues" intro playing)

<i>Don't wish it away</i>

<i>Don't look at it like it's forever</i>

<i>I could honestly say</i>

<i>That things can only get better</i>

<i>And while I'm away</i>

<i>Ooh...</i>

<i>Dust out the demons inside</i>

(SIGHS)

<i>The blues</i>

Joe, uh... you got a minute?

What is it, Peter?

I, uh... just wanted
to apologize.

I thought you
and your friends

were just a bunch
of gross cripples,

but I've been in a wheelchair
for 45 minutes now,

and I see how tough it is.

Well, Peter, it's been
a rough week for both of us,

but it means a lot to me
to hear you say that.

So what do you say?
Can we put all this behind us?

I'd like nothing better.

Hey, Bonnie and I are
watching <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

if you want to come in.

Oh, boy, Joe, I...
I got to tell you,

that... that...
that sounds awful.

TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return
to Julia Louis-Dreyfus

in "Now It's Just Getting Sad."

Okay, okay, hear me out.

My character is a therapist
living in the city,

but I'm married to an elephant.

Hi, I'm the husband.
Hey, honey.

We're going to my parents'
this weekend.

Did you pack your trunk?

(canned laughter)

I don't think I want to go.

I don't like going
to your parents.

Why?

Maybe because your dad's
an ivory hunter?

See, there's a lot
going on here.
A lot going on.

It actually, it actually
gets pretty watchable.

Ah, damn, it's still raining.

Lois, you mind if I
go in the house?

Fine, fine, just put
the newspaper down.

Hey, Lois, look at this.

The church is holding auditions
for a new organist.

Really?

Wow, you know,
that sounds like

it could be a lot of fun.

Yeah, it's been a while since
you've had the chance

to play in public.

Church organist?
Ah, that's boring.

Why don't you do something
more interesting?

Like when I had that job
feeding the homeless.

That's going to make you
big and strong.

Burping time.

Oh, smells like someone
needs to be changed.

When was the last time
you were changed,

seven days ago?

That's one week.

There are seven days in a week.

I love you, filthy hobo.

Huh, huh! All right.

(unzipping, slap):
Ah!

Why do you say "organist"
if you don't want...

I don't understand
the world anymore.

Here be a jaunty sea chantey
from me boyhood.

♪ You shake me nerves
and you rattle me brain ♪

♪ Too much love
drives a man insane ♪

♪ You broke me will,
oh, what a thrill ♪

♪ Goodness gracious,
great balls of fire. ♪

(rock organ plays)

♪ I know what boys like ♪

♪ I know what guys want ♪

♪ I know what boys like ♪

♪ Boys like ♪

♪ Boys like me. ♪

All right, up next
is Lois Griffin.

Well, I don't know
if I can compete

with the rest of these people,
but here goes.

(gentle hymn playing)

My word, what a fascinating man
this Jesus must have been.

I can just imagine meeting him.

(organ music continues)

That was beautiful,
Mrs. Griffin.

Up next is Jake Tucker.

(disjointed notes playing)

(playing
"William Tell Overture")

Well, finally!

Some of us have been
waiting all evening

for a certain wife
to come home

and feed her
starving family.

Peter, I told you
I was going to be late.

Couldn't you have
handled dinner?

You can't ask me
to make dinner, Lois.

That's like asking me to choose
between Sarah Jessica Parker

and Kirsten Dunst in a hot
body/weird face contest.

It can't be done.

Well, I've got good news.

I'm going to be
the church's new organist.

Hey, congrats.
Wow, Mom, that's great.

That means
you'll play the organ.

It also means
that this family

is going to start going
to church again on Sundays.

Being there today reminded
me of how important

religious services are to
the moral fiber of a family.

And lately, this family
has been lacking moral fiber.

Especially you, Meg.

Meg, what happened to you?

She can't answer you.

She can't even talk.

Ever since she
started smoking pot,

she just kind of lays there.

It's really sad.

And a tiny bit funny.

Oh, my God, I think
I'm getting a contact high.

Oh, now I'm messed up, too.

(pipe organ plays)

Good morning, everyone.

A reading from
the letter of John

to the couple with
the crying baby upstairs.

"Obviously you hear
your kid crying

"and you're trying
to break him of some habit.

"But I got news for you.

"It's not working.

"I swear to God
if it doesn't stop,

I will come up there
and show him what real pain is."

The Word of the Lord.

ALL:
Praise be to God.

Oh, I am so hungry.

Oh, look, they're handing
out cookies up there.

Stewie, wait, don't...

Hey, there.

Eat up, y'all.

Youse is good
churchgoing folk.

Y'all deserve
a little treat.
Give me that!

Well, aren't you
an enthusiastic
wafer muncher.

What is that, punch?

Oh, don't y'all
drink that.

Youse gonna get sick.

Yep.

(gasps):
That baby just threw up
the host!

That's a sign
of the devil.

Oh, my God,
is he possessed?

He's possessed!

That baby is
possessed by Satan!

Calm down, everyone.
He's just a little sick.

I'll take him home.
Come on, sweetie.

Oh, sweet, we
are out of here.

Now I can do what I planned
to do this morning--

gladiator mice.

(laughs):
Yes, yes, die, die, die!

I have everything,
and you have nothing!

Ugh, what a horrible morning.

You know, all I wanted
was for us to share

a simple Sunday church service
as a family.

But I guess that's
too much to ask.

(doorbell rings)

Good afternoon, Mrs. Griffin.

We're here to take custody
of your baby

so that the good reverend here
can perform an exorcism

and banish the devil
from his infant soul.

What?! You are not performing
an exorcism on my baby.

Mrs. Griffin,
you can give him to us,

or we can take him
by force.

No!
Don't worry, Lois,

we'll hide in the one place
they can't find us.

In imagination land,

where you burp
where you fart,

and you fart
where you burp.

(burps, farts)

Indeed, that's
how it happens.

(angry shouting)

Where are we going?

Who cares as long
as it's away

from those bloody
church fanatics.

We're going to Texas.

We can stay at my sister Carol's
place until this blows over.

Texas?
We're going to Texas

in search of religious
tolerance?

That's going to be like trying
to get Sneakers O'Toole

to take his sneakers off.

♪ I'm not taking
my sneakers off ♪

♪ I am Sneakers O'Toole. ♪

Hey, take those
sneakers off.
No!

Take them off, I said!
No!

Ah, let him go.

We'll never catch him.

Not in these shoes.

♪ I didn't take
my sneakers off ♪

♪ I'm still Sneakers O'Toole. ♪

Good evening,
I'm Tom Tucker.

And I'm Diane Simmons.

Authorities are on the lookout
for one-year-old Stewie Griffin,

a Quahog infant who is believed
to be possessed by Satan.

A substantial reward
is being offered

for any information
leading to his capture.

In other pseudo-
scientific news,

a local man claims
to have spotted bigfoot.

We've got the
exclusive interview.

I was about to bone my
girlfriend out at the lake,

but suddenly she
yelled, so I looked up

and it was bigfoot.

So what happened next?

Then I went back to bone her,

but the mosquitoes
were going crazy,

and she said there was no way.

All right, get your snacks
and hurry out, you guys.

Yeah, look, they
have Chunky bars.

What a God-awful mess
those things are,

chocolate with
raisins in it.

Yeah, yeah, that's
what kids want with
their chocolate-- fruit.

Why don't you put
sunflower seeds

in the Ding Dongs
while you're at it?

Is that part
of your stand-up act?

I don't know,
do you like it?
I wouldn't open with it.

Pardon me, sir.

We're trying to locate
a possessed child.

Have you seen anyone
who looks like this?

Yeah, that's my son.

He's actually in
the mini-mart right now.

He'll be out in a second.

I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no.

Never seen him before.

Hmm. What was that
first thing you said?

Oh, I was just saying that baby
in the picture is my son.

He's traveling with us.
He's part of our family.

We're trying to avoid being
found by police like you.

I mean, I was just remarking
what a nice tie you have on.

I<i>love</i>this tie.

All right, you folks
take care now.

(laughing)

Oh, did you hear
that cashier's accent?

(Hindi accent):
"Would you like
some change please for you?"

Oh, you know, if it
weren't for 9/11,

those guys would
be adorable.

Oh, my God, look.

Quick, into the bathroom.

We're going to have to
come up with a way

to change your appearance.

Well, I could disguise myself
as Britney Spears.

I'm already
standing in urine,

and I hate the person
I'm with.

No, see, there's got to be
something in here we can use.

(sighs):
Boy, that was a close one
back there.

Way to think on your feet,
Brian.

We got lucky.

How you holding up, Stewie?

Um...

I feel right, Brian.

I feel right.

Are you sure Aunt Carol
won't mind us using her house?

She won't care, Chris.

She's off on her
ninth honeymoon.

(laughs)

When will it work for her?

Howdy, new neighbors.

Pleased to welcome you.

We're the Lynches.

We live next door.

Nice to meet you.

We're the Griffins.

Nellie here is a homemaker.

And I'm a queer chaser
and beater.

Lois, I'm not sure this is
the right place for us.

These Texans are socially
backward and politically,

they're all stubborn
as a mule.

Nope, sorry, Kevin Bacon
wasn't in<i>Footloose.</i>

What?
Of course he was.

No, he wasn't.
You lose.

Of course he was,
he was the star.

No, you're wrong.
Look it up.
I don't have
to look it up.

It's common knowledge.
Nope.

He was on
the cover of...
Nope. Nope.

<i>People</i>magazine
when the movie...
No. No.

Everyone knows Kevin Bacon
was the star of<i>Footloose.</i>
No! No! No! No!

It was a huge movie.
He was the lead.
No! No! No!

No! No! No! No!

(braying loudly)

Look what
the Lynches gave us.

A needlepoint of Chuck Norris
from<i>Walker, Texas Ranger.</i>

You know, they say
Chuck Norris is so tough

there's no chin under his beard.

There is only another fist.

That's ridiculous.

Chuck Norris?

You know,
this place may be the upside

to everything that's happened.

The people are kind
and generous.

They seem wholesome and moral.

Exactly the kind of influence
this family needs.

Lois, we're living
in a red state

with a bunch
of right-wing nutjobs.

Hey, Chris, check
out my belt buckle.

It says, "Everything's
bigger in Texas."

(laughing)

Belts are a great way
to express opinions.

TV ANNOUNCER:
This is Channel Five News,
Texas, with Duke Dillon.

Howdy, Texas. I'm Duke Dillon.

At the top of the news tonight,

authorities have called off
their pursuit

of a fugitive Rhode Island baby

who was thought
to be possessed by the devil.

Oh! Thank God!

This turn of events came

after Vatican scientists
announced today

that the devil is<i>not</i>the
greatest threat to salvation

due to last week's discovery
of the Superdevil.

Religion reporter Dallas Houston
has the story.

Thanks, Duke. Well, let me try
and give you a clear picture

of what we're dealing with here.

Here's a photo of the devil,
and here's the Superdevil.

Now, as you can see, there are
some significant differences.

The Superdevil
is at least six inches taller,

he has a flying motorcycle
and a jar of marmalade

that we believe forces you
to commit adultery.

Thanks a lot, Dallas.

Looks like we all got something
new to be afraid of.

Everyone, it's over!

We can go back to Quahog.

Hey, Lois, you say something?

Aw, just that I think
you're going to love this cake.

None for me, thanks.

It's going to go
straight to my vagina.

That's what girls
worry about, right,

having big vaginas?

Dad, why aren't
you taking the car?

Chris, we're in Texas now.

If I'm not riding a horse,
I'm gonna stick out

like a straight guy
in a figure-skating
competition.

Boo-ya!
Triple Salchow in your face!

Hey, you want this? Huh?
You want some of this?

Oh, man, look at your rack.

I'd motorboat that.

I'd motorboat the hell
out of it!

Right after this layback spin.

Bottle of Jack Daniels, please.

There you go.
Thanks.

What's this?

That's your gun.

Buy some liquor,
get a free gun.

Is that like a special
you have on now or something?

Nope. Texas state law.

You have a nice day now.
State law?

God! This place officially sucks
worse than the WNBA.

And, at the top
of the second half,
it's 16 to nine.

Easton leads the
scoring with four.

And that's why
she commands $7,000 a year.

These gals sure do
make it look difficult.

But is having this minor skill
worth being so unattractive?

That's for the fan to decide.

Yay!

(gunshot)

Huh. That was kind of cool.

(gunshots)

(yawning):
Been a long day, Lois.

Long day.

Peter, what the hell?

You can't bring that
horse into our bed.

Lois, I cannot believe

you would ban the
horse from our bed.

He is a graceful,
majestic creature

who is a part
of this family

and only wants you
to love and respect...

The horse may have
pooped in the bed.

I hereby call this meeting

of the Texas Youth Club
to order.

First, I'd like to welcome
our two newcomers,

Chris and Meg Griffin.

Wow! This is the coolest club
I've ever been in.

Well, you're not quite
in the club yet.

You got to pass
the initiation.

What do we have to do?

You got to sneak
on to the Crawford Ranch

and steal a pair
of George Bush's underwear.

And then bring it back here

so we can bask in
its Bushy goodness.

Boy, that's even kinkier

than the porn they make
for senior citizens.

Can I help you, Edward?

Yeah. I'm here
for the early bird special.

Are those new slacks?
(funky music begins playing)

What's that, now?

Are those new slacks?

I got these
on special at Caldors.

Who drove you there?

My nephew.

Oh. That was nice of him.

I forgot why I came over.

Are those new slacks?

What is this?
What the hell are we doing here?

Welcome to your first
toddler pageant, Stewie.

It's what you do
when you're in Texas.

Oh, lovely.
A first-class ticket

to a semen-stained death
in the basement.

Why don't you meet
the other contestants

while I go
register you?

Hello. I'm, uh...
Stephanie Griffin.

Hi, Stephanie.

What's your talent?

I sing, I do gymnastics,

and I can play
seven instruments
at the same time.

Hmm. You could be
a threat to me.

Chuck.

There it is--
the Crawford Ranch.

I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

What a bonding adventure
for the two of us.

Settle down, Meg.

Okay, I see
Old Man Cheney
guarding the place.

(snoring)

(muttering):
18% approval ratings.

I'll give you 18%
of my foot in your ass.

I'd like you to meet my
daughter's husband Michael.

Wow! Look how
organized he is.

He's already
got his sugar

cut up into neat little lines
for his breakfast tomorrow.

And a razor blade to shave.

Wow! Look at this.

I can't believe
Mrs. Bush kept

all these Planned
Parenthood receipts.

Holy cow! She's been
scraped more times

than a fisherman's
knuckle.

Hey, what are you
kids doing here?

You tell Javier to back off.

I'll have his money
by next week.

What?
Never mind.

Hey, you guys want
to see something?

Grab a beer
and follow me.

See this car?

I restored it
myself this summer.

I was here for 12 weeks.
I had to do something.

But, along the way,
I learned about
honesty, integrity,

and cold filtered
Miller Genuine Draft.

(burping)

That's an adult
beverage right there.

You understand
what I'm trying
to say to you?

Yes. But I have
just one question.

Can I borrow your underpants
for ten minutes?

(drumroll)

ALL:
Ah!

(phone rings)

Hello.

Oh. Hi, Jillian.

Brian, I'm
reading<i>TV Guide.</i>

Can you explain
how these cheers
and jeers work again?

Well, the cheers is
when they generally approve

of something on television,

and jeers is when
they find some sort
of fault with it.

Oh. See... yeah,
I'm not quite...

We can't do this
over the phone.

You're going to
have to come over.

I can't come over.
We're still on the run

because the town
thinks Stewie's possessed.

No, they don't.
Didn't you hear?

They stopped
chasing you weeks ago.

What? I have to go.

Wait, wait! I have
another question.

How do I know
if I'm Jewish?

Are you Jewish?
No.

There you go, sport.
Thank you.

Hey, guys, thanks so much
for inviting me out today.

I'm psyched
to brand my first cow.

Here you are, Peter.

All fired up
and ready to go.

(screams):
Oh...!

Oh, yes!

Yes! Oh!

Oh, hang on a second.

(muffled screaming)

Man, Texas is great.

Back where I'm from,

a retarded guy could
never have this much fun.

What did you just say?

What?

Technically, I'm retarded.

Fellas! Fellas!
Can't we talk this over?

Talking is for terrorists
and blacks.

In Texas,
we execute the retarded.

Oh, my God!
So this is how it ends?

I always thought I'd die

having to sit through
the Canadian Film Festival.

I don't wish to cause you
any harm, and I won't.

The end.

(neighing)

Horsey, you saved my life.

No problem, Peter.
Glad to help out.

Wow! Gilbert Gottfried.

That's right!

Awesome.

Now the final contestant

for our talent portion
of the competition,

Stephanie Griffin.

Thank you, thank you.

Hey, what's the deal
with Chunky bars, huh?

Chocolate with raisins in it?

Yeah, that's what kids want
with their chocolate-- fruit.

(laughter)

Wow, that bit is killing.

Hey, Lois, great news.

We can go back to Quahog.

I know, Brian. Shh!

We're about to see
if Stewie won.

Wait a minute. You know?

How long have you known?

A few weeks. Who cares?

Wait a minute.
You... you've known for weeks,

and you've been lying
about having to stay here?

Brian, don't you see?

This is a wholesome
community with
real values.

And our first
runner-up is...

Miss Dixie-Ann Thomas.

Which means that
Miss Stephanie Griffin

is our new
Little Miss Texas!

(applause and cheering)

Oh! Oh, my God!

Oh, I never expected this.

Oh, I'm so, so honored.

(cheering stops)

Hey, that's not a girl!

It's Enrico Palazzo!

No, it's not!
It's one of them queerosexuals!

Get him!

(yelling angrily)

Quick! Get on!

Thank you for
all your help.

My pleasure,
Peter. Anytime.

Oh, fantastic.

Hey, do you still
do stand-up?

I do. I'm still touring.

Oh, wow. Can we
get tickets?

Absolutely.

I'm in Atlanta next week.

Great. Oh, well,
this will be fun.

It is so good to be home.

You know,
I wanted us to live

in a place with
real family values.

But values don't come
from where you live

or who your friends are.

They come from inside,
from your own beliefs.

I agree, Lois.

Like, for instance,
if you're watching
a TV show,

and you decide to take
your values from that,
you're an idiot.

Maybe you should
take responsibility

for what values
your kids are getting.

Maybe you shouldn't
be letting your kids

watch certain shows
in the first place

if you have such
a big problem with them,

instead of blaming the
shows themselves. Yeah.
S05E16.en
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

ANNOUNCER: We now return

Oh, Barney, I'm never going to meet
the right girl and get married.

You know, Ted, don't you think
it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s

to always be talking about getting married
rather than getting laid?

Barney, I'm in love with you.

Suit up.

All right, come on, everyone.

Go get dressed. It's ballet night.

(ALL GROAN)

Lois, don't freakin'
put me through this again.

Peter, a little culture
is good for this family.

Besides, you liked
<i>The Nutcracker, </i>didn't you?

No, Lois, I did not.

<i>The Nutcracker</i> had zero physical comedy.

And with a name like <i>The Nutcracker</i>

I thought, "Oh, this
will be worth a few yuks,"

but no, Lois, that title wrote a check

that those queers
on stage refused to cash.

Peter, we're going.

Well, we're not the first people

to be dragged off against our will.

-Are we there yet?
-No!

-Are there yet?
-No!

Are we there yet?

Damn it! I swear to God,
I will turn this ship around!

-That works. Okay.
-It'll teach us a lesson.

Yeah, that's even better.

All right, if that's what you...
Wait a minute!

You know, Meg, female ballet dancers

are famous for anorexia and bulimia.

And, uh, it seems to work out for them,

so... hintity, hint-hint.

Boy, this is gonna be long.

So, uh, you kids develop
any good pot connections

at your school yet?

-What?
-Yeah.

Lois, we'll be right back.

Meg's gonna take me outside to poop.

<i>Hello.</i>

-Hey, Quagmire.
-Hey, Peter, what's up?

I'm stuck at the stupid ballet.

<i>Get out of here. You serious?</i>

-Yeah.
-So am I.

What?

<i>Yeah, I got dragged here by this broad</i>
<i>I'm trying to nail.</i>

Where you sitting?

<i>Look across at the other</i><i>balcony.</i>
<i>I can see you.</i>

Oh, my God! What do we do? What do we do?

What do we do? We're both here.

Oh, my God! We should text
each other! Hang up! Hang up!

(BUZZES)

(LAUGHS)

(BUZZES)

Ha!

Chris, how many times have I told you

no reading during meals?

I have a history test today, Mom,

and I couldn't study last night

because you made us go to the ballet.

Well, Chris, you're not gonna
learn any history from this.

-This textbook is from 1948.
-What?

Chapter 3. "Youth culture
rebels with Big Band music."

Let me see that.

"Israel, the brand-new country
everyone's gonna love."

What the hell?
Are the schools so underfunded

that they can't afford textbooks
from this century?

Well, I am going to raise hell about this
at the next PTA meeting.

Well, let me know if you need help.
I can be very persuasive.

I gave the next speech
after the Braveheart guy.

They can take our lives,

but they can never take our freedom!

(CHEERING)

And... and let's not forget the tax
they levied on properties

that are in abutment of church lands.

So, yeah, let's do it.

(APPLAUSE)

All right, let's get
this meeting underway.

For our first order of business,
we'll go to Bruce.

(SINGSONG) Well, hey, y'all said my name.

Welcome to our meeting here at the school.

We got lots of exciting
topics here tonight.

We gonna have a puppet show.
We gonna have some jazz.

No, I'm just kidding.

We have some business
to take care of, though.

I'm sorry I pulled y'all's legs.

I'm just a little excited
'cause I met somebody today.

(SINGSONG) Someone in the bookstore.

Someone who likes the same kind
of literature as I do.

Oh, and the adventure begins again.

Excuse me, Principal Shepherd.
There's something I'd like to discuss.

The school has gone too far
with these budget cuts.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but the No Child Left Behind law

cost us our federal funding

because our students'
test scores were too low.

They cut a school's funding
if it's got low test scores?

This is not what the
founding fathers had in mind.

Okay, we're here to sign
this declaration of our independence.

Let's take roll call first.

-Thomas Jefferson?
-Here.

-Benjamin Franklin.
-Here.

-John Footpenis?
-It's Hancock now.

-Why?
-Mind your business. That's why.

Well, somehow this school needs
to raise its test scores right away.

I suppose there is one thing I can do
to raise the school's test average.

Then do it.

All right, we'll drop
the dumbest student we have,

Chris Griffin is hereby expelled.

But if I leave now, I won't hear
who's the dumbest kid in the school.

Cool, I don't have to go to school.

I can just pee in my bed all day.

Chris, being expelled is a serious thing.

Peter, we've got to find
another school for him.

I say, I could home-school him.

After all, I taught Cleveland
how to make Jiffy Pop.

Oh! (LAUGHING)

Oh! Oh!

So do you think your school
would be right for Chris?

Oh, absolutely.

Quahog School
for the Deaf has great programs,

both academic and athletic.

In fact, you're just in time
for our homecoming pep rally.

What are we gonna do to Lincoln?

Kill them!

I can't hear you!

Kill them!

I can't hear you!

Kill them!

I can't hear you!

Kill them!

I can't hear you!

Kill them!

Let's just go.

Welcome to the Quahog
Maritime School, Chris.

Our curriculum consists of being on boats

for long periods of time with men,
just men for many days at a time.

Up on the deck with lots of men
or down in the galley with lots of men.

Is this some kind of pirate school?

Well, a certain kind of pirate.
Yes, we've been called that.

I don't know.

Is there some kind of preschool program?

You know, I have to admit

I've always been
a little worried about Chris,

but I guess I just convinced myself
things would work out for him.

But with no education,
what kind of future can he possibly have?

What are we supposed to do, Lois?

I mean, it's not like
the high school will take him back.

And every other school
we've tried just doesn't...

Oh, crap!

Ah!

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on. Hang on.

-What are we fighting about?
-(SIGHS)

You know, I have completely forgotten.

Me, too.

Something about a coupon. It's all...

-I cannot for the life of me remember.
-Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.

You know what?
I just... I hope I didn't hurt you.

No, no, no.
I... I'm all right. I'm all right.

But listen, you know what?
Let me make it up to you.

Why don't you let my wife and I
take you out to dinner?

Well, that sounds lovely.

Uh, that was delicious.

You know, I drive by
this place all the time

and I've never been inside,
isn't that funny?

Yeah, you know,
Nicole and I came here by accident.

We had reservations at another place
and they... right, right, honey?

Yeah, they couldn't seat us
for like an hour,

so we ended up coming here
and we just loved it.

-Loved it.
-I can see why.

I mean, th-that halibut was...

that, may have been the best
halibut I've ever had.

Well, glad we talked you
out of the pork chops, huh?

Yes! Thank you!

(CHUCKLING)

Oh, oh, oh, lemme, lemme,
let me... I'll get that.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I got it.

No, no, no, no, no.
I'm taking care of this.

No, no, no, no, your money's no good here.

My food was more expensive.
I feel bad. If I...

We invited you. I've got this.

-Look, just let go of the check, huh.
-You let go of the check.

-I'm not taking my hand off this thing.
-Well, neither am I.

Let go of the check.

-Ernie, if he wants to...
-Stay out of this!

Don't you talk to my wife like that!

Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

(ELECTRIC KNIFE WHIRRING)

(BUBBLING)

Aah!

(SCREAMING)

(PANTS)

(PANTING)

Sorry.

And every other school we've tried

just doesn't seem to be
a good fit for Chris.

Well, there is one other option.

Daddy, there's something
I need you to do for me.

Chris got expelled from James Woods High,

and, well, I was wondering
if you could get him

into that fancy
boarding school you went to.

You want me to get Chris
into Morningwood Academy?

It would mean so much to our family.

All right, I'll pull some
strings on one condition,

I want Peter to do something
really humiliating.

Well, what did you have in mind?

He has to shoot and star
in a shot-for-shot remake

of <i>Liar, Liar</i> for my amusement.

Do you know why I stopped you?

I didn't fasten my seat belt.
I didn't look in my rear view mirror.

I didn't signal when I pulled
away from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.

I changed lanes in the
intersection without signaling.

I changed lanes while running
a red light and speeding!

Ha...

Well, Chris, here we are.

Wow, this school is really nice.

Boy, a degree from here would set you up
with any job you wanted.

Yes, I should attend this institution.

Perhaps one day I could be
more powerful than King Friday.

I am the supreme ruler of the
Neighborhood of Make Believe.

So, Chris, how's the new school?

It's awful. I hate it!

Everybody's mean to me
because I'm not rich.

Oh, no, Chris, that's horrible.

All right, look, I'll tell you what.

I'll call Daddy and I'll see if there's
anything he can do.

we go to a local orphanage,
pick out a kid,

fill out all the paperwork
and then don't take him home.

It's hilarious.

That sounds kind of cruel.

No, no, you'll love it. It's great.

Come on. Come on in.
Your family's waiting in here.

There are toys. And a puppy.

And food that's not served
from warming trays.

Come on. You gotta want it.

Okay, I guess you don't want
a new family, toys, and a puppy.

-Hey, how are you?

Well, tell us everything, sweetie.

How's school going so far?

It's great, Mom.
I got powerful connections now,

thanks to Grandpa.

Chris, I'd give you a hug,

but I'm exhausted from working two jobs
to pay your tuition.

I've been selling buttscratchers.

-No, Peter.

-Buttscratcher.
-Peter, no.

-Buttscratcher!
-No!

Dad, you... you got an extra job
just to put me through school?

We all did, Chris.
Meg and I have been working nights.

I'll take the one on the right.

Well, once again, Meg,
I'll be back in an hour.

And I got a job following
fat people around with a tuba.

Yes, Chris. Your pledge period is over.

The Skull and Bones elders
are now ready to admit you to our ranks.

As is customary with all our new members,

you now have to spend
seven minutes in the closet

with our most senior member.

We don't start the clock
until the door closes.

You know, Grandpa, I don't think
I want to go through with it.

We all had to do it, Chris.
Now get in there.

No, I mean, I think I want to go
back to my old school.

My family's working so hard
to pay my tuition here,

and I feel bad.

Is there any way you can get me
back into James Woods High?

Well, I suppose I could pull some strings

if that's really what you want, Chris.

It is.

All right, consider it done.

Thanks, Grandpa.

-Sorry, Master Herbert.
-Sorry?

You better get your ass
in that closet, Pewterschmidt.

Yes, sir.

I am so tired of you.

Ah, it's good to have you back, buddy.

Thanks, Dad.
I didn't really fit in there anyway.

The rooms were only 15x20.

how much I appreciate
all your hard work.

It's really gonna make
a difference with my campaign.

Hey, Lois, take a look.

I just made 500 T-shirts that say

"Vote for Lois,
unless you're queer.

No, wait,
even if you're queer.

No Jews though.

Okay, Jews."

(NERVOUSLY) Oh...
These are wonderful, sweetie.

Chris, why don't you
put these upstairs

in your closet
so we don't lose them?

But the evil monkey
lives in my closet.

Of course,
he hasn't been as evil

since he became
a Jehovah's Witness.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

(DOOR OPENS)
Hi, I'm going door-to-door

to campaign on behalf
of Lois Griffin

who's offering real change
for the city of Quahog.

May we count on your vote
next Tuesday?

Chris, this is our house.

Ah, then what is for dinner?

-Pork chops.
-Excellent.

Chris, have you been
to any other houses?

I have not.

-Would you like to come in?
-Please.

This is Tom Tucker

with some breaking
election coverage.

Mayor Adam West has
widened his lead

over challenger Lois Griffin.

I'm confident that
the people of Quahog

will make the right choice.

And here to help me secure
the Latino vote

is actor Jimmy Smits.

Adam West likes to eat food
that's grilled in foil.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

That's our guy.

Boy, this election's
gonna be a tight one.

It's probably gonna be decided
by just a couple of votes.

And here we
are sitting here

like a bunch of lazy,
paraplegic cops.

-Huh?
-I'm sorry, Joe.

-It's just an expression.
-Ah.

We got to give Lois
a last-minute edge.

Guys, I need you to help
out on the campaign.

Oh, man, that's like
making all, like, signs,

and walking around or what?

You know, you bastards
got a stake in this, too.

I mean, Lois is my wife,
and if she's the mayor

we can pretty much do
whatever the hell we want.

I could do cocaine
if I wanted to.

Peter, you want
some potatoes?

Yeah, how you doin'?

I was just asking
if you wanted...

We got enough napkins?

Yeah, we got
enough napkins.

That's enough.
That's enough right there.

(EXHALES)
What time is it?

Is this-Is this straight?
Is this straight right there?

Look, wait, see...
I'll fix it.

No, no... Is this straight?
I can't tell...

(SCREAMS)

Meg, sweep that up.

Get, get a broom, sweep that up.
Sweep that up.

Put it in your room,
but sweep it up first.

Suspect number two,
he's the one who raped me.

All right, all but number
two are free to leave.

Ma'am, I know that
you're going through

a difficult time right now,

but I just have
a few more questions.

Are you planning
to vote tomorrow?

What?

Are you aware that
Lois Griffin has a plan

to cut property tax in half
over the next three years?

What does that have to do
with what happened to me?

Well, you say
number two did it,

maybe I say I smell
alcohol on your breath.

You can't do that!

Sounds like Lois Griffin
can count on your vote.

Hi. When you go to vote
for mayor tomorrow,

please vote for Lois Griffin.

That's right.
I work at a deli

and I know baloney.

And that's exactly
what you'll get

with Mayor Adam West.

Ooh, snap!

Boy, you guys,
I really appreciate

all the help
you've been giving us.

Except for you, Quagmire,
you ain't done nothing.

What the hell are you
talking about?

Lois is gonna get the entire
female vote 'cause of me.

I've been having sex
with every woman in town

nonstop for the past two days.

You know how many sperm
I got left? One.

He's all alone in there
and he's scared, all right?

-He's scared.
-Ha.

Welcome, Quahog,
to the town hall mayoral debate

between incumbent Adam West
and challenger Lois Griffin.

We will now open up
the floor to questions

from a community at large.

Yes, Mrs. Griffin,
how do you feel

about those computer websites
that put a blue square

on the home of a sex offender?

Well, the safety of our children

is a very important part
of my plan for Quahog.

I have a 12-point program
for the security of...

(GONG CLASHES)

I'm sorry, your time is up.

(CROWD MURMURING)

No, no, no, no,
I'm not impressed.

I'm not impressed, not yet.

Mayor West, if reelected,

would you increase the frequency
of garbage pickup?

Well, citizen,
that's an excellent question

and I thank you for it.

I think it's great
we live in a town

where you can ask questions.

Because without questions,

we'd just have answers.

And an answer without
a question is a statement.

Oh, I like him.

He looks me in the eye.

(CROWD MURMURING)

I'd like to have a beer with him.
I'm voting for him.

I don't understand these people.

He didn't even say anything
and they're eating it up.

Lois, undecided voters

are the biggest idiots
on the planet.

Try giving short,
simple answers.

Sir, your question, please?

Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan
to do about crime in our city?

A lot.

-(APPLAUSE, EXCITED MURMURING)
-She's got my vote.

Because that's what Jesus wants.

(APPLAUSE, EXCITED MURMURING)

9/11 was bad.

(CHEERING)

I agree with that.

God, I can't believe
how easy this is.

Mrs. Griffin,
what are your plans

for cleaning up our environment?

9/11.

(CHEERING)

Mrs. Griffin, what about
our traffic problem?

Nine...

(ANTICIPATED GROANS)

Eleven.

(CHEERING)

(RAUCOUS CHEERING)

Well, the election results
are pouring in

and it looks like it's
gonna be a tight one.

Which reminds me, Diane,

when's the last time you...
aw, forget it.

Oh, my God,
I'm an absolute wreck.

Well, folks, this is it.

The last of the votes
have been tallied

and we're getting
the final results in now.

Quahog's new mayor is...

Lois Griffin.

(CHEERING)

(EXCLAIMING)

Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

Oh.

Were we done cheering?

Ha.

Well, Mrs. Mayor,
how do you feel?

Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian,

but mostly I'm excited

about all the good
I'm gonna get to do.

Wow, look at you.

All that power and you've
still got that body.

And the first thing
I'm going to do as mayor

is clean up Lake Quahog.

Well, I know the people
will support you, Lois,

because you connect
with them.

Like Disney connects
with its audience.

You da cow!

No, you da cow!

Wow, Disney gets us.

And I think we all realize
the importance of stopping

the environmental damage
being done to Lake Quahog,

which is why I'm proposing
a very modest tax increase

-that will help us to...
-(CROWD GROANING)

(BOOING)

No, no, no, that's awful.

No, no, no,
I'm not okay with that.

No new taxes!

ALL: (CHANTING)
No new taxes!

No new taxes!

No new taxes!

But what about the terrorists?

(AUDIBLE GASPS)

That's right, terrorists.

We have intelligence
that suggests that...

Hitler is plotting with...

with the Legion of Doom...

to assassinate Jesus...

using the lake as a base.

(FRANTIC MURMURING)

ANNOUNCER: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>at the Legion of Doom...</i>

How did she discover our plan?

Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of
dropped the ball on that one.

And we also
have evidence that...

Darth Vader tried to buy
yellowcake uranium...

from unwed teenage mothers.

Those things all sound scary.

How much money before
it can feel safe again?

Um...

a hundred thousand?

(EXCITED MURMURING)

I threw a ten. See that ten there?
I threw that.

At the top of the news,
Lake Quahog is once again clean,

thanks to the efforts of newly
elected mayor, Lois Griffin.

We now go to Asian reporter,
Tricia Takanawa,

for her slant on the story.

Thanks, Tom.

Once again, happy locals

are frolicking in the waters
of Lake Quahog.

And we're here
with their reactions.

Sir, how does it feel
to have the lake back?

Well, I'll tell you, Tricia,
as a local resident,

I feel like I can once again

take pride in my community.

I think this is really
gonna revitalize tourism.

And--

And if you look around,

I think even the wildlife
is starting to come back.

And, you know, that's something
we haven't seen in a while.

I think we're going to be
seeing a lot more of that.

Hey, you guys.

Mom, everyone on TV says
you're running the town great.

Maybe you can do some
damn laundry once in a while.

-What?
-What?

Wow, Mom, is that a new purse?

Yeah, that looks pretty expensive.

Well, don't tell anybody, Brian,

but I was a little naughty.
(CHUCKLES)

I may have dipped into
the tax surplus.

Wait a minute,
you used taxpayer money

to buy yourself a handbag?

It's no big deal, Brian.

Besides, there was a lot left
over after the lake cleanup

and I figured maybe I earned
a little treat, huh?

Lois, spending even one penny
of that money on yourself

is incredibly unethical.

Oh, come on,
it was only $600.

My God, that's more than I spent

to go see that prizefight in Vegas.

I thought you said we was
going to see <i>Hairspray.</i>

Bitch, I thought
I said just shut up

and be lookin' fine.

What the hell's up with
these rolling blackouts?

Well, since Lois is the mayor,

I'm allowed to reroute
all the town's electricity.

What'd you do that for?

So I could reanimate
the corpse of Jim Varney.

Howdy, Vern.

This is some dad-gum nice
house you got here, Vern.

That's Vern, Vern,
Vern, Vern.

Oh, wait, wait, it was John
Belushi, that's who I wanted.

-Peter, how could you...
-Way ahead of you, Brian.

My mistake, I'll take care of this.

Hey, Jim, come out in the yard, will ya?

Sure thing, Vern.

(GUN COCKING, FIRES)

He got the shotgun, Brian!

Don't ask me how he did it,

but Jim Varney got the shotgun!

-Run for your life!
-What!

Run!

Excuse me, how much
is this coat?

It's $4,300.

Oh.

Do you think
you can give me

a little mayoral discount?

Well, I think you're doing
a great job, Mrs. Griffin,

but my boss would kill me.

How's everything
going out here?

Fine, Mr. Voorhees.

Good. 'Cause if you
screw up, I'll kill ya.

Hi. Bob Grossbeard, Quahog Oil.

I'd like to buy you that coat.

Really?

All I ask in return
is that you let my company

do just a little bit
of dumping in your lake.

This guy don't sit
right with me, Lois.

He don't sit right with me.

But I just cleaned
up Quahog Lake.

Do you want the coat or not?

I want the coat.

Excellent.

Then we have a deal.

Ugh, Brian's gonna be really
upset when he finds out.

Eh, I'll just take him
for a ride in the car,

he'll forget all about it.

(SNIFFING)

Wait a minute,
I know where we are.

The park is near here.

We're near the park, Lois.

Oh, that's the tree.
I peed on that.

Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois.

There's another dog in that car.

Hey, hey, hey!

There's another dog
in that car. Hey!

Are you seeing that!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Other dog, (BLEEP) you!

Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of the Quahog Oil Refinery,

we would like to thank
Mayor Lois Griffin

for our newest waste pipe.

Let the dumping resume.

Hey, Jake, how long can you
hold your breath under water?

Longer than you.
Check it out.

(SCREAMS)

Ahhh! My face!

(SCREAMING)

Lois, what the hell
are you doing?

Remembering who I am,
you crook.

Oh, I'm a crook, am I?

What about all the money
you embezzled?

You want people to
find out about that?

You better play ball, or we'll
find someone else who will.

I'll play ball.

You know what, West?

You can have your job back.

Politics does terrible things
to good people.

Good for you, Lois.

You wised up before
it was too late.

I was so consumed by
power and money,

I became the very thing
I set out to destroy.

Hooray!
I'm mayor again!

Don't we need to have
a whole new election?

There.

Now no one will
have heard him say that.

We all heard him say it.

Anybody else hear anything?

My wife did.

Brian, Molly Ringwald is in my bed,

That's not all.

Look at this place.

Everything's different.

This is crazy.

Brian, did you ever see
that<i> Twilight Zone </i>episode?

You know, where the woman wakes up
in the hospital,

and all the doctors are pigs?

-Yeah.
-I like that one.

But what the hell is going on here?

You know, I think I have a theory.

It's possible that
when we went back in time,

we somehow altered the past.

Geez, Brian, that's more ridiculous

than the theory of why
Tom Cruise runs in all his movies.

Wow, that cameraman has nice strong arms.

You can't catch me, gay thoughts.

-Hey, where the hell is Lois?
-That's weird.

Looks like she's coming out

Lois, what the hell?

I'm gone for one night,
and you sleep with Quagmire?

Mr. Griffin, what I do

Brian, what the hell is going on?

We were only in 1984 one night,

and now everything's all messed up.

I think I can explain it to you, Peter.

This line represents
the normal flow of events.

Here's where you met Lois,
here's where you got married,

and here's the present.

And here's the night at the bar.

Now, at some point during that evening,

you did something that changed
the course of your history,

causing the time line to skew off

into an alternate tangent,

where you're married to Molly Ringwald,

Quagmire's married to Lois,
and for some reason,

we have a chalkboard in the living room.

Well, what are we gonna do?

We got to figure out what
happened at this point in time.

And I'll tell you another thing
that worries me.

You ever hear the theory
that if you kill a butterfly

in the past, it can drastically
alter the present?

Well, who knows what else we changed.

Don't freak out like you did
when your goldfish died.

Here you go, Lieutenant Shiny-Sides.

It's okay. You don't have to eat it now.

You're just sleeping.

(VOICE BREAKING) You'll eat it later.

You'll eat it later,
Lieutenant Shiny-Sides!

(SOBBING)

Meg, stop staring at Mr. Griffin.

I'm sorry, Peter.

I'm afraid she's got her father's libido.

What can I say? I'm a Vagitarius. Oh!

(ALL THREE LAUGHING)

ALL THREE: Giggity, giggity, giggity,
giggity, giggity, giggity.

Hey, did you guys hear on the news

about President Gore hunting down

and killing Osama Bin Laden
with his bare hands?

I know. Who would've thought

Bin Laden was hiding out
in the cast of <i>Mad TV.</i>

Man, the perfect hiding spot.

The one place no one would look.

-(BUZZER SOUNDS)
-Oh, there's the pie.

Lois, this is a huge mistake.

What are you talking about, Peter?

You're supposed to be married to me.

We're the ones who were
meant to be together.

Not you and Quagmire.

(LAUGHS) It's a little late for that,
don't you think, Peter?

I mean, there was a time
back when we dated

that I thought you might be the one,

but as I recall, you were more interested

in partying with your friends.

Then Glenn came along,
and stole my heart. (LAUGHS)

When he kissed me that night
at the Country Club Dance,

I knew we'd be together forever.

Hey Lois, I'm ready for your pie.

And you made dessert, too! Oh!

(LAUGHING) Oh, Glenn,

I love all your sex jokes
and your dirty puns.

That's why I married you.

-Mmm.
-Let's go upstairs and do it.

Okay!

Brian, going back in time ruined my life.

We've got to get Death
to send us back to 1984 again

so I can undo what I did.

Or we could just make the best of this.

Al Gore is President.

We could kind of just take
that one and call it a win.

I mean, with Bush,
we didn't have flying cars

that run on vegetable oil.

No! No! I took this one out for you.

You take this one, I keep this!

You are not taking
my whole wallet so you can go shopping.

I was just going to buy some groceries.

Bull crap.

I don't care what it takes, Brian,

I've got to get Lois back somehow.

Well, the only one
who can help us is Death,

and he only shows up when somebody dies.

(SIGHS) That's gonna be tough.

With President Gore's
universal health care,

people are living much longer these days.

And with zero tolerance gun control

and a strong, well-funded
educational system,

there's no street crime.

Face it, Peter, you not marrying Lois

was the best thing that
ever happened to the world.

I don't care. We've got to find a way

to summon Death and quick.

(THUD)

Well, that might do it.

Death, oh, thank God you're here!

Listen, you've got to
send me back in time again

so I can marry Lois.

Man, it's been a busy day.

Dick Cheney, the chairman of Halliburton,

shot Supreme Court Justice
Scalia in a hunting accident,

Oh, my God, Peter, you can't marry Lois.

I don't know who any of those people are.

All right, hang on.

Here we go.

This is the exact moment in 1984

that I sent you to the first time.

You've just got to manage
not to screw it up again.

Lois! Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

Hey, Peter, you all set
to go see<i> Zapped! </i>tonight?

I figured Scott Baio
was androgynous enough that we could...

That we could both fantasize about him

and no one would be gay,
yeah, I know the joke.

Hey, you know what, listen,<i> Zapped! </i>sucks.

Why don't we go see <i>Krull?</i>

Peter, you know I'm dying to see <i>Zapped!.</i>

I would much prefer <i>Krull.</i>

Well, maybe you should
just go by yourself.

-Well, maybe I will.
-Fine.

Crap. Death!

-What?
-One more time.

Hey, Peter, you all set
to go see<i> Zapped! </i>tonight?

I figured Scott Baio
was androgynous enough

-that we could...
-(LAUGHING) That's hilarious!

You are a delight.

And<i> Zapped! </i>is one of my favorite movies.

I look forward to watching it
with you, sweetheart.

Oh, wonderful.

(PETER PASSES GAS)

Death!

Hey, Peter, you all set

Yeah, yeah, Scott Baio, gay,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

(LAUGHS) I can't wait to see the movie.

Well, terrific.

I'll see you tonight.

Oh, hey, Peter.

Say, I was just getting
ready to hit the town.

You want to join me?

I can't, Cleveland,
I got a date with Lois.

It's gonna be fun.

It is?

Aw, crap! Death!

No. You know what? I'm not doing it again.

Screw this. No more mulligans.

You're on your own.

Oh, damn it, Brian,
what the hell am I gonna do now?

I haven't screwed up this bad

since I bought Joe Piscopo
that barbell set.

All right Joe, now don't
get carried away with this.

Don't worry, Peter.

I'll only work out during my downtime.

Oh, look who it is.

Only 14 hours late.

If you don't want to
spend time with me, Peter, that's fine.

But at least don't
make me wait up all night for you.

Lois, I'm so sorry.

I promise, I'll make it up to you tonight.

We can watch any stupid movie you want.

Sorry, I've already got plans.

What do you... what do you mean "plans"?

I'm going to the Country
Club Dance with Glenn.

I wanted to surprise you

with the invitation last night,

but you never showed up.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready.

Peter, the Country Club Dance
is where Lois said

she fell in love with Quagmire.

If they kiss at that dance,
you're finished.

You're right, Brian.
We've got to stop them.

And I think I know how.

-Peter!
-Oh, God, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You're right, let's go to the dance.

Peter used to be so passionate.

Suddenly he just doesn't
seem very interested in me anymore.

Lois, if may speak freely, as a friend?

You deserve better than Peter.

You deserve a gentleman.

Oh, Glenn, you're so sweet.

Oh, something poked me.

It's okay, it's okay.

It's just my wang.

PETER: (GRUNTS) Now I know what
a TV dinner feels like.

-BRIAN: What?
-It's a line from <i>Die Hard.</i>

We could write it, Brian.

After we're done with this,
we could write it.

Peter, I am here with Glenn.

You had your chance

Now leave us alone.

Is that what you really want, Lois?

Yes, it is.

Well, I guess that's it.

Who the hell am I kidding?

I don't deserve her.

Come on, Peter.

Prove to Lois that you love her.

It's your last chance.

-Hey, Quagmire.
-Huh?

Sorry, Lois, but I have to do this.

(LOIS MOANING)

Oh, Peter, that was so passionate.

Why, I didn't know
I meant that much to you.

Are you kidding?

Lois, I couldn't bear to live without you.

I came back thinking

I was missing something in my life.

But what I almost missed

was the best thing that's

Yes.

Hi, my sexy friend and I are looking for
a ship to take us to Alderaan,

and I'm willing to pay big money.

Well, you've come to the right place.

I'm Han Solo,
captain of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>

and the only actor whose career
isn't destroyed by this movie.

-Is it a fast ship?
-Are you kidding?

It's the ship that made the Kessel Run
in less than 12 parsecs.

Isn't a parsec
a unit of distance, not time?

(STUTTERING)

Chewie, take these guys to the ship
and get her ready.

He died of leukemia.

How do you feel now?

<i>-You got any strawberry milk in there?</i>
-No, but she'll make 0.5 past light speed.

If you want, I'll show you around,

since no one's trying to stop the ship
or blast us.

STORMTROOPER:
<i>Stop that ship, blast them.</i>

Oh, now I can't show you around.
Quick, get in the ship.

Looks like we got Imperial Cruisers
on our tail.

Oh, look at that one on the left.
Get off your cell phone, you are driving.

(RADAR BEEPING)

They're gaining on us.

We'll be safe enough,
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

That was your maneuver?
Moving slightly to the left?

Well, I mean,
we're not in the same place we were, huh?

-That ought to confuse 'em.
-Yeah, but you hardly did anything.

You just started listing
lazily to the left.

I'm pretty sure they can keep up.

Where did they go?

There they are! They're listing lazily
to the left. Go left, left!

Boy, this guy knows some maneuvers.

All right, strap yourselves in,
I'm about to make the jump to light speed.

Did he say "strap in" or "strap on"?

Man, hyperspace always looks so freaky.

Nothing but net.

Hi, I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips

on blowing up the Death Star.

First off, never forget your objective.

There are gonna be so many folks
coming at you to slow you down,

you might feel like you got
a bull's-eye on your head.

Naw, but they <i>will</i>
be trying to kill you.

Also, don't forget you have
teammates out there

watching your back,

unless you been messing around
with their wife or girlfriend.

Naw, but they <i>will</i> be there to help you.

Lastly, you want to make sure
you step back and take cover

after you sink that bucket,

'cause that sky gonna light up
like the Fourth of July.

Naw, but there <i>will</i>
be a large explosion.

Well, kid, I guess this is good-bye.

So, you got your reward and
you're leaving. Is that it?

Well, when you say it that way,

I sound like a douche, but,
yeah, that's what I'm doing.

What'd you get for a reward anyway?

Uh, let's see, I got 10% off
a Netflix membership, um...

some nice Cracker Barrel cheddar,

uh, assorted lotions,

and... a little plastic
champagne bottle

full of jelly beans...

and a little bear.

See? Little bear?

I-I don't think people are

even aware of that show's existence.

Well, I don't know, Dad.

I think a decent number
of people watch it.

Oh really? Define "decent."

I think it's the highest-rated show

on Cartoon Network,

and the <i>Star Wars </i>episode

doubled that audience.

Well, yeah, but double ten people

is like 20 people, so, I mean,

what kind of numbers are we
talking about here, you know?

Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad.

It's a legitimate show,

and they beat you to the punch.

Uh... I-I don't know
about that, Chris.

I mean, to me, a legitimate
show is on ABC, CBS, NBC...

You know, one of the real networks.

(LAUGHING) I don't know about that, Dad.

And besides, what's up
with that 15-minute runtime?

Wh-What is that? It's like 15 minutes

Oh, yay, yay, tune me into that.

Well, maybe I could talk to Carl
and get you a job here.

-You could do that?
-Absolutely. Carl totally trusts me.

You and I will be the best brother-sister
team since Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal.

-I'm more off-putting.
-No, I'm more off-putting.

I'm more unattractive
to put in a lead role.

-Well, I'm a bigger box office drag.
-Kids, kids. You're both...

Just awful.

Oh, hi, Brian.

I thought you were
spending the day with Jillian.

I was, but Peter took her off my hands.

Perfect timing. I've been feeling
a little smothered lately.

Plus, it's given me a chance
to work on my novel.

-And I finally have a title.
-Oh, what is it?

"Faster Than the Speed of Love."

(LAUGHING)

That is the worst title I've ever heard.

No, it's the story of a boy
who has to rescue his father,

who's a pilot that's been taken captive
by a militant Islamic country.

(LAUGHING)

That's the movie <i>Iron Eagle.</i>

What? Is that... Is that a recent film?

They made three sequels!

Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's got to
gather all these old World War II pilots

to help him rescue his father.

That's one of the sequels!

Well, well, in mine,
one of the World War II guys is Japanese,

but they accept him anyway.

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

I'm going to pee in my pants!

Boy, it sure is fun
hanging out with you, Peter.

(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

That means "thank you"
in my new language I'm inventing.

(CHUCKLING)

Anyway, all I was saying is,
if you think about it,

it shouldn't have been
<i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</i>

It should've been <i>Ferris Bueller's Day On,</i>

'cause that was all the stuff
he wanted to do.

Yeah! And he was so on that day,
so it kind of works on two levels.

Well, I don't know what you mean by that,
but how about that Cameron, huh?

-Oh, definitely.
-Am I right?

It was his day off, too.

That is just what I was going to...
His day off...

That is just what I was going to say.

You know, you are a catch, young lady.
You know that?

I don't know when the hell Brian is going
to open his eyes and get serious with you.

(SIGHS)

I really wish he would.

It'd be so great
if we were at least living together.

Well, you need to
just lay it on the line with him.

Either he commits to you, or you're gone.

What the hell did you do?

Because of what you said,
Jillian wants us to move in together!

Well, I think you should, Brian.
She's beautiful, she's funny,

and she is smart as the day is wide.

Don't you understand? I don't want
a committed relationship with Jillian.

Well, it sounds like she does.
And if you're never going to get serious,

then you're not being fair to her.

I mean, what are you, Brian?

One of those creepy guys
who just uses a woman for sex?

Because Jillian deserves better.

She has feelings, you know,

and she's devoted a lot of time
and energy to this relationship

with some expectation that it could grow
into something much more significant,

and if you're just stringing her along,

well, then I got to say, I have lost
a lot of respect for you, Brian.

You don't really think
I'm like that, do you?

-Prove me wrong.
-All right, I will, Lois.

I will ask her to move in with me,
and you'll see, I've got what it takes.

Boy, you know, I got to tell you, Jillian,
this move is really working out great.

-It just feels right, you know.
-Cool. Rock on, Brian.

Okay, done.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Stewie. Hey. What's up?

Oh, I was just on my way
back from the cobbler.

Figured before I stopped
by the apothecary, I'd come here,

and then it's off to the haberdasher.

These turn of the century business jokes
doing anything for you?

-Not really.
-Did you use the jokes?

Yeah, they're not landing.

-Got your mail. So, how's it going?
-I tell you, Stewie, it's going great.

And that's the worst part.
I can't afford the rent.

I'll be lucky if I can make it
to the end of the month.

Sounds like you need a roommate.

-Where did you get that kind of money?
-I picked up Chris's paper route.

Oh, OshKosh B'Gosh,
it's a brand new paperboy.

That's a mighty full sack you're carrying.

-Piss off, you perverted old freak!
-Oh, we got a fighter.

Wow, you were almost in a dirt bike race?

Yeah, yeah, I filled out
most of the paperwork, too.

-You are the coolest guy I have ever met.
-Yeah?

Hey, guys. Chris, I need you to
stack the boxes in the back for me.

You know what, Meg?
Why don't you do that?

-I need Chris up here with me.
-But the boxes are really heavy.

Oh, that's 'cause
there's a bunch of stuff in them.

Chris?

(LAUGHING)

Yeah.

Chris, you ever see
the movie <i>Cruel Intentions?</i>

No.

Oh, Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar
make out. It's pretty hot.

47 minutes, 16 seconds in.

-No way.
-Yeah, yeah.

You know what's another great movie?

<i>Career Opportunities</i> with
Jennifer Connelly.

I mean, that's one of those movies that...

I mean, she's really hot in it,
but it's also a good movie.

She was in <i>A Beautiful Mind,</i>
and I've got to say,

the direction was excellent,
but I was very disappointed that she...

Wore clothes the entire film.

Was she hot in it?

Yeah, in the way that, like,
classy women with expensive clothing

who never take them off are hot,
you know?

-No.
-All right.

So, like, you see a hot girl,

and you're, like, "Okay, I appreciate
your exterior beauty

"'cause you've definitely worked at it

"with the clothing, and the jewelry,
and the makeup and stuff."

But secretly, I'm just, like, "Hey, man...

"Where is the chase
and how do I cut to it?"

Wow, you're smart.

What?

Listen, I hope you don't mind
Stewie staying with us for a little while.

He... He just gets really lonely
without me at home.

You're so fatherly. It really turns me on.

STEWIE: Brian, there's no more
graham crackers.

-They're in the cabinet.
-I don't see them.

They're right in front of you.
Which cabinet are you looking at?

-Can't you just come in here?
-No, I'm busy!

(CLATTERING)

Oh, no! Oh, no, Brian!

Oh, no! Oh, no!

Oh, Brian, we need paper towels!

Oh! Oh, it's going under the fridge! Oh!

-Just use a dish towel!
-There aren't any, Brian!

You need to come in here!
Oh! We are gonna have ants!

A hundred points.

<i>Meg, clean up aisle two.</i>

What the hell is this?
I am not cleaning this up.

-Meg, less talkie, more sweepie.
-Shut up, Chris!

You can't tell me what to do.

Actually, Meg, as your supervisor, he can.

-Supervisor?
-Yeah, I promoted him this morning.

-Promoted me this morning.
-What?

Carl, you promised me
that assistant manager position.

Meg, things change.

Hey, you ever see
<i>Broken Lizard's Club Dread?</i>

No.

Well, go see that movie
and absorb its message,

and you'll get the gist
of what I'm talking about.

-Carl, this isn't fair!
-All right, then, you're fired.

What? But... No, you can't...

(CRYING)

Don't worry about it, Chris,
she'll be fine.

Hey, by the way, you know who else is hot
in kind of a screwed up way?

Mary Stuart Masterson.

Yeah, yeah, in that sort of
"you think you could get her,

"'cause she could be your brother"
kind of thing.

Like, she's gettable, you know?
Like Elisabeth Shue.

-Oh, I remember her.
-Yeah.

You know, she was in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>
in addition to <i>Adventures in Babysitting.</i>

One of those underrated actresses
that was always talented and beautiful,

and never quite popped,
if you know the meaning.

-Who, Elisabeth Shue?
-Yeah.

Like totally naked in <i>Leaving Las Vegas.</i>

And still so hot. Like...

-I don't see art films.
-Like, like, crazy hot.

Yeah, it's about
39 minutes, 45 seconds in.

-Oh.
-It's a really exceptional sequence.

I mean, Nick Cage is
poisoning himself with alcohol.

He's a... He's a failed writer
who just decides that,

"Oh, I'm going to have
a big last hurrah in Las Vegas."

And then he meets a whore and pays her
a bunch of money to stay with him,

and have sex with him
while he murders himself slowly.

And, you know, she's game for it,
but she catches feelings midway through

and the whole thing changes.

Wow, have you seen <i>Cocktail?</i>

-Yeah, yeah.
-She was in that.

-She was in that.
-Yeah.

(JILLIAN AND BRIAN CHUCKLING)

-BRIAN: You like that?
-Yeah, it's rad.

BRIAN: Don't talk, please.
Hang on, let me get a condom.

-Brian, are you guys up?
-Stewie, what the hell are you doing?

-Go back to bed.
-But I'm not tired.

-And I'm lonely.
-Oh, come, get in bed with us.

-Oh, all right. "Dear <i>Penthouse Forum."</i>
-No, no, Stewie, go away!

Brian, don't be mean to him.

Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me,
I'll stop paying the rent.

-What did he say?
-Nothing.

That's right, I'm paying
Mr. Lickity Self's half of the rent.

Is that true?

-All right, yes, fine, it's true.
-Why didn't you say anything?

Because you wanted me
to move in so badly,

and God knows I didn't want to...

Wait... You didn't want to
move in with me?

Well, honestly, no.

Oh, my God! I've never felt so stupid!

-Really?
-Really?

Well, I don't want to be
your guilty burden, Brian!

-We're through!
-Jillian, wait!

-Damn it.
-I'm sorry, Brian.

You'll feel better in the morning.

(SIGHS)

STEWIE: Hey, you know
what you should do?

You should have sex with somebody else

just to get back at her
for walking out on you.

Just have sex with somebody. Anybody.
Just don't even think about it.

The next person you see.
The very next person you see.

-She's gone, Jillian's gone.
-Look, Brian, I know you're upset now,

but I think it's important
to see things in perspective.

Remember when Alex P. Keaton
lost his girlfriend?

And then he got another one,
and everything was all right?

And then he got Parkinson's. Yikes.

You know, Stewie, you're right.
This is not a loss, it's an opportunity.

I'm free now.
I've got my own place, no attachments.

There you are. That's just the kind of
can-do spirit that built this nation.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

-"that all men are created equal."
-Except the Jews.

Franklin, for the fifth time,
I'm sorry you overpaid for your house,

-but it's not going in.
-You'll be sorry.

Noted. Moving on.

-So, Meg, any luck finding another job?
-No. Hardly anybody's hiring right now.

The only job I could find was
for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.

What am I wearing? A hat and glasses.

What kind of underwear? I don't know.

Big underwear, I guess. I'm sorry, what?

Oh, what would I do to you? Well...

I guess maybe we'd get pizza.
And we could watch <i>House.</i>

All right, I am totally flaccid,

but thank you anyway, ma'am,
I appreciate your time.

Mom, check it out!

I just got my paycheck and my salary's
doubled ever since Meg got fired.

Oh, shut up, you bastard!

Chris, we should have a talk about Meg.
She's really upset that she got fired.

Gee, I didn't realize working at the store
meant that much to her.

You know, it would mean the world to her
if she could get her job back.

And you'd be one terrific brother
if you could help her.

Well, gosh, Mom, I'll sure try. Poor Meg.

She got a worse deal than that no-armed
baseball player, Bucky LaGrange.

ANNOUNCER:<i> Groundball to shortstop.</i>
<i>The throw is to second,</i>

<i>and again, the ball sails past LaGrange</i>
<i>into right field.</i>

<i>The runners will score and a cascade</i>
<i>of "boos" rain down from the stands,</i>

<i>as clearly the fans' sympathy for this</i>
<i>scrappy, little no-armed man has run out.</i>

<i>Now, granted, the throw was a little wide,</i>

<i>but you've got to believe that a two-armed</i>
<i>player would've made the catch.</i>

<i>In fact, a one-armed player</i>
<i>would have at least had a shot at it,</i>

<i>which calls to mind</i>
<i>the question once again,</i>

<i>why, with all the two-armed youngsters</i>
<i>waiting in the minor leagues,</i>

<i>does this team stick with</i>
<i>an armless second baseman?</i>

-JERRY:<i> And he hasn't had a hit in ever.</i>
<i>-In ever, Jerry. In ever.</i>

What the hell? What are you people doing
in my apartment?

Hey! You made it.

-What is all this? What's going on?
-You, that's what's going on.

Come on, time for you
to meet some women

who are gonna make you
forget about Jillian.

Looks like there's a lot of gay guys here.

Yeah, everybody's having a good time.

Brian, I want to introduce you to Joanna.

Look out for this one,
she's a bit of a card.

Okay, here's one for you.

-What food can't make up its mind?
-This is gonna be good.

(LAUGHING)

A waffle.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

This one. Didn't I warn you, right? Right?

How are you still single?

Hey there, buddy. Check it out.
Check it out.

I put a cruller in the Jerry's Kids jar.
I thought that would be funny.

That is hilarious, but, Carl,
I want you to hire my sister back.

No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass.
I don't want her back in here.

Well, that's a shame, because
I watched <i>Event Horizon</i> last night.

-No way! We have to talk about it!
-Yeah, well, my memory is kind of hazy.

We have to talk about every scene, man.

Hey, hey, hey! Remember when
Jack Noseworthy's eyes explode?

Wasn't that awesome? Please agree
with me that, that was awesome.

Well, if you hire Meg back,
maybe I'll have an opinion.

She's hired, she's hired!
What do you think of it?

It was awesome!

-Wasn't it awesome?
-It was totally awesome!

It was the most awesome thing ever!
Hug me!

-Hey, how you doing, Brian?
-Lousy.

I know who can cheer you up.
The robot from <i>SpaceCamp.</i>

-Brian and Jinx are friends.
-Get that out of here.

Okay, how about the robot from <i>Rocky IV?</i>

(ROBOT SPEAKING)

Look, Stewie, get these stupid '80s movie
robots out of here, and leave me alone.

It's all your fault that Jillian's gone.

My fault? Brian, you've got
no one to blame but yourself.

You let the fat man talk you
into moving out.

You let Jillian walk out the door.
Stop getting pushed around.

Be a man. If you want her, go get her.

You know something?
You are absolutely right.

It is time for me
to take charge of my own life.

Stand aside, I got to get my girl back.

Go, get her, Brian.

-Hi.
-Hi, Brian.

-What are you doing here?
-Jillian, look, I made a huge mistake.

I don't want to lose you.

You know, you really hurt me, Brian.
And I can't let you do that again.

Look, I won't. I promise.

I don't know how to tell you this,
but you're too late. I met someone else.

Jillian, do you get the Oxygen Network?
If I miss my <i>Moesha,</i> I get a bit crabby.

In a minute, Adam.

Well, I guess this is good-bye.

-Please don't send me away.
-I have to.

You broke my heart.

Well, Meg, you got your job back.

Actually, Chris, I don't.
I really appreciate what you did for me,

but I can't work for that guy anymore.
He's a freak.

The important thing is
that you stood up for me,

and I won't forget it.

Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian,
but it is good to have you back.

Kind of sucks though.

I mean, you are never gonna find a chick
that hot again.

You know what the mistake was,
moving in together.

Well, it's just another
life experience, I guess.

Hey, and look on the bright side.

Maybe you got
another chapter for your book.

Oh, yeah, pile it on, pile it on.

Welcome home, douche bag!

Couldn't we just ask the women to leave?

No, no. I got something way more expensive

Well, men, the Quahog Men's Club
is complete.

It took six weeks and cost $8,000,

but it was worth it.

get rid of this thing.

if it meant you could have sex
with Angelina Jolie?

Uh...

No closing your eyes and

I think still yes.

Thank you, Peter.

All right, here's another one.

Who would you rather have sex with?

A very pregnant Gina Gershon

or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?

Wait, hang on, hang on...

Look, you know,
I know this is a men's club,

but why does it always have
to be about sex?

Like, okay, look, how
about this, how about this:

who would you rather start
a small business with,

Janet Reno after a safari,

or the fat guy
from <i>My Name is Earl?</i>

-That still sounds like a sex question.
-It is not.

Well, then what the hell does
"safari" have to do with it?

What's the guy
from <i>Earl's </i>credit rating?

-651.
-That's not bad.

-Better than mine.
-Does he have an idea,

or do I have to come up with it myself?

He's got an idea,
but it's not quite there.

I'd have to give it to Janet Reno,

'cause I've always had this
business plan

for home delivery
of prescription medications,

and that seems like
it's more her market.

This is stupid!

I want to talk about vaginas!

He's not saying it, Peter.

(WHISPERING)

What?

-(WHISPERING)
-No.

Why would I say that?
It's not even a word.

-What isn't a word?
-Bonerific.

-Ah!
-Ah!

You can't keep this guy
from saying it!

-Boy, great party, huh, Fred?
-Yeah.

You know, Barn, I figure
I ought to tell you this.

I was walking by your house
the other day,

and, uh, I poked my head
in the window

and Betty was undressing.

Uh, she saw me there,
but she didn't stop.

-What?
-She didn't stop.

I mean, she saw me there,

looking at her,
and she kept undressing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you serious?

Yeah.

I got an erocktion.

(GROANS)
I got a headache.

-Do you have any Anacin?
-Any what?

-Anacin?
-Yeah, Anacin.

Do they even make Anacin anymore?

Yeah, it's still around. Why?

No, it just seems like
sort of a '70s medication.

-So, you don't have any Anacin?
-No.

God, you're more worthless
than Colin Farrell.

So, uh...

Got the wool cap on, huh?

Yeah, yeah, I guess, you know,

whatever, it's 96 degrees out.

Yeah, you'd better put
on the old wool cap.

Yeah.

You got a lot going on under there, yeah?

Under... Under the wool cap?

Thinking about your sideburns?

Yeah. No, no, no, no,
you're not a complete jackass.

Yeah.
Oh, hey, nice T-shirt.

"Phresh" and it...
and it's spelled with a "P-H."

Oh, that's fun, 'cause
it's usually spelled with an "F."

Yeah. Oh, you got a little tear
in your pants, there...

Oh, that's on purpose, though, isn't it?

Oh, yeah, yeah, you're a bad boy.

You're a bad boy.

Society wants your pants to be intact,

but you're just not gonna listen, are you?

My God, this is ridiculous.

I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, one more pre-party drink,

and then we'll head off to the Clam.

It's cheaper to drink at your house first.

(MEN CHEERING)

Boy, they sure are making
a lot of noise out there.

Those idiots have done nothing

but hang out in that stupid shed
for the last two days.

We should crash that party.

Hey, you know what,
Bernice is right.

They're always trying to get away from us.

We should march in there

and remind them that they have wives.

Especially if they have food,

because bar food is so overpriced.

Man, who invited Anne Frank?

Quagmire, tell that story

about the girl with the inside-out anus.

-Oh, you mean Blossom?
-Oh, that's a great story.

All right, so I'm skulking
around the intensive care unit,

and all of sudden
this smoking hot chick...

Hey, boys!
Mind if we join the party?

-Sorry, Lois, no girls allowed.
-Oh, come on, Peter.

It'd be good to have
some chicks in here.

Quagmire, you nuts?
This is a men's club.

There's the problem.
The ratio be terrible.

It's a total mast-fest in here.

Yeah, this is sort of lame.

Well, we can fix that.

Come on, girls, let's dance!

-(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
-Hey, hey, hey, stop it!

You women can't dance in here!

Well, I know two people
who'll take my side on this.

The stuffy parents from <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

Right, guys?

Sorry, Peter. Even we're getting into it.

Oh!

What's the matter, Bonnie?

Don't you want to dance?

Oh, it's okay, Joe.

I don't mind sitting here with you.

What I mean is...

I don't want to hold you back.

Don't be silly, honey.

It's just as nice watching
other people have fun.

God, I hate being handicapped.

Sometimes I feel more useless

than the head of the Maid's Union.

And what exactly are your demands?

We need more Lemon Pledge.

You need more Lemon Pledge?

Yes.

We're not responsible for that.

You should just bring
it from your own home.

No.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello.

Oh, hi, Lois.

Yeah, last night was fun.

Oh, it's okay,
I'm used to not dancing.

I mean, I knew what to expect
after, you know, Joe's accident,

and I'm... I'm prepared to live
the rest of my life this way.

Poor Bonnie.

She deserves so much better
than me.

God, she must regret this marriage.

If only there was some way
for me to walk again.

Wait a minute, what am I saying?

There's nothing wrong with me.

I'm no different
than any other guy!

Joe, would you put on your hand-shoes

and take out the garbage?

Thank you.

(SOBBING)

Hey, thanks for coming with me, Peter.

It sure would be wonderful

if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.

I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese,

but I'm not sure if any cosmetic surgery
is even possible.

Look, if it's
a financial issue...

It's not an issue of money,

your head is a cheeseburger.

There's no blood flow to it.

It's just,
it's just dead cow meat.

All right, well,

I appreciate you giving it to me straight.

All right, then, have a tasty afternoon.

-(CHUCKLES)
-Ah, there's a smile.

So, what can I do for you, Mr. Swanson?

Doc, I can't take it anymore.

I want to walk again.
I'll do whatever it takes.

Well, there is a highly
experimental new procedure.

It's essentially a leg transplant.

If you'd be willing to sign a waiver,

I think I may be able to help you.

You know, when you talk,

you sound, a lot like my father-in-law,

-Carter Pewterschmidt.
-Oh, that's funny.

He's a patient of mine.

Here's my urine sample, Doctor.

-Thank you, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
-Oh, hi, Peter.

You know, Peter says we sound alike.

Really? I don't hear it.

Actually, I think I do hear it now.

-Really?
-Yeah, you know,

we've never really had
any extended interactions,

so I've never noticed it.

Hey, I think I hear it, too.

Seems lazy, doesn't it?

Well, there's only so many
voices in the world.

Some of them are bound to be similar.

Now, Mr. Swanson,

through the magic of digital imaging,

we'll select the legs
most suited to your body

from our inventory of donors.

-Hey, what about these?
-Ah, good choice.

These are the only ones we have in stock

-that aren't hilarious.
-I'll take 'em!

Ah, Joe, you are gonna be
happier than bullfrogs

on vacation in Ethiopia.

Ah, this is fantastic!

This is even better than
they said it was in the brochure!

Oh, I feel like a pig,

but, come on, we're on vacation!

Exactly, don't hate yourself,

we're on vacation, right?

Yeah, I hear Madonna

is raising this guy's kid.

Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson,

and let the anesthetic do its job.

-All right, Doc, I trust you.
-Good.

Now, I'll just pop in the how-to video,

-and we'll get started.
-What?

<i>Hi, I'm Jamie Farr,</i>

<i>and you're about</i><i>to perform leg surgery.</i>

No!

He's been in there an awful long time.

I hope everything's all right.

Gentlemen, I give you...

the new Joe Swanson.

-(ALL GASP)
-Oh!

Well, what do you think?

-Oh, honey!
-Oh, my God, you look great, Joe!

-Oh, that is fantastic!
-Holy crap!

They still got that new leg smell.

I put his old legs in a bag
if you want them.

Oh, great. You know what?

We'll take them home,
we'll give them to Brian.

Come on, Joe, I'll drive you home.

Are you kidding?

I've got working legs for the first time

in 15 years, and I'm gonna use them.

I'm walking home!

I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson.

Hospital rules... you have
to leave in a wheelchair.

(SIGHS)

Oh, Joe, that was amazing.

I know. I was there.

My God, we haven't done it in so long,

I'd forgotten how big you were.

I was gonna say the same thing to you.

-Come on, guys, let's go!
-Go? Where we going?

Listen, these new legs
have given me my life back.

I want to do all the things
I could never do

when I was handicapped.

And you guys are my best friends.

I want you to experience it all with me.

You can count on us, Joe.

Oh, this is great!

I feel so alive! Come on, ladies!

Kick your high heels off and get moving!

You guys are a disgrace!

Peter, this doesn't seem safe.

Yeah, I'm afraid I might...

(SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Oh. Wow. Thanks, Spider-Man.

Everybody gets one.

Tell him, Peter.

Uh, apparently,
everybody gets one.

Bingo.

I don't know about this, Joe.

There is no fear in this dojo!

Joe, we-we don't even know what a dojo is.

There is no mercy in this dojo!

Joe, why don't you take it down a notch?

No mercy!

(FARTS)

All right, we're gonna
do it once more.

(ALL GROAN)

And this time,
no mistakes!

One, two, three, four!

Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted

since I had that job

as Jackée Harry's
personal grocery shopper.

A pallet? Am I...
Am I reading this right?

You need a pallet
of chocolate-covered pretzels?

(STAMMERING)
Where the hell am I supposed to...

And what is this?
A drum of grape jam?

Is that... What is that?

Is that like a drum

(STAMMERING)
And look at this one...

"A desk of Cheez-Its."

A desk?

Where-where are you getting
these units of measurement from?

-Mary.
-(CHUCKLES)

That is still funny.

Okay, you stay right here, big funny gal.

I'll be right back with
a "hammock of cake."

Yeah, "Dave Matthews Live."

I'll burn you a copy. Stay cool.

Hey, Joe.
What you got there?

Mountain bike.

Oh, Joe, I-I don't know.

I'm still chafed from that power walk.

Both of my inner thighs look

like those big cherry Swedish Fish.

Don't worry.

I'm not taking you pansies.

I'm taking my new friends.

This is Parker, Quentin,
and Portland.

Is Portland the Black one?

Portland is the Black one.

Joe, what the...
What the hell is this?

Well, Peter, I realized
over the last few days,

the only reason I hung out
with you guys

is that I was crippled
and you were lazy.

I decided it's time
I got some friends

more suited to my status.

But, Joe,
we've been friends for years.

Hey, we all make mistakes.

Come on, dudes, let's go exercise.

-Exercise!
-Yeah!

I'm gonna do sit-ups till I poop myself!

I can't believe it.

Joe just dumped us. He's gone.

And all we got to remember him by
are his old legs.

-(GROWLING)
-Okay, okay.

Peter, I wish you'd go over there

and patch things up with Joe.

Hey, screw him, Lois.
He doesn't need us anymore

now that he's got his cool,
new friends.

I tell you, those legs have
turned him into a complete jerk.

It's like giving a monkey
the keys to an amusement park.

-How is that?
-How is what?

How is it anything like
a monkey having the keys

-to an amusement park?
-I don't know.

The hours would be erratic.

Maintenance would probably
suffer to some degree.

The prizes for games
of chance would all be bananas.

Lois, don't call me
on this stuff, all right?

I'm... I'm... Just go with it.

Support me in these moments.
I'm hurt. I lost my buddy.

Well, Peter, there have been
a lot of changes in Joe's life,

and maybe he just needed to move on.

If I were you, I'd look for a new friend.

A kindred spirit,

like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.

You know, sometimes I feel
like someone should just...

BOTH:
...Crucify Jesus of Nazareth.

-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

-Shut up!
-No, you shut up!

-I'm Judas.
-Pontius.

This is so weird, because
just today, I was thinking about

how I wanted to
find the son of God

and nail him to some wood.

Well, let's go find him and kick his ass!

That sounds swell!

you're suited

to be the fourth guy
in our group, Buzz Killington?

Yeah, I mean, we mainly
just sit here in the booth

and crack jokes,
but you're kind of a buzz kill.

Oh, on the contrary.

I've quite a mastery
of the humorous yarn.

(CHUCKLES)

Do any of you know the tale

of how cornmeal came to be?

-No.
-No.

-Uh-uh, no.
-Neither did the miller

when he left his house
that morning.

Aah!

We got to get Joe back.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Joe, please, can't we talk about this?

There's nothing to talk about.

I've outgrown you, Bonnie.

I need to spread my legs and fly.

(CAR HORN HONKING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Keep the kid.

It was awful. I mean, he just left Bonnie.

And then the bastard
completely blew me off

to hang out with those
new douche bags.

Peter, we got to do something.

You're right, Cleveland.

Boys, there's only one answer.

We got to re-cripple Joe.

It's the right thing to do,
like taking out Hitler.

(CALLIOPE MUSIC PLAYING)

See? We had a plan
for that all along.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Bye, new awesome friends!

Bonnie, I forgot my Soloflex.

Yo, Joe.

What the hell
you doing here, pansy?

We're gonna break your legs, Joe.

It's for your own good.

Come on, guys, get him!

(WIND WHIPPING, BLOWS LANDING)

All right, then.

(GUN COCKING)

Bonnie! What the hell?

Put my gun down!

Not until I have my husband back!

Aah! My perfect ass!

Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.

I was aiming for your spine.

Aah! Damn it!

Joe, I'm so sorry.

I'm a terrible shot.

Oh, for God's sakes, just give me the gun!

I'll do it myself!

(GUNSHOT)

Boy, we, uh, really did
a number on each other.

You know, I just want
to take this opportunity

to apologize to you guys.

I was acting
like a first-class jackass.

I hope that you can forgive me.

Oh, it's just good to
have our old Joe back.

And once our injuries heal up,

we can all go for a nice, long walk.

All right! Yeah!

Wait a minute!

Ah!

Oh, Brian, you don't have

Oh. Well, give it back then.

No, no, we have fun.

Oh, my God!

Two tickets for a cruise?

Brian, this is wonderful.

-What the hell?
-You fink!

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

We agreed on

You get to go on

-What?
-What?

Well, yeah, you
didn't think Brian

meant for me to go
with him, did you?

Great.

This was a bigger waste of time
than Ringo's song-writing.

Hey, guys.
I wrote a song.

Oh, that's great.

-Oh, good, Ringo.
-Fantastic.

I'm gonna have to bar you

from the aft section of the ship
for the rest of the cruise.

(SIGHS)
We are so sorry.

Peter, what the hell did
you think you were doing?

Lois, it is called
the "Poop Deck."

That is why I pooped there.

You're disgusting.

And you're misleading.

Boy, this is romantic,
isn't it, Lois?

Oh, it sure is, sweetie.

the one opposite
Leonardo DiCaprio.

that was a guy.

-That was a guy.

That was Philip

What? No, it wasn't.

Yes, it was, honey.

It was Philip Seymour Hoffman.

(GIGGLES)

Look at you out here
on a big trip.

What are you doing?

I'll teach that hussy to go on
a boat ride without me.

When she returns,
I'm going to put bamboo splinters

under all her fingernails.

Then I'm gonna strip her down

-and tie her to the bed.
-Okay.

Then I'm gonna make her crawl
on her hands and knees

while I drip hot candle wax
all over her back.

-Uh, and then what are you gonna do?
-Uh, let's see...

Are you gonna shower her off
after all that candle wax?

No, I'm gonna keep her filthy.

Yeah, she's been a bad girl.

And then I'm gonna gag her
with her own brassiere.

(LAUGHS)

-What?
-No, no, nothing, nothing.

That's all part of your diabolical plan
to humiliate her.

-Yes, yes, she'll be humiliated.
-Maybe you'll handcuff her?

-She'll hate that.
-Then I shall do that as well!

-And call her a bitch.
-Until I'm hoarse with rage!

Maybe smack her ass
with a riding crop?

Yes, and then-- What?

No, I mean, would, like--
That would show her.

Are you-- You're getting
some kind of sick sexual thrill

-off this, aren't you?
-Who cares?

You're not gonna
kill her anyway.

You're gonna
bitch and moan,

and then you're gonna
do what you always do.

The minute Lois walks
through that door,

you're gonna forget
all about it,

beg for your apple juice,

go poop and fall asleep.

God, he's right.

I've got the same daily routine
as Dick Clark.

Rupert, I've been all talk.

So much time wasted.

Well, no longer.
Lois is a dead woman!

I'll do to her what douche bags
did to the guitar.

Peter, stop picking

We're at the Captain's table.

And that was the first time

I saw the Northern Lights
at their peak.

And as I gazed, astonished,

at their lustrous brilliance,

I turned to my first mate
and I said,

"We are looking
into the very eyes of God."

Oh, what a wonderful story.

All right,
I got one for ya.

So me and Lois are driving
up to Vermont

-to get this abortion.
-Peter!

Hang on. Hang on, Lois.
Don't ruin it.

All right, so we're driving
up to get this abortion,

and we get to
the abortion clinic,

and the abortionist
has one hand.

-Peter, for God's--
-Bah-bah-bah-bah.

I'll tell it,
I'll tell it.

So I turn to Lois
and I says,

"You want to get
an abortion here?

"You want to get
an abortion

"with the abortionist
having a stump hand?

We can't get
an abortion here."

So, we turned around
and went home,

and two-and-a-half
months later,

our daughter
Meg was born.

Okay, explain to me
exactly what I did wrong.

Peter, that story was
completely inappropriate!

Well, send me the crap to hell
for being nostalgic

about the early years
of our marriage.

You've totally ruined
this trip for me!

I am mortified to even show
my face around this ship!

Hey, the captain's the one
who should be embarrassed.

His story was gay.

You're gay!

(ENGINE REVVING)

-STEWIE: Hello, Mother.
-Stewie?

What the hell are you--
How did you get here?

Oh, there's a very
simple answer to that.

You drove me here, Lois.

With all the indignities
I've been forced to suffer

day in and day out
under your matriarchal tyranny.

What are you-- What--

What are you doing
with a gun?

Something I should've done
a very long time ago.

I did it!
I killed her! She's dead!

(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

Oh.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

Mommy!

Mommy! Mommy!

Oh, yeah, that's right.

<i>And finally, still no word</i>
<i>on the disappearance</i>

<i>of Lois Griffin, housewife</i>
<i>and mother from Quahog</i>

<i>who vanished from a cruise ship</i>
<i>six days ago.</i>

<i>Well folks, that's the news,</i>

<i>and I am outta here!</i>

Daddy, she's been
missing so long.

Do you think
they'll ever find her?

God, I hope so, Meg.

Oh, yes,
I'm sure they'll find her.

<i>This is fantastic.</i>

<i>Nobody suspects a thing.</i>

<i>Ooh, listen to my voice,</i>
<i>that sounds cool.</i>

<i>Hello!</i>

(ECHOING) <i>Pigs in space!</i>

Hi, Peter.

Can I talk to you in
the kitchen for a second?

What is it, Joe?

Please tell me
Lois is alive.

(SIGHS)

It's been six days, Peter.

I'm sorry,
but we had to call off the search.

I'm afraid
you're just going

to have to accept
the fact that...

she's gone.

(SCREAMING)
No!

ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
<i>We now return to...</i>

Harrison Ford
Telling Random People

He Wants His Family Back.

<i>-I want my family back!</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

<i>-Give me back my family!</i>
<i>-Get off me!</i>

<i>I want my family back!</i>

-Hey, where've you been?
-Ah, I had another date.

You know, I'm glad you're finally
putting yourself out there.

Lois would've wanted you
to move on.

Yeah, only this one
was kind of awkward.

My date was a stick figure.

So, I--
How would this work in bed?

(MALE VOICE)
Well, I can't do sex.

But I can give you
a stick job.

That, uh--
That sounds--

Yes, it is very unpleasant.

But the freakiest

was that date I had
with Bonnie.

BONNIE:
Peter...

you don't know
how badly I need this.

PETER:
I don't know, Bonnie,

it's, it's just
a little weird.

Joe's a friend of mine.

No, it's okay.

I promise you,
it's okay.

Eh, I'm not sure.

JOE:
It's okay, Peter.

Just remember,
whatever you do,

don't tell Chris I'm dating.

Peter, Lois has been
dead for a whole year.

You're gonna have
to tell him sometime.

-Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
-Hi, Dad.

Did we get any mail from Mom
at the health spa today?

Nope, sorry, Chris.

She said she's going
straight from the spa

-right back to Europe.
-But I haven't seen Mom

since she took me
back-to-school shopping.

All right, sweetie,

you ready to get
some new notebooks

and protractors
and slacks?

I want blue jeans.

You're getting <i>slacks!</i>

Here you go, Stewie.

Finish your oatmeal,
and then I'll get you ready

for our "Mommy and Me" class.

You know, Meg has
really flourished

since Lois was murdered.

What are you talking about?

Lois's death was an accident.

Which is just
what someone

who pulled off the perfect murder
would want you to think.

What the hell are you...

Stewie, did you?

Did you kill Lois?

Of course I didn't, Brian.

Remember what you said?

I'm all talk.

I wouldn't possibly
go through with it.

I'll just poop and fall asleep.

My God, you did it.

You actually did it.

Oh God, I've really
screwed myself up here.

Listen, could you reach
into my pocket

and get the number
for that acupuncturist?

You son of a bitch,
you killed Lois.

Good luck proving that,
Brian.

Seriously, that number?

Well, I'm going to expose
you for what you are.

No matter what it takes,
you are gonna pay for this.

You know, it's funny,
from this position,

I can hear Meg upstairs.

I'm going to pretend
you're the New York Knicks.

Hey, put your wallets away,
guys.

The drinks are on me.

Well, that's awful nice, Peter.

What's the occasion?

Lois's life insurance
policy paid off.

I got more money
than Barbara Streisand.

Honey, I'm going shopping.

And I was going
to valet park.

I didn't know that you had life
insurance on Lois.

Did you get that
right before the cruise?

Actually, I got it
on the cruise.

Right after we had
that big fight when I said,

"I wish you were dead," right
before I never saw her again.

Well, see you guys later.

I got to go buy hot dogs.

We keep running out
for some reason.

Either of you guys think
it's a little suspicious

that Peter took out a life
insurance policy on Lois

right before she went missing?

You don't think...

That fat bastard
murdered her, didn't he?

That son of a bitch!

He's a killer,
like Bernie Goetz!

You know, the subway vigilante
from the eighties?

I used to do a bit about him
back when I was doing standup.

Ah, what else is in the news?

Oh, oh, oh, Bernie Goetz.

Did you hear about this?

This guy Bernie Goetz

shot a bunch of muggers
on the subway.

Wouldn't mind having him
with me

next time I go see
my mother-in-law.

No, but really, New York City's
a great place to live...

if you're a cockroach.

-MAN: You suck!
-I know.

Hey, Stewie,
I found this receipt

for a speedboat rental
upstairs in your room.

It's dated about
a year ago.

Any idea how
it got there?

Um, someone who rented a speedboat
must have left it there.

Uh-huh. Well, you can play
innocent all you want.

I am going to find the
evidence to put you away.

Starting by proving

that you were on
that cruise ship

the night Lois disappeared.

No, I wasn't.

Ah, the carnival
with Rupert.

We won! We won!

Do it again!

Now I want a pink one!

Stewie, we've been playing
for half an hour.

Oh, okay. You want to go ride
the tea bags... tea cups?

(SIGHS) I was hoping to keep these
mementos, Rupert,

but I can't risk it with the dog
sniffing around for evidence.

Damn! What the hell
are they doing here?

What are we
looking for, Joe?

Well, the trail
is pretty cold by now,

but if Peter did kill Lois,

we might find some clues
in his garbage.

Man, I haven't dug through these cans
since Lois died.

Can't believe
it's been 12 months

since I've deliberately
choked myself

by stuffing her discarded
makeup sponges down my throat.

What's wrong with you?

Oh, my God.

That does look like
Peter's handwriting.

-(GASPS)
-(GASPS)

There's no doubt anymore.

Peter murdered his wife.

This is fantastic!

I'm completely off the hook!

What the hell?

Hey, little man,
tell Chris to open his window.

<i>Just around the corner</i>
<i>there's a rainbow in the sky</i>

<i>So let's have</i>
<i>another cup of coffee</i>

<i>And let's have</i>
<i>another piece of pie</i>

Joe, what the hell
is going on?

You're a suspect
in Lois' murder,

that's what's going on!

Don't make us go good cop,

developmentally disabled cop
on you.

Um, we know that,

um, you, um,
killed Lois.

(PHONE RINGING)

Um, hello?

Uh...

No.

We can, um,

put you at the, um, scene

where she, um, was,
um, killed.

Hobey's right, Peter.

It doesn't look good for you.

Joe, you got this
all wrong!

Like God did
when he made Rosie O'Donnell.

You can't put
a vagina on this man!

Why not?
I'm God.

Well, what do you want to do
about the breasts?

Ah, take a couple out of the bin
we can't find matches for.

I-I can't believe
Dad killed Mom.

Look, there he is!

Dad, how could you?

Hey, Dad, if they
put you in jail,

can we go in your room?

Look, don't you kids buy
any of this for a second.

Your father is innocent.

Oh, he killed her.

Just like the telephone killed
the telegraph sex business.

-(BEEPING)
-Hey, baby.

I bet you're hot. Stop.

Describe to me what you're doing
to yourself right now. Stop.

(BEEPING)

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah...

Oh, nasty!

This trial is called to order.

Defense Counsel, we will hear
your opening statement.

Hey, everybody,
today's the big day.

That's all, Your Honor.

Good. Good.

Prosecutor,
call your first witness.

Peter called me right
after he killed my daughter

to tell me he
killed my daughter.

Really?
Well, that is interesting.

Yes, and as a favor
to the court,

I've produced
this simulation

of how the killing
transpired.

I play Peter,
and I hired an Asian hooker

to play my daughter.

<i>Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid,</i>
<i>and I fart at times</i>

<i>that ruin my father-in-law's</i>
<i>social occasions,</i>

<i>and that's why I'm never</i>
<i>invited to them.</i>

You pay me now?

(ALL GASP)

Chris, have you ever seen
your father do anything bad?

Well, now that you mention it...

Hey, Meg.

Proud of you!

Mr. Griffin, do you deny
killing your wife?

Of course I deny it.
I loved my wife.

And I certainly think
I'd remember killing her.

-Mr. Griffin, do you drink?
-I plead the fifth of Jack.

(CHUCKLING)
No, no, I'm joking. Yes, I drink.

And have you ever
struck your wife?

Only in front of the kids
to assert my status

as dominant male
of the pride.

Are you a violent man?

What are you,
a wise guy?

'Cause I know how
to deal with wise guys.

No further questions.

You son of a bitch.

If I had a gun on a boat,
I'd shoot you.

Mr. Foreman,
how say you?

We find Peter Griffin

guilty of murder
in the first degree.

-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

-Oh, no!
-Oh, yeah!

(LIQUID SLOSHING)

Okay, can I ask everyone

to please stop saying,
"Oh, no" in this courtroom?

'Cause the (BLEEP) Kool-Aid
Guy's gonna keep showing up.

Thank you.

Mr. Griffin,
I hereby sentence you

to life imprisonment
with no possibility of...

(DOOR CREAKING)

(ALL GASPING)

Lois! You're alive!

Mom, you're alive!

Oh, my gosh, Mom!

Lois, my God,
what happened?

We thought you were dead!

Mom, we thought
Dad killed you!

No, he didn't, Chris.

But someone tried to.

Do you remember who it was?

Yes, I do.

It was Stewie!
S06E06.en
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker
with Channel 5 News.

We now go live to Ollie Williams
recapping the events

of the last episode of <i>Family Guy.</i>

-What happened last time, Ollie?
-Stewie killed Lois!

-Then what?
-Peter got blamed!

-Then what?
-Peter went to court!

-Then what?
-Lois came back!

-How?
-Wasn't really dead!

Thanks, Ollie. And now part two.

<i>It seems today that all you see </i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

ALL:<i> On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

ALL:<i> He's a family guy!</i>

Oh, Lois, sweetheart,
I'm so glad you're alive!

You got to tell me everything
that happened.

I mean, not tonight
'cause I've got plans with the guys,

but tomorrow night,
I want to hear all about it.

Peter, didn't you hear what I said?

Stewie tried to kill me.

Mom, Stewie's just a baby.

No, he's not, Meg. He's evil!

He shot me point-blank
right on the deck of the cruise ship.

(GUNFIRE)

LOIS:<i> I would have been dead</i>
<i>if it hadn't been</i><i>for a passing merman</i>

<i>who treated my wounds</i>
<i>and carried me to safety.</i>

<i>It sounds romantic, I know,</i>
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

<i>he was kind of a reverse</i>
<i>of what you'd expect a merman to be.</i>

I wish to make love to you.

Oh, uh... (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

No, thank you.

What are you talking about?
I thought this was a woman's fantasy.

Yeah, but this is sort of the opposite.

Like if you had
a man's body and fish legs,

then it'd be different.

Yeah, but then I wouldn't have a penis.

-Well, but I...
-See? There you go.

I just poked a huge hole in your logic.

(SIGHS) I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna have to say no.

Maybe I feel like you owe me a little.

Ah! Damn it! (GRUNTING)

LOIS:<i> Unfortunately, I was suffering</i>
<i>from total amnesia</i>

<i>and had no idea who I was.</i>

<i>After wandering around for a while,</i>

<i>I discovered I was in North Carolina,</i>

<i>where I managed to get a job</i>
<i>at a summer camp for fat kids.</i>

<i>It was my job to keep the children</i>
<i>from eating each other.</i>

Hey, hey! No! No, no, no, spit him out.

Jeffrey, spit him out now!

And Mike, you spit out Timmy.

<i>Over the next several months,</i>
<i>I developed a relationship</i>

<i>with a seemingly nice, young townie</i>
<i>named Derek.</i>

<i>Eventually, he got comfortable</i>
<i>enough with me</i>

<i>to introduce me to his friends.</i>

<i>That's how I found out</i>
<i>he was a white supremacist.</i>

Okay, first order of business,
uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy,

who have agreed to bring cookies
for next week's punch social.

Just remember, you two,
Fred is allergic to peanuts.

Peanuts and Jews!

(ALL LAUGH)

No, but Jews are bad.

You know, it's remarks like that
that started the Holocaust.

And I know none of us
want that to happen again.

<i>And after that blow to the head,</i>
<i>it all started coming back to me.</i>

So I rushed back to Quahog, and here I am.

So what you're saying is we've got
a homicidal baby on our hands.

Mom, Dad! Stewie's gone!

(RAPID FOOTSTEPS RETREATING)

Don't worry, Lois. We'll catch him.

(RINGS DOORBELL)

Sorry to bother you,
but we have a fugitive baby on our hands.

Have you seen this child?

No, I haven't, officer,

but I sure will keep my eyes open.

JEFFREY: What is it?

That killer baby from the trial's
gone missing.

-JEFFREY: Oh, no!
-I know!

(WIND WHISTLING)

Mr. Superman no here.

Oh. Well, we're looking for a missing...

I... I... No. Mr. Superman...
He no is here.

Yeah, okay, well, uh, can you just
give him this flyer?

I... No, no.

I have no money.

Just take this flyer
and if you see this baby.

No, no.

Boy, I sure hope They find him.
Otherwise, we're all gonna be...

(GUN SLIDE RACKS)

So it's all out in the open now, isn't it?

Stewie, uh, how long you been
all messed up and evil like this?

Oh, so now you're interested in Stewie.

Last week when I made
that macaroni picture of an owl,

-you didn't give a damn!
-That was an owl?

Yes, and now we're going
to look at it again.

(SCREAMING)

Look, look! Do you like it?

Yes.

What do you like about it specifically?

I don't know.

Pick something
or I'll blow your brains out!

I like how it looks like an owl.

Thank you for the compliment!

(SOBBING)

-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-JOE: Hey, everything okay in there?

-I heard shouting.
-(GUN COCKS)

Dog, answer it.
Tell him, "Yes, everything's fine."

Yes, Joe, everything's fine.

Oh, okay, good.

(WHISPERING) Make fun of his wheelchair.

-What?
-What?

Do it! Say, "Ha-ha-ha-ha,
you're in a wheelchair."

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, you're in a wheelchair.

What's that supposed to mean?

Say, "I bet you can't get a boner."

I bet you can't get a boner.

That's not very nice, Brian.

"Neither is your mother's ass."

Neither is your mother's ass.

Well, I'll give you that one.

Now tell him you've always
thought he was handsome.

I've always thought you were handsome.

Well, I got to tell you, Brian,
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

Please call me if you see
any sign of Stewie.

Tell him, "Ha-ha-ha-ha,
just kidding about the handsome thing."

-Oh, come on.
-Do it!

-Come on. That meant a lot to him.
-(GUN COCKS)

Ha-ha-ha-ha, just kidding
about the handsome thing.

Ah, well, that's, uh, disappointing.
I needed that boost today.

All right, I'll see you later.

All right, Lois, I'm hungry.

Take those breasts out.

Wait a minute.
You could have drugged this.

Well, I'm no fool.

-Brian, taste this.
-What?

Go on. Taste it! You're the guinea pig!

Lois, he's got a gun.

Look, I'll do it myself. How about that?

Uh, I don't know. He kind of asked me.
I think we should do what he says.

Well, yeah, but Brian...

I'm... I'm totally willing
to do this for the family.

-I'm not sure...
-I'll do it.

Hey, Griffins, just checking in.

(GRUNTS)

-Holy crap!
-Oh, my God!

Stewie, you killed him! He's dead!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

Oh, poor Cleveland!

It's all right, Lois. He's in heaven now.

I don't understand why I need
to give you a credit card imprint.

It's kind of a new policy.

I didn't see you ask
the guy in front of me.

It's kind of brand-new.

Do you have a credit card?

I got a Sears card.

Ah, they're doing pretty well, huh?

One by my house got a McDonald's
right in the store.

Won't be long before the police notice
Cleveland's disappearance.

Black man gone missing?

My God, the media will be all over that.

All right, if I see any cops following me,
the dog gets it.

Get in. Come on! Drive! Drive! Drive!

Ooh, there's Joe.
Say, "Joe, I think you're cool."

Joe, I think you're cool.

Well, thank you, Brian.

That's gonna get me through
the rest of this yard work.

"No, just kidding. You suck."

No, just kidding. You suck.

-"Queer."
-Queer.

Ah, well, there goes my smile.

You know, you're not gonna
get away with this.

Kidnapping me is one thing,
but you killed Cleveland.

You forget I'm the one
holding the gun, Brian,

and you're gonna do exactly as I say.

You mind if I ask where we're going?

You'll know soon enough, Brian.

The world will know soon enough.

I'll be as big as I should have been
when I was on <i>American Idol.</i>

(SINGING OFF-KEY) <i>I don't mind not knowing</i>

<i>What I'm headed for</i>

<i>You can take me to the skies</i>

<i>It's like being lost in heaven</i>

<i>When I'm lost in your eyes</i>

Stewie, what the hell was that?

That was <i>Lost in Your Eyes</i>
by Debbie Gibson.

-One of the worst I've ever heard.
-Okay.

Stewie, you shouldn't
actually even be alive,

you sniveling little creep.

I hate you so much
I want to shoot you in your face.

-All right.
-Honey, I like you,

but you're just not right
for this competition.

Yo, dawg, I got to tell you for me, man,
that was not even half good, dude.

You can't sing. What're you doing, Stewie?

I don't even care!
They don't know what they's talkin' 'bout!

Next time they hear 'bout me,
they, they's gonna be, like,

"We was wrong about Stewie,"
'cause... 'Cause I's gonna be huge.

I... I is gonna be bigger
than every one of all y'alls.

Hey, hey, you know
what we should do, guys,

-while we're here tied up like this?
-What?

We should come up
with a totally bogus rumor

about a celebrity.

And then when we get outta here,
we'll spread it around as much as we can.

That sounds like fun.

Actually, that does sound like fun.

What'd you have in mind?

Okay, okay, how about this?

Hey, did you guys hear
about Rob Schneider?

Somebody told me
he goes down to Home Depot

and pays the migrant workers
to go to his house

and choke him in the shower.

I could buy that.
That sounds like something he'd do.

Well, I think that's awful
that Rob Schneider does that.

Yeah, isn't that
a disgusting absolute fact?

Yay! We're starting a rumor!

Wait a minute.

-Chris, are you clapping?
-Yeah.

-So your hands are free?
-Yeah.

Stewie didn't tie up your hands?

No, he must have forgot.

You realize we've been sitting here
for 14 hours?

Well, get pissy if you want, Mom.

I've enjoyed the time
we've had as a family.

(BOTH EXCLAIM)

(AIR HISSING)

-What is it? What did you do?
-You almost shot me, you son of a bitch!

That's because you yelled.

No, you shot the gun first.
That's why I yelled.

Oh. "That's why I yelled..."

I'm watching you, buddy.

There's got to be some clue in here

that'll tell us
where Stewie might have gone.

(BEEPING)

Wow! Look at all this cool stuff!

Man, what do you think these things do?

(IN PETER'S VOICE)
Huh! Guess it doesn't do anything.

(IN LOIS' VOICE) Well, that seems odd.

(BOTH SCREAM)

Oh, my God! Peter, you're me!

Holy crap!

Ah! Sweet!

(SNICKERING)

(HUMMING <i>GREEN ACRES</i> THEME SONG)

Squeeze, squeeze.

STEWIE: All right, pull in here.

The CIA? What the hell are we doing here?

You'll need CIA credentials, Brian.
What do you want your alias to be?

-What are you talking about? I'm not...
-Pick a name for yourself!

-Willem Dafoe.
-Ooh! Not that one.

I used to have a Willem Dafoe
living under my bed.

Hey, you asleep yet?

Uh...

No.

Just checking.

What, exactly, are you looking for?

According to my schematics,

it should be right in here.

This is it, Brian!

My plan for world domination
is about to come to fruition.

(ALARM BLARING)

Stewie, for God's sake, they know
we're here! What are you trying to do?

Once I locate the proper code sequence,

this terminal will allow me to
take command of the satellites

which control the world's power grid.

Once they're under my control,

the entire world
will be subject to my whims.

Go away, you paper clip! No one likes you!

MAN: Open up in there
or we're breaking down the door!

I love you, Katie.

I love you, too, Tom.

(BEEPS)

Oh, my God!

I'm free!

The force field is down! Go now!

I'd drop the gun if I were you, Joe.

What? It's Stan.

Oh. Sorry, You look sorta
like someone from...

Anyway, I'd drop the gun if I were you.

I now control
the entire planet's power grid,

and unless you want me
to send you all back

to the Dark Ages,
you'll do exactly as I say.

What are your demands?

We interrupt this program
to bring you a special message

from the new president of the world.

Greetings, loyal minions.

(GASPS, IN NORMAL VOICE) Stewie?

-Oh, my God!
-What the hell?

-Good gravy!
-Señor Rob Schneider!

You must come see the news!

I'm not paying you guys to watch TV.
Now, get in the damn shower!

Brian, come here. I want you to hear
my presidential address

for Saint Rupert's Day.

I'm unveiling all the new laws
I've passed.

Screw off. I don't want anything
to do with you or your damn laws.

Oh, just take a look, will you?

(SIGHS)

You're banning
straight-to-video Disney films?

Absolutely. I mean, look at this.

<i>Aladdin 4: Jafar May Need Glasses.</i>

Number one. Number two.

Um...

Number one. Number two.

Um... about the same.
Number one might be a tiny bit better.

Number three. Number four.

Number three.

Five and six.

Oh...

Five and six.

Uh...

About the same?

Yeah. They're pretty much...
Can I see five one more time?

Five and six.

Yeah, they're about the same.

Greetings, unwashed masses.

The following laws will go
into effect immediately.

From this day forward,
all the nation's milk

must come from Hilary Swank's breasts.

Hey, I don't give a damn what you want!

Just get the hell off of my property!

Look, Hilary, all I know is
it's breakfast time,

I've got this bowl of Corn Flakes,
and I gotta be at work at nine o'clock.

So what are we going to do here?

Not so fast.

Did you know you'd have to eat 17 bowls
of those Corn Flakes

to get the same nutritional value
in one bowl of Total?

Say, that's a lot easier
than eating 17 bowls.

And it's easier on my breasts!

-Everybody wins!
-(ALL LAUGHING)

CHORUS:<i></i>(SINGING) <i>Hilary Swank</i>
<i>Get your milk from her</i>

ALL: Yeah!

Also, as I've had quite enough
of the fat man,

anyone who sees Peter Griffin
must throw apples at him.

Uh, yeah,
I'd like to make a deposit. (YELLS)

-What the hell?
-MAN: It's the law, sir.

And, finally, anyone who uses
the terms "irregardless,"

"a whole 'nother" or "all of the sudden"
shall be sent to a work camp.

That is enough!

Peter, I am not gonna stand by

while other people suffer
at the hands of my own baby.

I brought Stewie into this world.
It's time for me to take him out!

How the hell
are you gonna do that? (SCREAMS)

Sorry, Dad!

That's okay, Chris.
You're a good boy, following the law.

But you, Meg, you're going to jail.

All right, Peter.
I'm going to kill Stewie.

Dinner's in the oven. All you have to do
is turn it to 350 at about 5:15.

Yeah, okay, Lois.

-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

What did I just say?

Turn the oven to 350 at 5:15. I heard it!

All right, sir.
Your presidential portrait is finished.

Let me see.

Ah! Excellent.

Much better than the one Gary Larson did.

Why would I even be talking to a chicken?

Lois!

Stewie, your reign of terror
has come to an end!

I will not stand by while
you make innocent people suffer!

Bring it on, bitch!

Time for me to finish
what I started anyway.

(GUNS CLICKING)

(YELLING)

(YELLING)

(GUN COCKS)

Go ahead, Lois. Do it. Shoot me.
Shoot your little baby Stewie.

(SIGHS) I can't do it.

You're a terrible, evil child,
but you're still my baby,

and I could never hurt you.

Well, that works out perfectly
because I can hurt you!

Say hi to Cleveland for me.

Oh, and Mr. Weed.

(GUNSHOT)

(GUNSHOT)

It's just been revoked!

Uh, Peter, he didn't really set you up
for that <i>Lethal Weapon </i>line.

-It doesn't really work here.
-Oh.

I'll have what she's having!

That's better?

Hey, Stewie, we got a postcard
from Peter and Lois on the cruise.

-What are you doing?
-Oh, hello, Brian.

Well, you recall my complaining

about Lois and the fat man
not taking me with them?

-Yeah.
-Yes. Well, you said

I didn't have it in me to kill Lois,
so I was just running a simulation

to find out exactly how killing her

and taking over the world
would play out for me.

Yeah? How did that go?

Not well, Brian. Not well.

I suppose I'm not ready to kill Lois
or take over the world yet.

So, what you're saying is that
what you experienced in the simulation

-didn't really happen or even matter.
-Yes. That's correct.

-So it was sort of like a dream.
-No. It was a simulation.

Yes, but theoretically,
if someone watched the events

of that simulation from start to finish,

only to find out that none of it
really happened,

I mean, you don't think that would be just
like a giant middle finger to them?

Well, hopefully, they would
have enjoyed the ride.

I don't know, man. I think you'd piss
a lot of people off that way.

Well, at least it didn't end
like <i>The Sopranos,</i>

where it just cut to black in midsent...

-Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.
-And I'm Diane Simmons, reporting live

from the 35th annual
Quahog Veteran's Day celebration.

And here comes the parade!

First up, a float from
the Veterans of Future Wars.

And here comes whackadoo film director,
Oliver Stone.

Oliver's here promoting his new movie,

<i>Born on the Fourth of July 2:</i>
<i>Born on the Fifth of July,</i>

which he promises will be even July-ier
than the original.

A dangerously insane human being.

And here comes the next float,
honoring uninjured veterans.

<i>(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

-Yeah!
-We rock!

Our wives stayed with us.

-Think fast!
-We did!

(CHEERING)

Mom, how come when we see these guys
on the street corner

you tell me not to stare at them,
and today that's all we're doing?

Because, Chris, as Americans,
we owe our lives to these veterans.

Hey, look, Lois,
"The John McCain Experience."

(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

(SOBBING) I wanna be President!

<i>(PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN</i> PLAYING)

What is that?

I am proud to be an American,

to love my country like never before.

Anybody wanna see my Purple Heart?

<i>ANNOUNCER: We now return to</i>
Superman 5: The Broken Condom.

-Hey, Lois, ready to go to dinner?
-Yeah, sure. Just let me grab my purse.

Okay, ready.

Ooh! On second thought, I got something
I gotta do back on Krypton.

I thought Krypton was destroyed.

I think we should see other people.

Good morning, my American family.

Peter, where did you get that suit?

My God, you look like
the Statue of Liberty's pimp.

This is how a patriot dresses, Lois.

Boy, I never knew it would feel this good
to love my country.

It's like loving God or a step-parent.

You never really feel them love you back,
but that's okay

because they got other stuff going on,
and you understand.

Peter, you do realize there's a difference
between loving America

and being swept up in post-9/11 paranoia.

Brian, are you suggesting that
9/11 didn't change everything?

What? No, I was just...

Because 9/11 changed everything, Brian.
9/11 changed everything.

Peter, you didn't even know
what 9/11 was until 2004.

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

Lois, I am doing my duty
as a patriotic American.

I'm sacrificing a goat to Toby Keith.

Peter, Toby Keith doesn't want to be fed.
Toby Keith wants to hunt.

Hey, listen,
don't tell me what Toby Keith wants.

I think I'm perfectly capable...

(GOAT BLEATING)

You're all doing such a great job,
I wanted to play you a song I wrote

about what America means to me.

(SINGING) <i>When you say USA</i>

<i>I just say hooray</i>

<i>And if you're not from here</i>

<i>God's gonna hunt you down</i>
<i>and give you AIDS</i>

<i>USA!</i>

Wow, Peter, you're really becoming
quite the patriot.

You bet I am. I just had my penis
tattooed to look like the space shuttle

and my nads tattooed to look
like launch exhaust.

<i>QUAGMIRE: That bastard!</i>
<i>That was my idea!</i>

<i>He stole it!</i>
<i>I was gonna do that to my penis!</i>

<i>Oh, well, maybe I can do something else.</i>

<i>Like, like, like the Space Needle.</i>

<i>Or a banana. Or a Sharpie.</i>

<i>I'm boring myself.</i>
<i>Guess I'll listen to some music.</i>

<i>(SINGING) 'Cause I love a rainy night</i>

<i>Yeah, I love a rainy night</i>

(IN PORTUGUESE)

Man, that really makes me mad.

Illegal immigrants coming into
this country,

taking all the good jobs
away from Americans.

Well, I am gonna make sure people like
that stay out of Quahog from now on.

We are gonna patrol the borders and
keep this town as clean as a Jewish porno.

I own four apartment buildings.

Mmm...

I have central air.

Ohhh!

And a well-funded 401k.

Ahhh!

We are gonna have sex at some point!

All right, guys, it's gonna be a long
night of border patrol,

so I brought along Michael McDonald
to help us out.

How's he gonna help us?

He's gonna do back-up vocals for
everything we say.

How's he gonna know what we're saying?

(SINGING) <i>How's he gonna know</i>
<i>what we're saying?</i>

Is he gonna do it for all of us?

(SINGING) <i>Is he gonna do it for all of us?</i>

Yeah, I hired him for the night.

It costs, like, $2.50 an hour,
so don't skimp on the conversation.

(SINGING) <i>...so don't skimp</i>
<i>on the conversation</i>

That sounds nice.

Peter, why did you have
my acupuncturist arrested?

Because he was an illegal immigrant
and a threat to our national security.

He was an 85-year-old Korean Buddhist.

Or was he a supreme leader of Al Qaeda?

I guess we'll find out
if he ever gets a trial.

Peter, America was founded
by immigrants.

Everyone here is the descendant
of an immigrant.

They're a vital part of our society.

They are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor. Take him away.

Peter, have you seen Stewie's
Speedy Gonzales video?

-He won't go to sleep without it.
-I threw it away.

What? What the hell, man?
I don't throw away your stuff!

-And where's my goat?
-Peter, why would you do that?

Because Speedy Gonzales is an immigrant
and a bad influence on our children.

So, I created his American equivalent,
Rapid Dave.

<i>-I got you now, mouse.</i>
<i>-Yeah? Well, up yours, cat.</i>

<i>Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!</i>
<i>Run fast! Run fast! Quickly!</i>

-Hey, Fuad, can I buy you a cup of coffee?
-(LAUGHS) Yes! Is funny because is free!

-Anyone can have!
-That's right.

(LAUGHING)

-That's the joke.
-Oh, yes.

Why, you son of a bitch.

-Angela, I have a complaint.
-What is it, Griffin?

I think Fuad is an illegal immigrant,

and I cannot stand by while he steals
wages and opportunities from citizens.

I mean, this is an American company.

You don't see Nike or Microsoft
or General Motors or Ford or Boeing

or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's profiting from
non-American labor.

(LAUGHING)

FUAD: Is funny because they all do!

(LAUGHING)

You have a point, Griffin. Maybe we should
run a company-wide check

to make sure all our personnel
are legal citizens.

Now you're talking, Angela.

This country needs more immigrants

like my cousin Peter the Pig
needs a new house.

(BLOWING)

PETER THE PIG:
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

-What?
-I said, I wouldn't do that.

I said knock it off!

-Why?
-Because I just made stool in there,

and if you blow it down,
the whole woods is gonna stink.

Do you understand?
Do you understand me, sir?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

-Peter, what brings you here?
-Hi, Mom.

Hey, there's a new policy at work

where everyone has to prove they're an
American, and I need my birth certificate.

Oh, dear. Peter, sit down.

I don't know how to tell you this,
but you weren't born in America.

-You were born in Mexico.
-What?

When I found out that your real father
was a drunken Irishman,

<i>I went to Mexico</i>
<i>to terminate my pregnancy.</i>

<i>But God had other plans,</i>
<i>and you were born right there.</i>

<i>You were so beautiful, and I loved you,</i>

but when I got back home, I was so afraid
of being judged by the community

that I never filled out the paperwork
to make you a citizen.

Mom, what are you saying?

Peter, as far as
the US government is concerned,

-you're an illegal Mexican immigrant.
-Holy crap!

(LAUGHING)

Looks like I've got myself in a bind!
How will I get out of this one?

Stick around...

(SINGING) <i>'Cause we've got Cleveland</i>
<i>and Quagmire, and Joe and Mort</i>

<i>And all your cartoon pals</i>

Peter, how come you're not at work?

I got fired for being
an illegal immigrant.

Oh, dear. You know, Peter,
you can always take a citizenship test.

I mean, if Wilmer Valderrama passed,
it can't be that difficult.

Well, by that logic, Lois, it can't be
that difficult to nail Lindsay Lohan.

I don't think it is.

Oh! Well, good news there. All right,
you wanna head down to the INS?

So, give me the good news. Did I pass?

I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you,
<i>Señor</i> Griffin.

So far, you've failed everything,

including the "Behaving Like an American
at the Airport" test.

No, it wasn't bad. Yeah, I'm on the way
to the next plane now.

Yeah, I got a middle seat,
so I'm gonna see if I can switch.

Oh, a Sbarro!

I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza
so I got something to stuff in my face

while I'm reading <i>USA Today.</i>

The only thing remaining is the oral test,
which I will administer here.

Now, question number one.
Who discovered America?

-Dick York?
-No.

Dick Sargent. It was Dick Sargent.

(SIGHS)

Question number two.
Complete this sentence.

"The land of the free
and the home of the blank."

-Home of the Whopper?
-You've got to be kidding me.

Mr. Griffin,
if you were truly an American,

you would know our national anthem.

Now, wait a minute!
He is too an American.

-We've been married for almost 20 years!
-Well, we hear that one a lot around here.

Course there's a very easy way
of detecting fraud.

Mr. Griffin, what is your wife's birthday?

Uh...

Give me another one.
Give me another one.

-Where is your wife's hometown?
-One more, one more.

What is your wife's
favorite outdoor activity?

Uh...

-Things an overcoat would say.
-I'm covered with water.

Things an umbrella would say.

-You wear me.
-Things a festive bow tie would say.

You wear me to keep you dry.

-Things Speed Stick would say.
-I keep your head dry.

-I said umbrella.
-It's not umbrella.

(BUZZING)

Peter, what if I said, "I keep your head
dry, you wear me in the bathroom"?

-Shower cap.
-There you go.

-Oh, man.
-Did you have fun?

-I had fun. Yeah.
-All right, we'll be back after this.

<i>(GAME SHOW MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

(INAUDIBLE)

Peter, what are you gonna do about a job?

We can't just keep
eating into our savings.

I'll just have to find a job
for an illegal immigrant.

I can't believe this is happening
to our family.

It's taken us all by surprise, Meg.

Like that realistic original ending
to <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

Nobody puts Baby in a corner.

I do, because I'm her father,
and she's 16. What are you, like 38?

Forty-one.

<i>(HUNGRY EYES</i> PLAYING)

"Hotel maid wanted."

Sweet. I could do that.

Housekeeping.

-Housekeeping.

-Housekeeping.
-MAN: Go away.

-I come in anyway?

-Okay.

-You lend me money?
-No.

You drive my grandmother

-Okay.
-Okay.

"Nanny wanted."

Well, that sounds like a good job
for an immigrant.

Michael, did you hear the good news?
We're getting a new nanny.

Oh, Jane, I'm ever so excited.

Do you suppose
she'll be everything we've dreamed?

Oh, I do hope so.
I've always imagined the most beautiful...

(GRUNTING)

Damn it!

(EXCLAIMS)

(CRYING)

Oh, Peter, you look exhausted!

I am, Lois.
Life as a Mexican immigrant is brutal.

Even after seven jobs and joining Menudo,
I only made 25 bucks.

Now, look, don't get upset,
but I've been so worried about you

-that I asked someone for help.
-Who?

-Hello, fat ass.
-Lois, immigrants don't take handouts.

They just take one DVD a month
from the house they're cleaning

until they have a respectable collection.

It's not a handout, it's a job.

Daddy employs lots of immigrants, and
he said you could work at the mansion.

Really? Well, thanks a lot,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

I promise I won't let you down.

Well, they all do eventually.
Except for Noriega.

God bless him and his drug money.
I wish he were here today.

Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt!

Oh, look who it is!
Come here so I can give you a hug!

Come here so I can give you a hug!

(LAUGHING)

-There they are.
-Hi, Mom.

-Hi, Grandma!
-Grandma!

I missed you.

Peter, I'm using you as a house immigrant,

so take my family's luggage
to their rooms,

and then go get settled
down at the servants' quarters.

Right away, Mr. Pewterschmidt, sir.

Daddy, we don't want
any special treatment.

We're here as a family,
and we're going to live as a family.

Are you serious? We come to a mansion,
and you want to live with the help?

That's like going to a strip club
on a Tuesday afternoon.

Is there anyone here
who hasn't had a c-section?

Oh, no.
That boy's ball fell out of the cup.

Oh, but it's okay, because the ball
is on a string and attached to the cup.

(GREETING IN SPANISH)

You must be the Griffins.
I am Gerardo, the head groundskeeper.

You must be exhausted. Come, come.
Let's get you to your new home.

(WHISTLES)

-Hey, <i>Señorita!</i>
-You got nice bread dough legs!

I got a blank prescription pad!

See, this isn't so bad.

Not so bad? We're sharing a tool shed
with seven other families.

(BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

(LAUGHING)

They're making the best of it.

Good morning, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
It's 8:00, and I'm ready for work.

Good. Have a seat.

-Drink that.
-What is it?

My blood.
I'm a diabetic, and I need you to test it.

-Isn't that dangerous?
-I don't know. Probably.

-I don't wanna.
-You work for me. Now, drink it.

-No!
-Drink my diabetic blood, Peter,

or you're fired.

(LAUGHING)

I can't believe you really did that.
That's nasty. You're nasty.

Peter, how was your first day?

Horrible! I never worked
so hard in my life.

How the hell do you guys
do this every day?

-Immigrant life sucks.
-But, Peter, life in America is wonderful.

That is why we risk everything
to come here.

I don't know, Cheech. It seems like
a lot of work for no respect.

Peter, America is the land of opportunity.
There are tall buildings,

cheeseburgers and Fox's many hit comedy
series, including <i>That '70s Show,</i> and...

But let me ask you something.
Don't you miss your home?

Of course. We come to America
for financial opportunities, Peter,

but, someday, we will return to Mexico
because our heritage is rich and glorious.

Wait, wait, hang on a second. Are you
saying there's more to being Mexican

than working hard
and lusting after big asses?

There is, Peter. In fact, we are preparing
our <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> celebration.

As a Mexican,
you must experience it with us.

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, kids, enjoy yourselves.
<i>Cinco de Mayo</i> is as Mexican as it gets.

Wow, this is awesome!

And later, I'm gonna go
lift free weights in a parking lot!

Oh, Peter, I'm so proud that you've
embraced these people as your own.

You've come a long way
from hating foreigners.

Well, Lois, life can surprise you
if you open your mind a little.

For example, I used to hate the Japanese,

but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips
in <i>Young Guns,</i>

and now I don't hate them anymore.

Peter, I don't think that
Lou Diamond Phillips is Japanese.

Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

Hey, what do you say
we get some of them burritos?

Oh, <i>muñequita,</i> I would love to feel
your mustache on my mustache.

Really? Well, there's a lot more body hair
where that came from.

Oh, well, then no thank you.

What the hell is going on here?
Why aren't you people working?

It's <i>Cinco de Mayo,</i> Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Look, I don't care what day it is in
Mexico, in America we work on weekdays.

Now, do your jobs or I'll deport your
lazy asses back to the third world.

(ALL GROANING)

Wait a minute, hang on, everybody.

What he just said does not represent
the America that I know and love.

This country used to welcome our kind
with open arms,

but men like Carter Pewterschmidt
use us for cheap labor,

and then try to punish us when we
demand to be treated like human beings.

Well, no more!
Immigrants built this country,

and I say it's time for us
to take it back! Who's with me?

MAN: Could you say whole speech
again in Spanish?

(CROWD APPROACHING)

What the hell is that?

(ALL SHOUTING)

Get out of the way, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
we are here to take what's ours.

Well, I mean, technically it's yours,
but we don't feel like you deserve it,

so we're calling it ours
and taking it anyway.

But, Peter, why would you want to harm
a fellow American citizen?

-What?
-All I have to do is make one call

to a friend of mine in Washington,
and he can push your paperwork through.

You'll officially be an American citizen.

Not good enough, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
I want citizenship for everyone here.

Peter, you do not have to do this.

Yes I do, Gerardo. This great land should
be everything to you that it is to me.

A land where a man is paid
a wage he can live on.

A land where we flush every time.

A land where 17 miles
is not walking distance.

A land where meals
are not purchased from a truck

and then eaten in a different truck.

All right, all right, you make your point.

It's getting a little offensive.

That's my only offer. Take it or leave it.

Peter, you must go.
We will find our own way.

I'll never forget you, Gerardo.

Boy, I sure am gonna miss Reynaldo,

but I'm glad I'm finally
an American again.

Being an immigrant
is a real pain in the ass.

I'm glad, too, Peter, but I did enjoy
learning about another culture.

Yeah, you know, so did I.
Well, I guess everything's back to normal.

(SINGING) <i>Well, I guess</i>
<i>everything's back to normal</i>

Oh, man, not this guy again.

<i>with a Channel 5 News Special Report.</i>

<i>And I'm Diane Simmons.</i>
<i>A flash flood warning is in effect</i>

<i>as rain continues</i>
<i>to pound Rhode Island.</i>

<i>Let's go to Asian reporter</i>
<i>Tricia Takanawa,</i>

(MIMICKING CHINESE MELODY)
<i>Who's gonna tell us all about the rain</i>

Tom, residents all over Quahog

have been affected
by the heavy rains,

although some are doing
their best to ride it out.

For example, I'm here with

Rides-a-Ten-Speed-
Everywhere Guy.

Sir, why are you riding
your ten-speed in the rain?

I don't mind. A little
drizzle never hurt anybody.

I like riding the ten-speed
because it's fun,

it gives me energy, and it's
a great way to stay in shape.

What do you do
for a living?

I work in accounts receivable
at Quahog Insurance.

Uh, it's not too demanding,
the pay is good,

and it's a great way
to stay in shape.

Well, we should wrap this up--
you're getting wet.

Well, I'm living life before
the cancer I have kills me,

so I don't mind
the rain.

Water feels good
on my skin.

It's cool, refreshing, and it's
a great way to stay in shape.

-What kind of cancer?
-It's rectal cancer.

It's slowly eating away
at my lower insides.

It's a quick process, both
painful and untreatable,

and it's a great way
to stay in shape.

Thank you, Tricia.

Some local residents
have even been evacuated

to Quahog Stadium
for their own protection.

Why do I have to stay here?

We just think
you'll be safer.

-But my house is dry.
-Here's a blanket.

If you're looking for a bathroom,
it's all around you.

Oh, crap, Peter,
it's a flash flood!

Oh, man, I better save

my autographed picture
of Dean Cain!

You know, from before he got
all desperate for attention.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Hey, is that Dean Cain on that park bench?

(NORMAL VOICE)
Oh, God!

PETER:
<i>Lois! Uh, you may want to come down here!</i>

(GASPS)
Oh, my God!

I know--
about the water, right?

Wow! Cool!

-Hey, Chris, come here.
-What? Why?

-Just come here.
-What is it, Dad?

Does it feel like the water
suddenly just got warmer?

-No.
-Oh, that's right,

it's pee that makes it warmer.

Peter, the water's rising fast!
We got to get out of here!

Hang on, Lois.
There's a case of beer in the fridge.

I can't leave that behind!

Meg, you're a good swimmer.
Go get it.

What? But, Dad...

And for God's sake,
do not be afraid

to make me a sandwich
while you're in there.

(INHALES)

Peter, Meg's been
in there a long time.

Boy, you cannot wait
to criticize her

at every turn, can you?

Go get her!

Well, Lois, I am sorry
for snapping at you earlier.

You were right
to criticize Meg.

She could not even handle
this simple task.

She's in there right now
taking a nap underwater.

For God's sake, save her!

My God, we better get her
to a hospital.

She doesn't look too good.

Yeah, she looks worse
than Andy Garcia

when he had his conjoined twin.

I had a great time
with you tonight.

-You're really amazing.
-Thanks, Andy.

I had a great time, too.

Hey! How about some love
for shoulder guy over here?

-(EXASPERATED SIGH)
-Shoulder guy wants to get in on this.

-Just ignore him.
-Okay...

So, do you maybe want
to go in the other room?

Sure. Sounds good.

-Oh-ho! And shoulder guy's going with ya.
-Rick, shut up.

Hey, bitch,
want to suck on my tooth?

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter.

(LAUGHS) I mean... I mean,
your daughter's in a coma!

What?
Oh, my God, did you--

Did you hear what I said?
(BABBLING)

Brain freeze!
(LAUGHS)

Oh, my God!

Oh, that one is going
in the Christmas letter.

Oh, my God, Peter,

what if she doesn't
come out of it?

I know, Lois.

I never realized until now

how much I've taken her
for granted.

I mean, she's my only daughter,
and I feel like

I've never treated her
as well as I should've.

Hey, Meg, you got
something on your shirt.

(BLOWS RASPBERRY, LAUGHS)

Hi, Dad.

Aw, don't be too hard
on yourself, Peter.

We all do things that
we're not proud of.

Well, I am gonna change.

You hear me, Meg?
If you come out of this,

I am gonna treat you
like a princess

for the rest of your life.

'Cause I been a worse
father than Abraham.

You want to tell me what
the (BLEEP) that was?

Excuse me,
I'm Dr. Milano.

I'm the intern
for this floor.

You know, you guys
can probably go on home.

We'll let you know
if there's any change

in your daughter's
condition.

Wow, you're
a real doctor?

Hey, does Scrubs
work here?

I love that guy.
I want to meet Scrubs.

Ooh, and I want to meet
black Scrubs, too.

Well, hello, sleepyhead.

I'm Michael.

Hi, Michael.
I'm Meg.

-Meg!
-Oh, my God! Meg, you're okay!

Oh, Meg, my beautiful daughter!

Oh, things
are gonna be different.

No more will I treat you
like some kind of alien.

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
<i>Three minutes to minimum safe distance.</i>

(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Stop. Not so fast, y'all.

You think you can just up
and run away, you crazy.

I like to eat people
from other planets,

especially y'all.

(HIGH-PITCHED SOUTHERN ACCENT) I likes
to eat you with my little mouth, too.

Oh, now, y'all get back up
inside me, little mouth.

-I wants to play, too.
-Get back inside--

-I'll get you when we's eatin' em.
-Zoop!

So, what is it you wanted
to show me?

That, Brian.

What? It's a rundown old house.

(LAUGHING)
Well, yes, I-- I suppose

to the untrained eye
that's what it would look like.

Walk inside with me, Brian.

This is disgusting.
It smells, it's falling apart,

and you can hear the mice
humping in the wall.

MOUSE (HIGH-PITCHED):
Ho-ho! Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

Ho-ho! <i>Ho-ho!</i>

(MOUSE EXHALES)
Oh... That was so awesome!

That's why we can get
it for a steal, Brian!

We fix it up and sell
it for a huge profit!

You're crazy.
No, I'm not gonna buy this house with you.

Fine, I'll just give the
profits to another investor.

Plenty of others interested.

-Oh, yeah? Like who?
-Mort Goldman, for one.

Says it's a smart investment.

But what does he know?
He's only Jewish.

All right, I'm in.

Oh, there's my little angel!

Here, let me get that
for you, sweetie.

Thanks, Dad!

Wow, Peter, I got to say,
you've really been true

to your word about
treating Meg better.

She's my only daughter, Lois.

She needs to be protected,
like a rare gemstone,

or the herniated scrotum
of an older gentleman.

Well, I think
you've been wonderful.

Like when you took her
to that new movie,

<i>I'm Rich and You're Poor,</i>
<i>but Let's Dance Together.</i>

I'm rich and you're poor,
but let's dance together.

-Society won't like it.
-I don't care.

(QUIETLY)
Good for you, good for you.

Yeah, and I can't believe

how you stood up
to Connie D'Amico for me.

-Hey, Meg.
-Uh, hi, Connie.

I can't fit all my books
in my locker.

Can I put the rest of them
on your ginormous ass?

(LAUGHING)

Hey, Connie, hi.
Peter Griffin, Meg's father.

Say, uh, can you
do me a favor?

You see that fire
extinguisher there?

(GRUNTING)

Dad, that's enough!

Dad, that's enough!

That's enough, Dad!

(GASPING, SOBBING)

(SOBBING CONTINUES)

I just want you
to know, Meg,

if there's anything
you ever want,

-all you got to do is ask.
-Really?

Well, there kind of
is one thing.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-(GASPS) There he is now!

Hey, Meg.
You ready to go?

Dad, you remember Michael Milano
from the hospital.

-He's my date.
-Oh.

Say, Michael,
can you do me a favor?

You see that fire
extinguisher there?

Stay away from my daughter,
you possible rapist.

Dad, stop it.
Michael's my date.

Meg, I almost lost you once,
I'm not gonna lose you again.

This guy may look
harmless on the outside,

but on the inside he could be a complete
bastard, like Fred Flintstone.

So, why exactly do you
want this separation?

Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell,
the cat put me outside,

I was bangin' on the door
for like 20 minutes, shouting "Wilma!"

-I didn't hear you.
-Oh, there's no way you didn't hear me.

-I was in the shower.
-Oh, she was in the shower.

The elephant's trunk
was on full blast.

You could've been right
on the other side of the door,

-and you wouldn't have done a damn thing.
-I couldn't hear you.

And besides, you're always
yellin' about something.

All you do is spend my money
on expensive clothes and hairdos.

How the hell am I supposed
to know when to pay attention?

But when I want to get my rocks
off, you're nowhere to be found,

you passive-aggressive bitch.

Meg, can I talk to you
in the kitchen, please?

-Dad, what the hell?
-Lois, did you know that Meg had a date?

Yes. With that nice boy
from the hospital. What's the matter?

We don't know him.
Maybe he's not even a boy.

Maybe he's two dwarves
in an overcoat

wanting to see what sex is like
with a big person.

Huh? Is that what you want?

Two crafty dwarves
in your house,

after your daughter--
Wait, do dwarves grant wishes?

No, Peter, they're people,
like you and me.

Well, good-bye phone
in the bathroom,

but I still don't like Meg
dating that boy.

Guys that age,
all they care about

is putting their thing
in everything.

I'm not gonna let Meg turn out
like my Nerf football in the hall closet.

Dad, didn't you say you'd
give me whatever I wanted?

Well, I want to go out
with Michael.

Peter,
you're being overprotective.

Look, why don't you
just talk to him?

You might find out
he's not so bad.

All right, Lois, but I know
what my gut tells me.

And right now it's telling me
I have...

(DEEP VOICE)
<i>Indigestion.</i>

But I'll suck it up
and talk to Michael.

Even though I've also got...

(DEEP VOICE)
<i>Diarrhea.</i>

So, you are here
to take out my daughter.

What are your intentions?

I just think
Meg is really cool,

and I want to get
to know her better.

You know, Michael,
my daughter's womb

is not a wildfire
for you to douse

with your
adolescent seed.

I understand.

Do you, Michael?

Do you?

We'll see.

Let me ask you
a question.

You ever sit on your arm
till it falls asleep,

and then play
with yourself

and pretend like
somebody else is doing it?

Honestly... yes.

Not anymore you don't.

'Cause you're going
out with my daughter.

Morning, Brian.
Here, put this on.

-How long have you been here?
-7:00 a.m.

All right, here's your hammer,
here's your walkie,

and here's your stud finder.

Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.

Oh. Oh, well,
it's working.

All right,
joke time is over.

Work time has begun.
You get started with this drywall,

and I'm gonna start pulling out those
old floorboards in the kitchen.

-Hey, Brian, knock, knock.
-Who's there?

(WHISPERS)
Two friends building a house together.

Hey, Meg, I, uh,
got you something

for our three-week
anniversary.

Wow, a Maroon 5 CD.

Yeah, I remember
how you told me

you liked terrible music,

so I thought
you might appreciate it.

You're so thoughtful.

Mm...

-What the hell?
-What's wrong?

Uh, Meg, I'm not sure,
but I think your dad

is sitting at
that table over there.

What? Where?

Well, I can't tell
if it's him.

I-- I think he's wearing
some kind of disguise.

Oh, my God, Dad.

What do you think you're doing?

(WITH CHINESE ACCENT)
Peter? Who Peter?

I didn't say "Peter."

I said "Dad."

Oh...

Have you been spying on us the
entire time we've been dating?

Meg, it's only because
I want to make sure

this guy treats you right
and doesn't try anything funny.

Meg, this is more
than I can deal with.

If your father is this opposed
to our relationship,

I don't see how
it can work out.

But, Michael...

I'm sorry, Meg.

I promise
I won't forget you.

See, look, Meg,
he just walked out on you.

He's a bad man.

Like Jodie Foster.

(CAR DOOR SLAMS OUTSIDE)

Oh, no, Jodie!
It's my husband!

He's home from work early!

(MALE VOICE)
Don't worry, baby.

He had to find
out sometime.

(FARTS)

All right, Brian, I'm going to
go up to the upper level

and run this wire
down through the wall.

Grab your walkie,

-I'll call you when I get up there.
-Okay.

-(OVER WALKIE)<i>Brian, pick up. Over.</i>
-What?

<i>Brian, please say "over"</i>
<i>when you finish talking. Over.</i>

What? Over.

<i>-Do you see the wire yet? Over.</i>
-No.

<i>-No... what? Over.</i>
-No. Over.

<i>Okay, I'm going to start</i>
<i>feeding it through. Over.</i>

Wait, if you haven't
started feeding it,

why'd you ask me if
I could see it?

<i>Didn't copy that. Over.</i>

I said why'd you ask me
if I could see it,

if you haven't started
feeding it? Over.

<i>Oh, that's better.</i>
<i>I can hear you now. Over.</i>

<i>Do you see it yet? Over.</i>

You know, you're a jackass.
For the record,

I don't want to hang out with
you anymore when this is over.

<i>When this is what, Brian?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

I said I don't want to hang out
with you anymore when this is over.

<i>When this is what? You've got to</i>
<i>finish your sentence. Over.</i>

That's it.
My sentence is over.

<i>Your sentence is what, Brian?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

My sentence is-- Wait a minute.
I have to say "over"

even if the sentence ends
with the word "over"?

<i>Ends with the word what, Brian?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

Oh, I see the wire.

<i>You see the wire what?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

-Over!

Meg, sweetie, it's been,
like, two weeks.

Don't you think it's time
to forget about that boy?

Yeah, Meg, he was a bum anyway.
You'll find another fella.

I could set you up
with one of my friends.

Oh, wait...

I don't have any friends.

I could set you up with Dad.

Dad, would you be interested
in dating Meg?

I certainly would.

There, Meg,
everything's fine.

It's not Michael
I'm upset about!

Well, what is it then?

I'm pregnant!

Dad, I swear to God
I didn't know that

when I set you up
with her.

Oh, I can't believe this!

My baby's pregnant!

-How could this happen?
-I don't know.

But regardless of how
it happened, it happened.

You're pregnant, Meg,
and there's only one thing to do.

Meg, can you turn over?
I gotta get that thing out of there.

You're sitting
on my shirt.

I gotta put it
on this hanger.

Now, I'm going
to Michael's house

to force him to marry you.

Dad, please don't do this!

You can't make
him marry me!

I just want
to talk to him.

-Why do you have a shotgun?
-I just want to talk to him.

-Dad, this is ridiculous!
-I just want to talk to him.

-Put that gun away!
-I just want to talk to him.

-What are you doing? It is not his fault!
-(DOORBELL CHIMES)

-It was an accident!
-I just want to shoot him.

-I just want to talk to him.
-You can't shoot him!

Wait, what-- what are you doing?

You got my Meg pregnant!

What?!

Oh, my God! Meg!

Why didn't you tell me?

I didn't think you
wanted to see me.

But this changes
everything.

I want to be there
for you, Meg.

I love you.

Will you marry me?

Yes!

Of course!

Ah, now see?

That's an even more beautiful
sight than 72 virgins

waiting in heaven
for a suicide bomber.

Here I am!

We're playing
Magic: The Gathering.

Want to join?

Osama!

-Um, you know something, Brian?
-Yeah?

I'm starting to think maybe

we bit off a little more
than we could chew.

-Yeah.
-Well, we're in it,

and we're going to finish
the job.

Should we get started
on the upper level?

No.

What the hell
are we gonna do?

We've sunk all of our money
into this place.

I've, um...
I've got an idea.

I'll be right back.

So, listen, uh, we're going
to want to be leaving now.

-Why?
-Because I just emptied

a full tank of gasoline
and lit a match.

We've got about
five seconds.

Didn't we have an electrician
in there today?

Uh... he left.
Pretty sure he left.

Isn't that his truck?

Well, by God, Brian,
we're murderers.

I guess this means you'll
be going to doggie hell.

-(EVIL LAUGHTER)
-(DOGS SQUEALING, BARKING)

Hey, what do you guys
think of this one?

Meg, are you sure you want
to go through with this?

You know, there are
other options.

Mom, I'm not getting
an abortion!

I'm not saying an abortion,
per se,

but maybe you just drink
and smoke a lot.

-What?
-Just don't start doing it

and then chicken out halfway
through the pregnancy,

because then you'll
wind up with Chris.

Well, Lois,
I got the cake.

Oh, and they were all out of
the bride and groom figurines,

so I got the Iron Giant
and a courtroom doll

that kids use to show where
the molester touched them.

All right, Meg, enjoy
your bachelorette party.

I am outta here

'cause I don't need to see
what you crazy girls

are going to do while I'm gone.

But just remember,
this is a residence

and should be treated as such.

And if you girls drink anything,

there's recycling under the sink
in the kitchen.

Okay, have fun.

So... what are we
supposed to do?

Yeah, this doesn't seem
like much of a party.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey, what's with all the noise?

Got some complaints
from next door.

I might have to take
you girls downtown.

(TECHNO DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)

Which one of you
is the lucky bride?

What's your name, sweetie?

Dad, you know my name.

Ep, ep, ep, ep!

It's Officer Nasty.

Careful, I might be carrying
a concealed weapon.

Hello.

Hi. Name, please?

Neil Goldman.

Goldman, Goldman...

Sorry, no Neil Goldman.

Oh, I beg your pardon.

I meant to say
Chris Griffin.

Griffin, Griffin...
Oh! here it is.

Says you're supposed
to be an usher.

Well, you need this.

Name, please?

Chris Griffin.

Griffin, Griffin, hmm.

I'm sorry, sir, Chris Griffin
has already checked in.

Well, that's impossible!

(SOBBING)

Meg, are you ready?

Sweetie, what's wrong?

Mom, I can't do it.

I can't get married.

What? Well, why not?

Because...
I'm not pregnant.

What do you mean?
How do you know?

(SIGHS)

-I got my period.
-Oh.

I must've read
the test wrong.

What am I going to do?

Michael's out there
waiting for me.

Well, Meg, the best thing
you can do is be honest.

Just tell Michael
the truth.

If he cares about you,
he'll understand.

I'll try.

Thanks, Mom.

I love you.

I (MUMBLES) you
too, honey.

(PIPE ORGAN PLAYING "WEDDING MARCH")

God, look at Meg's fat shoulders
in those spaghetti straps!

It's like bread baking
around twine.

Meg... you look beautiful.

Thank you, Michael.

I have never been more
in love with someone

than I am with you
right now.

Oh, Michael,
I love you, too.

And I have some
wonderful news:

I'm not pregnant.

-What?
-What?

(DOOR SLAMS)

Dad, I'm sorry about
this whole mess.

(SIGHS) You know what, Meg?
It's all my fault.

I never should've dragged
you into this, anyway.

I guess sometimes
a father just gets

a little overprotective
of his daughter,

but you got to know I was only
thinking about your happiness.

I know, Dad.
And I appreciate it.

The problem now is that these
people are expecting a show.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Twitty.

He's collecting Cleveland's

Black guy mail.

Peter, you're just supposed to pick up
Cleveland's mail, not go through it.

Lois, black people are different

And me, I find that hilarious.

Boy, Cleveland gets

Ooh, <i>Mustache Aficionado.</i>

Wow, look at these men.

What class, what grace.

And all because
of a little upper lip hair.

Lois, I am going
to grow a mustache.

Then I'll have it made
like the Monopoly guy.

Except when he goes
directly to jail.

what if the refrigerator

was a monster that
talked like this?

(RASPY VOICE)
I am a monster.

I am going to bite

Here I come.
I'm going to get you.

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Ah! I don't want to play anymore!

Normal voice, normal voice!
The refrigerator can't hurt me. Okay?

Oh, my God, Dad,
what's on your face?

It's a mustache, Meg.

Oh, I think it's sexy.

I think it's gay.

It's not gay, Brian.

If I'm gay, then
Freddie Mercury was gay.

Freddie Mercury--
the lead singer of Queen?

He was incredibly gay.

He was not!
He had a mustache--

which is practically
like a wedding ring.

I imagine you're going to be
much more of a stern father,

now that you have a mustache.

Well, Chris, there may be
more lap sitting

than there's been.

And I might answer most of
your questions with a story.

But, mostly,
my mustache tells people

that there is a 90% chance
that I am poorly educated,

that I keep upscale porn
magazines out in the open,

and that I listen to
the Little River Band

with giant headphones.

Ugh! That's the ugliest thing
the Fatman's grown

since that horse leg.

Hey, Peter, have you seen my--

Aw, Brian, I'm sorry,
but what do I keep saying?

Do not stand behind me.

God, these high school

I'm a freakin' baby, and
I'm cooler than they are.

What the hell do you
know about high school?

Are you kidding?

These kids today are
so easy to manipulate.

If you plopped me in
the middle of a high school,

I could be the most
popular kid there in a week.

Really?

Would you care to place
a wager on that?

Absolutely.
What are the stakes?

Okay, if I win
and you can't do it,

you have to put your nose in Meg's hat
and take an eight-second inhale.

Okay, it's a bet.

-Great.
-Kiss on it?

-What?
-Oop.

Wow, Dad, you're up early.

Yep, it's a mustache
kind of morning, Chris.

I watched the sunrise
in my jeans,

jean shirt and jean jacket.

Gosh, mustache culture
is pretty cool.

You betcha, son.

I'm gonna make you some
hash browns for breakfast,

and then, later, I'm gonna take
you down to the whorehouse

to lose your virginity.

-Would you like that?
-Would I?

Wow, that's a way better present

than that buff hamster
you got me last Christmas.

Dad, all it's done is
run on that wheel

for the past three weeks.

Yeah, looks like it's
in pretty good shape.

-Can I pick it up?
-I wouldn't.

Boy, you know, I've always
wanted to come in here,

and now that I got a mustache,
the timing feels right.

Wow, all this stuff looks
pretty good.

Can we get some salami, and...

Brian, Brian,
let me handle this.

Uh, scusi.
Bah buh-da boopy?

-(SPEAKS ITALIAN)
-Peter, what are you doing?

Speaking Italian.
Ba-ba-da boopy?

Ba-boo-ba-da-bee-

a mustache.

Peter, don't you think you're kind of

letting that mustache
consume your personality?

Shut up, Brian. I am part of
a very special community now.

People with mustaches
look out for each other.

-Hey. Oh, hey!

-MAN: <i>Hey!</i>
-Hey, Jeffrey,

Peter Griffin has a mustache!

-Way.

-I know!

Oh, my God, Peter, look!

McBurgertown is on fire!

It's out of control!

We need someone to man
the other hose!

Hey, that guy has
a mustache! Grab him!

We need your help!
Take this hose!

MAN:
Help!

Oh, my God!
There's somebody trapped inside!

Wait, if I go in there,
I could get hurt.

No! No, with great mustache
comes great responsibility.

(SCREAMING)

My mustache!

No!

God bless you, sir,
you saved my life.

But at what cost?
At what cost?

Peter, have you
seen Brian?

No, Lois, I have not.

Well, I haven't seen
him since this morning

and I... What is
that on your head?

It's a mustache, Lois.

What, you never seen
a mustache before?

Lois, would you mind calling
the police or something?

Quiet, mustache!

Oh, my God!

Peter, I know you're upset
about losing that thing,

but get a grip on yourself.

Let Brian down.

No. I'm not living my life
without a mustache.

Even if, sometimes,
my mustache has Alpo gas.

(FARTING)

-Mustache fart.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hello, I'm looking
for Peter Griffin.

I'm Peter Griffin.

Mr. Griffin, my name
is Todd Meyers.

I'm the man you rescued
from McBurgertown.

Oh, yeah, you're the guy
who cost me my mustache.

What, did you come over here
to rape my daughter?

No, I own the restaurant,
and to show my gratitude,

I'd like to offer you a lifetime
supply of McBurgertown burgers.

Free burgers?

Oh, man, this is
a way better offer

than the one I got
from Helen Hunt.

You wanna have sex?

No...

No, no, no, no...

No... no.

Peter, you should
really slow down.

You've already had
like 30 hamburgers.

Shut up, Brian.

It relieves the pain
of mustachelessness.

And it's working.

I no longer feel the pain.

Come to think of it,
I can't really feel anything

on the left half of my body.

Really? That doesn't
sound good.

Peter, are you
winking at me?

(SCREAMING)

Oh, my God, someone
call an ambulance!

Doctor, what happened?

Is he gonna be okay?

Mrs. Griffin, your husband
has had a stroke.

The left half of his body
is completely paralyzed.

Oh, my God!

Peter, sweetheart,
how do you feel?

Uh... had better days, Lois.

Had better days.

Mom, it's been
three months.

When is Dad gonna
get better?

Chris, I've already explained
this to you.

Your father had a stroke and it may
take him a long time to recover.

PETER: Lois! Bring me
another beer, please!

(SIGHS)

Uh, Lois, you mind telling me
what the hell you think you're doing?

I'm handing you a beer.

You are handing it
to my stroke arm.

This is my good arm!

Bring the beer over here!

That's better.

So, I'm shaving last night
at this make-out party.

I took a bunch of pictures.

You can see them on
my MySpace page,

along with my favorite songs
and movies and things

that other people have created, but
that I use to express my individualism.

I have a MySpace page too.

Yeah, I have mine ironically.

Hey, why don't you
guys get lost.

I have to talk to Connie.

-Hey, guess what?
-What?

That's what.
No, but seriously,

there's something I want
to talk to you about.

Sure, Zac.
Anything for you.

You wanna go out to
Anal Point this weekend,

see what all the buzz is about?

OMG!

That'd be so awesome!

Sweet. We're gonna have
a real ragin' time.

Before you know it, we'll be
like an old married couple.

Well, Brian,
you've lost your bet.

I-- or rather, my

am currently the most popular
boy at James Woods High.

Well, Stewie, you got
the best of me on this one.

Congratulations. I guess you'll be
hanging up your wig now?

Oh, no, Brian.
I'm enjoying myself too much

Do you know that
I've got a date

with Connie D'Amico this Saturday night,
at Anal Point?

Ah, I've heard
about that place.

Really?
What's it like?

'Cause I have no idea.

Well, uh, I suppose
if you imagine it

like a parking space
that you think,

"Gosh, there's no way
I'm gonna be able to fit in there."

But then you fold in
the sideview mirrors,

and sure enough,
well, look at that.

Well, in that scenario,
it sounds like I'd rather be

the parking space
than the car.

Yeah, that's what
I've always guessed.

I hate being all strokey.

This is all your fault,
McBurgertown.

You and your delicious
hamburgers!

I swear I'll get back
at you someday

for what you did to me
and what you did to Wimpy.

(SLURRED SPEECH)
I would gladly pay you Tuesday

for a hamburger today.

If only there were some way

I could be like everybody else
again.

How long was I in there?

About five minutes.

Why are we not funding this?

Sweetheart, that's incredible.

And it only took five minutes?

Five minutes.
I went in there

they injected me with a little bit
of that fetal crap,

and bam, good ol'
gambling man Peter.

And now I can take my revenge
on McBurgertown.

-Wait. What?
-It's their fault I had a stroke, Brian.

And I'm gonna sue 'em
for it.

Peter, you ate
30 hamburgers.

It was your own fault.

Yeah, besides, Peter,

those companies have
huge legal divisions.

You can't fight that.

I'll find a way with the help
of my snarky cat lawyer

Meowsy McDermott.

You've got to be kitten me!

Ha!

(GAVEL BANGS)

This court finds in favor
of the defendant,

McBurgertown Industries.

What? Hey, come on!
That's not fair!

Mr. Griffin,
what did you expect?

They have a hundred lawyers,
and you tried to bribe me

with a subscription
to <i>Grape Soda Today</i>

which I already have.

Case dismissed.

What did I tell you, Peter?
One man can't take on

a multinational fast food
conglomerate.

Oh, yes, I can.
This ain't over, Brian.

Those people are bad,
and I'm gonna prove it to the world.

-How do you expect to do that?
-Are you kidding?

I've tackled
tougher jobs before.

Remember that time I was Robin
Williams' jumping-off point?

-Okay... religion.
-Oh, religion.

we both go to heaven.

or are we gonna do it?

All right, baby,
those are the magic words.

Now check this out!

our millions of dongs
elsewhere.

Wait, wait!

Let me get our general manager.

Peter, what the hell do you
expect to accomplish here?

Evidence, Brian.

I'm gonna find just
the right piece

of incriminating evidence
to bring down this company.

Over here is a menu

from our first McBurgertown
restaurant in 1952.

At that time, our value meal
consisted of a hamburger,

a cup of coffee
and a Lucky Strike.

Wow. How much did all that cost?

Back in the '50s,
one straw penny.

A whole strawpenny?

Indeed. Follow me.

Hey, what's in there?

Oh, I'm sorry.
That's off limits.

Now if you'll excuse
me for a second,

I have to go to the bathroom
for about 30 minutes

as I eat a lot of meat.

Please give me your word that
you won't go in that door.

-Okay.
-Good. See you in a half hour.

-Peter, this is your chance!
-Brian, I gave him my word.

The hell with that.
Let's see what's behind this door.

(CATTLE MOOING)

My God, what is this?

This must be the McBurgertown
slaughterhouse.

Sir, you are correct.
But in here, we call it "DaCow."

-DaCow?
-DaCow,

except we spell
the "chau" part C-O-W,

like "cow," so it's kind of a... eh,
sort of a dark joke.

Yeah, yeah,
it's a Holocaust joke.

That's, that's really funny.

Unfortunately,
life in a slaughterhouse

is no laughing matter.

They have killed
a great many of us,

including my beloved wife.

Peter, this is it.

This is the evidence
you've been looking for.

If we can get you out of here,
would you be willing to testify

publicly about these atrocities?

Oh, absolutely.

But how do you
intend to escape?

You leave that to us.

Come on.

GENERAL MANAGER:
Hey!

There they are!
After them!

<i>Here comes the story</i>
<i>of The Hurricane</i>

<i>The man the authorities</i>
<i>came to blame</i>

<i>For something</i>
<i>that he never done</i>

Quiet, everybody, this is it.

<i>The McBurgertown</i>
<i>franchise suffered</i>

<i>a publicity setback today</i>
<i>from which it may not recover,</i>

<i>thanks to testimony</i>
<i>regarding its practices</i>

<i>by a very brave cow.</i>

I have revealed to you, today,
these horrors

in the hope that you will
see the need for change.

But always remember,
what I have done here today

is not a courageous act.

The courage lies with a man
who has the guts

to say no
to a fast food restaurant

and eat a salad instead.

To say, "I will eat this salad
with pride.

I don't care
if I look like a gay person."

So to all of you
salad-eating homosexuals,

I say thank you.

And thank you, Peter,
for all you've done

to help expose
this grave injustice.

Where will you go now,
Mr. Cow?

I cannot stay here?

Peter said
I could stay here.

Oh, gosh.
Yeah, I don't--

I don't really see how
that's gonna work out.

Oh. Well, as I said,
Peter just promised--

Yeah, I should
stop you there.

I didn't really
promise anything.

I just said "Maybe,
if it was okay with Lois."

Boy, it just seems
like a real burden to me.

Well, this is pretty awkward.

(ALL LAUGH)

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, Peter,
your Visa bill is $16,000!

Somebody's been using your credit card.

Didn't you cancel it
when you lost your wallet?

I hear what you're saying, Lois,

but unlike my credit card,
I'm carrying a very low rate of interest.

(POPS MOUTH)

Let me see that.

A big screen TV, a massage chair
from Sharper Image, plane tickets...

Peter, someone has obviously stolen
your credit card.

Well, here's the good news, Brian.

Whoever the thief is, he's spending less
than my wife.

(POPS MOUTH)

Wait, look at this.
He eats at House of Chung every day.

House of Chung, eh?

Come on, let's go, Brian.
I'm gonna get revenge.

Just like I did against that pigeon
that pooped on my car.

Oh!

That's right. Get it nice and clean.

The place is packed.

How are we gonna figure out
who has your credit card?

I got it, Brian. Smell my ass.

-What?
-Smell my ass.

It's where I keep my wallet.

Get the scent and then find the guy
that smells like me.

-Peter, that's ridiculous.
-Come on, boy, get the scent.

-Cut it out!
-Get a good sniff.

That's disgusting.
You're an idiot, you know that?

Wait a minute.

(SNIFFING)

Your wallet's over there.

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, it's you!

James Woods.

Hello, Peter. I've been expecting you.

You stole my credit card,
you son of a bitch.

What did I ever do to you?

That's a good question, Peter.

What did you ever do to me?
What did you ever do to James Woods?

Well, I locked you in a wooden crate
and forgot to put an air hole in it.

-Forgot to put an air hole in it.
-Well, you kind of had it coming.

Look, Mr. Woods,
just give Peter back his wallet.

Oh, no, Brian. I'm just getting started.

Peter, you humiliated me.
You put me through hell.

And now you're gonna pay for it.

So get ready.

(SNIFFING)

Oh! That kung pao chicken smells good.
You smell that, Brian?

All I can smell is your ass.

Lois, we found the guy
who stole my wallet.

-You'll never guess who it was.
-James Woods?

WOODS: Hello, stranger.

I don't recall inviting you into my home.

Peter, he's been here for four hours.

I told him to leave,
but he keeps saying he lives here.

I say, this is more uncomfortable

than having James Brady
at a cocktail party.

All right, so I got my handgun

and I'm just randomly firing it
into a crowd of people, and then...

-And then what?
-And... Nothing. Nothing.

No, no, I'm anxious to hear
the conclusion of your story.

It's stupid. Stupid story.

-I'm calling the police.
-That won't be necessary.

I already did.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hello, Officer. Would you be kind enough
to remove this trespasser from my home?

What are you talking about?
This is my house.

No, this house belongs to Peter Griffin.
And that's me.

Hmm.

Driver's license, Social Security card,
passport, title to the house.

This puts me in a tough spot.

Joe, you can't possibly believe this.
You know who Peter is.

I know, Lois,
but this man has all the paperwork.

Oh, come on, this is identity theft.

I hate to have to do this,
but I'm afraid legally I have no choice.

I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir.

Thanks, Joe. Clam later?
We'll hoist a few?

-Sure, Peter.
-Joe!

Hey, not so fast, pal.
Those are my clothes.

-Oh, come on.
-You heard him, fella. Take 'em off.

Right down to the poop sack.

What? You don't all wear a poop sack?

Damn it, Bonnie!
You lied to me about the poop sack!

Hello, family. Hello, honey.

(BABBLES LOVINGLY)

Stop calling me that.
I don't care what the law says,

you're not Peter Griffin,
you're James Woods.

I should've warned you,
she can be a real bitch in the morning.

Mom, this is really weird.
I want Dad back.

I don't.
Having a celebrity dad is a real thrill.

Not like the fake thrill of running
into your ex-girlfriend on the street.

-Rob? Hey!
-Hey! How are you?

-God, it's good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

How's my dog? I'm... I'm sorry, your dog?

-Oh, I had to give him away.
-Gave him away!

-Well, Dave's allergic.
-Dave!

All right, so there's a Dave.
That's great. God, Dave sounds great.

Yeah, he is. And his parents are so sweet.

Met his parents and they're sweet.
Just older Daves, huh?

(LAUGHS)

What a family. God, it's good to see you.

You won't get away with this, Woods.

You know, you're not supposed
to be in the house, Brian.

-You're more of an outdoor dog.
-What the hell does that mean?

This is so humiliating.

For God's sake, I went to Brown

and he's got me out here
tied to a post like some kind...

(BARKING)

What the hell?

This rope was a lot longer,
and now it's somehow gotten shorter.

What sort of black magic is this?

Brian, guess what?

I gave James Woods your novel to read,
and you're not gonna believe this.

-Really? Did he like it?
-He wants to option it and make a movie!

-Really?
-No, he didn't really respond to it.

Oh. Listen, I need your help.
Run inside and get me a pair of scissors.

-No.
-Why not?

Because you made me watch that video
with the two girls and a cup.

-Okay, wait, so what is this now?
-Just watch.

-Why are we taping my reaction?
-Just... Just watch.

(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay. They're lesbians, clearly.

I don't know...

I don't know what else... Wait. Wait.

No!

(SCREAMING)

What is wrong with you? Oh, my God!

(LAUGHING)

Oh, I'm never gonna be able
to eat ice cream... Oh, my God! Oh!

Oh, my God!

(GROANING)

Oh, that is disgusting! Oh, my God!

Oh, can you imagine if two dudes did that?
Oh, my God, that'd be even worse!

I mean, like, would that...
Would that even exist?

I mean, like,
where would you even find that?

Let's type it in and see what comes up.

So, you can just rot out here, Brian.

Brian, what are you doing
tied to Meg's pole?

Peter, you got to get out of here.

If James Woods sees you,
he's gonna call the cops.

I miss my family, Brian,
and I gotta see them.

(SHOTGUN COCKING)

Well, well. A trespasser on my property.

That's the worst thing
that's happened to me since...

(GASPS)

-You wouldn't!
-It's up to you, Peter.

Either you leave now,
or I set up one of your random flashbacks.

All right, all right, all right. Okay.

-Peter, what do you care...
-No, no, Brian, he's serious.

I'll come back for you, Lois.

And I'll set up all the flashbacks,
just like I used to.

Like the time I swallowed that midget,

who played Mini-Me,
just so I could make you laugh.

-You ready for dinner, Peter?
-Oh, yeah.

In fact, my stomach has been
talking to me all day.

I said, my stomach has been
talking to me all day.

Come on, say the line.

Oh, oh, there he is.

You know what, he slipped into my colon.
Yeah, damn it, he's smothered.

But let me just ask you this, Lois,

if my stomach had said,
"Hell, yeah, I'm hungry!

"How about some pork chops?"

-Would you have thought that was funny?
-Not really.

Well, then,
this has been an absolute misfire.

Oh, this is just awful.

James Woods is destroying this family,
and all just to get back at Peter.

I know, he's doing all the stuff
Dad usually does.

Right now he's upstairs talking to Meg.

Now, Meg, you want to be thin
like all the Hollywood starlets, right?

Yeah, but I love to eat.

Well, I've got a way
that you can eat all you want

and look like a Hollywood starlet.

Meg, let me introduce you to Mr. Pukey.

-Hiya, Meg.
-Hi.

Gosh, Mr. Pukey, you sure are good
at making fat women hot.

Wow, thanks.

You think you could help out
my friend Meg here?

Yeah, I think I could give her a hand.

(LAUGHING)

Now close your eyes, Meg,
and let Mr. Pukey help you out.

(RETCHING)

Whoa!

When did Reese Witherspoon get here?

(GASPS)

(SQUEALS)

Mr. Woods, how do I get a girl to like me?

Oh, Chris, I'm your father. Call me Dad.

Okay, Dad. How do I get a girl to like me?

Well, there's a number of ways, Chris.

For example,
Heather Graham and I had a mutual friend,

and he threw a punch social one day
and we both happened to be there.

Next thing you know,
we're both in the back room, slam-bang.

I went bareback, babe.

-Wow, she sounds like a class act.
-Oh, not at all, Chris. No, not at all.

What am I gonna do, Brian?

James Woods has taken my life
and my family.

I know, Peter, but identity theft
is one of the hardest things to fight.

-How you gonna handle it?
-I don't know, Brian.

All I know is, I sure do miss Lois.
I gotta find a way to see her.

And I think I just got an idea.

A much better idea
than when I did magic for the blind.

-Is this your card?
-I don't know.

-Was it a red card?
-I don't know what red is.

Ta-da.

You know what's amazing, Lois?

A week from tomorrow,
it'll be 20 years we've been married.

-I married Peter Griffin, you lunatic!
-Hello. I was there, see?

Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.
I brought a friend home for dinner.

Mom, Dad, this is Scooter.

Uh... Hello, Scooter.

-Hi, Scooter.
-Hey, everybody.

Sure is swell of you to have me over.
What's for eats, Mrs. G?

Meatloaf, Pete... I mean, Scooter.
I hope you like it.

Leaping lizards, meatloaf is my favorite.

Scooter, how come
we've never met you before?

Shut up, Meg.

You know, Scooter,
we don't allow hats at the dinner table.

-Oh, my bad, Mr. G.
-Dad, no!

Aha! I should have known!

Get out of my house right now,
son of a bitch!

(WHIMPERS)

(GUNSHOTS)

(SCREAMING)

(CRYING)

Well, that's it, Brian. I guess he's won.

I guess he's Peter Griffin now.

Wait a minute, Peter.

If he's Peter Griffin,
then that means you can be James Woods.

That's a great idea, Brian.

If I was a famous movie star,
I wouldn't even want my family.

No, no, Peter, I'm saying you can
do to him what he did to you.

-You can ruin him.
-I'll do it, I'll be James Woods.

From this day forth, I am James Woods.

And I'll stick to that story,
even if nobody believes it.

I'll tell you
what nobody believes in, ghosts.

(SINGING) <i>Where did Robinson Crusoe go</i>

<i>With Friday on Saturday night</i>

Damn. Play me off, Johnny.

(PLAYING RAPIDLY)

You're probably wondering
why he's in hell.

Johnny liked little boys.

The question is, Brian,

how am I gonna make people
think I'm James Woods?

The same way he did, Peter.
Identity theft works both ways.

The first thing we're gonna do
is get you a perfect fake ID.

I know a guy who does good work.

You took a big risk coming here, man.
James Woods could be back any minute.

-I know. How fast can you do it?
-As fast as Spider-Man when he gets laid.

Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

That's never happened to me before.
It's just...

You're so attractive,
and it's been a while.

I'm gonna go.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

-Wait a minute, you're not James Woods.
-Oh, I believe I am.

Driver's license, Social Security card,
American Express.

What the hell is he doing?

Wow, I guess you are James Woods.

So, now, let me understand this,
what are you here to promote, James?

Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie
coming out on HBO next month.

It's all about 9/11.

The movie's called
<i>September 11, 2000-Fun.</i>

(ALL GASPING)

No! No, no, no, no!

James, that sounds unbelievably offensive
to Americans.

Well, you haven't heard
what the movie is about.

I play a window washer who has
just finished washing the last window

of the World Trade Center.

And then I turn around
to get off the scaffold,

and what do you think I see coming?
A plane.

And I go, "Come on!"

You know, it's real,
real old-style comedy.

You know, it's like two pies in the face,

and one in a field in Pennsylvania.

James, I don't want to hear any more
about this.

And the voice of the plane is David Spade.

What? I would never
work with David Spade!

That dwarf! That skinny chicken (BLEEP).

Well, Brian, it's been a productive week.

I think I've successfully destroyed
James Woods' reputation. Here it is.

<i>Well, our top story continues to be</i>
<i>the fall of actor James Woods,</i>

<i>who almost overnight has gone</i>
<i>from America's most beloved celebrity</i>

<i>to America's most hated pariah.</i>

You're in a lot of trouble, Griffin,
you (BLEEP).

Oh, no, sir. You're Peter Griffin.
I'm James Woods.

You ruined my reputation.
And now you are gonna pay for it.

We're gonna settle this like men.

All right, we'll settle it like men.
But not here.

Meet me out in the alley in 20 minutes.

I'll be there. You be there, too,
you little piece of stool.

All right, Peter, I'm here. Where are you?

Ooh! A piece of candy. Ooh!
A piece of candy. Ooh! A piece of candy.

Ooh! A piece of candy. Ooh!
A piece of candy. Ooh! A piece of candy.

Ooh! A piece of candy. Ooh!
A piece of candy. Ooh! A piece of candy.

Okay, Brian,
next time let's remember this right away,

because he's done this twice.

Oh, Peter, we're so glad to have you back.
I missed you.

I missed you, too, Lois.

-So, what happened to James Woods?
-Oh, he's being examined by top men.

-Who?
-Top men.

(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

<i>He's a family guy!</i>

Lois, look at this.

My essay won first prize in
the New England Rising Writers Contest.

I'm gonna be honored at the big ceremony
on Martha's Vineyard.

They're gonna put me up
at a luxury hotel, all expenses paid.

-Wow, congratulations, Brian.
-Meg, please, I'm talking.

Over a thousand people
entered the contest,

and they chose mine.

-Well, that's wonderful, Brian.
-Yeah, that's a great achievement.

Just like the first chemotherapy patient
to figure out the handkerchief look.

Honey, get in here!

-What is it?
-Just... Just get in here!

-What... Oh, my God.
-Right?

-It's like you don't even have cancer!
-Don't even have cancer!

-I know.
-Oh, my God.

No, but I still have
pretty aggressive cancer.

Come on, Peter. We're gonna be late
for lunch with Mom and Dad.

Oh. Right.

-You didn't forget, did you?
-No, no, I didn't forget.

Let me just go change
out of this fishing gear.

-Hey, Peter, what's up?
-Come on, come on, we gotta go now!

We gotta go now. Come on, Joe! Joe!
Quagmire! Come on. Go, go, go!

Pull the car around. Come on, let's go!

(PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
<i>-Lois, this is Peter.</i>

<i>I'm afraid that on my way to the bedroom</i>
<i>to change, I took ill.</i>

<i>You'd best go to lunch without me.</i>

Why do I hear an engine?

<i>Because my stomach is rumbling in a way</i>

<i>that sounds like the engine</i>
<i>of Joe's fishing truck.</i>

-Peter, are you lying?
<i>-Now she's a doctor, guys.</i>

QUAGMIRE:<i> Hi, Lois!</i>
PETER:<i> Quagmire says hi.</i>

Damn it, Peter,
you're going fishing, aren't you?

You promised me you'd come to lunch
with my parents today.

<i>Well, Lois,</i>
<i>until we get an appointment secretary,</i>

<i>things like this are gonna continue</i>
<i>to fall through the cracks.</i>

My parents are not gonna like this, Peter.

You know they're still angry
at how you behaved at our wedding.

-You may now kiss the bride.
-Kiss her? I am gonna destroy her.

Mom, are you still mad at Dad
about yesterday?

Well, sort of.

I mean, we planned that lunch
two weeks ago.

But he promised he'd go with me

to put flowers on my grandmother's grave
this afternoon,

so I guess it's all right.

-Peter, are you ready...
-Oh. Right.

So, a lot of tension
with Peter lately, huh?

That's an understatement, Brian.
He's been incredibly thoughtless lately.

Even more so than usual.

But tonight is our sex night,

and a little physical release
will do us both some good.

-Peter, are you... Oh, come on!
-Lois, I know it's late,

but, me and the guys,
we're going beekeeping.

Oh, my God,
what the hell is wrong with you?

Whoa, someone just yelled themselves
out of honey with breakfast.

I don't need honey, Peter,

I need a husband
who wants to spend time with me.

Can I make a suggestion?

All you two have done is argue about stuff
for the past two weeks.

It's my guess you could use a vacation.

Why don't you come out
to Martha's Vineyard

and watch me accept my award?

Wow, does that sound wonderful.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that sounds expensive.

Can't we just do something fun here
at the house?

It's just as relaxing.

Hey, guys,
I've decided I'm gonna take up the drums.

-I'll start packing.
-I'll start packing.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

Look, Quagmire, we're only gonna be
in Martha's Vineyard for a couple days.

Can't you just watch the kids?

Man, you're more of a letdown
than Fruit Stripe Gum.

Hmm! Aw!

What are we gonna do, Lois?
Quagmire's busy,

and Joe and Bonnie are out of town.

-Well, what about Cleveland?
-He's on the road touring with Black Box.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

-(SINGING) <i>Everybody</i>
-(SINGING)<i> Everybody</i>

<i>-Everybody</i>
<i>-Everybody</i>

Well, wait a minute,
what about that nice old man

who lives up the street?

Oh, yeah,
maybe Herbert can watch the kids.

He seems like a responsible guy.

So it would only be till Monday,
and we could pay you for it.

Yeah, and it's real easy, I promise.

I mean, you've spent time
watching children, right?

-Yes, sir. Yes, I have.
-Wonderful.

Brian, this is wonderful.
I feel like one of the Kennedys.

You know, the over-privileged drunk ones,
not the socially-responsible dead ones.

You know, this resort offers
some wonderful amenities.

They have bird-watching,
wine tasting, horseback riding.

Yeah, they also have stork startling.

Squawkety, squawkety, squawkety,
squawkety, squawkety, squawkety!

(LAUGHING)

Your bird intelligence is no match
for my people intelligence.

All right, children,
your mammy and pappy asked me

to look after you
for the next couple days,

so I want to lay down a few ground rules.

No cussing, clean your plates,

and only a half hour of radio
and then it's off to bed.

Well, that sucks.

And don't you mouth off to me,
or I'm gonna slap you right in your penis.

No offense, Mr. Herbert,

but I'm a 17-year-old girl,
and I don't need you here.

Well, no offense to you, Meg,

but you're a 17-year-old girl,
and I don't need you here.

What do you think's keeping Peter?

I hope he gets here
before they give you your award.

Well, you're here, Lois.
That's enough for me.

(CHUCKLES) Oh...

You always know just what to say.

<i>And now, reading a passage</i>

<i>from his grand prize-winning</i>
<i>short essay,</i> Amazing Grace,

<i>tonight's guest of honor,</i>
<i>Mr. Brian Griffin.</i>

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

<i>"She was grace in name and in essence.</i>

<i>"To those she loved, she exuded</i>
<i>strength, life, laughter and light.</i>

<i>"And, to me, also sorrow,</i>

<i>"for circumstance had bound her</i>
<i>to my best friend,</i>

<i>"through whom we met in the warmth</i>
<i>and serenity of her home.</i>

<i>"Nothing from the first day I saw her</i>

<i>"and no one</i>
<i>that has happened to me since</i>

<i>"has ever been</i>
<i>as frightening and as confusing,</i>

<i>"for no person I've ever known</i>
<i>has ever done more</i>

<i>"to make me feel more sure,</i>
<i>more insecure,</i>

<i>"more important and less significant."</i>

That was beautiful, Brian.

Well, you know what they say,
write what's in your heart.

(SLURRING) Hey! Oh, did...
Did I miss Byron's reward?

Brian's award. And, yes, you did, Peter.

You've been a good son, Brian,
and I'm sorry you're so sick.

-What?
-Peter, where the hell have you been?

Every time that we go to a hotel,
you hide the key to the minibar from me.

But I found it. I found it.

You're a piece of work, you know that?
An hour late and you're drunk.

You had an opportunity
to share a beautiful moment with Brian,

and you wasted it,

wasted it like the Osmond family
wastes water.

(SHOWER RUNNING)

Who's in the shower? Is it Donny?

No, I showered earlier.
It could be Merrill.

-Merrill's right here.
-Well, where's Jimmy?

Jimmy's running through the sprinklers
in the yard.

-Is it Marie?
-No, no one's in there.

So the shower's just running
with no one in there?

-That's right.
-Well, I'll be a son of a gun.

(SNORING)

-Hey. Good morning.
-Oh, good morning, Brian.

That's a lovely fragrance you're wearing.
What is it?

Oh, this? This is Hartz Mountain Flea Dip.

Kills ticks, fleas and mosquitoes.
It's very potent.

Almost as potent
as the inspiration you give me

to plumb the deepest fathoms of my soul

for a literary bounty
of truth and loveliness.

(FARTS LOUDLY)

That's so much better. Morning, Lois.

I'm sorry about last night.
I promise I'll make it up to you.

Well, if you really mean that,

I was hoping we could go
paddle-boating today.

Great, but can we do it after 5:00?
There's a ball game on.

Well, then maybe Brian and I
can hang out.

-Do you mind, Brian?
-No, not at all.

Good, now can you move, please?
You're blocking the screen.

-You all know what day it is?
-No.

-It's bath day.
-I don't want to take a bath.

(GIGGLES)

Not for you, silly. It's bath day for me,
but I can't wash myself.

Know anybody
with a pair of strong, young hands

to help me in and out of the tub?

Rats!

-Oh, I had so much fun today, Brian.
-So did I.

Hey, you feel like grabbing something
to eat?

Oh, I'd love to, but Peter and I,

we're gonna get dinner
at that little place by the...

Well, looks like I am free.

Hey, you know what might be fun?

How about we just order room service
and watch a couple of bad movies?

Yeah, that does sound like fun.
I'll go rent <i>Vanilla Sky.</i>

I said a bad movie, not an abortion.

This is gonna be great.
A whole evening with Lois!

We are gonna have such a fun time.

Lois, my darling!

Couple of steaks, some wine,
maybe a couple of sundaes...

Lois, my darling!

...little music, some candlelight.

Lois, my darling!

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What am I doing?

This is Lois, Peter's wife.

How can I even think
about trying anything?

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-STEWIE:<i> Hey, Brian, it's me.</i>

<i>I got a question for you.</i>

<i>Herbert and I are playing Scattergories.</i>
<i>Would you count NyQuil as a beverage?</i>

<i>-No, right?</i>
-No.

<i>Yeah, not gonna fly, old man.</i>
<i>Thanks, Brian.</i>

HERBERT:<i> Damn it. I'm missing</i>
Boy Meets World <i>for this?</i>

This is so much fun, Brian.

Well, it's a Saturday night,

sorry the video-store pickings
were a little sparse.

Hope you like <i>Roman Holiday.</i>

<i>I lied. I was a princess the whole time.</i>

<i>You bitch!</i>
<i>I'm gonna punch you in the face!</i>

That was a lovely dinner.
I saved all my scraps in a bag for you.

Thanks. You know, Lois,
I'm sure you've already figured this out,

but that essay I wrote,
I wrote it about you.

(CHUCKLES) Oh...

I had a hunch. Thank you, Brian.
I'm glad you shared that with me.

Well, you know, Lois,
you mean a lot to me.

I mean, things you say and things you do
resonate with me in a big way.

When you drive away to go to the market,
I just don't know what to do with myself.

And then when I hear that car
coming up the driveway, I just go berserk.

I mean, you know, half the time,
when you go to the market,

I just assume you're leaving forever,
and when you get back,

I realize I have no idea
how long you've been gone, and I...

Well, you know what, I'm...
I'm rambling. I...

-Would you like some more champagne?
-I'd love some.

My head is swimming.

Oh, my God! Brian, no! Now, stop it!
What are you doing?

I can't help myself, Lois!
I know you're married to Peter,

but I love you
and I can't stand it anymore!

Brian, no! No! Get down! Get down!

This is a good sweater! Off! Off!

Brian, I think you'd better go.

BRIAN: Lois, I'd really like to talk
about this.

-No! Stop scratching the door!
-Okay.

Oh, my God, I attacked Lois!

What the hell was I thinking?
I'm a rapist!

I'm... I'm no better than Kobe Bryant
or Mike Tyson or Reagan!

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

STEWIE:<i> Hey, Brian,</i>
<i>another Scattergories question.</i>

<i>The category is "Type of Pet."</i>
<i>Herbert put "Cambodian."</i>

<i>That's not right, right?</i>

Look, Stewie,
I can't talk about this now, all right?

-Jeez, what's your problem?
-I just...

I did a bad thing,
and I don't know what to do about it.

I feel like I'm losing my mind.

That's how I felt
at that Grateful Dead show.

Does anybody want to buy my shirt?

I'll trade you my shirt
for a grilled cheese!

So, what happened, sport?
Come on, talk to your pal, Stewie.

All right, but only because
I've got to tell somebody.

-I pretty much just threw myself at Lois.
-So, you finally did it, huh?

Well, look, Brian, as your friend,

I should tell you that
that vagina is ground zero, man.

I mean, I just...
I wrecked that thing on the way out.

And just to be a jerk,
I carved "Brooks was here" in the wall.

Did... Did you see that?
Did you see "Brooks was here"?

We didn't have sex.

'Course, what with Chris going before me,
I pretty much just walked out of there.

Didn't even have to stoop over.

There was even room to twirl a cane
as I strolled.

-You're exaggerating.
-Only a little bit,

that's the messed-up thing.

-Morning, Lois.
-Peter, there you are.

Were you down at that hotel bar
all night again?

I was, Lois.
And you know who's staying at this hotel?

Nathan Lane!

We got wasted at the bar,
and he ended up asking me to marry him,

so I convinced this minister to do
the job, but the joke's on Nathan Lane,

'cause gay people can't get married!

-They can in this state, Peter.
-Oh.

Well, in that case,
we're registered at Filene's.

God, you've spent half
this entire trip intoxicated!

I'm intoxicated all right, Lois,

by the beauty and magic
of Martha's Vineyard,

Nantucket, Cape Cod
and all the great destinations

that make Massachusetts
the wondrous place it is.

<i>The spirit of the red, white and blue</i>

I am so glad
Brian brought us out here, Lois.

He's a real pal, you know that?

Well, it's actually Brian
I need to talk to you about.

Boy, he's a hell of a guy, isn't he?

He's the one guy I know I can trust.

Brian tried to have sex with me.

Was he bigger than me?

"...and they told Peter
to stay away from the Wolf.

"But he didn't listen to them
'cause he's his own man.

"And he knew that sometimes the things
that seem the most dangerous

"turn out to be the most fun."

Yes, sir, it was a good day
for young Peter.

(WHISTLING CHEERFULLY)

Are you a pedophile?

Hey, Lois told me
there was some funny business.

-Yeah, what of it?
-Well, it's just...

I can't help but feel
a little betrayed, Brian.

Lois is my wife, and...

Well, I mean, all the dry food
I've bought for you over the years?

Yeah, well, you don't deserve her,
you know that?

-Say what, now?
-You don't deserve her.

She does nothing
but give and give and give,

and you repay her
with selfishness and neglect.

I mean, you've barely spent any time
with her at all on this vacation.

Well, who the hell are you
to tell me how to run my marriage?

You can't even hang on to a girlfriend
for more than a couple months!

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

You're a freakin' train wreck
with that crap, Brian.

You couldn't even get Jillian
to take you back,

and she was dumber than Lou Ferrigno.

(GROWLING)

(YELLING)

(GROANS)

Stop it! Stop it! Get off my husband!

Wait a minute, Brian. Nathan Lane
is right. What are we doing?

Look, I'm sorry, all right? It's just...

When you have feelings for someone
that are strong enough, you just,

I don't know,
lose sight of the rest of the world.

Brian, she's my wife,
and you're my best pal.

So, what are we gonna do about this?

(SIGHS)

I promise, Peter,
nothing like this will ever happen again.

Thanks, old buddy.

Yeah, blah, blah, blah!
That's all well and good, Peter.

Now, get ready, we're having dinner
with my parents tonight!

Oh. Right.

I just feel terrible
about this whole thing, Lois.

-Can you ever forgive me?
-Yes, Brian, I can.

But there's something
you deserve to know.

-What's that?
-Well,

it's not like I haven't thought about it.

-Really?
-Well, yes.

I mean, you and I have a lot in common,

and we've spent so much time together
over the years,

and, of course, that essay you wrote,
it really touched my heart.

Well, to be honest, Lois,

I ripped off most of that speech
from <i>Summer of '42.</i>

Oh.

Well, it was still nice.

Let me just ask you this.

When these thoughts about you
and I have crossed your mind,

is it good?

-What do you mean?
-Well...

Oh!

Yeah.

Well, a lot of times
when Peter and I are having sex,

I feel suffocated,

but with you I imagine it would be
like doing it with a stuffed animal.

-Everybody ready to go?
-All set, Peter.

Good.

Well, we may be leaving
Martha's Vineyard,

but the spirit of this wonderful place
will stay in our hearts all the way home.

'Cause after all...

Hello, America,

I'm Seth MacFarlane,
creator of <i>Family Guy,</i>

here to talk to you about
some of the amazing work

that's going on
at the Dana-Farber Center

for Cancer Research.

Oh, I'm just kidding.
Can you imagine?

Tonight, we're going to watch
some of my favorite clips

from <i>Family Guy</i>

as we celebrate 100 episodes
of doing just enough to get by.

And we thought it'd be fun

to find out just how well
the show is holding up.

So, we gathered a group
of regular, average Americans

who had never seen <i>Family Guy</i>

and showed them
a couple of episodes.

Their reactions were almost
universally positive.

Take a look.

Did you enjoy <i>Family Guy?</i>

No, I didn't, really.

I don't really get it.

It's not funny to me.

It's stupid.

What's the point?

It should have a point
or something.

Is <i>Family Guy </i>a show

that you would recommend
to your friends?

No, definitely not.

No.

I just thought it was horrible.

-Did you enjoy <i>Family Guy?</i>
-No.

Would you allow your children
to watch <i>Family Guy?</i>

No.

Have you ever heard of a show
called <i>American Dad?</i>

No.

At the heart of any
successful TV family comedy

is the family itself.

Let's take a stroll
down Spooner Street

and relive some memorable
moments from the family

that helped turn me,
a poor Vietnamese immigrant,

into a Caucasian Hollywood
millionaire.

Dad, what is it?
What's going on?

I heard a noise.
Is somebody downstairs?

-(SCREAMS)
-Oh, God, Meg, you startled me.

I'm sorry.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

Oh, my God,
that was such a rush.

Mmm, yeah!

I'm alive!

(GASPING)

(WHEEZES)

(GAGGING)

It's up to us as parents
to be a part of the solution.

I'll go talk to the principal
tomorrow.

Thanks, honey.

The safety word is "banana."

I love you.
(GRUNTS)

How are you, uh...

How are you coming on that novel

you're working on, huh?

Got a big, uh, big stack
of papers there?

Got a... got a... got a nice little,

nice little story
you're working on there?

Maybe a big, uh, novel

you've been working on
for three years, huh?

Got a...

Got a compelling protagonist, huh?

Got a, got a obstacle for him to overcome?

Huh?

A little story brewing there

you're working on?

Working on that
for quite some time, huh?

Yeah, talking about that three years ago.

Huh? Been working on that the whole time?

Nice little, uh, narrative,

beginning, middle and end?

Some friends become enemies,

some enemies become friends,
yeah?

At the end, your, uh,
main character is, uh,

richer for the experience,
yeah?

Yeah? Yeah?
You got a...

No, no, you deserve
some time off.

Now, whoever goes the longest
without puking

gets the last piece of pie
in the fridge.

(ALL GULPING)

Okay, here we go.

How's everybody doing?

-Good, good so far.
-All right, all right.

-Nothing yet.
-Cool. Cool.

You know, I don't know
if you guys had any

of that pie already
but that is, uh,

that is some tasty stuff.

That's from the, uh,
bake sale that Lois would...

Ooh, one down. I know
somebody who won't be having any...

I'm starting
to feel funny.

Well, I feel fine.
I guess I'm gonna...

Oh, boy,
that means I win!

I get to eat...

(GROANING)
Oh, oh, God.

Why didn't anybody tell me...

Oh, my God, my
insides are on fi...

No, no, please, no more.

No more.

Dad, I'm scared.

Get the phone. Call 911.

Lois, Lois, Lois, get in here.

(GASPING)
Okay.

Okay, I think it's all gone.

I think it...

I don't want to...

Peter, Peter, I need
you to hold my ears.

Oh, oh.

Who wants chowder?

Sure, <i>Family Guy</i>
is a half hour of laughter,

but it's also a half hour
of learning.

Let's take a look back at
some <i>Family Guy </i>history lessons

that have kept America's
high schoolers out of college.

What did you just call me?

I thought that was your name.

That is our word.

You've got no right using it!

Hey, hey, hey, I'm cool.

I'm cool. No problem.

Could, could you
pass me the oar,

-N-Word, Jim?
-Thank you.

This time we really have to do it.

Oh, okay, all right, ready?

-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

-One, two...
-One, two...

-Ah!
-Ah!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

You want me
to kill myself,

and you're not going to.

You suck!

-You suck!
-You suck!

Look at Edison over there
with his damn electricity.

Hey, Edison!

How about sharing some
of those lightbulbs, huh?

Hey, figure it out
for yourself, man!

We're freezing
our asses off over here.

Hey, man, how do you
think I feel, you know?

You get to look at my great house.

I got to look at that dark thing. Huh?

Wh-What is that a candle over there?

-Oh, that's pretty sweet.
-Yeah, it's a cand...

We're, we're freezing
over here.

No one in my family's taken
a bath in a month.

We stink. It stinks
over here, you jerk!

I can't hear you over my central heating.

Hey, why don't you go to hell, Edison.

Hey, bite me, man.

Hey, hey you guys seen <i>The Office?</i>

Oh, no, oh I guess
you haven't,

'cause you don't have a TV.

Hey, how about I come over there
and kick your ass?

Ooh, yeah, come on over.

("FOXY LADY" BY JIMI HENDRIX PLAYING)

<i>Foxy</i>

We'll be right back with more clips

from the show that has
all of America laughing.

Would you say <i>Family Guy</i>
is inappropriate for children?

-Absolutely.
-Definitely.

I mean, I wouldn't
want my kid watching that.

Is there anyone that you
would recommend <i>Family Guy </i>to?

Um... There's a lot of people, uh...

you know, that are, um...

you know, hooked on drugs,

uh, you know, that are hooked on alcohol

and... or marijuana,

and they need
this kind of addiction.

What kind of people do you
think would watch <i>Family Guy?</i>

Gosh. Um...

people who don't know how
to turn the TV station.

(LAUGHS)

That's what I think.

Welcome back to <i>Family Guy's</i>
100th episode celebration.

Aren't you glad this isn't
the <i>Dharma & Greg </i>clip show?

Because by now, you would have
already seen the Dharma clips

and you'd be stuck watching
all the Greg clips.

God, what an awful, awful show.

(MELLOW JAZZ PLAYING)

Well, now, let's check in once again

with some of our biggest fans.

I guess, what I don't get
about <i>Family Guy</i>

is how sometimes the baby
and the dog find themselves

in sexual
or perverted situations.

It's weird, because I think
of babies and dogs

as innocent and cute,

and then it's like... Whoa.

Babies are supposed to be cute and sweet,

and this baby is evil
and is talking a lot of trash.

Who is the voice on...
That's not David Hyde Pierce's voice.

-For which character?
-Stewie the baby,

or whatever his name... That's not him.

-That is David Hyde Pierce.
-No way.

-Yeah.
-Is it really?

-Yeah.
-Oh, I'm so disappointed.

What character did you relate to the most?

I didn't relate to any of the characters.

Um, the one character that
I might have related with

is probably Meg.

Do you think Jesus,
if He were to come back,

would enjoy <i>Family Guy?</i>

Definitely not. No. No.

If He were the head
of a network,

would He cancel <i>Family Guy?</i>

Yes, He would. Correct.

You know, some of my favorite
moments on <i>Family Guy</i>

over the years have been
the musical numbers.

They're the moments that keep us

just one gay step ahead
of the competition.

So, lighten those loafers

and get ready for us
to suck your funny bone

with some <i>Family Guy </i>style
showstoppers.

I forgot how funny I am.

We'll be right back
with more <i>Family Guy </i>clips

after a few pats on the back
from you, the viewers.

What shows do you like?
What shows do you think are funny?

I do like <i>South Park.</i>

Like, I could actually sit there
and watch it,

'cause they kind of make, um, more jokes.

I like <i>The Simpsons</i>
'cause it's smart.

<i>The Simpsons...</i> I know that's Fox,

but it's just, it's way better,
it's way more creative.

Even <i>Scrubs,</i> with its zany humor,

still has moralistic fiber
underlying tones to it.

So you would say <i>Scrubs</i>
is better than <i>Family Guy?</i>

Oh, miles. Yeah.

(CHUCKLING) Definitely better.

Do you think Jay Leno
is funnier than <i>Family Guy?</i>

Mm-hmm.

-A lot funnier?
-Oh, yeah.

A lot funnier.

-Do you like Tina Fey?
-Um...

I liked Molly Shannon a lot better.

I don't know.

Tina Fey maybe is a bit boring to me.

What kinds of shows do you enjoy?

I really just watch soap operas
and <i>The Bachelor.</i>

Welcome back to the <i>Family Guy</i>
100th episode celebration.

I hope you like what you've seen so far,

and I know you're going
to enjoy the rest.

And after it's over,
what do you say

you and I head out back
and have a game of catch?

We can talk about the trouble
you've been having at school

and why girls are so interesting
all of a sudden.

Do you think <i>Family Guy</i> speaks for women?

I never sensed for one moment
watching that show

that <i>Family Guy</i> speaks for women.

It's probably degrading
to women.

I can't see, like,
any women really watching it

unless they're sitting next to,
like, their husband

or their boyfriend or something.

I don't think <i>Family Guy</i>
speaks to women at all.

Um, if they do,
it's in a derogatory manner.

Do you think <i>Family Guy</i>
speaks for Latino-Americans?

Oh, no, not at all.

As an African-American male,

do you think <i>Family Guy</i> speaks to you?

Uh, yeah, I do.

-It does?
-Mm-hmm.

In what way?

In the wrong way,
that's why I want it off.

You know, people often ask why

there are so many pop culture
gags on the show.

Well, I'll tell you.

<i>Family Guy </i>likes to hold
a mirror up to society

and say, "Society, you're ugly,

"and we don't like
a lot of what you're doing."

Here's just a small sampling
of our distaste.

Tom Hanks, that's it.

Oh, funny guy, Tom Hanks.

Everything he says is a stitch.

<i>-I have AIDS.</i>
-(LAUGHING)

Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave
inappropriately toward you?

Well, yes, but the worst part
was he never called back.

(LAUGHTER)

No, but in all seriousness, yeah,

he was actually
pretty aggressive.

(SCREECHES)

Help!

Stop this crazy thing!

Stop! Help!

Oh, my God, George!

Did you not hear me out there?

-Dad, are you all...
-Go to your room, Elroy.

-But what happened?
-Go to your room!

Hello, Peter.

Welcome to the cool side

-What are these?
-I don't know.

What do you mean
you don't know?

I-I-I don't know
how they got there.

Well, I think you do know.

No, no, uh, Derrick was in here earlier.

He was, uh, making the beds.

He probably put them, uh...

I was in the john.

You're freakin' Nazis!

-(YELLING)
-Shh-shh-shh!

Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!

Yeah, uh, I bought a giant,
life-size slingshot from you,

and it just slammed
me into a mountain.

Sorry, no returns.

I've been a customer here for years.

I can maybe give you a store credit.

But... Really? Well, I guess...

-What's the holdup in here?
-I'm taking care of it!

Give me, like, a...

Give me, like,
a Dewar's and soda.

And, uh, you know, try to keep

the saltwater out
of it if you could.

Try... you know...
Try to keep the saltwater...

Yeah.

We're, we're surrounded by saltwater,
you know.

It's kind of difficult...

I know, I'm just saying,
I'm just saying try.

-Yeah, okay, I'll try.
-Thank you. Yeah.

You want me to wipe
your ass, too?

-Wow, that's a helpful tone.
-You're abusing your powers.

Actually, this is all time that could be
spent getting me my beverage.

Jim Henson had
a "wait and see" attitude,

and look what happened to him.

Now we've got
wrong-sounding Muppets.

-I'm hungry.
-Oh, that's no problem.

I could cook you something.
You want some spaghetti?

That's, like,
my specialty and junk.

Yay.

You're a worse parent
than Britney Spears.

I know, I know.

Oh, the gift basket
was not worth the trip.

-Not by a long shot.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, I've got to get that.
I'll talk to you later.

Wow, you know,

from the other side,
that's kind of annoying.

You know, through the years,
Peter Griffin has had more jobs

than you can shake a stick at.

You know, I never got that phrase,

"shake a stick at."

Did people in the old days

shake sticks at things in large groups?

(GROUP LAUGHTER)

See, I'm the engine that drives
a lot of the comedy on the show.

Let's look at some of Peter's jobs.

So, Peter, where do you see
yourself in five years?

Don't say, "Doing your wife."
Don't say, "Doing your wife."

Don't say, "Doing your wife."

Doing your... son?

I am going to stop
pollution with my new

lovable character,
Gary the No-trash Cougar.

(CHAMBER CLICKS)

-Pick up your trash!
-(ALL GASPING)

I want to know
whose cup this is.

I said, "I want to know
whose cup this is."

Pick it up!

Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up!

Thank you, sweetie.

See what a nicer place
this is when we all pitch in?

Like Gary the
No-trash Cougar says,

"Give a 'labage,'
throw out your garbage."

(HELICOPTERS WHIRRING)

You're all stupid.

See, they're going to be
looking for army guys.

"Bet," I knew that.

Slow it down, will ya?

"Pit," come on, pal,
it's my first day.

Oh, that's it, buddy!

(BLOWS LANDING)

Boy, this gig is even
better than that job

I had providing nighttime heat
for Lara Flynn Boyle.

-Hey, Lara.
-Yeah?

Is Dylan McDermott
nice in person?

Yeah.

Good.

And a one, and a two...

(GRUNTING)

No, no, no, no, no.

The altos were early.

This is the worst
glee club I've ever...

Oh, oh, come on.
Where are you going?

The benefit's tomorrow!

Relax, the sand people
frighten easily,

but they'll be back,
and in greater numbers.

Well, that'll give us a richer harmony.

Oh, yeah, no... it's going
to sound fantastic.

We'll be right back with more <i>Cold Case.</i>

Another awful show.

And it's very tough to look at,
the whole thing is just drab.

And it's like it's all shot
with a blue filter,

and it makes everything look
really gray and unappealing.

And <i>Medium, </i>I hate <i>Medium.</i>

Come on, everybody!

If there's anything
you could say directly

to the creator of <i>Family Guy,</i>
what would you say?

Can it.

-You mean, cancel the show?
-Yeah.

And it's going to cost
David Hyde Pierce a job if they do that.

That's okay, he'll find work.
He's wonderful.

-(LAUGHING)
-I love him.

I don't want people

from other countries
to watch this show

and say, "Oh, that's how
Americans are."

I-I wouldn't want that.

If you could say one thing

to the creator of <i>Family Guy,</i>
what would it be?

To move on, cancel it.

Just basically, uh, you know...

start over again, you know.

That's all. Just, uh,

-start over from scratch.
-Mm-hmm.

They're trying to hit, like,

a grand slam here,
and it's not going to happen.

You have to lose first, you know.

You don't become champions,
you know, your first time out.

You know, you have to...
you have to first lose

-and then you win.
-Like Jesus?

That's correct...
and like the Dodgers.

Well, we hope you've enjoyed
this look back

at the first 100 episodes
of <i>Family Guy.</i>

Here's to the next 100.

And hopefully,
we won't get canceled

for two and a half (BLEEPS)
years in the middle again.

Good night, America.

What would you say if
I told you <i>Family Guy</i>

is contributing money
to help find Osama bin Laden?

Um, I'd say that they're
not contributing enough.

Would you recommend
<i>Family Guy </i>to your friends?

Um, my immature friends.

-The word "hero"
-Mm-hmm.

is applied too liberally today.

Do you think
Peter Griffin is a hero?

No, no, no, no.

But you had
to think about it.

Yeah, I had to think about it.

Yeah, I did. I did.

Right, right.

Do you think
Peter Griffin is a hero?

Peter Griffin... I have to be
completely honest with you.

I don't know
who Peter Griffin is.

About an hour ago. This party sucks.

Really?

No, wait. He was either wounded or killed.

I don't remember.

Well, which is it, Stewie,
wounded or killed? I can work with either.

No, no, he's dead. He's dead.

Just like the Pink Panther.

-What's wrong with him, Doctor?

Well, it seems his lungs
are completely filled

with Owens Corning fiberglass insulation.

What? Will he be okay?

No, he won't be okay.

One-third of his body weight

is Owens Corning fiberglass insulation.

(BEEPING INCREASES TO STEADY TONE)

Well, that's it.

But don't worry, he won't burn in hell

thanks to all that

How about that magician, huh?

Yeah, he's great.

I love magicians.

I don't know why, but I've
always found magic very sexy.

-I'm a magician.

You know, my son's birthday party

is next weekend.

Any chance I can hire you to do your act?

Absolutely!

I think the magic's
starting to happen already.

(BOTH LAUGH)

Brian, this is painful.

It's like listening to those
two foreign guys

down at the coffee shop
who've been living in the US

almost long enough to sound American.

Oh, man, what a good bunch

of partying at that discotheque.

They played one of my audience requests.

Way awesome.

I myself drank, like, five liters of beer.

Any more and I would have
ended up in hospital, man.

Oh, you said it, friend.

But I wanted to stay

'cause I almost had sex on this girl.

Oh, yeah! But it was so expensive.

Each drink was, like, six dollars 40.

And if I've done this right,

then this is your card, Stewie.

Really, Brian? Card tricks?

That's what's gonna close
the deal with this woman?

Well, yeah. Why not?

You need more than that. You need an act.

Listen, I'll be your assistant,

and we'll put on a whole big show.

-Really?
-Yeah, we'll do all the great tricks.

You can even split me in half.

-What?
-Saw me in half.

Well, I am still a little shaky
on some of this stuff.

I guess I could use the help.

Great. And we'll get you
a wand, a top hat and a cape.

In fact, you can use Peter's cape

from last year's Halloween costume.

Hi, Brian.

I'm Count Crotchula, the bulging vampire.

I'll bite your neck,

but also look how big I am down there.

That costume doesn't make any sense.

Don't stifle my creativity!

See that bulge down there, Brian.

What is that? What is it?

Can't be my pointy teeth,

'cause those are all the way up here.

I'll let you in on a little secret.

(WHISPERS) Happy Halloween.

Okay, kids, it's time for the magic show.

How about a big round of applause

for The Amazing Brian?

(CHEERING)

I can't believe I agreed
to four costume changes.

Oh, who am I kidding? I insisted on it.

Brian, thanks so much for doing this.

Paul and I are so excited to see your act.

Oh, thank... Wait. What?

Paul, my boyfriend.

Paul, this is Brian.

Boyfriend? Oh, come on!

I paid $800 for all this crap!

You have a boyfriend?

-Yeah.
-And I'm a great guy. I'm unemployed,

but that makes her feel useful
in the relationship.

I'm gonna fix him.

Our relationship
will do fine on that basis.

If he had his life together,
I wouldn't be into it.

But I don't.

God! I am so sick of this crap!

Is this the show?

You know what? The hell with both of you!
I'm outta here!

Are we doing this thing or what?

Brian? Brian?

Well, this was a lot of effort
for nothing...

like trying to tell Matthew McConaughey

how much he sucks.

You know, Matthew, I may not ever get

another chance to say this,

so I just want to get this off my chest.

You are just awful.

You're one of the worst actors
in the history of film...

(CHUCKLES)

And I think that you need to go away.

Oh, thanks, man.

The truth is I spend
at least 90% of my year

going away, exploring exotic places,

having sex with my beautiful girlfriend,
just doing sit-ups.

I mean, I really...
And then counting money.

Money that I made off the terrible films

that I put out into the American populace

because they just love to see me

doing what it is that I do.

Yes, but you're not hearing me.

<i>Dazed and Confused </i>was the one thing
that was passable.

-After that...
-Oh, thanks, man.

That actually launched my career.

After that, everything else was awful.

<i>Contact,</i> they didn't
even need you in that movie.

They could have done
the whole movie without you.

I know. I know. I said the same thing.

But they were just, like,
"Oh, we need a good-looking guy

"with a great ass and some tight abs

"to just provide some down-home
enthusiasm in this picture.

"Something to counterbalance
Jodie Foster."

They took her to be, uh, slightly cold,

uh, unapproachable, do you know?

So they put me in there.
I said it didn't make any sense.

Said the same thing

about that Bill Murray elephant movie,

but they were just, like,
"Oh, the audiences need you."

(CHUCKLES)

You make me physically sick to my stomach,

and I wish that you would
get a heart attack.

I totally feel you, man.

Truth of the matter is,
I don't like my movies either,

but, man, they just keep offering me money

and I do it and I get
to go around the world.

I mean, did you see <i>Sahara?</i>

(LAUGHS) I tell you what the move gave me

was an opportunity to take
an Airstream all across the country

and sell that picture
one person at a time.

-You suck donkey ass.
-Now, you can't prove that.

That was so humiliating!

I mean, look at all the stuff

I put myself through just to get laid.

Oh, don't worry, my friend.

One day you'll find your soul mate.

The sad thing is I already did, years ago.

Tracy Flannigan.

She was the greatest girl I ever met,

and I blew it.

(YAWNING) You should look her up.

Oh, am I boring you?

No, it's just... long day.

Well, I suppose I could look her up.

I just wonder if she'd even
want to see me.

I wasn't exactly the nicest
guy in the world.

And then, in high school,

I was violated sexually by my father.

It happened on numerous occasions,

and I was too afraid to tell anyone

because I felt like
somehow it was my fault.

So... you do go all the way.

Well, here goes.

(DOORBELL CHIMES)

(RASPING COUGH)

Uh, Tracy?

Tracy Flannigan?

(DEEP, HOARSE VOICE) Oh, my God,

Brian Griffin, is that you?

Uh, yeah, it's me.

And all he wants is to kiss you

just one more time.

Wow, you sure look... different

than the last time I saw you.

Yeah, haircut.

So to get out of here I just make a left

out of the driveway
and drive as fast as I can?

Wait. Brian,

I'm actually glad you found me.

There's someone I've wanted you to meet

for a long time.

From the look at those toenails,

I bet it's that little Lamisil monster.

Brian, this is Dylan.

He's... your son.

Oh, no way!

Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

Gosh, this is a lovely home, Tracy.

That's so weird.

It smells like there's a cat,

but I bet there's no cat.

I've wanted you to meet Dylan
for a long time, Brian.

Well, Brian, a son.

How about that?

My God, this is more uncomfortable

than the good-bye in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

Good-bye, Tin Man.

Good-bye, Dorothy.

Good-bye, Lion.

Good-bye, Dorothy.

And I think I'll miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.

Oh, okay.
That's kind of an odd thing to say.

Yeah, sort of a weird comment
right in front of all of us.

Kinda thought this was a team effort.

Yeah, yeah. Really, really glad

I risked my life and everything.

Yeah, you're, like, five minutes from gone

-and you leave with that?
-Yeah.

You know, it's like cutting a huge fart

and then walking out of the room.

And that's how we'll remember you,

as a big fart.

Good-bye, big fart.

So, Dylan, um, shouldn't you be in school?

-I don't know.
-It's Wednesday.

-Up yours!
-Nice kid.

Say, Brian, now that I think about it,

how can you possibly
have a 13-year-old son

-when you yourself are only seven?
-Well, those are dog years.

That doesn't make any sense.

You know what, Stewie?
If you don't like it,

go on the Internet and complain.

Oh, it was awful.
That kid was a complete thug.

I'm telling you, I couldn't
get out of there fast enough.

Boy, Brian, you dodged a bullet

not having to raise that kid.

Your life would have been more miserable

than a lonely old widow living
in a downstairs apartment.

-(SNEEZES)
-Quiet! Keep it down up there!

-(SIGHS)
-What did I just say?

I'm calling the police!

I don't know, Brian.

Don't you think you have
a responsibility to your son?

Hey, Lois, I didn't even know
I had a son until today.

And besides, it's not like
Tracy ever asked for my help.

Yeah, it seemed like
they're all set without you.

She's done a fine job

creating a child-friendly
environment... a-roni...

(SPOUTS GIBBERISH)

(BLOWS RASPBERRIES)

STEWIE: Great parenting.

I don't know, Brian.

Raising a child is a very
rewarding experience.

You know what else is rewarding, Lois?
Shuttin' your vag.

-What?
-What?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Dylan! What are you doing here?

My mom wanted me to give you this.

"To Brian from Tracy.
He's your problem now.

"PS Will you write me
a letter of recommendation

"for the University of Phoenix?"

No. No, I'm not gonna
put myself on the line like that.

But Dylan, my God!

Everybody, this handsome muscular boy

is Brian's son, Dylan.

Dylan is gonna be staying
with us for a while.

Dylan, it's so nice to meet you.

Shut up, bitch!

Oh! He got you, Lois.

No, no, no! Tracy can't do this.

She can't just leave him here.

Well, we can't just turn him away, Brian.

After all, he is family.

I don't know. Where's he gonna sleep?

He could sleep in Stewie's room.

Would you like that, sweetie?

No, my pants just got shorter
'cause I hated the idea.

And this is Chris.

Chris, this is my son, Dylan.

Hi, Dylan.

All this stuff in here is mine now.

Oh. Well...

Okay, but be careful opening the closet,

'cause that's where the evil monkey lives.

Yay!

I haven't been in my closet for years!

Boy, there is a lot of feces in here.

Something on your mind, son?

Shut up, dude.
You're just a fat old bastard.

Well, not to get technical,
sir, but you are the bastard.

Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!

(RAGTIME MUSIC PLAYING)

I hate you all!

I didn't ask to be born.

If I had a gun, I would kill you all!

Did you hear that, Lois?

Now we know what to get him for Christmas.

Oh! I love the holidays.

Brian, you have got
to get Dylan under control.

He's terrorizing the whole family.

Yeah, you wouldn't believe
what he did to Meg yesterday.

He made her watch the other 178 hours

of <i>Monty Python </i>stuff

that isn't funny or memorable.

<i>I have a pet</i><i>hedgehog named Zippy</i>

<i>and I shall walk</i><i>her to town,</i>

<i>and each time my foot</i><i>hits the ground,</i>

<i>I shall say,</i><i>"Boing, boing, boing."</i>

I'm a girl!

I don't even like
the good <i>Monty Python</i> sketches.

Don't worry, I got it under control, Lois.

I'm monitoring Dylan from here
on Stewie's baby monitor.

STEWIE: <i>Hey, Dylan.</i>
<i>Hey,</i><i>come on in here for a sec.</i>

DYLAN: <i>Stewie, why are you nude?</i>

STEWIE: <i>Oh, just</i><i>a little something I do</i>

<i>once a week around here</i>
<i>called a naked tea party.</i>

<i>Got my teacup here.</i>

<i>Now all I need</i><i>is a tea bag.</i>

<i>That's something that</i>
<i>interests you, my friend?</i>

DYLAN: <i>You're weird.</i>

STEWIE: <i>Yeah,</i><i>and you're attractive.</i>
<i>Now take your </i>(BLEEP) <i>pants off!</i>

DYLAN: <i>I'm outta here.</i>

STEWIE: <i>Oh,</i><i>did you see that, Rupert?</i>

How to Lose a Guy in Ten Seconds,

<i>starring</i><i>Stewie Griffin, huh?</i>

<i>Gee whiz.</i>

Hey, Lois, is the air conditioning on?

I just woke up from a nap
and I feel drafty.

Peter, we don't have air conditioning.

Well, that's awful peculiar.

(GASPS) Oh, my God. Peter, look.

Oh, damn it, Dylan. What the hell?

Well, thank God I'm full of Play-Doh.

(DEEP BREATH, GRUNTING)

There we are.

That's it. I'm telling Brian

he has to rein Dylan in once and for all.

Hey, where is Brian, anyway?

(FRANTIC SHOUTING)

Oh, thanks, Lois.

Dylan put this paper bag on my head

and I could not, for the life of me,

figure out how to get it off.

The kid's a sociopath.

Well, it's time
you laid down the law with him.

I couldn't agree more.

I am gonna kick him out of this house

faster than NASA kicked out
the Cocoa Puffs bird.

Okay, your physical exam was within range.

You aced the flight simulator.

I guess all that's left
is the psychological screening.

-Okay.
-How do you feel about this?

Ah, oh, my God, Cocoa Puffs.

No, that's not me anymore.

I'm just here to fly, sir.

All right, Dylan. You know what?
This isn't working out.

All right?
I don't care that I'm your father,

and you don't care that you're my son.

We don't have anything in common.

I think it's best
if you just get out of this house.

Fine. I hate it here anyhow.

Get out of my way.

BOTH: My pot! Your pot?

And then in chapter 28 of my novel,

the other pilots
finally trust the Japanese pilot

and let him... let him into... um...

their group.

Dude, that is an amazing story.

Hey. Hey, what if, um,

they were Korean pilots?

Yeah. Um, I'm not really
looking for notes,

but you know, Dylan,
I gotta tell you something.

I'm sorry I wasn't around
when you were growing up.

Don't. Just... just don't.

If I had known
having a son could be like this...

-How dare you?
-I didn't know!

You had no right, man. No right.

-It wasn't my fault.
-You weren't there for me.

Damn it, don't you think I wanted to be?

(BOTH SOBBING)

Shh. Shh. It's okay.

It's okay. Look,

I know I wasn't there for you, man.

for all those years, but...
that's gonna change.

It's gonna be different from now on.

And I'm gonna make you
into a better person,

starting first thing tomorrow.

Just passing through.
See anything you like, speak up.

Hey, there, everybody.

Was somebody looking for a son

with a bright new path to adulthood

and his very, very proud dad?

Oh, Dylan, you got a haircut.

Aren't you handsome?

From now on,
I plan on being a real father to Dylan,

and together, we are gonna turn
his life around. Right, champ?

You said it, Dad.

All right! You ready for school?

Yeah. Hey, can I drive today?

Oh, this kid! He's only 13.

I know. I was just kidding.

Oh. We got
a young Adam Sandler here, I think.

Right?

-Right?
-Yes.

-Bye, Mom.
-Bye!

All right, kids.
Have a good day at school.

Hey, Dylan. Have a great day at school.

Thanks, Dad. Hey. Knock-knock.

-Who's there?
-You're there.

I'll always be there, Dylan.

We interrupt this program
to bring you grim news

out of LaGuardia Airport,

where a 767 has been forced
to make a crash landing.

Oh, man, I tell you,
now that I'm a parent,

I can't even watch stories like that.

I just think, you know, I just think,

"Oh, my God,
what if Dylan were on that plane?"

Oh, my God, oh,
I just don't know what I would do.

I don't know what I would do.

Yeah, yeah, I understand.

-That'd be tough.
-Oh, oh, no. Oh, no.

No, no. No, no, no.

Quagmire, no. You do not understand.

Until you have a child...
Until you have a child,

you do not understand. Okay?

Damn it.

It's been like this all week.
Watch this...

Hey, Brian, what would you do
if Dylan fell out a window?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

I don't even want to think about that.

I don't even want to think about that.
Oh, God.

Oh, my God. Oh, no.

Brian, what would you do
if Dylan was in a fire?

Oh, my God. Oh, no.
Oh, my God. Oh, that's...

Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.

Knock on wood, knock on wood.
Knock on wood.

Oh, I can't hear any more of this.

Peter, your dog is giving me diabetes.

Oh, boy, you're not kidding.

I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's

had never even told him he had a kid.

Well, wait a minute, Peter.
Maybe that's the answer.

You just gotta
get his mother to take him back.

How the hell am I supposed to do that?

She's an idiot redneck, Peter.

Tricking her should be easier

than escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.

Can I go through here?

Just be back by bedtime.

Okay.

Lunch is ready, everyone.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Lois, Lois.

This is... this is white bread.

Yeah. So?

Well, don't we have any
of that whole-grain stuff?

No. This was cheaper.

I just... I just... I don't want
Dylan eating white bread.

Brian, there's nothing wrong
with it. Our kids eat...

(UNDER BREATH) Lois, Lois,
I do not want Dylan eating white bread.

Brian, I promise you, it's fine.

Lois. Lois, Lois.

I will decide what is best
for my child, all right?

Look, will you take it easy?

And, and, I do not want
to have this conversation

in front of my son.

Okay, you know what? That's it, Brian.

Feed him whatever you want.
Tell... tell you what.

Go up to my jewelry box,
take my gold jewelry.

Melt it down.
Make it into bread and feed him that.

That good enough?

Gold bread good enough for your Dylan?

Hey, everybody!

Look who's back to pick up her son.

This isn't<i> The Price is Right.</i>

You said we were going
to<i> The Price is Right.</i>

Peter. What the hell is this?

Mom, what are you doing here?

Tracy wants Dylan back.

Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?

-(VOMITS)
-What a joyous family reunion.

Isn't this great, Brian?

Now Dylan can go back with his mom,

and you can stop acting
like such a jackass.

So that's what this is all about, huh?

I must say, you have been

a little insufferable lately, Brian.

We just want the old you back, that's all.

Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have been

acting different lately, all right?

But that's only because
I've truly connected

with the one bit of flesh and blood

that I have on this earth.

And I have no intention of giving that up.

Who wants a half-and-half?

Oh, I'll throw my hat into that ring.

Wait a minute, Dad.

I think maybe I should go with her.

What? Dylan, why?

Look at her. She needs me...

a lot more than you do.

But we were just starting
to make a real connection.

Listen. I'll always be grateful to you

for turning my life around,
but now, thanks to you,

I finally have a chance
to transform my mom's life

in the same way you transformed mine.

Wow.

You know, I guess a dad
couldn't ask for more than that.

I'm proud of you, Dylan.

My life will never be
the same for knowing you.

Good-bye and...

good luck.

Good-bye, Dad.

Come on, Mom. Let's go.

Bye. Thanks for coming.

I'm gonna miss that boy.

You know, I just finally figured it out.

She looks like a really hot Tim Russert.

Right?

-Right?
-Yes.

-You're very polite.

You do not see that these days.

You do not see that. I like you.

-I like you.
-Oh, thank God.

You know, you never really know
what somebody thinks of you,

but I'm glad I made
a good first impression.

-Would you like to be friends?
-Like to be friends.

Oh, God, this is all going so smoothly.

What's your name? I'm Peter.

-Peter.
-No way! That's my name!

Hey, you should come home
and spend the night at my house.

Lois, will you make up the guest room?

Peter, that's someone's pet.
You can't just take it.

Well, maybe they never know it's gone.

Oh, Brian, I'm so glad you're okay.

Yes, he's doing fine.

We were able to clear
the stomach obstruction.

Turns out it was a used diaper.

-Ew!
-Gross!

-Oh, yes.
-Get off my back.

I thought it was Indian food.

Oh, thank you so much
for your help, Dr. Jewish.

I really thought we were gonna lose him.

It was my pleasure, Mrs. Griffin.

Go ahead and check out
with my intern, Anna.

ANNOUNCER: (ON TV)
<i>We now return to </i>Busy Business Lady

Whose Life Is Missing Something

But She Doesn't Realize It
Because She's So Busy With Business.

<i>No, no, I cannot make</i>
<i>that business meeting.</i>

<i>I've got a different</i>
<i>business meeting at 3:00,</i>

<i>and will be doing</i><i>business there.</i>

<i>I was wondering if</i><i>you're free for coffee.</i>

Oh, no, I can't!

I've got a lunch meeting,
and then a meeting after lunch,

-after that...
-Shh, shh, shh.

Over the next 90 minutes,
I'd like to show you

that all your problems
can be solved by my penis.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, guys, what is going on?

-No way!
-Cool!

That thing don't bite, do it?

Guys, say hello to Adrien Beaky.

-Pick a lane, bitch.
-Isn't that funny?

He heard me say that
on the way over in the car.

I gotta pee. Where's that Snapple bottle?

(LAUGHING)

I had a gay experience at camp.

(NERVOUS LAUGH) We... we had the radio on

and they were talking about
some goofy stuff.

So, what are you...
what are you guys drinking?

Hey, Peter, you kind of look like a pirate

with that thing on your shoulder.

A pirate? Ah, cool!

You should get a pirate name.

-And a peg leg.
-And a hook hand.

And you should have sex
with that crossing guard

even though she looked young
and then I found out she was 12.

I mean, you should get an eye patch.

Eye patch would be cool.

Mom, can we go back to the vet

and see the pretty vet assistant again?

Well, I guess, if Brian gets sick again.

Oh, boy! Hey, Brian, look!

(RETCHES)

Brian's sick. Mom, get your keys!

Chris, I'm not going to the vet.

Aha!

There's me wench!

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

That's Long John Peter to you, Porthole.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Fetch me five tankards of ale,

-and a leg of mutton for me maties!
-(SHRIEKS)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Who the hell are those guys?

Just a few sea dogs from
my fishin' boat days.

I don't care who they are, they stink!
Get 'em out of here!

They stink of good cheer, Lois!

-Aha!
-(ALL LAUGHING)

After we've had our fill
of bread and wine,

we shall tell tales of other times

we had our fill of bread and wine.

God, this is a more disturbing
sight than Tom Hanks and ET

in <i>Philadelphia.</i>

Ouch...

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
There you go, you're good.

You didn't touch me.

I don't wanna get AIDS.

(SCREAMING) Kristallnacht!

Aha!

'Tis Long John Peter
and his merry men come seeking plunder.

All your Tucks Medicated Pads be ours.

Aah! Oh, my God!

Oh, God, what are you doing?

Aha! For no reason,

I'm going to fire
this cannon all over your store.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Aha!

Terrible pharmacy toys.

We'll see to it that no child
ever receives these

as a last-minute gift
hastily bought on the way to the party.

(TOY SQUEAKS)

Dear me, it's almost 3:00.

I've got to get this shipment
of sugarcane, tobacco and spices

to the harbor before day's end.

That car is coming up awfully fast,

but at least it's flying the British flag.

Oh, no. Privateers.

No doubt they're after
my sugarcane, tobacco and spices.

Well, Shelley Boothbishop
isn't about to let you

over-egg this pudding.

Aha!

(ALL LAUGHING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Prepare to be boarded.

You'll never take my cargo.

(HORN HONKING)

Load the cannon.

(SCREAMS)

All clear, sir.

(WITH ENGLISH MILITARY CADENCE)
Shoot it again.

What? I didn't understand that.

I said "shoot it again,"
but I said it pirate-like.

(SCREAMING)

(HUMMING "RULE BRITANNIA")

(GURGLING)

Well done,
you barnacle-munching scallywiggers.

Sir, we've got a man down.

Oh my God! Adrien Beaky.

Say something.

Shoot... me.

Oh, God, this is my fault.

I did this.

I've screwed up worse
than Disney did when they cast

Michael J. Fox in that <i>Zorro</i> remake.

Who was that masked man who saved us?

I don't know, but he left his insignia.

Give it to me straight, Dr. Jewish.

Is he gonna live?

Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid
your parrot is dead.

No! (SOBBING)

Did he at least die with dignity?

Well, he convulsed a lot
and fell off the operating table.

Then he flopped around
a little on the floor,

and then a passing nurse
accidentally stepped on him

and kicked him into a puddle of urine.

Which must've frightened him,

because his bowels
released all over himself.

I tried to pick him up,
but then I got angry

because some of it got on my thumb,

so I threw him against the wall
and that's where he died.

That's the way I want to go.

I'm really sorry about your dad's parrot.

Oh, that's okay.

He'll get over it pretty quickly

and then move on to another wacky thing.

PETER: Lois, whose pipe organ is this?

My name's Anna.

Um... I'm Chris.

Sometimes I have to poop for a long time.

Now you say something.

(LAUGHS) You're funny.

But I bet a lot of girls
tell you that, huh?

Well, the only girl I know
is my sister, and she sucks.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Wow, we're having a conversation!

(CHUCKLES)

Listen, I have to get back to work,

but, um, would you maybe
want to go out sometime?

(YELLING) Yes!

Great. Here's my number.

Awesome!

Oh, no, I broke the pipe organ.

Hey, look, the deed to a cattle ranch.

So, um... how do you like
working at the vet?

Oh, it is so rewarding.

Ever since I was a little girl,

I have loved working with animals.

Did you ever make it with one of the dogs?

-What?
-I mean, uh, did you enjoy your appetizer?

It hasn't come yet.

Oh, um, I mean, did you ever
make it with one of the dogs?

No! Stupid!

Chris, just relax.

Um, okay.

(SIGHS) You know, Anna,
when I first saw you,

I thought you were the most
beautiful girl in the world,

and now all I want to do
is show you my innermost self,

but I'm afraid you'll reject me
because you won't like

what you see, or that
you'll see my scrotum,

and see that it has a seam on it,

and then you'll think
I'm made up of two different guys

that were sewn together,

'cause that's what
I think happened, and...

Chris, I like you.

You don't have to try so hard.

I'm sorry.

When I'm around a pretty girl,

I get all worked up like a kid
watching a toy commercial.

Hey, fellas!

Um, I have a question.

I went on a date with this
girl that I really like,

and if you don't mind,

I was hoping I could ask
you a few questions

about the birds and the bees?

Ah, my boy wants to know about sex.

Came to the right place.

Chris, what you always want to remember

is that sex is perfectly natural.

Whoa, uh, uh, sorry, Mr. Swanson.

Um, I wasn't really talking to you.

Chris, I know a lot about sex.

Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories,

but I was kind of
hoping to get some advice

from someone who isn't broken
from the waist down.

I'm a father!

You're a two-wheeled monster!

(SOBS)

That's gonna be my ring tone.

Quagmire, call me.

(RECORDING OF JOE SOBBING PLAYS)

(LAUGHS)

Well, I have to get to work, Chris.

I have tons and tons
of dogs to incinerate,

but I can't wait to see
you tomorrow night.

Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'll clean that up.

Oh, uh, that's okay. I'll get it.

Have fun at work!

Okay. Bye, Chris.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

-What do you think you're doing?
-What?

You, a man, are cleaning up a mess

made by Anna, a woman,

that she, also a woman,

-spilled on you, a man.
-So?

You're treating her like a human being.

If you want to get anywhere with a chick,

you can't treat 'em too nice-like.

-Really?
-Trust me, Chris.

The next time you see this girl,

treat her like crap, and you'll be cooler

than a mid-'80s novelty
answering machine message.

Chris, is everything okay?

You seem a little,

I don't know, quiet tonight.

Yeah, everything's fine.

Uh, yes, can I have two tickets,

one man and one bitch
that needs to do what I say.

What? That's not funny, Chris.

Here's your ticket. Pick that up!

Chris, why are you acting like this?

Pick that up and cook it
into something delicious

or knit it into something
that's useful to me!

(SOBS)

Um, are you ready to make out now?

Why in the world would I want to do that

after what you just said?

You're obviously
not the person I thought you were!

I never want to see you again!

I can't believe I thought
you were special!

-(ANNA SOBS)
-Anna, wait!

Oh, no!

What did I do?

Hey, Chris! Guess what we just did!

-Bonnie, tell him.
-We had sex.

-We had sex!
-We had what Joe calls sex.

Chris, honey, what's wrong?

-Anna took a dump on me.
-What?

Yeah, she broke up with me.

Oh, she dumped you.

That's what you meant to say.

What's the difference?

Well, what you said first was...

Well, I mean, when
two grown-ups love each other

very much, sometimes they show it by...

Never mind. So... so, what happened?

I don't know.

I did everything Dad said.

(SIGHS) I should've known Peter

had something to do with this.

You're not the first person

whose life he's screwed up.

Knock, knock.

Nicole? Ronald?

Who's ready for Boggle?

Oh, my God! No!

Why? Why?

My beautiful Nicole!

My man Ronald, who did this?

Oh, man, they were so good together!

We were just establishing our friendship.

They were about to get engaged.

Oh, he was going to ask me to be an usher.

I mean, he already had enough groomsmen,

so he made me an usher, but just to think

I could be involved
in the ceremony in any way.

You told Chris to act
like a jerk to this girl?

Well... define "Chris."

Peter, he's really upset right now.

I mean, he cared about this girl a lot.

Can't you see what you've done?

I don't know, I mean,
I thought I was helping.

But you may be right.

'Cause now Chris is all sad and crying

and fat and bad at sports.

Well, you created this mess,

and you have to help him fix it.

Man, parenting is more complicated

BOTH: Well, what do you know about that?

Hey, Chris, it's me.

-I got something for you here.
-What is it?

I caught you a bullfrog outside.

Poked some holes in its back
so it can breathe.

See, look at this...

Oh, boy.

All right, hang on, hang on.

I'm never gonna be happy again.

I know how you feel, son,
but you can't give up now.

Now, let's get out there
and meet some ladies, eh?

But I don't want to date anyone else.

I want Anna.

Chris, you don't want to miss out

on experiencing your teenage years.

If you do, you'll feel as bad as I do

when I miss the toilet.

LOIS: Peter Griffin!

All right, Chris, have a seat.

Your date'll be here any minute.

In fact, I think she'll
be coming through that door.

(FALSETTO) Hey, Chris. I'm Betty.

Sorry I'm late.

Your dad told me all about you.

You sound like a swell fella.

Uh... Thanks.

So, where are you from?

I'm from the rich part of town,
so you know I'm a good egg.

But I'm more interested in you.

-Did you finish your homework today?
-What?

You know, your dad's
got a birthday coming up.

Have you given any thought to
what you might be getting him?

How do you know when my dad's birthday is?

Well, that... It doesn't matter.

What are you getting
your dad for his birthday?

I don't know. A tie.

Ooh! I don't know if he
would want one of those.

I think he's got enough ties.

I think he might...

(NORMAL VOICE) Chris, I don't
want a tie! Pick something else!

Chris, this is Barbara,

the girl from your class
you used to have a crush on.

Now, you kids enjoy yourselves,
and I'll create some atmosphere.

Your blind date should be here by now.

She answered the ad.

Whoa!

So, still no luck on the girl front, huh?

I know Dad's been trying to help,

and I'm trying to listen to him,

but nothing seems to be working.

Well, I know I asked him to help,

but it occurs to me
that you've been taking advice

from everyone except
the one person who matters.

What do you want, Chris?

All I want is to go out with Anna again.

Then you just need to go talk to her

and tell her exactly how you feel.

But she said she never
wants to see me again.

Well, I'm sure you can
come up with some excuse

to see her at the vet.

Is there any more coffee?

Anna, I'm here with my dog.

He's not feeling well.

(BLEEP) you.

Don't you think you'd
rather go to another vet?

Anna, to be honest, I came here

'cause I wanted to apologize
for acting like such a jerk.

That's not who I am.

Oh, yeah, no, no, no.

Yeah, no, you're... you're a cool guy.

Brian, shut up!

Look, I was just really nervous

'cause I've never had a girlfriend before,

and I wanted to make sure
I didn't do anything wrong.

You know, you really hurt me, Chris.

I know. I was wrong.

-I don't want to hurt anybody, Anna.
-(THUDS)

Please. Just give me another chance.

Gosh! He doesn't look so good.

I know.

But you do.

You know, I get off at 4:00.

I might just be up for a movie.

Okay, somebody really needs

to help me here.
