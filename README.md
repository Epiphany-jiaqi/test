(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>

<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

<i>All the things that make us</i>

<i>Laugh and cry</i>

<i>He's a family guy</i>

Hey, everyone.

You'll never guess who I ran into
at the market just now.

Your hairdresser who's
almost dead from cancer?

Ross Fishman.

Your old boyfriend?
The one with the penis?

Peter, would you stop being so jealous?

-I dated Ross 20 years ago.
-That's right.

And that means he had you first, Lois.

I'll always be Scottie Pippen
to his Michael Jordan.

Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Jordan!

And Scottie Pippen.

MAN 1: He's also good.
Why didn't they do Jordan last?

MAN 2: Alphabetical?
MAN 1: Oh, right. That's smart.

You're smart. But still.

Peter, don't be ridiculous.

Ross' wife was with him, and in fact,

they invited us all over for dinner
tonight.

Oh, come on, Lois. I hate that guy.

I don't want to have dinner with him.

Hey! It's cooked food in another house.

That's exciting for life-over women
like me.

-We're going.
-All right, fine.

But I'm gonna stare at
his wife's boobs so hard

that when they both go
into the kitchen together,

it will be discussed.

(SIGHS) The cold car ride
through a dark, suburban night.

Look out the window
and think of death, kids.

It's a-coming.

Wow, Pam. Everything smells terrific.

Did you make all of this yourself?

`Yeah, I just got home from work,

put down the lawyer's briefcase,
and put on the chef's hat.

-You know how it is.
-Nah. She don't do nothing.

So, Peter, Lois tells me that
you're working at the brewery.

I think that's great. A real job.

Trading futures, that's not real.

But the money is unreal.

Hey. To real jobs.

That's it, Fishman. Shirts off.

-I want to see who's got bigger pecs.
-Peter!

Well, they look better when they're
oiled up.

Pass the salad dressing.

Oh, no, it's an almost-empty
squeeze bottle. Hang on.

It's all out.

There's dressing on that salad.
Give me that salad.

Yeah, who's the better man now, Ross?

Brian, what are you doing down there?

They didn't set a place for me.
Not a dog family.

Oh.

Go away.

Go away, you.

So, Ben, do you go to James Woods High?

(SCOFFS) No. I'm a junior
at The Meadows. It's a private school.

Oh, do they do it so right at The Meadows.

Class size is so small.

And they really know your child.
They care.

Mr. Wiggins rested his thing
on Jen Crosby's shoulder during a test.

Yes, I'm told James Woods High
leads the nation

in teacher-to-student thing resting.

Well, it's family that really matters,
and no family is closer than ours.

That's why we love taking trips together.

Here we are in Machu Picchu.

Is that the topless place in South
Attleboro?

I spat on a chick there at a work retreat.

Peter, just stop talking.

What? We've been places.
They ain't so great.

Well, this year is perhaps
our biggest trip ever.

We're climbing Mount Everest.

Oh, yeah? Is that right?

-Well, so are we.
-We are?

Peter, I highly doubt that.
I mean, no offense,

but it doesn't look like
your family would be up to the task.

I think he's right about that.

After all, we couldn't even
turn a double play.

All right, Griffins, on the ground,
we're going to second.

Let's turn two here.
Ground ball's a double play ball.

Play's at second. Let's look sharp.

Tough D. Tough D. Let's flash that
leather.

Head in the game. Play's to second.

This infield is the Great Wall of China.
Nothing's getting past us.

Good D behind you, Bri. Good D all around.

(SPEAKING WITH STEWIE'S VOICE) I'm okay,
everyone. Don't worry, I am okay.

My voice sounds weird,
this is weird, I know, but I feel fine.

Man, what a bunch of jerks.

Yeah, we should call Ross and tell him,

"This is the hospital,
and your mom's dead."

And then, he'll be like, "What hospital?"

And we'll be like, "Saint Up Yours."

And then, that's like, two jokes.

Look, I'm sorry, Lois.
I know we can't climb Mount Everest.

It's just, that guy really got to me,
and I wanted to stick it to him.

Will you call tomorrow
and make some excuse

that doesn't make me look bad?

Ooh, I know. Tell him I'm a
pathological liar

and that I've been under a lot of stress

because of the child rape charges
I'm facing.

-I think we should do it.
-What?

-Lois, you can't be serious.
-Oh, I'm dead serious.

You think I liked sitting there
pretending to be polite to those people

while they talked down to us like that?

Well, I'm sick of it.

I'm sick of this family
always feeling second-best.

I want to do something we can be proud of.

I want Stewie, Meg, and Chris
to grow up with some confidence.

Then don't buy our shoes at the car wash.

But climbing the world's
most dangerous mountain?

-Isn't that a little extreme?
-Maybe.

But if the Fishmans can do it, so can we.

Yeah, we're just as good as them
or any other family.

That's right.
You guys, we're climbing Mount Everest.

Let's do it!

Yay! I drank seven cups of coffee
at the Fishmans'.

(KNOCKING)

Oh, crap. It's Quagmire.
I don't want him knowing about this.

He's always trying to horn in
on our plans.

QUAGMIRE: Hey, what's going on?
You guys up to something?

Shh. Kids, don't move.

QUAGMIRE:
(TURNING KNOB AND KNOCKING) Hello?

So we're really doing this?
We're actually gonna climb Mount Everest?

How are you okay with this?

Well, if we make it to the summit,

I could pee there, and then it would be
mine.

'Cause the rule is, the highest pee wins.

Okay, gang, once we arrive in Nepal,

we'll get all the supplies we need
for the trip up Everest.

Okay, but remember, kids,

the people there have
never seen people before.

So when they walk up to you, quickly
stuff a dollar bill in their mouth.

Then you can pet them
as much as you want.

-Is that true, Dad?
-No.

Truth is, I don't know nothing
about this place.

I don't even know why it's called Nepal.

The mountains look like nipples.

Well, you can't just
call a country, "Nipples."

What about Nepal?

Ooh, I like that.

(LAUGHS) Shocker. God gets it right.

(CAR HORNS HONKING)

(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)

Okay, now, we gotta make sure
we've got all the provisions

before we head up to base camp.

'Cause I don't think there's
gonna be a Star Market

halfway up the mountain.

(LAUGHING)

-Oh, Mom.
-That's our local market at home.

Okay, let's split up

and meet in an hour
in front of The Yak Shack.

And my mom is pounding on the door,
and I'm like,

"Mom, don't come in here.
I'm yakking off."

MAN: Boo.

So, I've been carrying this
really promiscuous guide around,

and my back starts itching.

I go to the doctor,
turns out I got sherpes.

(PETER LAUGHS)

Yeah, I'll meet you guys here.
I'm just gonna be here.

Peter, I don't think we need
a donkey for this climb.

Of course we don't need a donkey, Lois.
It's a status thing here.

You, leather man. You sell me donkey.

I don't know what it is,

but you have got it.

(ALL GASP)

-Oh, my God.
-It's enormous.

Lois, this is probably a terrible time
to remember this,

but I think I might have
left the weed whacker on.

Well, look who's here.

I didn't believe you'd actually
follow through with this.

Oh, hey, Fishman.

Hey, listen, on a scale of one to 10,
how bad is the bathroom situation up here?

Like, 10 is a suite at the Four Seasons,

and one is a tied-up raincoat sleeve
at a party in your honor.

Yes, we're here, Ross.

When our family says that
we're gonna do something,

we follow through with it.

Yeah, in fact, not only are we gonna
climb it,

we are gonna beat you guys to the top.

(CHUCKLES) I seriously doubt that.

Oh, yeah? Well, so do I!

Yeah, so you watch it, Fishman.

We are gonna beat you so bad,

you'll think you gave Chris Brown an STD.

Is that what happened?

You're not gonna beat us to the top.

In fact, you probably
won't even climb Everest at all.

-You don't have the nerve.
-Like hell I don't.

Getting to the top, ahead of you,

is gonna be one of the
greatest moments of my life.

It might even beat graduating
from chiropractor school.

<i>Robert Baker.</i>

<i>Brad O'Bannon.</i>

<i>Anyone.</i>

Okay, the Fishmans are
heading up the North Face,

but I've been studying this map,

and I think we've got a better
chance of beating them

if we go up the South Face.

Oh, we don't need a map, Brian.
I got us a GPMS machine.

WOMAN'S VOICE: <i>Go up.</i>
<i>What do you think? Just go up.</i>

Sorry.

<i>Okay, can everyone just stop freaking out</i>
<i>and just give me, like, two minutes?</i>

(CRYING) <i>God!</i>

<i>Everyone's always yelling at me.</i>

<i>All the questions!</i>

All right, well, maybe we'll turn you
on later

and see how you feel.

She was so nice in the store.

Well, come on, everyone,
let's get started.

(STEWIE SHIVERING)

Brian, I'm not sure I can do this.

It's chillier out here than Angelina
Jolie. Something like that.

I don't know, I'm so cold.

She took that sad old lady's husband.

You're just gonna have to
block out the cold, Stewie.

Picture yourself in a warm place.

(INHALES) Okay, I think I can do that.

<i>Do you remember</i>

<i>21st night of September</i>

<i>Love was changing the mind of pretenders</i>

<i>While chasing the clouds away</i>

<i>Our hearts were ringing</i>

<i>In the key that our souls were singing</i>

<i>As we danced in the night, remember</i>

<i>How the stars stole the night away</i>
<i>Oh yeah</i>

<i>Say, do you remember?</i>

<i>Dancing in September</i>

<i>Never was a cloudy day</i>

-Do you want the heat on, sir?
-Yes, please.

Oh, my God.
How are we supposed to get across this?

We have to walk on those ladders?

Guys, be sure to look down the whole time.

It's really deep and freaky and
disorienting.

(SCREAMING)

(THUDS)

-Peter!
-Oh, my God!

Dad!

PETER: It's okay! There's a huge pile
of dead bodies down here

that cushioned my fall!

Do any of them seem like they have
any extra tampons in their backpack?

PETER: Uh, no!

"No," like you checked
and there aren't any, "no"?

Or "no," you're just assuming?

PETER: (STAMMERING) I'm embarrassed.

(SHIVERS)

Peter, you left the flap open.

It's like a thousand degrees in here,
Lois.

Close the tent now! It's freezing!

Headline. "Woman Cold."

(WIND WHISTLES)

My God. I think I see the Fishmans.

They're down on that ridge.
We're ahead of them.

Well, then let's keep moving.
You guys, we can do this.

We can beat them!

Hey, you know, I heard
when you drink at high altitude,

it hits you even faster.

(WHOOPING) Party! I love you guys!

You don't know how much you mean to me.

You think you're better than me?

Why can't you hit a curveball?

I've done nothing with my life.

Hey, cats, is everybody cool?

Sammy Davis Jr.?
What are you doing up here?

Whatever Frank tells me to do, man.

Hey, Sam, get back in here
and carry my golf clubs.

Yes, boss.

(LAUGHS)

Ew. Seems kind of racist, doesn't it?

No, no, 'cause Sammy's in on it.

Okay.

But he's still carrying the clubs.

This is so hard.

I can't do this, Mom.

Come on. Keep pushing, kids.
We're almost there!

I'm feeling nauseous.

I think I got altitude sickness.

Hey, Brian, you want a pukesicle?

I would love a pukesicle.

(GASPS) I can see the top of the mountain.

Let's move it!

We made it! I don't believe it!

We climbed Mount Everest!

Isn't it amazing, Brian?
You can see for...

Oh, you're doing your pee thing, right.

I don't really know what the point is.

I mean, there's no way
other dogs can smell this.

Trust me, Stewie. They'll know.

They'll know the world is now mine.

(SNIFFS)

Fark, no way.

Oh, my God, you guys.
I'm so proud of us all!

We made it!

We proved that we're not second-best.

Well, look who finally got here.

(STAMMERING) You beat us?

Don't feel too bad, gang.

We only beat you by one hour,
12 minutes and 43 seconds.

And, quite frankly, we're bored of it
up here.

So you guys enjoy it.
We're gonna head back down.

-I hate those guys.
-Yeah, me, too.

Come on. Let's head back down.

At least the hard part's over.

I'm not so sure about that.

You might want to
take a look at those storm clouds.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Oh, my God.

Yeah, it looks like it's closing in fast.

We're all gonna die!

All right, everyone get into a
hilarious pose,

so when they dig out our bodies,
they'll have a good laugh.

(CHUCKLES)

This guy's pretty funny.

This is terrible.
The storm keeps getting worse.

Mom, I can't even see!

And the scarf Brian called "A gay waste"
makes a rather important appearance.

-I'm so hungry.
-Me, too.

I don't know if I can keep going.

Peter, I still don't understand.

How the hell can we already be out of
food?

Didn't I tell you to bring Trail Mix?

Yeah, but by that I thought you meant

a set list of totally awesome tunes,
which I do have.

(SINGING) <i>I got the power!</i>

And after this, it's <i>Everybody Dance Now</i>

and after that, it's <i>Come Baby Come.</i>

That sounds like <i>Jock Jams.</i>

It is similar to <i>Jock Jams.</i>

It is <i>Jock Jams.</i>

You guys, look,
there's something up ahead.

I think it's a person.

Oh, my God, maybe they have food.

Maybe it's a rescue team.

Oh, my God, it's Ben Fishman.

-Is he...
-Yep. He's dead.

Oh, great. Not only are we
caught in this blizzard,

but there's some maniac up here
freezing people to death.

Oh, that poor boy.

We should bury him. It's only right.

Yeah, yeah, we should, Lois. You're right.

Or we could...

Could what?

-Eat him.
-(ALL GASP)

Brian!

Look, if we don't eat something soon,
we're all gonna pass out

from exhaustion
and freeze to death just like him.

Are we really considering this?

We're talking about eating a person.

Yeah, I'm not so sure about this.

Oh, I thought we decided. I'm sorry.

Well, I guess we don't have a choice.

I am oddly prepared for this.

Oh, God, Peter.

I hope Ben would forgive us for what
we did.

Look, we needed to eat,
the same way birds need to fly.

What do you mean, you don't
have our names on there?

My wife and I absolutely
have to be on this flight.

I'm doing the best I can, sir.

Do you have your confirmation number?

I think you'll find all the
information you need on here.

Sir, this is just a piece of paper
with the word "South" written on it.

Can I speak to your supervisor?

You guys, there's someone up ahead.

-Ben!
-Ben!

Oh, my God, it's the Fishmans.
They look terrible.

Have you seen Ben?

We lost him in the storm.

We're headed back up to find him.

I just hope he's not trapped
in some crevice somewhere.

Well, my gut tells me

he'll be squeezing himself
out of a crevice very soon.

Oh, we finally made it below the storm.

Look! I see base camp!

Yay! We're gonna be okay!

Wait! We have to go back.

What? What are you talking about?

Kids, your mom is clearly
delirious from the altitude.

I say we leave her behind

and marry that hot new assistant
from my work.

Look, Ben freezing to death was one thing.
We had nothing to do with that.

But we just let Ross and Pam
walk back up there,

probably to their deaths.

And you know what? That's not who we are.

We're the Griffins.
And you know how we win?

You know how we keep
from being second-best?

We do the right thing.

We go back up there and save them.

Tell me again why we ate a person
before we ate the dog?

(SIGHS) Your mom's right.

Let's head back up there.

Plus, if we don't rescue the Fishmans,

their Jewish god is just gonna sit there
and make us feel guilty.

You do whatever you want.

(SNIFFING)

Over here! I think I smell 'em.

Oh, my God! Look down there.

We got to get them out.
They'll die down there.

Well, we've got some rope.

Quick, Peter!

You're the only one strong enough
to carry two people.

(SCREAMS)

(STRAINING)

(GRUNTS)

(ECHOING) All right, I got 'em! Pull
me up!

(ALL STRAINING)

Peter, we can't do it.

You're too heavy.

PETER: Keep going. You're almost there.

I found a rock I like.

Griffins, I don't know how to thank you.

We never would have made it
without your help.

Oh, you would've done the same for us.

There are more important things
than a petty rivalry.

We're just happy that you're okay.

Well, thank you both. You saved our lives.

And Peter, I'll never
forget what you did for us.

You're a good man.

All right, you rest up, get better,
we ate your son.

Bring it up.

We got guns. You got hoses.

See you on the softball field.

Over here is our kitchen,
where we make all our meals.

And upstairs is where we sleep.

What about your wives and families?

Sometimes we don't see them
for long periods of time.

Thanks for understanding
that we can't do anything.

Hey, Chris, you think it's safe

Why not, Dad? It's just water.

All right. Well, turn it on.
I'm very thirsty.

Nice job, Chris. You got my shirt wet.

Now, few people realize that until 1928,
there were no hoses,

with your bare hands.

And what was that beginning,
middle and end part again?

Um, this Nielsen box will keep
track of everything you watch,

which helps us generalize
the viewing habits

of millions of Americans.

Is there any way you can
describe that to me

using colorful puppets of some sort?

The Nielsen box will monitor
your viewing habits.

(SNICKERS)

I don't like the left puppet.
His chin is scary.

Well, thanks for your cooperation.
If you have any questions, please call me.

-And welcome to the Nielsen family.
-Thank you very much.

Well, isn't this exciting.

I know.
I can't believe we're a Nielsen family.

I never get picked for anything.

(GUNSHOTS)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

-(GUNSHOT)
-(GRUNTS)

All right, everyone.
Time to do our Nielsen duty.

So, what are we gonna watch?

-Boobs.
<i>-Project Runway.</i>

<i>-The Good Wife.</i>
-That black version of our show.

You know, guys, this is a real opportunity
to promote quality programming.

I think we should watch PBS.

Yeah, you're real passionate about PBS.

You donated once five years ago
and they sent you a mug.

And now the mug's so old
that the "P" has been worn off

so it just says "BS"

It's libtards like you that are screwing
up our country

(KNOCKING)

Tom Tucker? What are you doing here?

Well, I heard you're the new Nielsen
family.

Just hoping you plan to watch
the Channel Five news.

I don't know. I've missed so many.
It's gonna take me forever to catch up.

Well, we'd sure love
to have you as a viewer.

Is there anything we can do
to make the news more appealing to you?

Maybe.

-I guess you could lose the moustache.
-Lose my moustache?

Well, gosh, I don't know.

My birthmark makes it kind of tough.
Always caused me problems at my old job.

<i>And that'll do it for us here</i>
<i>at Channel 12 News.</i>

<i>Make sure you turn those clocks ahead.</i>
<i>Good night, St. Louis.</i>

Yeah, I don't know,

I was never that crazy about the
moustache.

Well, I suppose I could lose it
and just use more makeup.

Yeah, that'd be cool.

And maybe a festive hat
would make things more festive.

All right, this is good.
Any other suggestions?

Yeah, can you end each show

by trying to pull-start a very cold
chain saw?

Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

All right, thank you for being so candid.

Hey, thanks for listening.

I know how hard it is to take criticism.

Hey, nice boots, Griffin.

They sell men's shoes where you got those?

PETER: <i>You made a commitment</i>
<i>to these boots, Peter.</i>

<i>These boots are the new you,</i>
<i>and no one will shake that.</i>

Yee-haw, ride 'em, cowgirl.

<i>Okay, you can take the boots off at lunch.</i>

<i>Go to the gym. Have a workout.</i>
<i>Come back in your sneakers.</i>

<i>If anyone asks,</i>
<i>you forgot the boots in your locker.</i>

<i>Just make it to lunch.</i>

Those boots are made for walkin'.

Up to guys' butts.

(LAUGHING)

-Hey, fellas.
-Hey.

TOM: <i>Good evening, Quahog.</i>

<i>Tonight, Channel Five mourns the loss</i>
<i>of a dear colleague.</i>

<i>My moustache.</i>

<i>And as per the wishes of my moustache,</i>

<i>his ashes were sprinkled</i>
<i>off the coast of Acapulco,</i>

<i>where he was born.</i>

<i>Well, that'll do it for us here.</i>

<i>Thanks for watching Channel Five,</i>
<i>the most trusted name in news.</i>

(SPUTTERS)

<i>Oh, crap.</i>

(SPUTTERS)

<i>Oh, come on.</i>

(SPUTTERS)

<i>Ugh, let's go, Tom.</i>

(SPUTTERS)

(GRUNTS) <i>Work, damn it.</i>

What the hell?
What's going on with the news?

-This is terrible.
-Yeah, has he lost his mind?

Well, I'll be damned.

If I knew he was gonna do
all that stuff I told him,

I would've told him more stuff.

What? Peter, you told him to do this crap?

Yeah, he came to my house

when he found out I was a Nielsen family.

Asked what I wanted to see.

Hey, hey, you know what would be cool?

If he did the news
with a family of prairie dogs,

and whenever he said something sad,

they'd pop their heads up, all concerned.

Peter, you sure that's such a good idea?

People rely on the local news to
provide them with several stories a year

on how saltwater taffy is made.

Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family,

it seems like you should maybe be a
little more thoughtful with your choices.

What are you talking about?
I'm just having a little fun.

For God's sakes, I've just been handed
the coolest freaking toy on the planet.

Well, you know, except for
<i>Hungry Hungry Alec Baldwins.</i>

Hey, I'm not even touching the lever.

<i>Chilling news from Long Island Sound,</i>

<i>as a four-passenger prop plane</i>
<i>on its way to East Hampton</i>

<i>spun into the surf off Montauk Point.</i>

<i>There were no survivors.</i>

Oh, that's so great,
I just called him on the way home.

Peter, I'm not sure
this is entirely responsible.

I don't see what the big deal is.

I was just trying to make the show better.

Hell, I wish I could do it with all the
shows.

Yeah, well, you only have one Nielsen box.

You don't have the clout
to affect national shows.

Damn it.

I guess that means I'll never get to see
an episode of <i>Superman</i>

where Clark Kent and Lois Lane
finally get together.

Lois, I love you,

and I want there to be
no more secrets between us.

I am Superman.

Oh, my God.

The only thing that can kill me is
kryptonite.

Or latex.

Or lambskin.

-What about polyurethane?
-All that. All that stuff.

(KNOCKING)

Hi, folks. Just thought I'd stop by

and make sure your equipment
is working properly

and see if you have any questions.

Yeah, is something wrong with our remote?

No matter how low I turn the volume,

Aziz Ansari is always shouting at me.

What did I do?

Thank you. I think we're good.
Everything seems to be going well.

Okay, great.

Well, I'm just gonna change out the card
on your unit real quick,

and I'll be on my way.

(CLATTERS)

Well, we're all set. Thanks for your time.

No, thank you, pal.

And hey, you've been working hard.

Why don't you take the rest
of the day off?

Here's two tickets to
Sandra Bernhard's one-woman show.

-Wow, thanks.
-Yeah, and they're great seats.

They're right in the gap of her teeth.

Social media?

More like a social disease.

Ha! That's funny.

Peter, what the hell's going on here?

Lois, we're no longer one Nielsen family.

We're 100. More boxes, more power.

And I got some ideas to make TV better.

(TOUCHTONES BEEPING)

(RINGING)

Hello, <i>Mad Men</i> production office.

Yeah, Peter Griffin here.
Could I speak with Jon Hamm, please?

-One moment.
-(BEEPS)

(RINGING)

-Hello?
-Hello, Jon Hamm?

Peter Griffin, Nielsen family.

Listen, did I catch you at a good time,

or are you and the critics busy
yanking each other off right now?

-Excuse me?
-Look, your show is really boring.

But don't worry, I got some ideas
on how you can jazz it up.

Listen, I don't need your suggestions,
pal.

I've been a big celebrity
for a year and a half now.

Okay, if that's how you're gonna be.
We'll see how this plays out.

Lois, we're not watching <i>Mad Men</i> no more.

(PHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-Look, I may have been a little rash.

Our ratings have dropped 50%.

Whatever suggestions you have,
I'll listen.

And so, gentlemen, in baseball,
three strikes and you're out.

But three Lucky Strikes...

And you're in.

Nice try, Don.

But I'm afraid we're going to
have to take our business elsewhere.

Oh? I don't think so.

(PLAYING STAR WARS THEME)

What the hell was that?

I'll tell you what it was, Lois.
It was awesome.

And wait till you see <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

I don't know what it was,
but now it's on roller skates.

Hi, NBC, this is Peter Griffin.

Listen, you guys are doing a great job.

If anybody knows what America
wants in the '90s, it's NBC.

But I just have one small request.

I like <i>Dateline,</i>

but I really hate waiting two hours
to find out who the killer is.

MAN: <i>Tonight on</i> Dateline,
<i>a woman murdered.</i>

<i>Was it her ex-boyfriend?</i>

<i>Yes, it was.</i>

I knew it. I knew it was the ex-boyfriend.

<i>"Sleep tight, truck.</i>

<i>"Sleep tight, firefly.</i>

<i>"Sleep tight, chair.</i>

<i>"Sleep tight, bird."</i>

<i>You see that, Peter? You see the bird?</i>

Bird.

<i>Okay, we'll pick up the rest tomorrow.</i>

<i>Now, I'm just gonna vamp for</i>
<i>a while with some random noises.</i>

Hee-hee!

(MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY)

(MAKING RANDOM NOISES)

<i>-Okay, good night, Peter.</i>
-Good night, Dave.

DAVE: <i>And here's Paul</i>
<i>to play you to sleep with a lullaby.</i>

PAUL: (SINGING) <i>Hey, lullaby</i>

<i>Oh, lullaby</i>

<i>Hey, you lullaby...</i>

Stop, no, stop. Stop.

I forgot, he's terrible.

MAN: (ON TV)
<i>We now return to</i> Cops With Banana Guns.

<i>Freeze.</i>

<i>Is that... Is that a banana?</i>

<i>Don't worry about what it is. </i>
<i>I'm still a cop.</i>

<i>Whoa, hold on.</i>

<i>All right, just take it easy.</i>

<i>This can go a couple of ways.</i>

What the hell did Peter do to <i>Cops?</i>

Bonnie. Come push me out in a huff.

Peter, what is this show?

It's called <i>Creeping up on the </i>
<i>Kardashians.</i>

See that guy with the ponytail
in the background?

He sneaks up and scares the girls

while they're starting businesses
or getting their fat waxed.

(ALL SCREAM)

What the hell?

(CROWD YELLING)

There they are. That's the Nielsen family.

You ruined television.

Now it's just a big, old, silly mess.

Oh, God. An angry mob.

I've got to swallow all my valuables
and get out of here.

Did you see the mob?

Did I see the mob? Why else am I here?

Oh, my God, Peter, they're really angry.

Say something.

Wait. What the hell's going on?
What do you mean, I ruined television?

You put a real cougar on <i>Cougar Town,</i>

and now that cougar's dead

because Courteney Cox ripped it
apart with her teeth and claws.

You turned <i>Anderson Cooper 360</i>
into <i>Anderson Cooper 720.</i>

He's turning around too much.

You converted <i>The Biggest Loser</i>
to the metric system.

Now it feels like they're not losing
enough.

The hell with you guys.

You're just jealous
'cause I get to say what's on TV now.

I am a Nielsen god.

(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)

Sorry, y'all. That's the first time
I ever throwed anything.

Well, if it isn't Mr. Nielsen himself.

Nurse, who's the worst
doctor in this hospital?

You are, Dr. Hartman.

Good. Put Hartman on this bozo.

Hey, what can I do for you?

Please, Doc, you got to
help me with this nasty gash.

What seems to be the problem?

No, it's my husband.

Well, you've got a lot of nerve
coming in here

after what you did to television.
Now, get out.

Please, Doctor, you've got to help him.

You took an oath when
you went to medical school.

I took a lot of things when
I went to medical school.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to answer this.

Hello? Ah, Hartman.

Hey, guys. How you doing?

-Not so good, Peter.
-Yeah, me either.

Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland.

You know how I know that phrase?

I read it in a book, you monster!

Come on, let me make it up to you.
Let me buy you a beer.

No, that seat's taken. Move along, Peter.

What are you talking about?
You guys are my pals.

We used to be, Peter. Now, scram.

Well, fine, I'll sit at the bar.

Not at my bar, you won't. Get out of here.

Geez, I can't show my face anywhere.

I might as well be back doing
public radio.

<i>This is Peter Griffin,</i>

Hey, what's wrong, Peter?

I miss my friends, Brian.

I mean, I was having fun
with those Nielsen boxes,

but what's the point

if I don't got Joe and Quagmire
to enjoy it with me?

I guess I shouldn't have
messed with television.

Well, it's not exactly your fault.

The networks never should have
listened to you in the first place.

This is exactly what makes bad television.

Pandering to the lowest
common denominator.

So what do I do, Brian?

Well, you still have these boxes.

That means you still have the
power to influence television.

Maybe you can use that power
to help restore TV to the way it was.

You're right, Brian.
Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows,

that'll help get things
back to the way they were.

We can use these boxes for good and...

(GUNSHOTS)

What the hell?

That's for adding another tree
to <i>One Tree Hill.</i>

Oh, my God, he destroyed every last box.

-Holy crap.
-We're sunk now, Peter.

There goes your one chance
to get TV back to the way it was.

Wait a minute. Maybe not, Brian.

-(DINGS)
-I think I just got an idea.

-(SHATTERS)
-(SCREAMS) I got glass in my face.

Oh, crap. Now I forgot what it was.

-(DINGS)
-I got it.

-(SHATTERS)
-(SCREAMS) Son of a bitch.

You know who I hate? The troops.

Yeah, me too.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you?

I'm Peter Griffin.

I'm the guy who ruined television,
and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it.

Guys. I broke television,
and now you have to help me fix it.

Yeah-ha!
Looks like this is one we beat you to.

Gentlemen, I have
gathered you all here today

because you are the creators
of what television used to be

before I ruined it.

And we need to rebuild
television from the ground up.

So, I'm gonna need all your best ideas.

J.J. Abrams,
you take wonder and complexity

and present it in a way that
no one can possibly understand.

-What do you got?
-I've got an alien

that goes back in time

and encounters a koala bear
in an Eastern European town.

Totally confused. Do it.

Okay, now, we're gonna need
15 workplace comedies

where people talk to the camera
for some reason.

You, you, you and you. Go.

When Peter told me to make
a workplace comedy

where people talk to the camera,
I thought...

Not now. I mean, go do a show.

Don't do that thing here.

Huh, wonder if I can pull off one of those

can-you-believe-what-I have-to-put-up-with
looks to the camera.

Okay, Mark Burnett, you did
<i>Survivor</i> and <i>The Apprentice.</i>

Can you give me a reality show
where people do horrible,

unforgiveable things to each other

for embarrassingly small sums of money?

I got some ideas.

Here's a nickel, pull down your pants.

There's a show.

Yeah-ha! Go.

All right, now, who's gonna make a show
about horrible New Jersey freaks?

You know what? I don't care.
Just, someone do it.

Okay, Dick Wolf,
make the same <i>Law & Order</i> six times.

And also, could you marry Matt Weiner,

'cause I want your name to be Dick Weiner.

Okay, but can I go by Dick Wolf-Weiner?

Oh, my God, yes. Yes. Yes.

Okay, Bravo people,
go find women fighting.

No, you know what, just find women.
They'll end up fighting.

All right, everyone who's left,
make a talent show.

We are done.

Oh. Kelsey Grammer,
what are you still doing here?

I have nothing left for you. I'm sorry.

Ah! Then I shall take my ease
on the Lanai.

I don't care what you do now.

Oh, that's okay, Peter.

So, what do you say? Are we pals again?

-Of course we are.
-You bet.

Well, let's drink to having TV

Yeah, Brian's right.

You know, there's lots of
big Hollywood celebrities

who have gone bald with dignity.

John Travolta, David Spade,
Nicolas Cage, Jeremy Piven.

And besides, don't you think
you'll be happier

Everybody knows now anyway.

Great. Trust me.

-I don't want to talk about it.

That's from a song.

-Is that all?
-Yeah.

Is there an age restriction

for the sleight-of-hand magic show
this afternoon?

-Twelve.
-Oh...

Maybe I'll just stand in the hallway
and look in.

Now, we all saw you put
your card back in the deck.

So how did it end up in your shirt pocket?

Oh, my God, how did he do that?

Oh, no, there's Quagmire.

He's been so weird lately.

You notice now that he's bald,

whenever he thinks about something,
he scratches his wrist?

Hey, Quagmire, we got a pitcher.
You want a beer?

Eh, I don't think so.

I was planning on looking
at pictures of birds later,

and I don't want to be
all fuzzy-headed for that.

-Listen, Quagmire, we hate you now.
-Yeah, you used to be fun.

Yeah, now you're always
either preparing for a colonoscopy,

or just coming back from a colonoscopy.

The fuck's going on down there?

Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

Come on, we want our buddy back.

I'm not putting that toupee
on again, Peter,

so I'm not sure what you want me to do.

You could get a hair transplant.

Oh, yeah. Like one of those guys
pretending to get out of the pool.

-That looks all right.
-Yeah, come on, Quagmire.

Get the hair transplant. Come back to us.

You're right. This isn't me.

Baldness is for women's crotches,
not men's heads.

There you go, that's pretty gross.

Yeah, that's the spirit, Quagmire.

Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up
with me the last couple weeks.

Hey, no problem. You put up with me
when I was barefoot guy.

Boy, nothing like a beer
with the fellas, eh?

Peter, would you mind
putting on some shoes?

Oh, you mean foot prisons? Yes, I would.

Glenn Quagmire?

Why does that name sound familiar?
Oh, yeah, I treated you for butt flu.

Hey, you want to keep it down?

Easy now. That's my privilege
as a doctor to talk about that stuff.

How's it going, Dr. Kamada?

Bob!

Matty.

Oh, hiya, Rachael.

Oh, hey, Dr. Geller.

Sarah.

Jim.

Merianna.

-Geez, Joe.
-Yeah, I come here a lot.

All right, I'm gonna hit the john.

Good. Me and Joe can stay here
and tell secrets.

I'm wearing my dead
grandmother's panties.

DOCTOR: I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

but the cancer is terminal.

If you're lucky,
you've got two weeks to live.

I understand.

Oh, my God! Carter's dying?

I now declare this hair transplant
officially over!

-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, he's back!

You look great, Quagmire.

(BEEPING)

Oh, my God.
One of my patients on Two has been shot.

-Hey, Stewie.
-Um, hey, what's up?

Were you...
Were you just looking at Rollerblades?

What? No. Yeah, who cares?
What do you want?

Listen, I was at the hospital earlier,
and I heard something I wish I hadn't.

Oh. Please do not tell me
it was a sexist remark,

because that is not okay.

You know, those nurses
are busting their asses,

weighing people
and seeing how tall they are.

Stewie, I heard a doctor tell Carter
he has two weeks to live.

What? Are you sure?

I saw it with my own eyes.

I gotta check this out.

Oh, my God, you're right! He looks awful.

(MONITOR BEEPING)

Wait, how are we seeing this?

Oh, I've got a nanny cam
hidden inside his house.

Watching him nail his cleaning woman
is how I'm learning Spanish.

Although I'm not sure what
the Spanish word "no" means,

because it doesn't seem to mean
the same thing as it does here.

And the worst part is,
I don't think Lois even knows he's sick.

Oh, this is going to destroy her!

Just thinking about it makes me all giddy,
like a group of women ordering dessert.

And then we have
a chocolate, chocolate cake

that's infused with chocolate
served with chocolate ice cream

and a molten chocolate topping.

We'll have one of those with four spoons.

More like four of those
with one spoon for me!

(LAUGHING)

-Oh, hi, Brian.
-Hey, Lois.

Listen, I have something
I need to tell you,

but it might be difficult for you to hear.

-What is it?
-Lois,

-I think your father is dying.
-What?

Ha!

Brian, what are you talking about?

Well, yesterday at the hospital,
I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer,

and that he has two weeks to live.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Daddy!

Yeah, I feel really horrible for you,
and I hate to do this,

but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie,
and it's, like, 4:40 now,

and so if I'm gonna make it,
I have to leave, like, now.

Yeah, this stinks,

but I've already blown this guy off,
like, twice, so...

I've been trying to call my parents
all day, and I can't get ahold of them.

I'll tell you, this obituary
came out great.

"Carter Pewterschmidt died today
of the disease cancer.

"In lieu of flowers, please send
carnival rides to Peter Griffin

"at 31 Spooner Street."

If we get just one ride out of this,
it will have been a success.

Lois? What are you doing here?

Mom, I've been trying to get ahold of you.
Is Daddy okay? Where is he?

Oh, he's fine, dear,
but now's not a good time.

He's very busy.

Look, I know something's going on.
I want to see him.

Daddy?

-Well, look who's here!
-Daddy! You're okay!

-Of course I'm okay! Why wouldn't I be?
-Well, Brian said you were dying!

And I finished a book!

I promised myself I'd work that in.
I might've jumped the gun.

I didn't finish it.

I'm so glad you're all right.

Brian, how could you get us
all worked up like that?

Yeah, shame on you!

Oh, you're gonna get it, Brian.
You are gonna get it when I drink.

What the hell's going on?

Last night, Carter was on his deathbed,
and now he looks better than he ever did.

Well, they say laughter
is the best medicine.

Maybe he went to a comedy club
or something.

(LAUGHING)

In my neighborhood,
we didn't have no Kool-Aid.

We had food coloring and water.

-Mama used to call it "Fool-Aid."
-(LAUGHING)

CARTER: No, I don't get that.

And everybody had an Uncle Earl.

You know, that uncle that sit around
in the house all day in his under-drawers

saying he between jobs.

To be between jobs, you had to have
had a job in the first place!

-(LAUGHING)
-CARTER: That's accurate!

And Earl got that cell phone.
He on the Sprint plan.

When the bill come, he sprint.

CARTER: Yes! So many of them
are delinquent in payment.

Rupert, move your legs.
I can see your balls.

Stewie, this is gonna sound crazy,

but I have a theory
about what's going on with Carter.

-Really? What is it?
-Well, think about it.

If Carter Pewterschmidt,

the dynamic chairman
of Pewterschmidt Industries,

were to fall ill or even die,
the stock price would plummet.

I don't want you to think
I'm not listening,

-but when's Christmas?
-Not for a while.

But what I'm saying is, I think
Carter is sick or possibly even dead,

and that the man we saw today
was an imposter

brought in to keep
Pewterschmidt Industries' stock price up

and to keep people from knowing the truth.

Boy, you are just gonna keep on talking

with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth,
aren't you?

-Anyway, what are you suggesting?
-We can follow him,

see if he's really Carter.

Okay, but I got to be home by 7:00.

I'm supposed to talk to the police
about that shooting I witnessed.

Good Lord, are you all right?

If I die, leave two dollars'
worth of flowers right here.

Here's my fourth grade class photo.
Lean it against a cheap candle.

-Should I call an ambulance?
-No. Call Channel Nine.

And have a gap-toothed woman say, quote,
"He never bothered nobody."

Okay, if this guy is an imposter,

he's gonna have to do
everything Carter normally does.

We just have to wait
and see if he slips up.

All right, here he comes now.

All right, Stu, now, if we can just...

-No.
-What?

You know what you did.

Hey, wait a minute.
If this is an imposter,

then this guy we're following
never had cancer.

-Yeah, so?
-Well, you're a dog.

Can't you just sniff cancer?

No, that's just a myth we started so
we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs.

(SIGHS)
It's nice to have a clean bill of health.

Well, for now.
The key is weekly follow-ups.

You know, cervical cancer
is also a problem.

My boyfriend thinks
he might have prostate cancer.

Nope, doesn't.

Okay, now we've got him.

The real Carter
would never go to a Starbucks.

He thinks they're too liberal
and pretentious.

-Coffee for Brent.
-(CHUCKLING)

Latte for Cecil.

(CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

-Beanie?
-(LAUGHS)

None of those people are real.

I'm stealing all your sugar packets
and napkins.

Woodstock's over, assholes.

Wow. You certainly look a lot better
than that walking corpse I saw last week.

Well, no one's ever gonna see that again,
I can promise you that.

I can't stress how important it is
our secret be kept from the public.

I understand, sir.

And I assure you that Specimen Z
is secure on level 12.

Did you hear that, Brian?

That "walking corpse"
was Carter dying of cancer.

-This guy is an imposter.
-Oh, my God.

And I bet Specimen Z
is the real Carter's body.

You two didn't hear that, did you?

BRIAN: Hey, buddy, we're just trying
to read the paper here.

I'll have you fired
for talking to me like that.

BRIAN: I don't work here.

-Then I'll have you killed.
-BRIAN: I want to die.

I hated that guy back there.

Okay, this is level 12.

There's the lab.
Let's get in there and find Carter's body.

Oh, crap, there's a keypad.

We're just gonna have to try
and figure out the code.

When's his birthday?
I think it's in March.

Stewie, are you crazy?
That's so loud. The guards will hear.

-Don't worry about it, Brian.
-MAN: Hey, what's going on down there?

-Nothing.
-All right.

All right, now, where would they keep
a dead body in a pharmaceutical lab?

(GASPS) Brian, look.

That's it. I bet he's in there.

Oh, my God!

Specimen Z isn't Carter's body.

-What is it?
-Specimen Z is a cure for cancer.

Carter didn't die. He cured himself.

-Hold it right there.
-(BOTH GASP)

Damn it, Brian. You broke into my lab.
And you didn't wear a suit.

-Hey, why didn't he have to wear a suit?
-See what you've started now?

Carter, you found a cure for cancer?

Well, I didn't come up with it.
A couple of eggheads I hired did.

One of them's a Chinese.

Boy, I don't like those people.

But holy crap,
wind them up and watch them go.

How long have you had this?

I don't know. When was that
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out?</i> song?

You've had this since 1999?

You know when
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out?</i> came out?

It's a song about dogs
and letting them out.

I could have you arrested
for breaking in here.

Carter, you've discovered
the holy grail of modern medicine.

Why the hell would you
keep it buried like this?

I'll tell you why.

Because there's far more money
to be made

in treating a disease than in curing it.

Why cure someone of cancer in a day
if we can treat them for a lifetime

and bill them every step along the way?

What? That's insane.

Brian, it's so cold in here,
look how big my nips are.

They're almost like a woman's.

Oh, look, I'm tugging at them
and they're getting even bigger.

Carter, what you're doing
here is criminal,

and I'm gonna tell
the whole world about it.

Is that right? Who's gonna believe you?
The Internet?

You'll be just another nut-job,
left-wing blogger.

-Security!
-MAN: Everything's fine.

No, it isn't. Get in here.

(GRUNTS) Damn it! You bastards!

I don't know
why you're surprised by this, Brian.

Big corporations never tell the truth.

Look at the Kleenex industry.

Well, we had another good quarter.

I guess a lot of people
are sneezing out there.

Jerry, I'm going to let you in on
something, and it can't leave this room.

Our research shows the primary use
of our product is sperm.

-What?
-Yeah, and brace yourself for this.

The second biggest use
is women crying about nonsense.

-But I thought sneezing was...
-Jerry, Jerry, it's sperm and nonsense.

I can't believe Carter
would sacrifice millions of lives

just to protect corporate profits.

Well, don't be too upset.

Old Stewie here snagged
a little souvenir on his way out.

Oh, my God, Stewie.
You got the cancer cure.

How'd you manage to steal it?

It was easy. I just took it
while you guys were yammering on.

I swear, I felt like I was waiting
for Lois to get off the phone.

That is amazing. All right, Bonnie.
Well, it was good talking to you.

No way. She did? When did she say that?

You know what? That doesn't surprise me.
That's how she is.

Okay, then. Okay. Okay. Okay.
All right, I'll see you Tuesday.

Oh, no. What happened?

(GASPS) That's terrible.
Oh, my God, just awful.

Well, you give them my best.

Okay, I got to go.
Stewie and I are headed out to the beach.

Oh, I didn't tell you?
He's learning to swim.

Oh, I got him the cutest swim trunks.
At Kohl's.

You've never been to Kohl's?
Well, let me tell you about Kohl's.

(SIGHS)

All right, well, you know
the mall with the Chili's?

It's across the street.

-(GUN FIRES)
-(WOMAN SCREAMS)

Bonnie? Bonnie, are you there?

-What happened?
-STEWIE: Let's go!

Oh, there you two are.

Lois, there's something incredible
I have to tell you.

And there's something incredible
I have to show you.

I learned how to do a somersault.

Did I do it?

-There he is.
-Crap.

Daddy? What's going on here?

Brian here has stolen something
very important from me.

Give it to me, Brian.

Lois, your father has a cure for cancer,

but he won't release it
because it's not profitable.

So I stole it.

-Daddy, is this true?
-Yeah. So what?

So I found the cure for cancer
and didn't announce it.

Big deal. I also took a dump today
and didn't issue a press release.

Oh, that's interesting, because I did.

Good for Peter.

It's about time the media
covered something positive.

Daddy, you're the chairman
of a billion dollar company.

You've got more money than anyone
could ever spend in one lifetime.

Are you challenging me
to a <i>Brewster's Millions?</i>

Is money all that you care about?

What if somebody close to you got cancer?

What if the maid who raised you

'cause your parents were
too wealthy and busy got cancer?

-You mean Mamie?
-Yeah.

What if Mamie got cancer?

Mamie's not getting cancer!

Or how about one of us?

What if I got cancer or, God forbid,
one of your grandchildren?

For once in your life, do the right thing.

All right, pumpkin. I'll do it.

I'll do it for you.

You will? You promise?

Yes.
I'll make the announcement tomorrow.

Oh, Daddy. Thank you so much.
You're my hero.

Oh, that's her father?

<i>Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Our top story, a big announcement</i>

That's it? What the hell?
Where's the cancer cure announcement?

That son of a bitch went back on his word.

-CARTER: <i>Hello?</i>
-Daddy.

We're all sitting here in front of the TV
awaiting the big announcement.

Remember the one
that's gonna benefit all mankind?

The one you promised
to make for me, your daughter?

<i>-I lied.</i>
-(HANGS UP)

Lois, you can't stay mad at him.
He's rich and successful.

-It doesn't excuse what he did.
-It'll be fine.

He'll just do a magazine cover
with a wink to who he is,

and all will be forgiven.

Oh, Daddy.

I know. If he's such a bad guy,
why's he on a magazine?

-Hi there.
-Hi. I'm Cindy.

The only way I believe I'm pretty
is if strangers have sex with me.

Well, maybe I could help
fill you up with self-confidence.

Brian.

-Hello there, sexy.
-Hey, do you mind?

We were having a conversation.

My house has 8,000 square feet,
zero bookshelves.

Wow, that's impressive.

I'm a writer, published twice.

I own a cinder block yard.
Have over 12,000 cinder blocks.

If you ever need cinder block,
I can get you good price.

Thank you.

I have a six-CD changer,

so you can pretty much
fill the tray and create a world.

Come have sex with me.

My mother will make you
farkshekoosh when we are done.

Okay.

Wait!

I have a time machine.

You do?

-Yeah, you want to see it?
-Yes, I want to see it.

Better luck next time, pal.

Some people got moves, others don't.

Been that way forever.

You. Me. Sex.

Him legend.

(SHUSHING)

Why do you keep a sleeping baby
in your time machine room?

I don't know, my decorator's terrible.

Yeah, whatever you're doing, it's working.

You should see the way
I have to pick up chicks.

Hi. (GIGGLING)

Well, I guess you can call me
the Man of La Munch-a. (CHUCKLES)

Hey, why does your time machine
have a sticker that says,

"Property of Stewie Griffin"?

Uh...

Well, I... (SIGHS)

All right, to be completely honest,

and because we've already had sex,
it's not mine.

I use it all the time,
and the owner has no idea.

In fact, he'd kill me if he knew.

Really? Won't he see that thing
on the control panel

that says "Years Traveled"?

What thing?

Here's where Brian goes berserk.

(BRIAN SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Look, it's no big deal.

Just reverse it and take off the miles.

That's what I do
when I take my dad's car out.

Are you 16?

I will be next September.

Well, I think someone

has a Barnes & Noble gift card
coming for their silence.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

Brian, what the hell are you doing
in here?

What's happening to my time machine?

I don't know, man.

I saw Meg leaving a minute ago,
going, "Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha."

But I don't know.

Oh, my God, it's having
a complete meltdown.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

-What happened?
-I don't know.

Dear God, my time machine!

You want to tell me about this?

See? I told you. It was Meg.

I don't think so.
The crotch doesn't look like a BMX track.

You bastard!
You've been using my time machine

to nail your bar skanks!

Come on, they're not all bad.

Yes, I've seen the women you bring home.

That stutterer? She was a real prize.

How are you enjoying your meal?

(STUTTERING) Lois, it's delicious.

For crying out loud.

Peter, why are you turning up
the heat again?

Lois, this woman is obviously freezing.

Brian, I want you to tell me
exactly what you did to my time machine.

Well, I didn't want you
to find out I'd been using it,

so I tried turning the
chronological gauge backward.

It's not designed to go backward, Brian.

The question is, how am I going to fix it?

What the hell?

Dear God, everything's moving backward.

What? What are you talking about?

I don't know what the hell you did
with all your messing around, Brian,

but somehow my machine seems
to have reversed the direction of time.

Reversed the direction of time?

Stewie, what does that even mean?
I don't get it.

Okay, now I get it.

Stewie, you can't just
change the direction of time.

How is this even possible?

Well, clearly, when you attempted
to reverse the gauge on my time machine,

you somehow released
a quantum shock wave

powerful enough to push the flow of time
in the opposite direction.

I can only surmise that you and I
were isolated from its effects

because we were inside the machine
at the moment of temporal inversion.

Are you sleeping?

Huh? No, no. No, I was listening.

What kind of jerk alters time,
and then falls asleep?

Look, I'm sorry, Stewie,
but do you think you can fix it?

Well, it's gonna take a while
to rebuild the machine,

and even longer to
recalibrate it for normal time,

but I've taken on bigger
challenges before.

I had to explain to America
why Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.

Face.

There, now you've got
a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

What are you talking about?

What's going on?

I think you're getting a diaper change.

Ah! Get that poop-filled thing
away from me.

No! Oh, God, it's cold!

Whoo! Smells like somebody
needs a diaper change.

Damn right I do!
Now, get this turd-filled sack off...

Oh, my God, it just went back in my body.

Hey, look, what's wrong with Peter?

You smell that? He's passed out drunk.

Does no one in this house have any
dignity?

Hey, Lois, I'm home from the Clam,
and I'm horny.

Hmm. Seems like reverse time
did that kid a favor.

I'm not so sure about that.

Stand up! You're gonna
break that thermometer.

My God, it's extraordinary.

They all seem to be completely unaware
that anything is amiss.

"Your trash barrels were
a little close to our driveway. Joe.

"My legs don't work, but my ears do."

Brian, what are you doing
staring in Quagmire's window?

Man, watching sex in reverse
is just bizarre.

God, where does Quagmire
meet these women?

This is why Boxbuster
went out of business.

Hey, what's going on over there?

(BOTH GASP)

My God, look at all this devastation.

you finally ask out that barista.

What's the worst that could happen?

You know, that chicken's kid
is in my preschool class.

I don't really want to be friends with
him, but he knows a lot of chicks.

And backwards rim shot.

(RIM SHOT IN REVERSE)

Brian, this is gonna be
more difficult than I thought.

Damn it, I hate these new stairs!

(BLEEP)

-What are you watching?
<i>-Meet the Press,</i> it's really weird.

In reverse time, the Republicans
make outrageous statements

and then the host asks
an unrelated question.

Global warming is a myth.

God created everything,
and the world is getting colder.

What is your tax plan?

-That's odd.
-What?

Man, we got a large number
of clovers on our lawn.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Hey, Cleveland.

Australia, here I come.

Look at that, Brian.

Cleveland is back living across
the street.

Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago,

yet we only just recently
entered reverse time.

So what does that mean?

Well, it suggests that time may
not simply be flowing backwards,

it may, in fact, be accelerating.

Accelerating?
Why would that be happening?

I'm not sure.

Have you ever heard of a phenomenon
called time dilation, Brian?

-Sure.
-No, you haven't.

Time dilation, in forward time,

is a phenomenon caused
by a variety of factors

in which time moves more slowly.

In reverse time, it stands to reason

that the same phenomenon would
cause time to accelerate.

I'll have to consult
my quantum calculations

to try to isolate the factors responsible.

What the hell was that?

This is more intense
than when I fought a rabbit

in that karate tournament.

That's weird.
You're doing reverse cutaways now?

-What the hell is... (SCREAMS)
-What? What's the matter?

Dear God, I'm un-teething.

Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time
is beginning to affect us as well.

What does that mean?

It means I'm going to have
to relive everything.

Every painful, awkward moment.

Like that time I forgot what came after
"G" and had to fake it.

It's Peter and Chris.
Sounds like they're in trouble.

(MOANS)

My God, why is there vomit everywhere?

Is that the ipecac bottle?

Oh, no. No, please, not this.

Oh, God, it's not gonna be
coming out of us,

it's gonna be going...

Oh, dear God...

What the hell?

I don't wanna! I don't wanna!

Dad, I'm scared.

(SOBS)

Oh, God, this is so disgusting.
I think I'm gonna puke.

(BLEEP)

Stewie, I don't care what it takes.

We have got to fix this.

We just ate so much vomit.

Brian, it gets worse.

Look.

Yeah, Bonnie's pregnant with Susie. So?

That means Susie's been un-born.

Oh, my God.

Stewie, you're not
that much older than Susie.

Brian, if we don't find a way
to push time forward again soon,

I, too, shall be un-born.

<i>You've got</i>

<i>The AIDS</i>

That guy's gonna feel so much better
after we do what we got planned.

How much time do we have
before you're un-born?

With the time acceleration,
I'm not quite sure.

But trust me,
I can feel myself getting younger.

All right. The machine has been repaired.

Now all I've got to do is isolate the
cause of the acceleration curve

and see if I can duplicate the shock wave.

What's the matter?

I've regressed to my pre-ambulatory stage.

I can no longer walk!

My God, Stewie, you look terrible.

Brian, I suddenly feel as if

I've just been through
some sort of major trauma.

Uh-oh.

I think I know what that major trauma was.

(GASPS) My birth.

Dear God, I've got to get out of here!

(GASPS)

Oh, he's so cute.

Oh, my God, we're getting
closer to the beginning.

You're Lacey Chabert.

Oh, boy, a baby.

I saw my Spanish teacher
leave one of you in a trash can.

Brian, help!

Stewie, what do I do?

He's gorgeous, isn't he?

I want to be the baby!

Look at that head.

Well, Lois, this kind of completes
your little carnival here.

Hey, little guy.

You ever need white,
corner-of-the-mouth stuff,

you come to your grandpa.

Stewie, this is your new home.

Brian, help! It's up to you.

You've got to restore the flow of time.

My life depends on it!

What? Stewie, I don't know
how to fix that machine.

Trust me, you can do it.

You're so talented in so many ways.

-Like what?
-Like... You...

Just write down however you think
you're talented, and I'll sign it.

Well, it's up to you, buddy.
Save this marriage.

Oh, my God, it's the greased-up deaf guy

running backwards toward
that grease truck explosion.

The grease burns so bad!

I can't hear!

Boy, I am late for that meeting.

(GROANS) Come on, math, you dick.

Come on, Brian.

All right, think, think.
What do I do? What do I do?

All right, could it be as simple as this?

Invert time flow.

<i>Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.</i>

Oh, he's perfect.

With a penis and no vagina.

No!

I think I can hear the ocean.

Smell it, too.

All right, what do I do?

Wait a minute, what did I do before?

That's all I have to do, right,

is duplicate the circumstances,
but do it the opposite way.

All right, I was standing right here,

the machine was on, I broke the glass...

And I turned the gauge backward.

Maybe if I turn it in the other direction.

Ooh, a quarter.

Who cares what that doctor found
on my nuts?

This is a good day.

It worked.

I don't believe it. It worked.

Brian, there you are. Where have you been?

Meg, where's Stewie?

Stewie? Who's Stewie?

Here it comes. Push, Mrs. Griffin.

(GRUNTS)

You know what? I take it back,
those panties are gonna be in the way.

Okay, here comes the baby.

Bloody hell!

-It's a boy.
-(ALL CHEER)

Oh, thank God.

He's so beautiful.

Mrs. Griffin, your husband's
standing right here.

What should we name him?

I kind of like Brian's name. Stewie.

That's a wonderful name, Brian.

Stewie. Hi, Stewie.

You did it, Brian. I've got to say,

I didn't think you were
gonna be able to pull it off,

but you did it.

You saved my life.

And for that, I shall be forever grateful.

Hey, I couldn't imagine life
without you, buddy.

You know, I forgot what
a man cave I had in Lois' uterus.

While I was waiting for you,
I was shooting pool.

Had to hold the cue
at weird angles, but still.

Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing?

Is he smart, or is he like me?

He's perfect.

(GIGGLING)

Ah, that's right!

I think at one point
I thought we would get to 200 episodes,

and then when we got canceled,

I thought, "No, we won't
get to 200 episodes."

And then, when we came back,

I thought, "Yeah, maybe
we'll get to 200 episodes."

And now, it's like,
"Oh, crap, 200 episodes."

-I'm so proud of you.
-Way to go, Dad.

-Yeah, you're a smart fella, Dad.
-And you're a fart smeller, Meg.

-(FARTS)
-(SCREAMS)

(LAUGHS)

Wait. We've been on for 200 episodes?
Wow. I'm actually almost...

What I've done is I wanted my weight
to equal how many episodes we have.

So I'm almost just about at 200 pounds.

And I plan to continue
to rise with the episodes.

So if the show goes 500 episodes,
I will not be able to leave my house.

(BEEPING)

I've always found it really funny

and I was excited
when so many other people did

'cause it meant that was something that
we all have in common.

We all find this funny.

This is a show that has never tried
to be anything more than something that

makes you laugh as often
and as loudly as possible

within the course of a half hour.

(SCREAMING)

(BLEEPING)

Damn it!

-Oh, my God. Peter, are you okay?
-No! I am not okay.

Nothing about this is okay.

Inherently, like, in the show's DNA,

has the ability
to go a lot of different directions.

We could tell conventional family stories
that are very character driven.

I say it's 4:00, away with you.

-Stewie!
-Change it back!

No, forget it. <i>Jolly Farm Revue</i> is on.

It's the latest indoctrinating pabulum
for children with not enough to do.

Hey! Shut up.

And also, you could tell buddy comedy.

You could do buddy comedy episodes
with Peter and Quagmire and Joe.

Would you rather get
a massage from a man

or a surgery from a female doctor?

Wow!

And then, beyond that, Stewie's got this
sort of scientific bent where

it opens the door
to tell all kinds of sci-fi stories.

Da Vinci must be my ancestor.

Good Lord!
That's who Bertram's here to kill.

So, that means you're Italian.

Of course, my love for
SpaghettiOs and smoking on the toilet.

It all makes sense.

You know, it really helps
having all those avenues to pursue.

Creatively, I've always said

this is the closest I've ever come
to writing <i>Monty Python,</i>

where any funny idea that you have

you can somehow fit it
into an episode of <i>Family Guy.</i>

It doesn't even have to serve the
story as long as it's funny enough.

-I got something for you here.
-What is it?

I caught you a bullfrog outside.

Poked some holes
in its back so it can breathe.

See, look at this... Oh, boy.

All right, hang on, hang on.

I also feel like this show
is unique in that...

Because it's animated we can push
boundaries a little bit further.

Uh, some of the things
that our characters say,

if they were coming out
of a live actor or actress,

would seem sort of off-putting.

Are you telling me that you have a
problem with me being handicapped?

As a matter of fact, Joe,
yes, I think it's immoral.

It's a lifestyle choice
you're forcing on America.

We handicapped are a proud people.

Yeah, when you're not drinking
and gambling on your reservations,

which we gave you.

There are things about the show that are
maybe gratuitous.

(RETCHING)

But the show doesn't
set out to shock for shock's sake.

It also has to be funny.

(ALL SHOUTING ANGRILY)

Hey, what are you guys bellyaching about?

Sir, we are doing all that we can to stop
the killing of millions of unborn babies.

If you have a few moments, I'd like you to
watch this video presentation.

Yeah, I got a few minutes.
My wife's getting an abortion.

The "Partial Terms
of Endearment" episode,

<i>the thing to me</i>
<i>that's most significant about the fact</i>

<i>that it couldn't air was</i>

that it was really the closest
we've ever come to a true modern day

<i>All in the Family</i> episode.

It's a women's
responsibility to carry it to term.

Well, what if a woman is raped?

Maybe she should have thought of that
before she asked me for directions.

-Huh?
-What about incest, Peter?

What's incest?

You know how cousin Lou
has that kid whose eyes touch.

So what, you're saying
Touch Eyes doesn't deserve to exist?

Well, you don't mind him
when you want a needle threaded.

I'm just saying that
they should have at least have the option.

How can you say that?

Think of all the love
he's given to Uncle Mom and Aunt Dad.

Okay, this argument isn't working.

Peter, what if carrying the baby to term
would endanger the mother's life?

I don't know
what seven of those words were.

What if you look at the ultrasound

and see that the baby is going to be
born with no arms and no legs?

-You name it Mat.
-(HONKS)

Even in our crazy venue,
which is <i>Family Guy,</i>

we felt we'd brought,
you know, a relatively balanced

and sort of intelligent discussion
of a very, very difficult subject.

That episode was not controversial at all.

<i>It's just like "When You Wish</i>
<i>Upon a Weinstein,"</i>

was an episode they felt
was too controversial.

And it's not at all.

It's one of the nicer episodes actually.

Max, Max, Max,
let's not deny our heritages.

You're Jewish, you're good with money.

I'm Irish, I drink and I ban homosexuals
from marching in my parade.

This is a story of love and loss,
fathers and sons,

and the foresight to
retain international merchandizing rights.

This is the story of <i>Star Wars.</i>

We had done a number of <i>Star Wars</i>
gags on the show and...

Uh...

They were so frequent
that Fox Legal said to us,

"If you're gonna keep doing these
we have to get clearance from Lucasfilm

"because there's just no way
we're not going to get sued."

This will keep you warm
until I get the shelter built.

-You're sure this is okay?
-Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.

And we said,
"Ah, well, God, that's the end of it."

You know, "We're not
going to be able to do these anymore."

And Lucasfilm surprised us by saying,
"Yeah, no, we like this."

What started as a small idea became

a one hour parody
of <i>Star Wars</i> that Alec Sulkin wrote.

Beep boop beep.

He says there are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

That's not what I said.

I said there ain't
a pack of menthols on this planet.

I'm a huge <i>Star Wars</i> fan
from way back as a kid, as many of us are.

Okay, so the door's
going to open and you guys say, "Freeze,"

and point your guns at 'em.

Or, you know... Or should it just be me?

Yeah, you know what,
I think that'd be better.

Get out, go, go, go. Just me.

Oh, I wasn't ready... Hi!

Those were very fun for me to work on.

Knowing every line
of those movies inside and out,

it was fun to kind of
go through it and make fun of it.

You know, tell the jokes
that you'd always think of saying.

-Where am I?
<i>-Jabba's Palace.</i>

Who are you?

Someone who loves you.

Whoa, you are
smothering me and I need my space.

Some of my favorite gags from the series
come out of some of those episodes.

I love in the first <i>Star Wars</i> episode

when they're in the trash compactor
and Peter finds an old ratty couch.

-PETER: Whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.
-What? What? What?

-What?
-No, no, no, twist it.

-I am.
-No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, other way.
You're twisting it the wrong way.

Which way? What do you want me to do?

Just look down, all right?
Just look at me, look what I'm doing.

-Yeah.
-All right, see the way I'm twisting it?

-Yeah.
-Turn it that way from your end.

-Okay.
-Okay, just...

-No, no, no, no...
-What?

All right, hey, just put it down.

-Put it down, just drop it.
-All right.

We were able to use
all that great John Williams music.

I mean, they really
gave us the tools to do this right, and...

And it was because they trusted us.

They knew that
we were fans and that we weren't gonna...

We weren't gonna destroy their property.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

-I say, Brian, look, three rows down.
-What?

Is that Tom Bosley?

What would Tom Bosley
be doing on a train in Switzerland?

I'm almost certain. Tom!

-Did he look?
-I don't know.

Well, if I yell, you have to watch.

Tom Bosley!

-No, it's not him.
-Huh.

The Road shows have been a lot of fun.

We started with
"Road to Rhode Island" in season one.

And Seth had this idea to do an episode

<i>based on those Bob Hope,</i>
<i>Bing Crosby Road shows.</i>

Seth, as you probably know,
loves Bob Hope.

And, you know,
is very familiar with those movies

and the music from those movies and...

So, I think that having "Road to..."
with Brian and Stewie,

they're sort of our
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

Up until that point Stewie had kind of
existed in his own world.

He would talk to Rupert
and hatch diabolical schemes.

And Brian meanwhile was
kind of Peter's sidekick.

And they were kind of separate.

And this was the first time we kind of
paired those two, and it just clicked.

Okay, if everything worked properly

this should be the exact time and
place that Mort was sent to.

Now, we've just got to
figure out where we are.

Or when we are.

That's such a douche
time traveler thing to say.

From that point forward we started

pairing Stewie and Brian
together on stories,

'cause they were so good together.

And it's a perfect example of how you can
create a show and then

your writing style...
Other people coming in,

in this case, the writing staff,

can find things in your characters
that you didn't see initially.

The Brian-Stewie relationship
which now seems so obvious

was not something that I thought of
when I was creating the show.

They're always sort of
busting each other's chops

and antagonistic towards each other,
but they're also...

I think they've evolved into...
They're best friends.

(STAMMERING) Can I just say before...
Can we just like take two...

I love... You're so brave.

I just love how brave
you're being right now.

This is like the closest
I've ever felt to you.

Okay. Oh, my God,
I was thinking the same thing.

We are so us right now. Do you know that?

MACFARLANE:
<i>And the Brian-Stewie episode,</i>

more than anything,
we did to explore whether or not

two animated characters

with just a single room
can sustain a half hour

purely on the strength
of their characters.

We thought that it might be
interesting to try an episode

where it was almost like watching a play.

Where it was one location,
two people on stage,

no cutaways,
nothing, just dialogue for 22 minutes.

It was very polarizing.
People either loved it or they hated it.

They thought it was revolutionary,
or they thought it was just...

You know, they couldn't get
past the Stewie diaper thing.

(ALL GASP)

He's dead.

Oh, my God.

Nice.

"And Then There Were Fewer"
was our first 16x9 episode,

when we went from this to this.

<i>And we thought</i>
<i>we'd do this big splashy visual episode.</i>

<i>I love that episode</i>
<i>because it's the first time</i>

we've really told a story that complex.

So James Woods murdered
Stephanie and then he murdered himself.

Criss-cross.

The animators did an amazing job.

The artists and the directors
and everybody that worked on that.

It looks so great to watch
and the score is amazing.

It's just a lush score
all the way throughout.

We use anywhere from a 50 to,

in some cases, a 90-piece
orchestra for every episode of the show.

<i>Even if people don't know</i>
<i>that what they're hearing is live music,</i>

<i>is a live orchestra,</i>

<i>on a subconscious level</i>
<i>it classes up the show.</i>

(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

I know that it happens to be one of
Seth's favorite episodes to this day.

And I think he really
liked approaching it like a movie.

Mr. Peter. Mr. Joe. Mr. Bonnie.

(WHISPERS) She doesn't know
what "mister" means.

Mr. Mort. Mr. Muriel. Mayor West Mister.

<i>Every last electrolyte</i>

<i>Now everybody</i>

<i>When I tell you</i>
<i>every person needs a way of feeling good</i>

<i>Every kitty needs a ball of string</i>
<i>and every dog a stick</i>

<i>But all you need</i>

<i>Me and Jesus</i>

We do a lot of
musical numbers in <i>Family Guy.</i>

Which is fun for us.
Seth is a big music fan.

And he's very skilled at executing them.

(SINGING) <i>Now a woman who'll kiss</i>
<i>on a very first date</i>

<i>Is usually a hussy</i>

<i>And a woman who'll kiss</i>
<i>on the second time out</i>

<i>Is anything but fussy</i>

<i>But a woman who'll wait</i>
<i>'till the third time around</i>

<i>Head in the clouds, feet on the ground</i>

<i>She's the girl he's glad he's found</i>
<i>She's his Shipoopi</i>

MACFARLANE: Shipoopi
<i>was so elaborately choreographed</i>

<i>and then the visuals,</i>

which Dan Povenmire, the director,
spent a ton of time working on,

really hit every point
in the orchestration.

And the thing that
I've always loved about the show is...

When I talk to my son
and his friends, you know,

they don't know what <i>Shipoopi</i> is.

They might not know,
you know, who Gene Kelly was,

but they're loving the musical,
you know, segments.

And it's like, how did Seth make
10 million teenage boys fans of musicals?

(SINGING) <i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>
<i>You can ask all the birds in the sky</i>

<i>And they'll tell you real sweet</i>
<i>With a musical tweet</i>

<i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>

Our season seven premiere was an episode
called "Road to the Multiverse."

And there's this great
musical number called

<i>It's A Wonderful Day for Pie,</i>

which is, you know,
as devoid of content as it sounds.

It's just about Peter and Lois
singing about how much they love pie.

But the animation
in that sequence is amazing.

Visually, it was
just fantastic to see our characters

animated in a Disney style.

I just thought that was so well done.
And it was a lot of fun.

And we sort of improvised
some of the lyrics in the room.

Seth just came out with...

(AS PETER) <i>It's a wonderful day for pie</i>

And one of us goes...

(AS CLEVELAND)
<i>And it smells so much better than I</i>

It was Cleveland as a skunk
and it just came together.

And that was a great piece.
One of my favorites.

(SINGING) <i>I know you just</i>
<i>can't wait to stare</i>

<i>At all that luscious orange hair</i>

<i>But, boy, before you touch a single curl</i>

<i>You must impress that ultra-bloomin'</i>
<i>All-consumin', poorly groomin'</i>

<i>Down's Syndrome girl</i>

The <i>Down's Syndrome Girl</i> song
was fun for me because

it was the first time
I had written lyrics and a tune.

<i>Which I basically went in</i>
<i>and sang for Walter Murphy</i>

<i>who then arranged it and actually</i>
<i>made it sound good.</i> (CHUCKLES)

It's a lot of fun for us to...

You know, to write a song lyric
and have a great composer

like Walter Murphy
or Ron Jones set it to music.

(SINGING) <i>Each bell would peal</i>
<i>with a silvery zeal</i>

<i>As the holiday feeling was filling us</i>

<i>But now instead</i>
<i>All we're feeling is dread</i>

<i>Because Christmastime is killing us</i>

When we did our Christmas episode,

I had originally envisioned
something like <i>Rudolph</i>

that had, like,
four or five, six musical numbers in it.

We ended up, like, doing two or three.

And I had written this lyric about how...

I was making a comment
on how crazy Christmas has become

and what it takes out of us all.

<i>And when the smoke cleared,</i>
<i>it was a success.</i>

<i>And we were nominated for an Emmy.</i>

But also, a great unexpected thrill was
we were nominated for a Grammy.

-(SINGING) <i>You have AIDS</i>
-(SINGING) <i>Yes, you have AIDS</i>

<i>Not HIV but full blown AIDS</i>

MACFARLANE: <i>I think the first song</i>
<i>that the barbershop quartet did</i>

<i>was the</i> AIDS <i>song.</i>

And that's a perfect example
of another reason

for using that orchestra
and trying to be so musically legit.

Because it allows you
to get away with content

that you wouldn't otherwise
be able to get away with.

Yeah, talk about making a subject
matter a little more palatable.

People love the absurdity of these guys
singing such an outrageous lyric,

but what Seth appreciates about it is

how unbelievably talented these guys are
and were in these pieces, musically.

It provides a musical cushion

that prevents you from
being completely crass,

if you're being that crass
in the first place.

ALL: (SINGING)
<i>You'll never have to wear a condom</i>

<i>When you do it with your wife</i>

<i>Or anyone else you do it with</i>
<i>We promise not to tell</i>

I also like the little
things that we do here and there,

like, Stewie singing little folk songs,

Stewie making up his own,
you know, little songs,

talking about, you know,
"Playing the G-chord

"and here we go to the D-chord."

(SINGING) <i>Then Brian comes in</i>
<i>and I change up the tempo</i>

<i>Brian comes in and it changes the song</i>

<i>Looking at me like</i>
<i>he thinks I'm a douche bag</i>

<i>But he's gonna learn</i>
<i>pretty fast that he's wrong</i>

<i>Hey, Brian, why are you</i>
<i>bringing me down, man?</i>

<i>Why are you bringing me down?</i>
<i>Don't bring me down!</i>

Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.

MACFARLANE: <i>It's amazing</i>
<i>to me that the show has had</i>

<i>the cultural impact that it has.</i>

For a long while,
<i>The Simpsons</i> was really the only show

<i>that had broken out in this way</i>

<i>and I always hoped we would have a prayer</i>
<i>of maybe doing that as well.</i>

And I think we've done that.

Ah!

SMITH: <i>One of the great things</i>
<i>now is that we're syndicated.</i>

<i>So, we're on all the time.</i>
<i>And old people like us now.</i>

I have an Auntie Philly who's 92.
She loves <i>Family Guy</i>

and she won't let any of her friends
in the room when it's on

because old people
talk back to the television.

She wants to hear it.

OLD WOMAN: What? What?
OLD MAN: Huh? Huh?

-What?
-I forget.

I said it before,
but we're so thankful to our fans

for bringing the show back from the dead,

<i>that I almost feel like we owe it to them</i>
<i>to give 110% every day to every episode.</i>

I try to interact with
the fans as much as I can.

I don't know if you can see right now,
but I'm actually eight months pregnant.

And this is a fan's baby.

You get crazy when you're pregnant.

(LAUGHING)

(SOBBING)

I feel like if you love me from afar
then the least I can do is love you back.

And if that means
carrying your child, so be it.

I love my fans.

Keep digging, you know?

It feels like
there's no more stories to tell

and then we dig for a while and something
pops up that, "Oh, we haven't done that."

(ROARING)

What's next is, I guess, episode 300.

And I'll have even more gray hair
and bigger circles under my eyes.

I'm here for the early bird special.

MACFARLANE: <i>A</i> Family Guy
<i>movie would be a logical extension.</i>

<i>But, with an animated show,</i>
<i>you can do pretty much anything.</i>

There's nothing you can't do.

So what is the reason to make a movie?

<i>Without giving anything away,</i>
<i>I think we've hit on the answer to that.</i>

<i>So when that</i>
Family Guy <i>movie does come around,</i>

suffice it to say,

it will be something
that is not do-able on TV.

(FARTS)

Sorry. It's been building up for a while.

I don't have a favorite
character at this point.

<i>I'm recording voices so much.</i>

Hiya, pardner. I'm a cattle rustler.
I rustle cattle.

That's turning out good.

I'm partial to Brian.

Brian. Brian Steele.

Ooh, good heavens!

He's the only character that I don't leave
the booth with a sore throat.

Seems to me you should
send less time working for the paper

and more time working
on that novel you've been working on...

Ah!

<i>"Duh, I'm a dumb cop.</i>

<i>I was going, like, 41.</i>

Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

They finally got that son of a bitch,
Briggs.

You know that guy?

You're damn right, I do.

Bobby Briggs is the one who
put me in this wheelchair.

(CRYING) They got him.

They finally got him.

Geez, Joe, you okay?

(SOBBING)

Here, use my handkerchief.

It's wet and cold.

Well, yeah, it's my handkerchief.
I've been blowing my nose in it all day.

Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs
is the one who crippled you?

You always told us you fell off a roof
during a fight with the Grinch.

(SIGHS) I lied.

I lied because I was
ashamed of the real story,

that I let a vicious criminal get away.

What happened?

Well, it was 1996.

Briggs was one of the
biggest heroin dealers east of Providence,

which is mostly just open water,

but still, I'd been undercover,
tracking his operation for six months

and had finally gained his confidence.

<i>I had almost gathered enough evidence</i>
<i>to put Briggs away for good,</i>

<i>but I knew a taped confession</i>
<i>would make the case a slam dunk.</i>

This is gonna take us to the next level.

We're gonna be banging
so many hot chicks

with jeans up to their navels.

Bobby Briggs,
you're really good at heroin.

How much heroin is here, Bobby Briggs?

Why are you talking like that?

Are you wearing a wire?

Oh, you're dead, Joe Swansonson.

JOE: <i>My undercover name</i>
<i>was Swansonson.</i>

Easy, Briggs.

You kill a cop,
they'll put you away forever.

Then get ready to spend
the rest of your life

as a lame gimp with
an annoying-voiced wife.

JOE: <i>He'd met Bonnie.</i>

(SCREAMING)

<i>Briggs got away,</i>

and I've been in this
wheelchair ever since.

I like that you can tell me a story

starting at the Clam
and ending on a Ferris wheel.

Yeah, people are starving in Africa,

and I'm at a carnival
with my best buddies on a beautiful night.

Blessings. Blessings.

So, Joe, it must feel great to finally
have some closure with Bobby Briggs.

Yeah.

You know last night was
the first time in 15 years

I didn't strangle Bonnie in my sleep?

Okay.

Hey, Dad, you're gonna want to see this.

<i>Again recapping our breaking news,</i>

<i>longtime fugitive Bobby Briggs</i>
<i>has escaped from police custody.</i>

<i>His whereabouts are currently unknown.</i>

<i>News of Briggs's escape</i>
<i>first broke on Telemundo,</i>

<i>if you can believe that.</i>

Escapo, escapo, escapo!

<i>Briggs reportedly escaped</i>
<i>during a prison open house,</i>

<i>an event that will most likely</i>
<i>be canceled in the future.</i>

No, no! I can't believe it.

Oh, don't worry, Joe,
they'll get him back.

No, they won't!
It took 15 years to catch him.

Well, this seems like
a good time to be heading out.

I should be getting back anyway.
I left Rupert with a sitter.

Well, you know where everything is.

Feel free to help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

And Mr. Con Man here can have
pudding or ice cream, not both.

Chief, can I have a word?

Yeah, but first, you have to agree
there's a huge difference

between bisexual men
and homosexual men.

-Sure, Chief.
-Thank you. Huge.

What is it?

Well, Chief, I'm here because I want you
to put me on the Briggs case.

Absolutely not.

Come on, Chief!
I know everything about Briggs.

I'm the only one who can catch him.

No, Swanson, you're too close to the case.

I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it

because they're so far from the case,
they don't care about it at all.

-Hi, Chief.
-Hi.

This isn't fair!

Swanson, you know your assignment.

You get me the guy
who's been rubbing his butt

all over Dunkin' Donuts.

Can I help you?

Not illegal. Not illegal.
Show me the law. Not illegal.

Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down
about this Briggs thing,

and that kind of bums me out,
so I got you this Cookie Puss.

(CHUCKLES) Isn't that funny?

Look at that weird nose.

I think your nose is weird.

Guys, I'm telling you, I...

I just don't think I could live with
Briggs on the lam for another 15 years.

Well, why don't you do something about it?

I can't do anything about it.
The Chief won't let me.

Joe, if they don't find this guy,

it's gonna eat you alive
for the rest of your life.

You got to take matters
into your own hands.

You got to go after this guy.

But that's a breach of police protocol.

This isn't about you as a cop.
This is about you as a man.

Come on, what do you say? Quagmire and I
will help you bring this guy to justice.

(CHUCKLES) Peter, what did I say
about you volunteering me for (BLEEP).

All right, let's do it!

WEST: Well, if you're gonna do it,

you're gonna need someone
who's very good at disguise.

Who said that?

I'd love to go with you, but I can't.

I'm supposed to be the gift table
at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.

All right, if we're gonna go after Briggs,
this might be a good place to start.

I've spent the last 15 years
gathering information on him,

and it's all here.

Every crime he's committed,
every associate he's had...

Look, Briggs was all-county JV swimming.

Well, I don't just focus on the negative.

Joe, your 25-year-old son
and your baby daughter share a room

just so you can keep
a weirdo Beautiful Mind room?

Isn't that a little bizarre?

And then we dug the bullets out
of that Iraqi family's skulls

so they couldn't be traced back to us.

SUSIE: <i>Today, I saw a balloon.</i>

Briggs' FBI profile says
the only relationship

he's maintained over the years
is with a stripper named Tanya.

Tax records show she currently works
at a club in Atlantic City.

So that's our first stop.

Is there touching at the club?

(STAMMERS) I don't know, Peter. Maybe.

Okay, this is good, this is good.
I'll be sure to pack my blammin' jeans.

Hey, listen, thanks for agreeing

to take care of Principessa
while we're gone, Lois.

It's our pleasure.
She looks like a nice kitty.

Uh, kitty?

Lois, she is a purebred Persian.

I can trace her lineage to
the cats kept by Cleopatra.

Just tell me what I need to do, Glenn.

Well, first, she has a very active bowel.

You can't be too generous
with the baby wipes.

Stroke front to back like
you would on yourself.

Otherwise, you're smashing
feces into her genitals.

Also, she's very skittish,
so you have to touch her like this.

I'm going to touch you now.

Is that okay?

See how I'm going?

Slowly, slowly.

Oh, the mysteries you keep inside of you.

PETER: Quagmire, come on, let's go.

(ENGINE STARTS)

All right, I guess we're off.

Hey, you guys, check out the look
on Lois's face when I do this.

LOIS: Peter!

Clean that up, you idiot!

Love you.

Boy, it'll be satisfying to finally slap
the cuffs on Briggs once and for all.

Hey, you ever just drive
through a town and wonder,

-"Who the hell lives here?"
-All the time.

Look at this place.
I mean, what's going on?

There's an adult with a lemonade stand.

That Chinese restaurant still has the sign
from when it was a mechanic.

I don't want to eat lo mein
where they were just changing mufflers.

There's an apartment above that Arby's,
with toys in the window.

Someone has built a life up there.

What a mess.

I'm telling you,
the Founding Fathers would be/

very disappointed in where
their country ended up.

Eh, it wasn't so perfect back then,
either.

And so I say unto you, Sons of Liberty,

no longer will free men live
under the yoke of giant predatory birds.

Shrieking, swooping down,
stealing our livestock.

What's going on in here?

Nothing, uh, just bellyaching
about the British.

Get back to warming those eggs.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

All right, this is the place.

We got to see if we can find
Briggs's girl.

Hey, we're looking for a stripper
named Tanya. She here tonight?

Yeah, she's working the Champagne Room.

Follow me.

Hey, Quagmire, uh,
you ever been to Atlantic City before?

Once, about 20 years ago. Why?

-All right! All right!
-All right! All right!

Hey, are you Tanya?

Yeah. Who are you?

A guy who's looking for Bobby Briggs.
Where is he?

I don't know any Bobby Briggs.

And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

-You're lying!
-Joe, let me handle this.

I know how to communicate with strippers.

All I need is one dance,
and I'll know everything she knows.

-You free for a dance?
-Sure.

I need information.

I was molested by my dad.

I know that. I need other information.

I want you to tell me where
I can find Bobby Briggs.

Come on, you know I can't give out
a client's personal information.

All right, I'm gonna have
to do the Vulcan V-Meld.

He lives at 2820 Ocean Boulevard,
across from the park, apartment two.

Atta girl!

Okay, now spit in your own mouth.

This is a cool place.

Boy, it sure is nice having
Mr. Quagmire's cat around.

I got to say, cats are
so much better than dogs.

-Well, that's kind of a broad statement.
-It's true.

Okay, show me one way
in which cats are better than dogs.

Well, okay, uh, for one thing,
they always land on their feet.

Watch.

So? Big deal. Dogs do that, too.

Here, go ahead, do what you just did,
but with me.

Ow! Oh, my God!

-(BONE CRACKING)
-Oh, my neck! Ow!

Oh, my God, Brian!

Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Call somebody! Oh!

We need one of those boards
they use for football players!

(GRUNTS)

-Hey, what's going on?
-Nothing.

I just figured out why
cats are better than babies.

Well, that's kind of a broad statement.

Okay, 2820 Ocean, this is it.

All right, apartment number two.

We'll just pick the lock.

What? What is that?

(QUIETLY) Let's use our eyes to see.

Aw, this guy has sugar cereals.
His mom must be so cool.

And he's got a trash compactor.

(GRINDING AND CRUSHING)

It compacted it all.

That is so boss.

Aha! We meet again, Briggs.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you?

Joe Swanson.

Who?

Wait, you don't remember me?

I infiltrated your heroin operation.

We saw <i>Reality Bites</i> together.

(GRUNTS)

You guys, I found him!

He went that way!

(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTS)

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Damn it. That's Lois.

If I don't get this,
she's going to kill me.

(GROANS)

-Hi, sweetie.
-(CONTINUES GROANING)

Yeah, everything's great.

Of course, I miss you.

Well, how does the supermarket
run out of parsley?

I'm as angry as you are.

Peter, I'm going to fall!

(HANGS UP)

(GASPS)

It looks like you're out of roof.

(GRUNTS)

Damn it. There's no way across.

Spidey, can you swing
us across with your web?

No, I can't swing you across.

And it's Spider-Man, not Spidey.

I'm pretty sure
I've heard people call you Spidey.

Yeah, close friends.

-What's your name?
-Peter.

Hey, Petey, do stuff for me.

-Oh, I don't like that.
-Yeah, you don't like it.

And you're a fat nobody,
and I'm fucking Spider-Man,

so how do you think I feel?

He's getting away.
Guys, drop me over the side!

Are you crazy, Joe?
That fall will kill you.

Not if I land on my legs.

(GRUNTS)

PETER: Heads up.

(PANTING)

I got you now, Briggs.

Move that bus!

(CHEERING)

(SHRIEKS)

Enjoy your new home.

He's gone, you guys!

I had him!

That was our one chance!

It's all right, Joe.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

You're a great cop
with a very distinguished career.

You caught that guy who was killing
all those Filipino girls.

Yeah, but this was important!

This was the guy who ruined my life.

The one perp who meant everything to me.

If I caught this guy,
I'd finally be able to sleep at night.

Damn it!

-(SIREN WAILING)
-Oh, thank God. Cops.

Oh, good. You guys can still catch Briggs.

He's headed that way.

We're not here for him.
We're here for you guys.

You're under arrest for interfering
with a police investigation.

What?

Yeah, what the hell? You should be
out there arresting the real criminals.

Like switchblade-wielding white guys

from movies and TV
who don't talk like people talk.

Easy, mama.

Hand over that purse, and everything
will be real cool, you dig?

Guys, you got to let us out of here.
The real criminal's getting away.

Yeah, the bastard's making a break for it,
just like South America.

Hmm. Lot of black guys over there.

Hey, man, where you going?

I'll be back. I'm coming back.
I'll be right back.

Why would the cops arrest us
instead of going after Briggs?

Flannigan? Wait a minute.

That's one of the corrupt cops
who helped harbor Briggs

while he was on the lam for 15 years.

These guys are bad news.

Oh, my God.
What are they going to do to us?

We're not going to stick
around to find out.

Joe, hold your handcuffs over my lap.

-(PANTS UNZIPPING)
-What the hell is that?

-Swiss Army penis.
-(SAWING)

Wow, Quagmire. That's incredible.

-Peter?
-(SAWING)

Yours are made of a stronger metal.

We're going to have to go
with the acetylene torch penis.

(HISSING)

Don't look right at it.

My STDs help it burn brighter.

The keys are in the ignition. Let's go!

(ENGINE STARTS)

I told you to search that guy's penis.

You say that about everybody.

-Yeah, we did it!
-But we lost Briggs.

How are we going to find him now?
We got nothing.

Well, I don't know if it helps,

but I found this number
next to the phone in his kitchen.

I was saving it 'cause I was going to make
a scrapbook of the trip for you guys.

Let me see that.

This is the area code for Juarez, Mexico.

He's trying to get over the border!

-You think so?
-Definitely.

There's only one road into Juarez,
and it goes through El Paso.

We got to get to El Paso.

Joe, how do you know
the area code for Juarez, Mexico?

There was a stem cell doctor
I went down there to see.

He just rubbed, like, salsa on my legs.

Hey, you're not in uniform.

Are you guys cops?

Are you guys cops?

-They know we're not cops!
-(TIRES SQUEALING)

All right, guys, the next flight
to El Paso leaves in 40 minutes.

But Briggs is ahead of us.
Won't he already be there?

No, he'd never risk
going through an airport.

Too many cops, too many cameras,
too much security.

I don't know, Joe.
Sometimes the security's pretty lax.

I mean, the last plane I was on
got gay-jacked.

-This plane's going to Miami!
-(ALL GASPING)

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

-Hey, Lois?
-Shh.

Quiet, Brian.
Mom's taking a nap on the couch.

Yeah. And look, she fell asleep
with the cat right on her chest.

(PURRING)

Isn't that cute?

(MEOWING AND PURRING)

I think you're dreaming.

No, I'm not.

BRIAN: Stupid cat!

God, it's so damn hot.

Hey, I got an idea.
Let's make scalding asphalt angels.

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

Second-degree burns, first-degree fun.

Geez, how long we got to
stand out here like this?

Till Briggs comes through.

You know, I was thinking about that, Joe.

If Briggs is driving here,
that's 2,000 miles.

It's going to be at least a
couple of days.

Huh. I guess you're right.

Well, what are we going to
do for two days in El Paso?

-(BEEPS)
-There's a Chicano heritage festival.

No way.

KC and the Sunshine Band is playing.

Why?

Or we could visit the Pershing House

where John Pershing took control
of the Eighth Army Brigade in 1914.

-So, that's his bed?
-Yes.

-So, that's his desk?
-Yes.

-So, that's his lamp?
-Yes.

-So, that's his dresser?
-Yes.

-So, that's his window?
-Yes.

-So, that's his floor?
-Yes.

Wow.

What do you got there, Quagmire?
Is that Briggs?

No, this guy's clean.

Well, send him through.
What's the holdup?

Sombreros! Maracas!

Ceramic Winnie the Pooh dolls!

Get 'em now, folks!

You're not going to find
this stuff in Mexico!

Come on. What's going on up there?

Briggs.

Damn it! He's getting away!

You're not going to get away this time,
you son of a bitch.

Please, don't kill me. I'm not married.

My life is awesome.

I've waited 15 years
for this moment, Briggs.

Do you have any idea what it's like

to have to lift yourself
into a wheelchair every morning?

To have your wife look at you
like you're half a man?

To get preferential parking?

To board a plane early
with the first-class people

and gold card members?

All right, it's not all bad.

But I'm not going to kill you.

I'm not an animal like you.

So, what are you going to do, arrest me?

No.

I don't arrest cripples.

(SCREAMING)

By the way, you're under arrest.

I only said that last thing
'cause it seemed cool.

Oh, my God, that was so awesome.
I saw everything.

You were all like... (TALKING GIBBERISH)

And Briggs was all like... (GIBBERISH)

And then you were all like...
(IMITATES GUNSHOTS)

And then Briggs's legs were like...
(WHISTLING)

Oh, crap, he's dead.

I think he bled out.
I must have hit the femoral artery.

Ah, just kick him into Mexico.

Guys, I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

You risked your lives for me,
and I couldn't have done it without you.

Hey, that's what pals are for.

Yeah, and thanks for letting me
fire a few rounds into Briggs's corpse.

That was the most powerful
I've felt in a couple years.

Well, you guys helped me
finally have some closure in my life.

I feel like a new man, like I'm reborn.

Joe, you have blood
just pouring out of your pant leg.

Yeah, I had a ball blow in the river.

It's nice of you to remember, Brian,

but, frankly,
I'd rather let this one slip by.

I don't need to be reminded

You know, it's funny.

You keep so busy with your kids,

Okay, bye. Stop making noise.

(SIGHS)

You know, Peter,
I know Lois is downplaying it,

but I think she might actually
appreciate it if we threw her a party.

Maybe even a surprise party.

That's a great idea, Brian!

Yeah, I love parties.

I mean, I had a great time
at my baby shower.

Well, after opening all these gifts,

I could use a little wine

Of course they will. They're Sears.

I say, you're a cute little fellow.

Tell me something, what do you

Yeah, she makes my turtlehead go in, too.

How about Michelle Rodriguez?

Yeah, me too, kind of, right?

You know, she's got a cute tomboy thing

Dad, how did you get Mom
out of the house so we could decorate?

Well, Chris, I constructed
a very elaborate, fake grocery store.

Oh, my God!

Are these pickles really only 39 cents?

That's right, ma'am.

Serious Putty.

Ooh! This looks like fun!

It says I have cancer.

We thought it would be better
if you heard it from chemicals in an egg.

Hey, Stewie, you better come down.
The party's about to start.

What is that? Is that a turtle?

Yes, Brian. I found him at the park.

I named him Sheldon.

Oh, and get this.
I brought him home today,

and coincidentally this is the day
Rupert started working out again.

So transparent.

Rupert? What happened to your eye?

Brian, did you pull
one of Rupert's eyes off?

No. Why would I do that?
Maybe your turtle did it.

Nonsense. Sheldon is a gentle soul.
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

Well, come on. Let's get downstairs.
Lois will be here any minute.

ALL: Surprise!

-Yay!
-Birthday!

(GASPS) Oh, my God!

Happy birthday, Lois!

You guys shouldn't have done this!

Hey, anytime you can celebrate
the end of someone's periods.

Everyone, everyone,
I have something to say.

"To my dearest Lois on her birthday.

"What a journey we've had together.

"You know, life has a way
of changing things.

"What were once two firm,
impressive mountain peaks

"have become a barren,
strip-mined, muddy landslide

"that droops ever downward.

"What were once
pink and succulent rose petals

"now take the form of the
shredded, raggedy, blown-out end piece

"of a practical joker's exploding cigar."

Peter, that's enough.

"Lois, you may not be
the young filly you were when I met you,

"but you're still
my reliable old plow horse

"who's there each day
to pull the plow, to help around the barn,

"and let the husband horse
slap a batch into her now and then."

Well, I guess that's it.

I love you, sweetheart.

And I have a lovely gift
of the batch-slapping variety

waiting for you when I'm just
the right amount of drunk.

To Lois!

ALL: To Lois!

(CRYING)

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

-Lois!
-Mom!

Geez, what the hell's her problem?

Peter, she was already
feeling insecure about her age,

and then you went and gave her
that horrible speech!

I don't blame her.
Nobody likes to be humiliated in public.

I'm King Stewie!

I rule with an iron fist!

La, la, la, la, la, la la.

Look at me! Ooh-ooh-ooh.

In my office. Now.

Hey, any of you guys seen your mother?

She never came to bed last night,
and I can't find her anywhere.

-(HORN HONKING)
-(HARD ROCK PLAYING)

What the hell?

Hey, sluts!

OMG, stop staring at me, please.
Okay, thanks.

Mom, are you okay?

Lois, what's goin' on?

I'm what's goin' on, Peter.

I got highlights, I went shopping,
and I had my...

So it's tighter now.

Peter, I think Lois might be
having a midlife crisis.

Come on, dudes!
Who wants to hop in my wheels,

and head to the beach
for some ultimate Frisbee?

Yeah, Sheldon, I'm with you.

I can't... I can't do that.

Hey, tweeps!

JK, I don't follow you, you're lame.

But look who just got herself
a sick new tat.

-MEG: Oh, my God, Mom!
-I know, I can't believe it either.

I guess one of my flaws
is I'm just kind of brave.

No, that's great actually,

because now anyone walking behind you
will know that you had $60.

Wow! That is awesome, Lois!

Your bum looks like an NBA guy's arm.

Except it's not payin' someone to install
a PlayStation in a car.

Lois, you do know that's permanent?

Good. Then that means
my ass is gonna look young forever.

Guys, I gotta go shoot one into the sink.

What's going on?

Mom's acting and dressing
like a 20-year-old.

I know, and I'm worried about her.

You can't just pretend
to be something you're not.

Yes, just ask Edward Scissorhands.

Okay, now, I'm an excellent night nurse,

so you two get some much-deserved sleep
and don't worry about a thing.

I will take such loving care
of this wonderful little gift.

And when you wake up, well-rested,

your precious little baby will be smiling
as bright as the sun.

It's dead.

And while I remind you I can't read yet,

I can only imagine Madeline would say,

"Take me out of this
disgusting French hospital

"and find me some real parents."

(GRUNTS IN PAIN) Paper cut!

A razor blade?

Who the hell uses a razor blade
as a bookmark?

All right, very funny, Stewie.

-What?
-What do you mean, what?

You replaced my Jack Daniels
with flat Diet Coke.

No, I didn't.

And you're noticing this
at 8:20 in the morning?

What has happened to your life?
Do you need to talk?

Just stay away from my booze!

It wasn't me, Brian.

Well, if it wasn't you, who was it?

I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff
going on around here lately.

Just yesterday, somebody gave
Peter a "hot-butt."

La, la, la, la, la.

(SINGING) <i>Regular life</i>

<i>La, la, la, la, la, la...</i>

(SCREAMS)

And then somebody replaced Meg's
sleeping pills with Alka-Seltzer.

People are gonna miss me when I'm...

(BELCHES)

Well, I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical explanation for those things.

Sometimes you just...

Whoa, that was close.

Yeah, how'd that thing fall over?

Okay, who replaced my glasses with forks?

I mean, they're real good for seeing forks
but not much else.

LOIS: Peter, can you come down
to the laundry room?

(SIGHS) Son of a bitch.

If she washed my belt again,

I am gonna hit her
with my dry, withered belt.

What is it, Lois? I was watching...

Whoa, Lois, what the hell are you doing?

Do me, Peter, do me right here
in the basement.

You mean this room we're in or your bum?

No, this room, Peter,
right here on the carpet.

So you want me to do you in the front.

Just get over here and kiss me.

Let's have sex
on all the clean, folded laundry.

Wow, Lois, I got to say,
I like this new you.

I like it a lot.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, Peter!

-LOIS: (MOANING) Oh, Peter, yes!
-PETER: Yeah.

-LOIS: Oh, I'm on fire.
-PETER: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

-LOIS: Take me, you filthy bastard.
-PETER: (MOANING) Yeah.

-LOIS: Destroy me and this laundry.
-PETER: Yeah.

PETER: Yeah, here,
put Meg's bra in your mouth.

Oh, my God, that's so disturbing.

I know, gross.

Yeah, and my hearing's a lot better,
so I hear, like, suction and stuff.

This place is sick.

Hells, yeah!

It is the only rooftop pool in Providence.

No offense, but this place is awesome.

Where was I supposed to be offended
within that remark?

Can we... Can we leave, Lois?

Actually, we are leaving.

We're hitting another
insane party across town.

What, you mean now?

Peter, you sound like an old fart.

I thought you liked having a hot,
young wife.

Well, I did at first,
but the novelty's worn off.

Same thing happened with
that blog I started on 9/11.

Look, Peter, you do what you want to do,
but I'm going to that party.

My life isn't over. It's just beginning.

So if you don't want
to run with the wild horses,

then go back to the barn and go to bed.

-But, Lois...
-(TIRES SCREECH)

Stupid place still doesn't
have my dry cleaning.

That's not a dry cleaners.
It's a dance club.

It is?

Well, that explains a lot.

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Oh, this is my jam!

Jeez, Peter, you look terrible.

I know. Lois has been wearing me out.

I just can't keep up with her.

I don't know what she's trying to prove,
Brian, but I can't take it anymore.

Peter, can't you see?
She's doing this because of you.

For God's sake,
you called her a plow horse.

It's no wonder she's trying to prove
she's young and vibrant.

(GRUNTING)

And, Lois, I've had enough of you, too!

Now, you come home
and start acting your age!

No, Peter. I don't want to act my age,
and you don't want that either.

Otherwise, you wouldn't have
called me an old plow horse.

Look, I didn't mean to say that.
I was a jerk.

But isn't this what you want?

Don't you want me to
stay young and exciting?

Well, I thought I did.

I mean, every guy
who's been married a while

thinks he wants a hot, young chick,

but after you spend an hour
with one of them,

you want to blow your brains out.

But, Peter, I was just doing this
to make you happy.

You do make me happy, Lois.

You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

That's sweet.

But you got to admit,
I'm not what I used to be.

Well, neither am I.

Oh, crap.

Ugh, you look like a nude Larry David.

No, no, no!

Oh, my God, Super Mario?
What are you doing here?

I jump on a turtle, Stewie.

It's not an exciting life,
but it's my life.

It sure is good to have you back, Mom.

Yeah, we missed you.

Well, thanks for putting up with me,
you guys.

Sorry, I got so flipped out about my age.

Aw, don't worry about it, Lois.

But from now on, remember,
I love you just the way you are.

And besides, there's nothing wrong
with being 35.

Peter, I'm 43.

Get out of this house.

Are you still obsessed with Kent?

Just ask him out already.

The worst that can happen is he says no.

Are you kidding? Of course he'll say no.

There's no way he'd ever go out with me.

He's just so dreamy.

I think she's choking.
Should we wake her up?

No, she's got to learn

She's getting it.

Peter, you want another waffle?

I can't, Lois.
I promised Janice I'd take her shift.

Can I get two eggs, scrambled, on toast?

Sure thing, honey.
Adam and Eve on a raft, wreck them!

I'd like a hotdog with ketchup

-You want in?
-Yeah.

Ugh, look at this. She's taped photographs
of Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry

on the inside cover,

as if she's some sort of
hip hybrid of those two things.

Ugh, yeah, like she could ever write
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

Brian, <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>
was not written by Virginia Woolf.

Yeah, obviously.

But, you know, it's pretty much about her.

It really isn't, Brian.

Let's just get into this, huh?

"Dear Diary, got down to 152 today.

"Think that's a nice weight for me."

Oh, here's another one.

"Dear Diary, just discovered
the music of John Denver.

"Wow-wee, where's this been?"

Hey, look at this.

"Kent is so incredibly sexy.

"He said hi to me today,

"Also, I learned a funny lesson
today in my pursuit of Kent,

"anal bleaching is better
left to professionals. LOL."

-Oh! Oh! Oh!
-No, no, no, come on, now, come on.

Jeez, it's just pages and pages
of stuff about this Kent guy.

She's really obsessed with him.

Well, obsession's not such a bad thing.

It got us the first printing press.

You're a whore, Sheila, and I'm gonna
make sure everybody knows it!

I can't read. No one can read.

We should get off the horse soon.

I want to save one for you.

I guess I got distracted again
thinking about Kent.

I've just got to ask him out.

WEST: Sorry!

Honey, give me any laundry you have.
I'm doing a diapers and Meg load.

Hey, Mom, can I ask you about something?

Of course, Meg. What's on your mind?

Well, there's this guy I like at school,
and I was thinking about...

I don't know, maybe calling him and...

Meg, are you asking, in this day and age,

when the CEO of Xerox is a woman,
when the president of Brazil is a woman,

even Rosie O'Donnell is a woman,

whether it's appropriate for a girl
to ask a boy out on a date?

Of course it's appropriate.

It's also sad and desperate
and I would never do it,

but you're not me, are you, sweetie?

No, I'm not.

(CHUCKLES) No, you're not.

(SIGHS)

And the Facebook campaign

Oh, Meg!

-Hey, what's up?
-Hey!

Um, nothing much.

I was just wondering if you, maybe,
wanted to hang out some time?

-Sure.
-(EXHALES)

Wow, cool!

-Okay, um, I'll text you?
-(BEEPS)

(SCREAMS) Yes! I can't believe it!

Oh, my God, I'm going out on a date
with Kent Lastname.

Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

(SCREAMS) Oh, my gosh!

I'm gonna go ahead and shut this for you.
(SLAMS DOOR)

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Oh, hello.

Hi, you must be Mrs. Griffin.

I'm Kent. I'm here to pick up Meg.

Oh, Kent, it's so nice to meet you.

She's just getting ready.

Meg, Kent's here!

Just putting on my lipstick.

Damn it.

And this is Meg's brother, Chris.

Oh, yeah, I've seen you around school.

You eat with the deaf kids, right?

One of them isn't all the way deaf.

What grade are you in again?

That's still being worked out
by a team of counselors.

Cool. Hope to see you around school.

He seems nice.

Sorry, I missed all that. I was tweeting.

Oh, sorry,

Boy, it's kind of chilly in here.

That was fun.
We should hang out again sometime.

Yeah, definitely.

-Well, good night.
-Night.

-Oh, no, I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God, I thought you...

-I didn't think this was a date.
-Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed!

Hey, it's 10:30!

I suggest you take your dope
and go elsewhere!

I'm sorry, Meg. I think you're great,
and I love hanging out with you,

but there's something you should know.

I'm gay.

You are?

Look, I really like you as a friend,
but to be honest...

-I like Chris.
-What?

Oh, for God's sake.
I have a shoe appointment in the morning,

and I want to be fresh!

Yeah, the person I'm attracted to
is your brother.

Brother?

Rupert, did you hear that?

Meg's boyfriend is in love with me.

Not that I care.

I mean, it won't matter once I explain
to him what's going on with us.

But what would I tell him
is going on with us?

(SOBBING)

Thanks, Brian!

Brian?

Hey, princess.

I'll get out of your hair.
I can see you want to be left alone.

Why does everything bad
always happen to me?

You and me both.

I got this cold.

(COUGHS)

And it's just in that

I-don't-want-to-give-it-to-a-friend stage,
you know?

(SNIFFLING) Oh, God, you hear that?
I sound like a Jewish See 'n Say.

(CLEARING THROAT)

OLD MAN'S VOICE: <i>"What?"</i>

MAN'S VOICE: <i>The aunt says...</i>

WOMAN'S VOICE: Oh!

Kent told me he's gay,
and even worse, he likes Chris!

Oh, wow, I'm really sorry
to hear that, Meg.

I don't get it.

I've been going to high school
with him for three years,

and I always assumed he was straight.

Well, high school's a tough time, Meg.

Maybe he thought he was straight,
but then realized he's gay.

He's probably still figuring things out.
Hang in there.

Well, I'll help him figure things out.

I'll help him figure out
that he's straight.

Oh, that was really close.

Hey, Chris, you mind if I sit here?

No, of course not.

We were just having
a political discussion.

Bill's, uh, kind of conservative.

Hey, you know, it was really cool
meeting you the other night.

I was thinking maybe
we should hang out sometime.

Sure. I sleep for, like,
six hours every day after school,

but other than that, I'm pretty open.

Well, great, then we should definitely...

Oh, hey, Meg.

Listen, I hope you're okay
after the other night.

Yeah, no, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about, Kent.

Look, I know you're going through
a confusing time.

The thing is, though,
I feel like you're not actually gay.

What? No, I told you, I am.

You don't talk or act gay.
I mean, you play football.

Those jeans cost 20 bucks, tops.

And you only use "hello" as a greeting,

not as a way to outdo some
imaginary antagonist in conversation.

Meg, please stop.

I know your heart's
in the right place, but...

Actually, it's not.
It's a serious medical condition.

(HEART BEATING)

Yeah, that's not supposed to be there,

so she should probably always wear a hat.

-Hey.
-Hey.

So I guess you heard
about Meg's boyfriend, huh?

I did. I did hear, yes.

Weird, right?
Guy has a crush on her own brother.

I know, so weird.

But, you know, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

I just hope it doesn't cause awkwardness,
you know, in the house.

Oh, no, it doesn't have to be awkward,
not if we don't make it awkward.

I just don't see the attraction.

I mean, is it all about that big package?

Big? You really think so?

Are you kidding? Biggest in the family.

That thing should be hanging
from the ceiling of a deli.

Thanks, Brian.

God, I have so much energy now.

Am I the only one
who feels like grabbing a drink?

(CHUCKLES)

Hey, do you think this picture is hot?

Kind of, yeah.

Well, guess what, that's my back.

Hook up with me! Come on!

We can make this work.

Just stick your head in here
and pretend it's a butt.

No, Meg, stop it.

God, this is getting too weird.

I can't be your boyfriend.

In fact, I don't even
think I can be your friend.

Kent, wait! We can totally be friends.

We can go shopping together.

And I like musicals.

I've even seen the latest
Tony Award-winning piece of crap.

(SINGING) <i>If more people join in</i>

<i>The song will get better</i>

<i>'Cause we're in the aisles</i>

<i>Even the bad guy is singing along</i>

They're singing right near me,
so it's a great musical.

Hey, Meg, what's wrong?

What's wrong is that Kent doesn't like me.

He likes my brother, Chris.

-Oh, my God.
-No way!

Well, I mean, you've done
everything you can do.

I guess you just have to move on.

Yeah, I mean, there's a lot
of sweet guy-trim at this school.

You don't understand.
He's all I think about.

I can't eat, I can't sleep.

Just thinking about him now
gives me heart palpitations.

(HEART BEATING)

I feel like if I could just know
what it's like to be with him,

just once,

I could at least have some sort of
closure.

Well, if Kent hooks up with your brother,

you could just have Chris
describe every last detail to you.

Oh, my God, that's it.

What do you mean?

I mean, if I can't have Kent,
then that's the next best thing.

I've just got to get Chris to sleep
with him.

Oh, no.

Here comes Mr. Davis with one of
his technically-not-illegal invitations.

Girls, I'm gonna be at the park later.

Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Bonnie.

I've put Stewie in the oven
a bunch of times.

As long as you come to your senses
within 15 minutes, everything's fine.

Lois, can I go Slip 'n Slide in the yard?

Has it been half an hour
since you've eaten?

Yes. Almost.

Okay, I just want to be sure
you don't get a cramp.

Yay! Poor people water fun!

Hey, Chris.

Can I ask you a question?

Sure, what's up?

Remember that "free hug" coupon
you gave me for my ninth birthday

-that I never used?
-Yeah.

Well, I'd like to use it.

Oh. Okay. Sure.

But I'd like to sort of upgrade it.

I'd like it to be a butt-hug with Kent.

What? Are you out of your mind?

Chris, please, just sleep with Kent
and then tell me all about it.

Forget it, Meg.
I can't just do stuff with another guy.

I'm not Derek Jeter. I like girls.

Ugh. Come on, Chris. Girls are terrible.

They're always backstabbing
and giving each other phony compliments.

Oh, wow, you are definitely
not afraid of dessert.

You know, I wish I were secure enough

to throw on any old thing
and call it an outfit.

Come on, you have so much body confidence.

I mean, who wouldn't
with those strong legs?

So muscular.

I'm jealous of how thick
with strength they are.

-Hey, I like your tie.
-Thanks.

(MAN READING IN SING-SONG)

Come on, Chris, he'll do all the work.

I said no, Meg.

I'll pay you a hundred bucks.

Fine, I'll keep it in my bum.
There'll be plenty of room.

That's my sarcastic way
of saying it's not gonna happen.

Good day, Meg.

Oh, it's gonna happen.

(RINGS DOORBELL)

-Oh, hi, Meg.
-Hi, Mr. Quagmire.

What can I do for you?

I was wondering
if I could borrow some roofies?

Oh, sure, sure, just a sec.

QUAGMIRE: Roofies, huh?

Pretty big pill for such a little girl.

Yeah, I know, but I asked
someone to do me a favor,

and they're not too keen on doing it.

QUAGMIRE: Oh, I know
what they're for, honey.

-So, how's school?
-Oh, good, thanks.

QUAGMIRE: Studies going well?

Yeah, yeah, mostly A's and B's
so far this semester.

QUAGMIRE: Oh, that's so great.

Seeing anyone special these days?

Hey, obviously, right?

-(BOTH LAUGHING)
-Of course, yeah.

Okay, well, listen,
good luck with everything.

And call me if you get arrested.

I will. Thanks.

That's what it's all about, Glenn.

Don't rape it back, rape it forward.

All right, I talked to Chris,

and he totally wants
to hook up with you, too.

No way! Really?
I didn't even know he was gay.

It's just that he's not as comfortable
with his sexuality as you are yet,

so he's gonna need to pretend
to be asleep while it's happening.

Oh. He's a snooze-juicer. Okay.

Wow, I didn't know Chris
had this dark side to him.

Oh, yeah, Chris has a major dark side.

My dad is actually really scared of him.

-(CREAKING)
-What... Who's there?

Go back to sleep, Dad.

Okay.

(WHIMPERING)

You're very precious to me.

Chris, I made some Kool-Aid!
You want some?

CHRIS: Sure!

Chris, what are you doing in my room?

-Nothing.
-Yes, you were.

You were putting something in my drawer.

What's this?

(SIGHS) Look, Meg, I know you've been
having a hard time lately,

so I wanted to give you something
that means a lot to me.

MEG: Oh, I remember this.

This was the trip our family took
to the Cape.

Ugh. It was miserable.

It was raining,
and Mom and Dad fought the whole time.

You taught me how to hunt squirrels
with poisoned cheese,

and then you took me to the hospital

when the squirrels tricked me
into eating the cheese.

Chris, you kept this photo
all these years?

Yeah, it's gotten me
through a lot of tough times.

Like when Felicity cut her hair.

What?

Oh, thanks, Chris.

That was really thoughtful of you.

Hey, so can I have
some of that Kool-Aid now?

No.

No, actually you can't.

Oh, Chris, hi. I didn't realize
you'd be awake.

What?

Well, Meg said you'd be asleep,
but it's fine. I can work with this.

Oh, hell no!

(YELLS) Meg!

Oh, my God. Kent,
I just texted you that the plan was off.

Meg, what the hell
were you planning on doing?

Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry.

I was so obsessed with Kent
that I guess I wasn't thinking straight.

I'm just glad I stopped
before I did a really terrible thing.

Terrible thing? What terrible thing?

Well, like I said, I changed my mind.
I didn't do it.

But, um...

I was kind of gonna roofie you.

-What?
-What is wrong with you?

And, Kent, I owe you an apology, too.

I lied when I told you that
Chris wanted to sleep with you.

Save it, Meg! I don't need your apologies!

I can see now
that you're a complete psycho!

Boy, clothes sure are a prison,
aren't they?

Lot of drum roll for nothing.

What's this? Ooh, candy!

Hey, Meg. I heard what happened.

Yeah, Kent hates me now.

You made a mistake.

I know you feel terrible,
but you're not a bad person, Meg.

You just need to get back out there,

and someday,
maybe you'll find the right guy.

-You really think so, Brian?
-I know so.

All it takes is one guy
making one mistake, one drunken night.

Sperm finding a fertile egg.

You refusing to do
what a sane woman would do.

You got him, Meg. You got him for life.

-Thanks, Brian.
-No problem.

Hey, do either of you know
what poison ivy looks like?

<i>Anyway, Joseph and Robby were hanging out</i>
<i>one day when this happened.</i>

So I went to see that new
Oedipus play last week.

Took my mother.
Talk about an awkward ride home.

Barely got a good-night kiss.

Hey, Joseph, check it out.

Oh, my God, look at that body.

Can't you just imagine her
standing on people's front lawns

inside a cut-in-half bathtub?

You should go talk to her
and see if she can talk.

Uh, hi. I'm... I'm Joseph.

Oh, hello. I'm Mary.

Listen, um, I was wondering
if you'd like to go out sometime.

Well, sure. That sounds nice.

You know, there's
a beautiful spot outside of town

where they dump all the foreskins.

You can sit on top and watch the sun set.

Oh, great, and maybe
we could slaughter a lamb

and light it on fire so that it rains.

Well, let's not go too fast.

Listen, I'll see you later, okay?

I've got to go sit in a circle
with the other women

and stare off into the fields.

All right, you got a date.

Yeah, I just hope it goes
better than my last one.

Wow, Joseph, that was great.

Yeah, I got to say
I'm a little disappointed.

When you said I could do you
in your mud hut,

I thought you meant something else.

PETER: <i>And so Mary and Joseph</i>
<i>began their courtship.</i>

<i>But even after several dates,</i>
<i>Joseph couldn't get to first base.</i>

<i>Not just because Mary was a virgin,</i>

<i>but because baseball would not</i>
<i>be invented for 1,800 years</i>

<i>and nobody knew what the hell</i>
<i>he was talking about.</i>

You know this is the same picnic basket
we drowned my sister in.

It was back when they were like,
"Drown all the girls,"

and then they were like,
"Don't drown all the girls,"

but she was born on
a drowning week, so, you know.

(SNEEZES)

Oh, look at that,
there's hardly any blood.

You're very healthy.

Well, I try to take care of myself.

Joseph, this is the most fun
I've had in a while.

That's good, that's good.

-Pull your pants down.
-What?

Come on, this is our seventh date.
It's completely natural.

Birds do it, bees do it,

dinosaurs, whom we live alongside, do it.

Joseph, I can't. People will talk.

So, what? They'll talk in Aramaic.

Do you understand that? I don't.

Look, you're very sweet,
but I have to save myself.

For who? There's only 30 people
in the whole world

and you're related to half of them.

I can't believe how hard
you're making me work.

Well, I do have a very good
virginity coach.

No, no, no.

Okay, I think I got it. How's this?

(IMITATING) No, no, no.

No, no, no.

Look, I can't explain it,
but something is telling me to wait.

Something deep, deep inside of me.

Stop talking like that or I swear to God

I'm gonna Pompeii all over this blanket.

(LAUGHING) Oh, you're silly.

Come on, let's just watch the show.

-(ALL SHOUTING ANGRILY)
-(SCREAMING)

Wow, she's really getting it.

Yeah, I know that girl,
that's Donna Magdalene,

and her sister's
a bigger slut than she is.

You know, we Jews got it right,
working with our hands.

Yeah, let those eggheads in Rome
do the brain work,

we Jews will do the brawn work.

Hey, Italians, put a book down
once in a while.

-Yeah, yeah, right.
-Definitely, yeah.

Put a book down.

Hey, so, uh, you've been seeing
that girl Mary for some time now.

She's pretty smoking.

Aw, man, she is so hot.

She's gonna go down in history
as "Hot Bitch Mary."

You know, I'm thinking
of popping the question.

-Really?
-Yeah, I figure I'm 14 now,

I'm not getting any younger.

Hey, look, it's the burning bush!

Hail Mary, full of guys.

Oh, come all ye face-full.

Come on, guys, that's really dirty.

Hi, Joseph.

Hey, Mary, what's going on?

Oh, I just thought I'd take a break

from pooping in the open street
to come see you.

That's nice.

Listen, can you come by my house later?

There's something important
I have to share with you.

Okay, sure. I'll come by around
that part of the day

when the sun goes away

and we're all terrified
it will never come back.

Okay, bye.

Wow, you're a lucky man, Joseph.

I know.

So, what have you got going on later?

I think I might hang out
in the town square.

I hear an oracle from Greece
is sending a funny message

and I want to be there when it arrives

(MESSENGER PANTING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

-Penis.
-Ha.

Hey, Mary.

Oh, hi, Joseph. Come on in.

Thanks. Hey, listen, I just got tickets
to see Cher in Bethlehem.

-You want to go?
-I guess. How close are the seats?

Row L-X-V-I.

That sounds great.

But, look, Joseph,
there's something I have to tell you.

I'm pregnant.

From my finger?

No, you don't understand.

God has blessed me with his child.

You banged Kevin God from South Nazareth?

No, no, Joseph, I mean God.

I'm carrying God's baby.

He... He sent down an angel.

(GASPS)

Fear not, pretty lady,
who ain't never had no relations.

I's been sent to bring you
the message that tonight

you's gonna be getting pregnant
with the Son of God.

It's a miracle, yay!

I am?

Yeah, and it's gonna be here soon,

so you might want to spruce yourself up.

Maybe walk in the creek a little bit.

Oh, and he probably
don't want me to tell you this,

but be ready 'cause he might give you

a little bit of a donkey punch.

So you're saying God got you pregnant?

Yes, Joseph. Glory in the highest!

Well, if it his will,
then his will be done,

and I am but his humble servant.

But I do have one question.

Was he bigger than me?

Joseph, it wasn't like that.

I felt nothing.

Oh. Little guy.

<i>No.</i>

(URINATING STOPS)

<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

(FLATULENCE)

<i>Sorry, this is turning</i>
<i>into something else.</i>

All right, kids, gather around.

Time to make our yearly terrible call
to Great Aunt Helen.

(BEEPING)

(PHONE RINGING)

-HELEN (ON PHONE): <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Aunt Helen.

It's Peter, Lois and the whole family.

-We're calling to say Merry Christmas.
<i>-HELEN:</i><i>Peter's lowest what?</i>

-We were just calling to...
<i>-</i>HELEN: <i>Are you there, dear?</i>

-I hope you got our card.
<i>-</i>HELEN: <i>We had quite a cold snap here.</i>

Okay, nobody talk,
we'll just wait for her to talk.

-Well, we just wanted to...
<i>-</i>HELEN: <i>Are you still there, dear?</i>

Damn it!

-So, how was the...
<i>-</i>HELEN: <i>It's been rather cold.</i>

<i>The pond froze over</i><i>a family of raccoons.</i>

-All right, well, Merry Christmas.
<i>-</i>HELEN: <i>Are you there, dear?</i>

Dad, can we hear
more of that story about the baby Jesus?

Ah, right. Now everybody listen up

while I stuff the rest
of this rhetoric down your throats.

Now, if you remember, Mary and Joseph
were on their way to Bethlehem.

Ugh, look at that.
I remember when this was all desert.

You know, when the baby comes,
we could probably homeschool him.

I can count up to nine.

Yeah, hey, so tell me one more time
how it is that God got you pregnant.

'Cause when you tell me the story,
it sort of makes sense.

But then when I tell the guys at work,

they poke all kinds of holes in it.

So, you guys are going to Bethlehem, huh?

I went there one time
on a donkeys' night out.

Oh, my God, I got so hammered!

(WHIRRING)

PETER: <i>And as Mary and Joseph</i>
<i>made their way to Bethlehem,</i>

<i>three wise men were preparing</i>
<i>for a journey of their own.</i>

<i>-Chris, did you get a haircut?</i>
-CHRIS: <i>I did.</i>

PETER: <i>I'm just noticing. Looks nice.</i>

Hey, what's this?

Hey, you guys, this says a King of Kings
will be born in Bethlehem,

and we are to go and pay tribute.

Hey, let me see that.

This says, "Three Magi or Resident."

I don't think they really care if it's us.

Yeah, I don't want to go, either.

Hey, isn't your mother-in-law
visiting tomorrow?

We're off to Bethlehem!

(CANNED LAUGHTER)

CHORUS: <i>Wise men</i>

Wow, I can't believe we're already here.

Yeah, it's amazing how small
the world is now

thanks to mules and camels.
You're anywhere, just like that.

Oh, my! You can really tell
we're in the big city now.

Yeah, they got everything here.

They got restaurants, they got museums.

They even got movies.

MALE ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming soon,</i>
<i>get ready to start seeing double!</i>

It's <i>Ben-Him and Ben-Her!</i>

<i>Starring Adam Sandler and...</i>

<i>Adam Sandler?</i>

Yoo-hoo, Benny!

That's my brother on that chariot!

I'm driving here!

Whoa!

(GROANING)

-CROWD: Ooh!
-Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

MALE ANNOUNCER (LAUGHS):
<i>And introducing that joke!</i>

<i>Ben-Him and Ben-Her!</i>

<i>Even Noah wouldn't put these two together.</i>

Cover your privates.
Everyone can coli-see-'em!

PETER: <i>Meanwhile, the three wise men</i>
<i>were making their way across the desert.</i>

Hey, did you hear they're coming out
with four more Commandments?

Ugh, all that stuff does is
interfere with small business.

Oh, no, we're out of water.
We gotta stop somewhere.

Look. That's King Herod's palace.

Maybe we can get water over there.

QUAGMIRE: Wow, look at that classy,
Middle Eastern house

with gold and marble.

People will always want to
live next to big Middle Eastern houses

with gold and marble.

Ugh, I'm so bored. How's the TV coming?

We are a long way off.

Excuse me.
We are three wise men on a long journey.

Could we trouble you for some water?

Sure. Not quite wise enough
to pack any, huh?

So, what brings you to Judea?

We're on our way to Bethlehem
to see a magic baby.

Magic baby? What's he do,
card tricks, rabbit in the hat?

Would he let someone in the audience
punch him in the stomach?

I'd like to punch a baby in the stomach.

You can't punch this baby.
He's the messiah.

Yes, they're even calling him
the King of Kings.

Yuck. He already sounds like a dick.

Okay, then how about this?
I'm the King of King of Kings.

Ha! New name! Called it!

Sounds like somebody's
a little threatened.

No, I'm not. Would a guy
who feels threatened

make sure all his advisors
are shorter than him?

Ha! You said it, King!

-That's telling him!
-Big guy!

You know what? Still, just to be safe,
I should probably kill that baby.

Then Jodie Foster will love me.

Welcome to the Motel Shiksa.

We won't leave the light on for you,

because what, do I work
for the electric company?

Yes, we were wondering
if you had a room available?

Sorry, we're all booked up.
Cher is in town.

You won't find a room in the city.

No room? Joseph, what are we gonna do?

Don't worry. I got this covered.

No rooms, eh?

Well, perhaps you have a room
for my good friend

fistful of sand.

Where's your money?

I spent it on sand.

I'm sorry, I can't help you.

But, sir, please, my wife is with child
and about to give birth.

And I am with burrito
and about to do the same.

Sir, if you don't leave now,
I'm gonna have to call IX-I-I.

Yeah, we... We did one of those earlier.

Yours is better, though.
We probably should've waited for yours.

(GROANING)

Joseph, my water just broke!

It's time! Oh, my God!

Please, you've gotta have
some place for us! We're desperate!

Well, there's a manger out back.
You can stay there.

That's fine, that's fine! We'll take it!

CHER (THROUGH SPEAKER): <i>Bethlehem!</i>

<i>I have one question for you!</i>

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

SINGING: <i>Do you believe</i>
<i>in life after love?</i>

(SIGHS) See? I told you
she'd open with that.

So Joseph and Mary
were turned away from the inn.

But, Dad, I still don't understand
the whole Immaculate Conception thing.

How can anyone get pregnant
without having sex?

Oh, there's lots of stories of that, Meg.

Cleveland's got a cousin
who had eight girlfriends get pregnant,

and he says he's not responsible
for a single one.

Good guy. You shake his hand, it feels
like you're touching a nice briefcase.

But back to our story.

All right, here we are.
This seems pretty gross.

I can't believe my baby's
gonna be the Son of God.

Looks like all those years fighting off
my own father's advances

have finally paid off.

What shall we name him?

Well, this is kind of like a barn.

We could call him Barney.

Yeah, maybe.

Or I kind of always liked Tristan.

Oh, my God, you want him
to get the crap beat out of him?

They will crucify him
with a name like that.

No, no, no.

What are you doing?
How long you been there?

Those names is no good.

Look, why don't y'all just give me a list,

I'll run 'em up to God,
and see if he picks one.

No. No.

That's the name of a champagne.

No. No.

Terrible. These are all just terrible!

Relax, God. You want me to get y'all
some wine and cheeses?

Wait, what'd you just say?

Cheeses. You want some cheeses?

And that's why you're allowed to eat

as much mozzarella as you want
in any church.

<i>So the three wise men set off</i>
<i>again on their journey.</i>

You sure this is the right way?

Yes, I'm sure. We follow the star.

Are you sure that's a star?

We've had this conversation!

Yes, it's a star!

It's got flashing red lights!

Oh, my God! It is a (BLEEP) plane!

I said that yesterday, you stupid idiot!

Hey, thanks for coming out
on such late notice, Doc.

Oh, you don't have to thank me.
This is a big deal.

It's not every day that God
bestows a woman with his son.

-Has it ever happened before?
-Yeah, once.

But the woman drank during her pregnancy.
The kid came out a real lemon.

I turned this water into poo!

Uh-huh.

I also turned this fish into poo!

Ah.

Do you want your birthday present?

I think I know what it is.

(LAUGHS) It's a cashmere sweater.

Oh, wow!

That's actually really nice.

And now it's poo!

(WOMAN SHRIEKS)

Well, here we are.

Okay, guys, squeeze in.
Bible photographer.

Okay, we're smiling,
we're happy to see Jesus.

There we go.

Hey, guys, watch your step in there.

That floor's gonna be dripping
in virgin olive oil.

-That's kind of hot.
-Gross.

Hello, we are the three wise men.

We came here following a star.

Those two statements
contradict each other.

We also come bearing gifts.

I brought frankincense.

I brought myrrh.

And I brought you a breast pump,

which in these times is just a guy.

When do I start?

Oh, he's coming!

Oh, it hurts so bad!

God, I hate working on Christmas.

Oh, here he comes.

(GRUNTS)

And BC turns to AD!

How's everybody doing?

Oh, he's a miracle!

Hey, if you're a virgin,
how come I shot out of there

like a greased-up cannonball?

Greetings! I have come to see
the newborn king,

but sadly, I bring no gift.

Well, what do you got in your hand there?

Uh, my drum.

Well, then it looks
like you got him a drum.

Pretty good gift.

But this is all I own.

It's what makes me the little drummer boy.

Yeah, the baby wants the drum.

Yeah! Drum!

Okay, nobody touch my hair.
I'm growing it out.

Also, I'm gonna start dieting
and working out

so I'm like crazy lean for the, you know,

for... (STAMMERING) For the thing.

-(HOOFBEATS APPROACHING)
-What the deuce?

Bring out the Christ Child! We want him!

Uh-oh.

(WHIRRING)

I may have a virgin mom,
but I am one bad mother.

(YELLS) Ahhh! You guys get him!
You guys get him!

I forgot something at the palace!

(IMITATING GUNFIRE)

(IMITATING EXPLOSION)

And that is the story of Jesus.

That was awesome, Dad!

Oh, my God! I just realized

that's the same Jesus
as the Jesus from church!

That's a beautiful story, Peter,
about people coming together

to form something greater than themselves.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Yes, can I help you?

Hi. We're from out of town
and our car just broke down.

My wife's in labor. Can we use your phone?

-What? No!
-LOIS: Peter, who is it?

Couple of freaking scumbags
working some scam,

saying how they want to use our phone.

What? Do they want
all the presents under the tree, too?

Get rid of 'em!

They're not gonna do that, are they?

Dad, shut the door, it's freezing!

Please, you've gotta help us!

You're lucky it's Christmas

or I'd call the cops
on you dirty grifters!

Now you and your whore wife
get out of here!

Peter, you handled that perfectly.

Merry Christmas, Lois.

MAN: Please! We're begging you!

I'm getting the baseball bat.

Chris, would you like
to read your personal essay?

Okay, Mrs. Donovan.

"Following Mrs. Donovan" by Chris Griffin.

"The first thing that Mrs. Donovan does
when she gets home from school

"is put on sweatpants.

"Then she eats a whole
tube of cookie dough,

"but she must be allergic to it

"because there are tears
coming out of her eyes

"and she always throws up right after.

"Then she puts paper doll clothes
on a picture of a sonogram."

Chris, I think you should stop.

What? I'm doing the best I can.

I'm not Nathaniel Hawthorne.

(CHUCKLING)

Nathaniel, what are you doing?

Just ruining ninth grade for everyone.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I called you in today

because your son, Chris, has been
getting in quite a bit of trouble lately.

In fact, just yesterday,
he tried to pass this drawing off

as his Advanced Art project.

-Oh, my.
-I'm very embarrassed.

Well, someone should be.

I'm sorry, Principal Shepherd.
We've tried talking to Chris.

We just don't know what else to do.

Well, I think we may have a solution.

We have these cats that hang around
the school, and we feed them.

Why doesn't Chris come in,
and we can treat him like one of the cats?

Then, in a couple of years,
we'll give him a diploma.

That doesn't sound like
he'll be getting the best education.

I don't know, Lois.

Some of those cats go on
to get pretty good jobs.

-(MEOWS)
-Yep.

Peter, I'm really worried about Chris.
What are we gonna do about him?

Let's face it, Lois, the kid's an idiot.

What the hell happened
to all the smart genes in this family?

I mean, I invent the razor blade comb,
and my kids are doing nothing.

I mean, when Chris grows up,

will he even be able to get a job

I just wanted to listen
to you guys have sex,

Chris! Oh, my God.
No, we weren't talking about you.

Yeah, we were talking about Meg.
We call her Chris so she doesn't know.

-MEG: (BLEEP) you!
-Shut up, Chris!

I know that's not true. (SOBBING)

Oh, God.

Peter, he heard us call him stupid.
His own parents.

What have we done?

Well, you know, Lois,
it's never easy hearing the truth.

Especially from a fortune cookie.

-What does it say, Peter?
-Just something about perseverance.

-What does yours say?
-It says I'm very creative.

Oh, by the way, there's a baby

-Ah!

He knows. He knows it's hot.

Peter, we've completely destroyed
his self-esteem.

We've got to do something.

You know, Lois,
if Chris is having confidence issues,

they have camps for kids like him.

What do you mean?

Well, they take kids who struggle
in school

and help them gain self-confidence
in a nurturing environment.

Wow. That's actually a great idea.

We don't got no money for camp.
We're saving up to go to Europe.

Peter, we went to Europe.
You didn't like it.

Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
My TV isn't here. Let's go home.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> Canadian Horror Story.

Hey, hon, we're out of Molson.

Oh, not to worry.
We've got some Labatt's in the garage.

And could you get one for the ghost?

Boo, eh?

Hey, Chris, could we talk to you?

If you're gonna insult me again,
just go away.

Look, honey, we're sorry,

and we want to do
something special for you.

This is a Hamilton Beach blender
we got on our wedding day.

It keeps coming back to us
in a vicious re-gifting cycle.

No, Peter.

Chris, we were thinking
of sending you to camp.

And we're going
to let you choose which one.

This one's called Camp Helmet.

This one's called Camp Sit 'N' Stay.

These camps don't sound fun at all.

Well, Chris, camp is only
as fun as you make it.

That's how it was in World War II.

Don't suppose it would help
to say I have a note from my doctor.

(CHUCKLES) Get in there, you.

Hey, this one looks cool. Space Camp.

"Spend a week doing
intensive math and science,

"learning from real astronauts."

Space Camp?

I'm sorry,

that one must have accidentally
gotten in with the rest of them.

What are you saying?
That I'm too stupid for it?

Chris, we're over here.

What are you saying?
That I'm too stupid for it?

No, no, of course not.

Then this is the camp I choose.

Yay! I get to go to Space Camp!

Thanks, Mom and Dad.
You guys are the best parents ever!

Would you excuse me a moment?

These are mine now.

Hey!

Oh, honey, when we accepted those mugs,
we knew this could happen.

You know, Chris, it's not too late
to change your mind about Space Camp.

Sometimes it can be tough
to fit in with a new group of people.

Yeah, I sure had my troubles
when I got involved with the Boy Scouts.

At no time were the campers
and Mr. Griffin naked simultaneously.

They merely engaged in horseplay.

Did Mr. Griffin sodomize the boys?

Mr. Griffin vehemently
denies all allegations.

Mom, I can handle Space Camp.
I'm not stupid.

Well, regardless, on the way back,

we're stopping at that
Down syndrome camp we passed.

Peter, that was the University of Florida.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

Welcome to Space Camp.

Hi. We're here to register
our son, Chris Griffin.

Oh, great to meet you, Chris.

Hey, this kid means the world to me.
Keep an eye on him, huh?

Hey, what's that? I thought all
the space shuttles were decommissioned.

Well, we always keep one
spacecraft flight-ready

in the event a satellite needs service,

there's a Space Station emergency,

or an Italian guy needs to over
exaggerate.

I swear to God, Johnny,
I've had it up to...

...here with your BS.

Oh, he's really had it this time.

-I'm sorry, Louie!
-All right, then.

Hey, what's that in there?

That's a sensory deprivation room
that prepares our astronauts

for the terrifying emptiness of space.

Oh, cool.
Hey, come on, Brian, try it with me.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Things got crazy so fast.

-Bye, Chris. Good luck.
-Take care, Chris.

Oh, and hey, if you get sent off
on a space mission, um,

don't be the black guy, 'cause you'll die.

I know you're gonna have fun
and make lots of good friends.

Yeah, and not fake friends,
like guys whose wives are friends.

-(LAUGHING)
-You have to get me that recipe.

Oh, my God, the cookbook?
It's right in the kitchen.

-Sports?
-No.

-Movies?
-No.

-Hiking?
-No.

-Cars?
-No.

-Porn? Yes!
-Porn? Yes!

-Gay porn?
-No.

Welcome to Space Camp, everyone.

Be sure to grab your physics textbooks.

And you may want to brush up

for tomorrow's lecture
on orbital dynamics.

Oh, man. I don't belong here,
and they know it.

People can always sense a fraud.

Gentlemen, it has come to my attention
that there's a Chinese among us.

Rest assured, he will be found.

Security is launching
a full-scale investigation

into the genealogy records
of every single one of our employees.

This man will be found,
and there will be dire consequences.

Too bad about that Chinese guy, huh?

Campers, we are now in our
state-of-the-art space shuttle simulator.

Hey, you're a girl.
I just figured that out.

By the time you leave Space Camp,

you will all be familiar
with every device on board this craft.

What's this button do?

Why don't you go ahead and push it?

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

That's my band.

Okay, campers, let's see
your astronaut haircuts.

Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

Chris, that's a Russell Brand haircut.

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Boy, I don't know what happened.

I went to me barber at the shop,
and I come out, I'm looking like this.

(LAUGHS)
You're talking different from how I talk.

Here's a bunch of money to be on TV.

If you all saw <i>Apollo 13,</i>

you know they had to fix an air scrubber
with just the tools in the capsule.

Griffin, I need you to use these tools
to fix my marriage.

I can't do that.

Well, I can't be the only one
who's trying.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

Oh, my God, Chris. What's wrong?

Mom, I hate it here. I want to come home.

All the kids are mean,
and I keep messing everything up.

Even Jinx the Robot is picking on me.

<i>Hey, you've got something on your shirt.</i>

<i>Joke complete.</i>

You and Dad were right.
I'm not smart enough to be here.

-Can you come get me, please, Mom?
-Okay, honey, of course we will.

-(PHONE BEEPS)
-Hang on, I got another call.

Hello?

Lois, I'm at the gym. I hate it here.
I want to come home.

Everybody's so mean.

And there's this one guy
who follows me around and calls me fat.

-Well, I suppose I...
-(PHONE BEEPS)

Hang on, honey, I'm getting another call.

Hello?

Hey, is fat ass home yet?
Put him on, I want to talk to him.

Thanks for coming to get me, you guys.

Hey, no problem.

We spent thousands of dollars
to send you here

and made two trips to Florida
in four days.

I'm glad we had you.

Well, I'm sorry.

I thought I could handle it here,
but I was wrong.

That's okay, honey,
everyone makes mistakes.

Yeah, remember when the fat man
brought home that cougar chick?

You make yourself comfortable, Beth.
I'll be right back.

Hi, young man. I'm looking for a
good time.

-Uh-huh.
-I'm worldly. I'm fun.

-This ain't mileage, this is experience.
-Not interested.

Listen, just so there are no surprises,
don't be scared,

my stuff looks like someone spilled
an apple pie in my lap.

Ugh.Yuck.

Didn't you have any fun at all, sweetie?

Well, I guess I did get to go
on the space shuttle every day.

Really? No way.

I always wanted to be an astronaut
like Lance Armstrong.

It's Neil Armstrong.

He lied about his name, too?

Wow, this is amazing, Chris.

Look at this, Lois,
a week ago, we call him stupid,

and now he's giving tours
of the space shuttle.

Negative reinforcement, that's the key.
Right, stupid?

(GROANS) I'll do better.

So, do you know how all this stuff works?

Well, I don't know
what most of these buttons do,

but I know this big red one
is the one you press to launch.

Ooh! Big red button!

-(BEEPING)
-Stewie, no!

-(RUMBLING)
-Uh-oh.

-Chris, make it stop.
-I'm trying.

I think... I think we're launching.

Oh, my God, everyone strap yourselves in.
Stewie, hold my hand.

No, thank you, I prefer to die
giving you the finger.

If this is what it takes
to get out of Florida, fine.

You know what? You only live once.
I am sticking my head out the window.

Yes, this is the best version
of whatever's so enjoyable about this.

Mom, I'm scared.

I don't believe it.
Are we really stuck in space?

Oh, God, what if we have
to live up here for the rest of our lives?

I'm gonna miss drinking at The Clam.

I'll tell you what I won't miss.
That waiter who thinks he has to be funny.

Yes, I'd like the chopped salad, please.
And could I get no onions on that?

Hmm. I've got a few connections
in the back. I'll see what I can do.

Yeah, that's funny.

If there's one onion on that salad,

you can forget the $1.80 tip
you need to live.

I'm sorry, you guys. This is all my fault.

I never should've brought you
on the space shuttle.

You were right, I am stupid.

-MAN: <i>Hello, up there.</i>
-Hello?

<i>I know you all must be</i>
<i>pretty terrified right now,</i>

<i>but we're doing everything in our power</i>
<i>to get you safely back to Earth.</i>

<i>We're pretty good at this.</i>
<i>We're like six for eight.</i>

Is there anything we can do?

<i>Well, fortunately,</i>
<i>the ship runs on autopilot.</i>

<i>We just need some time</i>
<i>to figure out your coordinates</i>

<i>and calculate the reentry plan.</i>

<i>So just try to stay calm</i>
<i>and we'll figure this all out.</i>

<i>By the way, you're all quite famous now.</i>
<i>You're on every news channel.</i>

<i>Good afternoon, I'm Brian Williams.</i>

<i>Our top story,</i>
<i>an accidental space shuttle launch</i>

<i>that has sent</i>
<i>a Rhode Island family into orbit.</i>

<i>For more on the story,</i>
<i>we go to our local affiliate,</i>

<i>Channel Five Quahog, where</i>
<i>Tom Tucker is on the scene. Tom?</i>

Thanks, Brian.

I saw that you opened my birthday Evite.
Now I just need you to go ahead and reply.

I'm standing here
at the home of the Griffin family,

chatting with their neighbors.

So, the Griffins might be dead.
How does that make you feel?

Griffin, dead? I take.

No, no, they might be dead.
They also might still be alive.

Is okay, I take.

-Peter, what are you doing?
-I'm going out for a spacewalk, Lois.

You know, this is our one chance

to experience the awe-inspiring wonders
of space firsthand.

PETER: Wow, neat.

So, this is space.

Damn it.

(LAUGHING)

PETER: Ha! Stupid drunk bitches.

Hey, Brian, check it out.
Meg's poking around the cargo hold.

I'm gonna give her a little scare.

(SNIFFS) Oh, boy, I think
this space food has gone bad.

Peter, that's a fecal collection bag.

Oh, there's a bag for that?

'Cause mine's over there
twirling in the air like a slow baton.

MAN: <i>Griffins, come in.</i>

Yes! Yes, we're here.

<i>Well, I have some good news.</i>

<i>The autopilot is capable</i>
<i>of taking you home.</i>

<i>-But, guys...</i>
-(STATIC CRACKLING)

<i>...to engage, we're gonna...</i>

<i>...to take the shuttle out of...</i>

Hello?

Hello? Crap, I think we lost him.

Let me fix that.

If radio deejays have taught me
anything about radio,

it's that you got to do two things.

Turn it up and rip the knob off.

Peter, no!

Damn it, now we've lost
communication entirely.

What are we gonna do?

I don't know, but we got to try something.

If we don't get this shuttle
out of orbit soon,

we're gonna run out of oxygen and die.

-Is failure an option?
-No, it's not.

Aw. That was my suggestion.

All right, come on, everyone,
we got to put our heads together

and try to find a solution.

Don't worry, Griffins have a long history
of figuring stuff out.

Like my great-grandfather
who invented the first marital aid.

This gives me an idea.

She's dead.

All right, come on,
if Mission Control thought

we could help get the shuttle out
of orbit, it can't be that hard.

Okay, okay, uh, try this.

Hit up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

Then we'll have unlimited lives.

Come on, we're running out of time.

Oh, Meg, all your suicide threats
over the years,

and you're just as chicken (BLEEP)
as the rest of us.

Hey, guys, I think I have an idea
that could help us.

In Space Camp, we learned about
countering forward momentum

with retro rockets.

If we use them now,
the ship might slow down enough

for gravity to pull us out of orbit.

PETER: That's an egg that I hucked at you
for being a nerd.

Chris, if you think it'll help,
just try it!

Oh, we're slowing down.
That's a good sign.

You know what's not slowing down?
<i>Breaking Bad.</i>

Haven't seen anything like it
since <i>The Wire.</i>

God, he never shuts up about those shows.

Oh, my God! I think it might be working!

(ALL SCREAMING)

BRIAN: We're spinning out!

Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

There's so many things I didn't do.
I never got to go to college!

My book wasn't all
I wanted it to be in spots!

-Peter, I wanted to grow old with you!
-Well, you kind of did.

I never got to wear it better!

(GRUNTS) We have to reorient
the retro rockets

to counter the spin rotation!

Chris, what are you doing?

Saving our lives.

Aw, I wish he hadn't said that.
Now I'm kind of rooting against him.

We're straightening out!

Look! It says "autopilot engaged."

Good for him. I'm glad he found someone.

Oh, thank God, we're saved!

I can't believe I got to go to space
before Derek Watson.

-Who's Derek Watson?
-Nobody now.

They've re-entered the atmosphere!

(CHEERING)

I'm not cheering. I don't even know them.

(ALL CHEERING)

(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

Well, thanks to no gravity in space
my spine stretched,

and I am now a confident 6'3",

so, Lois, I will be leaving you
for a hotter woman.

Never mind, Lois, I love you so much.

Chris, our family is alive right now
because of you.

You saved us.

That's right, buddy.
It was your brains that pulled us through.

We're so sorry we ever doubted you.

-Thanks, you guys.
-You bet, champ.

Hey, by the way, who moved our house?

"If you see only one play as an adult,

Those are hilarious.

This is amazing, Brian. How do you feel?
You're a hit!

It's overwhelming.

and respect my writing.

I want to write a play!

have gone missing.

-Oh, please.

We both know those are the ingredients
used to make crystal meth.

And I've got a pretty good idea
who you've been selling it to as well.

Oh, hey, uh, Beaker,

when you're done talking to your friend,
I want to, uh...

(GRUNTS) I want to talk to you
about that thing.

Hey, what you doing?

I was going to start
rehearsing my new play.

-Want to hear it?
-Aw, you actually wrote a little play.

Aw. Boy, I wish I could hang out,
but it has just gotten so crazy.

-Really?
-I know, right?

I mean, I'm not complaining, you know?
But I just... I want my old life back.

(GROWLS)

(CHUCKLES) I'm just kidding, of course.
I'm so grateful, you know?

I mean, every performance is sold out
and they just added a Wednesday matinee.

It's great. I mean, there's only one thing
I'm not getting out of this experience.

-What's that?
-Sleep.

(GROWLS)

(CHUCKLES) No, no, I'm so grateful really.
It's just that I'm so busy all the time.

But it's great. It's all great.

Well, do you think
you might have time to read it?

(EXHALES) All right, all right.
But be patient, all right?

I've got interviews
and appearances all week.

I mean, they're squeezing
every last drop they can out of me,

like a bottle of ketchup.

Listen, we've been at this for 15 minutes.
I don't think anything's coming out.

-I'm fine. I can keep going.
-I'm just really tired.

What if I stick my finger in your hole?

That only works when I'm already close.

The American play was dying.

Oh, God, Allison,
how do I even answer that?

Uh, I mean, what's a rainbow's process?

Two parts rain, one part sun,
one part childlike wonder.

What we do know, though, is that
the end result in both cases is joy.

Wow. Wow, are you glad
you left the lighthouse now, Seamus?

Oh, I think so, Seamus!

Excuse me, I noticed you were
talking loud, so that means you're smart.

But would you mind, and I hate asking,
but would you mind signing this?

Is this guy giving you a hard time, Brian?

-Naw, he's all right.
-All right. Cool, cool.

How you doing, buddy?

My God.

It's miraculous.

(BLEEP)

Hey, Brian, can you read my play?

(PETER FARTS)

Sorry, there was
a fart trapped in the play.

-Hey, Jasper, how are you?
<i>-Hey, Brian!</i>

<i>-Congratulations on your new play.</i>
-Oh, thanks.

<i>What's wrong? You look awful.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

I read the play Stewie wrote.

<i>She writes plays now?</i>

Yes, and it was brilliant.

Jasper, I've never read anything
like it in my life.

It was insightful
and fresh and intelligent.

It's like his play is mocking me.

He wrote it in a night.

<i>Ugh, that's how I feel whenever</i>
<i>I see Brad Goreski on Bravo.</i>

<i>God, everyone's on Bravo but me.</i>

<i>Anyhoo, have you told him how good it is?</i>

No. I just read it.

He gave it to me
'cause he wanted my feedback.

<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>
<i>Tell Stewie it's awful, it's garbage.</i>

<i>Do whatever you have to do, Brian,</i>
<i>but never let him know he's got talent.</i>

Yeah, you're right.

It won't be so hard.

After all, I've certainly done worse.

I replaced Peter's
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!

with real butter.

(GIBBERING)

I... I can't... I can't believe...

(GIBBERING)

(SCREAMING)

I don't know, Doctor.

Looking back,
I think it may have been real butter.

Your husband murdered three children.

Oh, my God. Look at this.
Brian, get in here!

-What?
-Your play has been nominated

for a local Hoggy Award
for Best Creative Anything.

Oh, that's great.

Um...

I'm gonna... I'm going to go get some air.

Look at that. Nominated for an award.

What have you two done today?

-I found a lump under one of my balls.
-Okay, that's something.

I ate three quarters
of an Entenmann's strudel.

Youse are good kids.

Hey, so did you get a chance
to read my play?

Uh, I did. I did.

Ooh, I'm so nervous. What'd you think?

Stewie, you and I are friends, right?

Yeah, I mean, I know you
through our mutual friend, Greg,

but sure, I'd say we're friends now.

Exactly. And as your friend,

you'd want me to be
honest with you, right?

Totally.

-It wasn't good.
-Oh, no, really?

Oh, I worked so hard on it.

Oh, I thought it was good. Oh.

I know, I wanted it to be good so much.

Oh, I am so bummed out right now.

Now I don't even know
if I should submit it.

-(STAMMERING) Submit it?
-Yeah, I was planning to submit it

to the Roundabout Theater
Company in New York.

No! I mean...
I mean, that would be a bad idea.

Definitely not.

No, no, they won't
let you down easy like I did.

New York can be pretty harsh,
especially to outsiders.

Hello, New York!

(SCREECHING)

Maybe you're right. I'll think about it.

Anyway, can I have that back?
It's my only copy.

-Your only copy?
-Yes.

And thank you for being a good friend
and telling me the truth, Brian.

I know that was hard for you.

And to show my appreciation
for reading my play,

I made you this.

Wow, "Good dog." And it's official?

That's what it says, doesn't it?

I wish my dad was alive to see this.

-Hey.
-Who the hell are you?

I'm the guy Stewie pays
to watch him sleep.

-Who are you?
-I'm Brian. I live here.

Oh.

-Do you mind if I take this script?
-Yeah, sure, whatever.

He just pays me to watch him sleep

and rub this knife
across my face while I do it.

(RASPING)

Okay.

-Hey, how much does Stewie pay you?
-$4,800 a week.

-(BLEEP)
-Yeah.

-Hey, Brian.
-Oh, hey, Stewie.

Listen, have you seen my play?

You know, Stewie, I have seen your play,
and it is exhilarating to me.

A child's play is one of the most
beautiful things in the world.

Continue to play, little one.
You're our future.

What the fuck are you talking about?

The play I wrote. Have you seen it?

Uh, I don't know. Let me call my lawyer.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hello.
I'm being cross-examined.

No, I haven't... I haven't seen it.

Really? 'Cause I had it
sitting right on my table...

I said I haven't seen it, all right!

And what does it matter?
It was terrible anyway!

We've had this conversation!
Do yourself a favor and move on!

Well, that's interesting, Brian,
because I found this

buried in the backyard
next to your soup bone.

(GASPS)

Stewie, I...

You tried to destroy it, didn't you?

I knew my play was good.

Just like I knew your play
was a mediocre patchwork

of hackneyed ideas and tired clichés.

You have no idea how hard it was

to sit in that theater
with all those braying hyenas.

Couldn't you tell something was up

when Chris and the fat man
could follow the plot?

I mean, it took Peter a year
to figure out <i>Stuart Little.</i>

I just figured it out.
"Stuart" means "mouse."

No, Peter.

-"Little" means "mouse"?
-No, Peter.

I feel so old and in the way.

It's still a good play!

It's filled with terrible double
entendres, puns and stolen bits.

-There's a line in there from <i>Seinfeld!</i>
-I never saw that episode!

I have a voice. Do you understand that?

A writer needs a voice, and I have one.
You don't.

Your play panders to the lowest
common denominator, Brian.

-And it doesn't even do that well.
-Shut up!

May every person
that laughs at your sophomoric effort

be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity
and pierce your heart like a knife.

(PANTING)

(SQUIRREL CHATTERING)

Come here, you bastard!

(BARKING)

You stink! And your play stinks!

This ain't about me, is it?

(SOBBING)

(INHALES SHARPLY)

(SNIFFLING) No.

And I'm sorry,

but nobody can ever know that.

(CRACKS)

-Donna? It's Grant, your new husband!
-DONNA: Hi, honey.

GRANT: I've got great news.
DONNA: What is it?

GRANT: First,
where do we keep the good scotch?

DONNA: At your brother's house.

(CROWD AND PETER LAUGH)

PETER: Lois, can I have my birthday here?

-Seems to be going well.
-What do you want?

Wanted to share a bit of good news.

I just found out that my play
is going to be produced on Broadway.

What?

And I'm taking Randall
Evan Battincourt with me.

Hi, Stewie. I'll be right there.
I just got to finish this crap.

Hey, I need you to take me to New York
for the opening night of my play.

(SCOFFS) No way.

Besides, I checked, and there's no play
by Stewie Griffin opening in New York.

I submitted it under a pseudonym.

They think it was
written by Tony Dovolani.

I thought your pseudonym
was Gorgeous Randy Flamethrower.

That's my dodge ball pseudonym.

Look, if you won't take me,

I'm sure the New York Theater
League would send a car.

New York Theater League? Why?

Because they're throwing
a welcome dinner in my honor.

Really?

Well, I guess I could clear my schedule.

Oh, you won't regret it, Brian.

All the most important
Broadway people will be there.

Playwrights, money men,
even Stanley Kowalski.

-Hi. I'm Michael.
-Michael!

Michael!

-Um, and this is my wife, Nancy.
-Nancy!

Nancy!

And this is our Uzbekistani
friend, Bokyavroychesku.

Hi.

(PEACEFUL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

Stewie, don't you think
you're overdoing it with that outfit?

I don't wear anything
I can't take off with a flourish.

Wow, this is amazing.
Every major playwright is here.

Yes, and it seems to be
quite a successful party.

Several of them
have already committed suicide.

-Great party.
-Totally!

-MAMET: Hey, Tony.
-Oh, my God, that's David Mamet.

There's the man of the evening.

I read your play, <i>An American Marriage.</i>

It was incredibly raw.
I was pretty damn impressed.

Oh, thank you, David.

David, this is Brian. Brian, David.

Oh, it's an honor.

Listen, I just want to say

what an inspiration
<i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> was to me

-when I was writing my own play.
-Easy.

Is that Tony Dovolani?

Hello. Alan Bennett.

-Fantastic play.
-And I'm Yasmina Reza.

-Oh, are you his night nurse?
-No, I'm a playwright.

I wrote <i>Art</i> and <i>God of Carnage.</i>

I won a Pulitzer.

You want to say your
grade point average, too?

Boy, it's just so weird to be in a room

where every single person
in the room is a playwright.

Every single one of us.

Everyone.

Including me. I'm a playwright.

Brian, my God, take it down a notch.

You're a playwright? In New York?

-Well, Quahog, Rhode Island.
-You're kidding.

We just went and saw a play
in Quahog, Rhode Island.

-Really?
-Have you ever heard of <i>A Passing Fancy?</i>

-I have!
-Oh, my God, what a load of rubbish.

We have this thing where we go
to the worst regional theater we can find

and laugh ourselves sick.

And this one took the grand prize.

(LAUGHING)

Really?

(STAMMERING) I had heard only good things.

It was a (BLEEPING) piece of (BLEEP)
on a (BLEEP)!

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God.
I got to hear David Mamet curse in person.

Oh, there you are.

That was the worst night of my life.

It's not like you were
the only fat guy in there.

-What?
-Oh, this is about the play. Sorry.

(SIGHS) I was so happy
until I read your play, Stewie.

I finally had some kind
of success as a writer.

It wasn't big, but it was mine.

I was fine being an okay writer,

until I discovered I was living
in a house with a brilliant one.

I know we don't talk
about doggy years a lot,

but I just wish you could have waited

to find out how talented you were
until I was gone.

By the time I'm dead,
you won't even be 10.

You'll have 70 more years to be great.

I just wish I could have
had five to be good.

There's your voice, Brian.

It's a depressing voice, but it's yours.
Write from that.

Listen, me and the other playwrights
are going out to have drinks

with Woody Allen and his daughter-wife.
You want to come?

All right. We can just
sit here for a while.

They talked a lot more crap
about you after you left.

-Oh, God, that was just terrible.
-Terrible.

I don't understand.

Stewie, what happened
to the play you wrote?

-That was terrible.
-Well, I gave it a final polish.

Changed a few things.
Guess I kind of mucked the whole thing up.

But how? You...

Wait.

Did you do that for me?

What are you talking about?
I'm a young writer.

I just wasn't as ready as I thought I was.

Maybe in a couple of years, who knows?

Stewie, you shouldn't have done that.

But thanks.

No problem, Brian.

Hey, what do you say we head back home?

That sounds good.

You know, I'm going to move
to New York City when I'm older,

'cause it's twinkly and big
and this is where dreams come true,

and that giant bird's
coming for us, isn't he?

Hey, why do you have
a Harvard dining hall ID?

I pulled over some punk Harvard kid

who gave me a bunch of lip,
so I took his ID.

Man, I bet they got fancy food
up there at Harvard.

Like them turkeys with paper shoes.

Or pigs with apples in their mouths.

Or them lambs
what ain't never seen the light before.

Oh, yeah, I love eating food that's sad.

Hey, you know, we should drive up there
and use that card to eat for free.

That's a great idea! Let's go to Harvard!

Oh, I don't know, you guys.

We'll be as out of place there
as a black guy in Sweden.

ALL: Ooh!

(SPEAKING MOCK SWEDISH)

Wow, so this is it. Harvard University.

The alma mater of Fred Grandy,
Amy Brenneman and Ted Kaczynski.

Are we sure this is
the way to the dining hall?

Oh, I'm sorry, are your
feet getting tired?

God, I'd love to be able
to wheel around in a toy all day.

Ah, this is it, you guys.
The Harvard Dining Hall.

Holy crap! This place is amazing!

And just think, this is where Helen Keller
used to eat when she went here.

Tonight, I want to go out
and just get wasted.

And not one of these campus bars.
I want to get wrecked by a townie.

Helen, you're outrageous.

I can't believe you're getting away
with this.

I've been getting away with this
since I was seven.

Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

Good morning, girls. Helen.

(MOANING INCOHERENTLY)

No freaking way.

They have breakfast for dinner.
Lois never lets me do that!

(TOUCHTONES BEEPING)

(RINGING)

Lois, do you have any idea
what I'm looking at right now?

LOIS: <i>Peter, we're not doing this again.</i>

I am at Harvard,

the smartest school in the country,
and they have...

<i>Peter, breakfast for dinner is anarchy.</i>

It's fun, Lois! It's whimsical!

<i>It's ridiculous!</i>
<i>Pancakes are not a nighttime food.</i>

-You're ridiculous!
-(BEEPS)

Boy, breakfast for dinner is a real
hot-button issue for you guys, huh?

She's also mad 'cause I shook Stewie
and now he's walking weird.

Hey, was <i>Beowulf</i> a <i>Teen Wolf</i> sequel
with Scott Baio?

-No.
-Ugh.

Then I just totally failed
that Medieval Lit midterm.

So this is a Harvard bar, huh?
Seems pretty normal.

Hey, check it out,
there's the Winklevoss twins.

-Let's get a drink.
-Get a drink.

Let's get a drink. I thought of it first.

Hey, you guys noticed how many Asians
there are at this school?

-I mean, how'd they all get so smart?
-I don't know.

Guess that's just the way God made 'em.

Gentlemen, I give you the Asian.

ALL: Ooh!

Compact, hairless and fiercely
intelligent.

The penises, while tiny,
are extremely efficient.

We're projecting 10 billion within
five years.

Also, there'll be different varieties

that will all hate each other
for some reason.

-Do they eat just, like, regular food?
-No, no, no, the opposite.

(SLOW DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

(MEN WHOOPING)

All right, this is more like it.

Way better than that lame-ass
college joint.

Yeah, finally a terrible Boston bar
with a giant low-def TV.

Let's go, Celtics!

I think that's <i>The Dr. Oz Show.</i>

What are you talking about? This
is the last scene of <i>Independence Day.</i>

Hey, look, even the bartender's low-def.

Hey, what can I get you fellas?

-Hey, what do you say we get some shots?
-Yeah! Let's get wasted!

Yeah! Let's get wicked bombed!

Sorry, pal, we already
have an intense wheelchair guy.

Well, now, hold on, hold on.

-What's your name, friend?
-Peter.

Yeah, we already got a wheelchair guy.

Oh, hey, Stewie.

Hey, sometimes when
daddies drive home drunk,

they come from faraway places,

but it's okay
because they didn't get arrested

and they're still kind of drunk
so they think it's okay.

You should know that Mom
has emotionally let you go.

It won't be long before she takes a lover.

Oh, my head!

She already has two cell phones.

Oh, man, what happened last night?

WOMAN: (WITH RASPY VOICE)
I can tell you what happened.

What the... Who the hell are you?

Who the hell do you think I am, sweetie?

-Oh, no. You mean...
-That's right, baby.

As of last night, we're man and wife.

By the way, I need you to call my pimp
and tell him I quit.

Oh, my God, I...

-I married a hooker?
-Married?

All right, bachelor party!
Come on! Back to Boston!

(ENGINE STARTS)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Oh... Oh, damn it. I guess we're
not going.

Hey, Stewie, here's five bucks. Get naked.

This can't be possible!
I can't be married to a prostitute!

Where will you two be going
on your scummymoon?

And can I plan your bridal golden shower?

-I don't even know your name!
-It's Charmese.

-Perfect.
-Listen, Charmese,

I was obviously very, very drunk.
This whole thing is a huge mistake.

Now, we got to fix this right away.

Like hell we do, sweet cream.

This is just what I've always wanted,

to settle down, find a husband
and live the married life.

And now I got that.

Your new wife is a human toilet.

Look, I don't remember
anything about last night.

How do I even know we're really married?

I got our marriage certificate right here.

It's legit.

And it looks like I signed
one of the witness lines

and Peter partially signed the other.

(CHUCKLES) Joe, look.

You know, after 40 years in my line
of work,

I've learned the difference
between true love

and doing the entire bowling team
of a pizza restaurant

on a box spring by a brook.

This is true love.

Hey, what's our last name again?

You know, Quagmire,
I was thinking last night,

I might remember Charmese
from a stag party in 1991.

Ask her if she remembers
getting hit in the forehead

with a meatball sandwich.

You guys, I can't stay married to her.

This whole thing is a complete disaster!

In fact, you know what?

I got to go down
to the courthouse right now

and file for divorce. This thing ends now.

Hang on, Quagmire.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

Quahog has some extremely
draconian laws governing divorce

that all heavily favor the woman.

-What? What do you mean?
-Well, to be honest,

if you divorce her,
she'll probably get everything you have.

What? No, that's impossible!
I can't lose all my money and my house!

Then I'll have to move into some
depressing divorced-guy apartment!

As you can see, we have plenty
of cabinet space for your plate.

The oven, of course, is just decorative.

Seems okay.
Do you have any other units available?

This is our only one.

-I hope you're happy, Marsha!
-(THUDS)

We might have something upstairs.

Sorry, Quagmire,
but the only way around the law

-is if the woman consents to a divorce.
-Consent?

But Charmese will never agree to that.

You heard her,
the crazy skank wants to be a wife.

She's found herself a husband
and she's not letting go.

I bet she's what happens

if you put a Hooters girl
in the microwave on "high."

Well, the only other choice
is to let her take all your money.

Ugh. Well, I obviously can't do that. I
guess I'm just gonna have to suck it up...

Let her suck it up, she's the expert.
Sorry, keep going.

...and at least try to make
things work with Charmese.

And who knows?
Maybe it won't be that bad.

After all, I liked her enough
to marry her last night.

I must've seen something in her.

There you go, that's the spirit, buddy.
There's a little bit of good in everyone.

Except that president guy
from <i>The Hunger Games.</i>

He was pretty bad.

This year, in addition to the Hunger
Games,

we're going to do
the Special Hunger Games.

-I'm Andy!
-I love you, Andy!

Come on, guys, fight.

So, Doc, I figured if Charmese and I
are gonna live as man and wife,

I ought to get her checked out.

Of course. Charmese, when's the last time
you had a pelvic exam?

-When was the Missouri Compromise?
-Uh, I think 1821.

-Then I've never had a pelvic exam.
-All right, I'm going in.

If I tug on the rope twice,
that means pull me out.

God, who are the pigs

who just throw
their empty beer cans down here?

Hey, Charmese.
You know, I really love your clothes.

I found a lot of them
on strung-out teenage corpses.

That's so lovely.
But I was thinking, maybe this afternoon

you'd like to borrow my credit card
and buy yourself a new wardrobe.

You know, something
a little more conservative.

Really? That's so sweet, Glenn.

No one's ever cared
about me like that before.

Thank you.

Sit anywhere you like.

That chair with the garbage bag
taped over it looks pretty good.

Meg, you look pretty next to her.

So, Charmese,

I was thinking of writing an article
about you for my school paper.

Do you charge black guys more or less?

Mmm. That's a hard question to answer.
Most of them get a group rate.

Come on, now, let's not talk about work.
It's a dinner party.

Are you and Glenn thinking about children?

Unfortunately, I can't have children.

Oh. Menopause?

No, I got knifed in the vagina one
Christmas.

Oh, the holidays are always stressful.

I have $3.74. Do something to me.

(SPITS)

I love you.

I want to take you away from all this.

They're supposedly putting
an ice cream place

where the shoe store was.

Excuse me, Lois, where's your bathroom?

I got to check on a whistling sound.

Upstairs, to the left.

Um, I'm obsessed with Charmese.

Hey. Let's do it.

-What? You mean, like sex?
-Yeah, and we should go now.

I just stuffed everything back into place.

Uh, you know, Charmese,
I don't really think I'm in the mood.

What? You're never in the mood.

We've been married two weeks,

and we haven't done it since that
first night.

I haven't gone two weeks without sex
since I was in a coma for six weeks.

Yeah, sorry, Charmese,
I'm just not feeling it.

Geez, what the hell's your problem?

-What are you, gay or something?
-Excuse me?

You heard me. Are you some kind of 'mo?

Oh, God, please tell me I'm
not married to some Nancy boy.

Why? Would that be a problem?

Are you kidding? 'Course it would.

My dream is
to live the married life and settle down.

-I can't be doing that with no gay.
-I see.

Well, Charmese, I have something
to tell you, and this isn't easy.

-But I'm gay.
-What? No. You can't be.

I was gonna be your perfect little wife.

I was gonna make you breakfast
maybe once a week,

and give you stuff to do

right when you walk
through the door after work.

And I would've loved that, Charmese, if
I just weren't so super-duper double gay.

(SOBBING)

This is awful.

Oh, don't cry, Charmese.
You'll find the right guy.

There's someone for everyone.
Even if you're a narcissistic pedophile.

Hey, Ma, we got any pictures
of me when I was a kid?

Maybe something in a tub?

-I'm really sorry it didn't work out,
Glenn. -Me, too, Charmese.

I'll send the divorce papers to that Rite
Aid where you brush your teeth.

-(DOOR CLOSES)
-(ENGINE STARTS)

-Hey, buddy, what happened? She gone?
-Yep, I'm off the hook, Peter.

I told Charmese I was gay,

and now she's gonna consent
to a no-fault divorce.

That's brilliant, Quagmire.

It's the exact opposite
of what Hugh Jackman does.

Pretend you're gay to get out of marriage.

Oh, thank God.
I really dodged a bullet there.

I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

Everybody makes mistakes. Even doctors.

(CHARGING)

-You forgot to say...
-I forgot to say "clear."

Ah, finally, back to my old life.

Hello, Internet porn.

Man, I haven't done this in two weeks.
I should weigh myself before and after.

Sorry, I forgot my prescription mouthwash.

-(SCREAMS)
-Oh, my God. What are you watching?

That's straight porn.

Listen, Charmese,
it's not what you think, all right?

I've been poisoned,
and I'm trying to make myself throw up.

Gay men don't watch straight porn.

-You lied to me, you son of a bitch.
-No, no, I'm gay, I swear!

Here, watch me, go there.

Jen Aniston?
More like Jen Can't-get-a-man-iston!

See? I went there.

Damn it, Glenn, if you're not gay,
then the divorce is off.

No, no, I am. I swear to God.

All right, fine.

If you're really gay
and you want that divorce,

all you got to do is one thing.

-Anything, Charmese. Name it.
-Prove it.

-Let me watch you have sex with a man.
-(STAMMERS) What?

You heard me.
I want to see you get it on with a guy.

(SIGHS)

All right, Charmese, I'll do it.

If that's what it takes,
I'll have sex with another man.

(RINGS)

Look, Daddy.

Teacher says every time a bell rings,

some gay guy's gonna have
sex with another gay guy.

We're gonna pull you out of that school.

(KNOCKING)

-Hey, Peter, you got a minute?
-Oh, yeah, sure. Come on in, Quagmire.

Listen, I need to ask you to do something,
and it's something huge.

I mean, it's, like, the biggest thing
a guy could ever ask his friend to do.

Hey, we're best pals, right?
Whatever you need.

All right, and you have to understand,

I would never ask you to do this
if I had any other choice

and if what were at stake

was anything less
than my entire way of life.

Geez, Quagmire, what is it?

(SIGHS) Charmese won't give me a divorce
because she doesn't believe I'm gay,

so I need you to have sex
with me while she watches.

-I have some demands.
-Of course, of course.

Nobody can ever know.

Absolutely.
I'm right there with you on that one.

There will be no kissing on the mouth.

-Okay.
-I changed my mind.

-There will be kissing on the mouth.
-Uh, all right.

Good. Now, what else? What else? Uh, yes.

If, per chance, it is beautiful,
I reserve the right to cry.

Peter, I can't imagine any scenario
where this is gonna be beautiful.

Oh, I can. I'm a very passionate man.

Haven't you ever seen
my Spanish soap operas?

Ugh. Peter, can we just get out of here?
I want to get this over with.

This was part of the deal, Quagmire.

-I need this to be a lovely evening.
-Fine.

-How was work today?
-I don't want to talk about work.

Hey, should we go
someplace else for dessert?

You know, someplace fun, downtown,
where the college kids go?

What? I'm not taking you to
two different restaurants.

Huh. Hard to believe
your marriage isn't working out.

-A rose for the gentleman?
-What? No. Scram.

Hey, I'm not just a poorly cleaned butt.

There's a whole man around it
that you have to please.

Ugh. Fine. Here.

(SMELLS)

Quagmire, what's going on with you?
You don't seem very present tonight.

Why are you so tense?

I'm tense because
I have to bang you in 20 minutes!

Well, if it's so much of a chore.

What the (BLEEP) is going on with my life?

Okay, Charmese, here we go.
Are you sure you want to watch this?

I'm just warning you,
you're in the splash zone.

-If I get anything out, I'll be happy.
-Get on with it.

Uh, okay.

Here, let me stroke your hair.

Thank you. I want to do gay things
for you.

I... I crave your groin.

Yes, and I cannot wait
to intertwine our bodies

and make each other's fingers
smell terrible.

Enough! Kiss each other.

(RETCHING)

(SWALLOWS)

-Yeah, that was so hot.
-Just like we always do.

Now take off each other's clothes.

-Oh, God, I'm so excited for gay sex.
-Me, too.

Your body makes me so horny.

Shut up and do it.

(WHIMPERING)

It's very close, Peter.

The paintbrush is about to touch the
canvas.

Come on, Peter.

Sir Ian McKellen does this. You can do
this.

-Here we go.
-Here we go.

-Here we go!
-Just do it!

Wait.

(SIGHS) Stop.

Look, Glenn, you're obviously not gay.

-(STAMMERING) Yes, I am.
-Well, I'm something

'cause I've been at full-sail
for the last half hour.

No, Glenn, you're not.
I see that now, and the truth is,

if you're willing to go this far
to get a divorce,

then maybe we shouldn't
be married after all.

What... What are you saying?

I'm saying, I'll give you your divorce.
You're off the hook.

Oh!

Oh, thank you, Charmese.
Thank you so much.

(STAMMERS) I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

Well, it's for me, too.

You were real nice to me, Glenn,
nicer than any other guy's been,

but I wanted to be somebody's wife,
not somebody's burden.

-Good luck to you, sweetie.
-And good luck to you, Charmese.

Thanks. You're very special to me.

I'm sorry my urine melted a hole
through your toilet.

Aw.

-Oh, thank God that's over.
-Yeah, no kidding.

Hey, you know,
there's not too many guys in the world

who would be willing to do
something like that for their pal.

Ah, don't mention it.

No, no, you're an amazing friend,
and I really owe you.

-Thanks, Peter.
-Ah, you're welcome, buddy.

Hey, Quagmire, why is the red

are you ready for your Valentine's gift?

No, but I'm ready for therapy.

Peter, you awake?

It's a beautiful day.

Yeah, I'm just glad I didn't die from
that weird sleep-breathing thing I have.

(SCREAMS)

You know, Peter, since it's
Valentine's Day,

I was thinking, "Let's do something
we've never done before."

Release the virus?

No, I was thinking
we could spend the whole day in bed.

That's a great idea.

Permission to begin a day of
epic lovemaking, sexy lady?

Permission granted, sir.

And if I need help, I'll just
fantasize about that Victorian stripper.

Yeah, you slut.

Doth the magistrate know
what you're doing tonight?

Good.

Now, undo the top six buttons
of your 100-button shoes.

Wow, Meg, you look nice. You got a date?

Yeah, I totally hit it off
with this great guy in the Internet,

and we're finally going to meet.

Okay, remember to
ask questions about him.

Seem interested.

-Listen, giggle, swallow.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, my God, that's him.

-Toby?
-Meg?

Hi. Wow, you look just like your picture.

You don't look anything like yours.

Yeah, that's a candid
from a summer job I had.

Well, you're much prettier in person.

-Shall we go?
-Yeah, sure.

Don't wait up, boys.

-I like him.
-Really? He seems kind of lame.

But, I guess every girl
has her own version of Prince Charming.

I'm in love with Paul.

I'm in love with John.

You know what? I'm in love with Ringo.

What?

Um, I said... I don't know what I said.

Sounded like you said
you were in love with Ringo.

Um, I don't think so.

Pretty sure you said,
"I'm in love with Ringo."

Here I am.

-Are Paul and John out there?
-Nope, just Ringo.

Oh, you're still here?

Yeah, after a wonderful night,
I thought we could get some breakfast.

(LAUGHS) Clearly,
you're not familiar with how this works.

See, you're supposed to be already gone.
There's no breakfast.

Here, let me help you to the door.

You're a jerk, Glenn Quagmire.

Oh, hey, Joe. God,
I thought I was in trouble for a minute.

Hey, toots,

-I'll need to see your driver's license.
-What?

Joe, what the hell's wrong with you?
It's me, Quagmire.

JOE: Glenda Vajmire.

Well, how would you
like to spend four hours

desperately trying to
give me a muscular soldier?

-What the hell, you weirdo?
-(LAUGHS)

I'm just having fun.

In fact, as I say to all the ladies,
Giggity Giggity.

You don't say that. I say that.

You're a bad person.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Hey, Stewie, what are you doing?

Well, Brian, in honor of Valentine's Day,
I thought, "Why not go back in time

"to that Summer of Love in the '60s
that everyone's always talking about?"

Oh, cool.

Hey, you think you might be able to
get me some acid?

I'll get you a rolled-up newspaper

Hello.

Oh, this must be yours.

Thanks.

My God, she's incredible.

Rupert, I must bring her back to
the present and raise her to be my wife.

Oh, God, I bet that diaper is soaking wet.

I can't let her get away!

Oh, hi.

Oh, hey, um, I just came to say, um,
you know, in a couple of years,

something's going to come along
called <i>Sesame Street.</i>

And I know the name
makes it sounds Asian,

but it's not,
and it's going to blow your mind.

The hell with it.

The real reason I ran over here
is because I wanted to do this.

There's my little Lois.

What? Lois?

Come on, honey. Hop in Daddy's car.

You can crawl around on the floor
while I drink, smoke, and drive us home.

Oh, my God, Stewie, what happened?

None of your fucking business
what happened!

Geez, you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

Do you like Coldplay?

Uh, am I a dull white guy?
Yes, I like Coldplay.

God, Toby, I can't believe
how much we have in common.

-It's like we were meant to find each
other. -I know.

To us.

Meg, if you were any more beautiful,
that'd be neat.

(GLASSES CLINK)

-So, what should we do next...
-(THUDS)

(SCREAMS)

Oh, my God!

Toby, what happened?

Oh, I just harvested your kidney.

(GASPS) Look at the size of this scar.

Sorry. It's my first day on this job.

-Well, where did you work before?
-Circuit City.

So, I haven't worked in, like, two years.

Toby, I can't believe you took my kidney.

You bastard!

Sorry, Meg.

Black market organs are big money
and I promised my bosses a fresh kidney.

No hard feelings.

Wait!

You also made a promise to me.

You promised
we'd spend Valentine's Day together.

The whole day.

And I'm not letting you break
that promise.

Well, I guess a deal's a deal.

Okay.

By the way, did you know you had a
tiny conjoined twin attached to your hip?

Is it worth anything?

It is to me.
I've been using it as a bookmark.

Peter, what's all this?

Quagmire loaned me this book
called the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

It's Indian.

And who has better sex
than people who don't use toilet paper?

I don't know, Peter.
That doesn't sound very sexy.

What are you talking about?
Bombay is sperm city.

<i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

More like <i>Scumdog Put-it-there.</i>

Peter, these candles
are getting wax all over the floor.

That's okay. Isn't Consuela coming today?

No, she spends Valentine's Day
with her husband.

Wait, but she's sneaking out of the US.

This is Arizona.

You can shoot a Mexican
for using a water fountain.

He's so hot.

Maybe I can help you out.

-You'd do that for me?
-Sure.

Ahh! Get away from me, you creep!

Everyone sees me as a woman!

Oh, no!

This is the universe giving me what I

From now on,
I'm gonna do things differently.

Men are jerks!

So, what's with you?
No Valentine's Day plans?

(SCOFFS) No. I've had it with
Valentine's Day. I'm sick of all of it.

Okay, I'm putting on my friend hat.

What's the matter? Let me in.

I don't know. It's just...

How come it's so hard
to meet the right woman?

I think maybe
it's just time for me to give up.

Come on, Brian. You can't give up.
Everything could change in a moment.

That's what happened with
the Kennedy assassination.

I'm sorry, gentlemen.

-Follow me.
-What's going on?

Oh, my God.

Stewie, what the hell?
These are all my ex-girlfriends!

Well, I thought they could provide some

insights that might improve your
love life.

Ladies, as you may have guessed,

you are here because
you have all dated this great guy.

Yet, somehow, things didn't work out.

My objective is to figure out why.

I don't know.
The word "self-absorbed" comes to mind.

-And pretentious.
-Definitely pretentious.

And he's got a big Eggo.

Okay, we seem to have a theme going here.

Oh, come on! You're all just mad
because I didn't wanna be with you!

I think Brian's a wonderful man.

He's just having a difficult time
coming to terms with his own sexuality.

-Shut up, Ida.
-She's my favorite.

-He's insecure.
-And a blowhard.

And he's got a tiny penis!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Yeah, that was pretty clear by the survey.

Okay, now who wants more wine?

This is great.
We should do this every Saturday.

No, no,
we're not gonna do this every Saturday!

What's wrong? We're just being honest.

Oh. Oh, you want honest?

You're an old bag. You're blind.

Your vomit tastes weird.

Chris, I wanted to come see you because,

Really?

Now, I know I'm not much to look at,

and ever since I got banned from

but if you're up for it,
I'd like to spend some time with you.

Okay. Sure, Sandy! I'll come right down!

Thanks, Uncle Herbert.
I don't know how I could ever repay you.

Well, there is one thing.

I wanted you to have it.

Oh, Toby, I love it! Thank you!

It sure was, Lois.

-Yeah, I sure do.

-Remember the dance?
-Of course I do, Peter.

Who was that half-Persian chick

I think her name was Flora.

Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, all right. I'm ready! I'm ready!

Here's a list of stuff

not being afraid to take everything
life wants to throw up on into ya.

Wow. I never looked at it
like that before. Thanks, Mr. Herbert.

But don't you think
it's scary to try new things?

No, Chris.
Life is like a new baseball glove.

At first, you think
you're never going to get a ball in there.

But then you oil it up, work your fingers
around in there a little,

and pretty soon,
you're pitching and catching.

It's so upbeat,
but the lyrics are so dark.

I'm sorry,
are we both listening to <i>Snowbird,</i>

as recorded by Miss Anne Murray?

Yeah, the woman in the song
is trying to cope with getting older

and she feels trapped because
she knows she can't do anything about it.

No, no, no, no.

I mean, you're right that she's feeling
trapped, but the message is positive.

It's about being trapped
in a bad relationship

and having the guts to get out of it.

No, no. See, what I hear is that
the woman is starting to hate life.

You know the line,
"Now I feel such emptiness within"?

Yeah, I know the song.

Well, Anne Murray feels old.

And then to make things worse,

the snowbird comes around every year,
bringing the snow, or "death,"

to remind her that no matter what
she does, her fate's already written.

Brian, the snowbird
has nothing to do with time or fate.

Well, I disagree.

Look, there's only one way to settle this.

Only the artist knows
the true meaning of their art.

Oh, don't worry, Mom.

I'm sure he'll be home later.

-Will you stop it?

She's going to think we're weird.

Hi. Can I help you?

Hi. Miss Murray. My name's Brian Griffin.

First of all, I just want to tell you
what a huge fan I am.

That's very sweet of you.

And I'm Stewie.
I'm the one who sent you the vibrators.

Well, I'm glad you enjoy my music.
Would you like to come in?

We'd love to.

Wow, nothing says success
like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m.

I'll get there.

So, Miss Murray, the reason we came
is that we have a question about <i>Snowbird.</i>

It's about a relationship, right?

No, no, it's obviously
about the fear of growing old.

You know,
I think you're both kind of right.

I guess I always thought it was
about human limitation,

both mental and physical.

Okay, that... That just blew my face off.

Well, I hope that helps.

It does. Thank you so much, Miss Murray.
This has been terrific.

Hey, before we go,
do you mind if I use your restroom?

-It was a long drive up here.
-No, go right ahead.

We should do something
without him sometime.

Do you like tapas?

Someone invited me out for that once.

I thought they said topless,
so I was like, "What?"

That's a good story.

Hey, you know, that was really cool
how you told us what <i>Snowbird</i> was about.

Well, you know, that's just the way
I always interpreted the song.

But I suppose Gene probably
could have explained it better than I.

Who's Gene?

Gene MacLellan. He wrote the song.

I see.
But you wrote all your other songs, right?

No, all of my songs
were written by other people.

As a singer, I've been blessed

to interpret the works of
many gifted, sensitive songwriters.

Oh.

So, you're just a big fucking liar?

Sit back down.

All right, come on, Stewie,
let's go home...

Stewie, what the hell are you doing?

She's a fraud, Brian. A fraud!

She didn't write any of her songs.

Well, so, that's the case
with a lot of singers.

It's a very common industry practice.

Well, then you're all a bunch of frauds,
aren't you?

A bunch of frauds and charlatans.

and I can't find him.

I haven't seen him,
but I'll keep an eye out.

(KNOCKING)

Hey, bozos, what do you think of this?

(CHUCKLES) I did it! I did it!

-You're crazy man. You're so crazy.
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

(PLAYING VIDEO GAME)

I thought I told you to clean up in here?

And why aren't you dressed?

We're supposed to have dinner
with Judge Maynard and Timmy.

Yeah, okay,
as soon as I finish this level.

No, get your coat on.

It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.

Can't you just cook something here?

Excuse me?
I am not going to cook you dinner

while you sit here in your own mess
playing your TV games.

Oh-ho! And the martyr returns.

Chris, I think it's time for you to go.

Okay, I'll go.

But I want you to know,
I faked all my light-headedness.

Mmm, good Kool-Aid.

Whoa! Whoa!

Sound familiar?

Oh, my God, Chris. Oh, there you are.

I've been looking all over for you.

Why? You want to humiliate me
with more slave work?

No, I wanted to apologize.

I should've never blackmailed you.
I'm really sorry.

And I want you to come home.

I thought you said no one would miss me?

I said a lot of stupid things
I didn't mean, Chris.

But I miss you.

Thanks, Meg. I miss you, too.

You know, living in that family,
we both have pretty crappy lives.

And if we're going to survive it,
we can't turn on each other.

We're all we have.

I know.

I'll never do anything like that again.

Do you think you can ever forgive me?

Yeah, I forgive you.

Hey, Chris, what do you got there?

-I made a birdhouse at school today.
-Oh.

Looks an awful lot like
the Governor's mansion from <i>Benson.</i>

It is. I'm fond of the series,
and I wanted

the local birds to be aware of that.

-Well, I'll be on the lookout for Great
Tits. -Peter!

Well, actually, Lois,
that's a species of bird

that's known to frequent
domestic birdhouses.

It's why I've always wanted a birdhouse.

Hey, Lois, let's go outside
and see if we can find some Great Tits.

'Cause there certainly ain't any in here!

Remember those two we saw last night?
One was bigger than the other.

Yeah, and the bigger one had
a hair sticking out of that pointy thing.

What do you call that pointy thing, again?

-The beak?
-Okay.

Come on, Dad!

Maybe we can get the birds
to act out the <i>Benson</i>

where a scheduling snafu
forces the governor

to decide between meeting the President
or going to Katie's school play!

(EXCLAIMING) Scatterbrain governor.

Well, there she is. A birdhouse.

I just hope whoever moves in
doesn't mind the Persian birds next door.

Eh! Tweet, tweet.
Check out my expensive fountain.

(CHIRPING)

Dad, look.

You built a great birdhouse, son.
I'm real proud of you.

Thanks, Dad.

(SCREECHING)

No!
What just happened? What was that thing?

I don't know. Some kind of super bird.

Or maybe an average bird
who bought a Bowflex.

Well, that super bird ruined everything!

-Okay, no budget cut.
-No budget cut.

Has anyone seen your father?
It's almost 6:00.

I am here.

Family,
I want you to meet my falcon, Xerxes.

I'm a falconer now.

And yet, for Christmas,
I got a wrapped scrambled egg.

(GASPS)

Peter, that falcon looks pretty dangerous.

Yeah, Peter, get rid of that thing right
now and eat your dinner.

No! I am a falconer
and I will eat whatever Xerxes brings me.

Feed master.

Peter, what the hell?

For Xerxes, every meal is a pageant.

Hey, Peter.

Oh, falcon. Cool. Hi, falcon.

Whoa! Whoa! Easy there, fella.

Xerxes. His name is Xerxes.

-Uh, what does Xerxes eat?
-Rodents.

-Now if you'll excuse me...
-(SCREAMS) What the hell?

-Peter, make him stop!
-(CHUCKLES)

Hey, what do you got going on down there,
Quagmire?

-You got a rodent situation?
-(EXCLAIMS) No!

Well, Xerxes seems to think there is.

-Get him off, Peter!
-Admit you got a rodent in there.

-Peter!
-Admit it!

(GAGGING)

Oh, you scared him out the front.

Tony, come back!

Oh.

What... What... (WHIMPERS)

What do I do? What do I do?

Well, just hope he's not
standing on your soft spot.

Well, is that possible?

Because that could really mess up my...

(MUMBLING GIBBERISH)

-Mom, I need money for lunch.
-Oh, God. I'm sorry, Chris.

My purse has been missing for a day now.
I can't find it anywhere.

Not to worry, Lois. Xerxes will find it.

Xerxes, find Lois's purse.

(BLEATING)

This is your purse now.

-Peter, I can't carry my money in this.
-(SCREECHES)

(SCOFFS) Yeah, her money.

You're gonna love the park, Xerxes.

(LAUGHING)

I think you know what I want.

This is awesome.
We should have our own TV show.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

So what do you think about
a platonic shower?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

-Are you Peter Griffin?
-Yes, sir, I am.

I represent the man whose
sidecar motorcycle you stole yesterday.

You've piqued my interest. Go on.

Unfortunately for you,

that man is very, very Jewish and
is suing you for everything you've got,

No! Not Xerxes!

(MOTOR REVVING)

You won't get away with this.

Wait till American Airlines' magazine

Hello. American Airlines' magazine?

Have I got a scoop for you.

"Falcon stolen."

Ew! There's a toenail in this.

Guess I'll just go back to coughing.

(COUGHING)

Now what are we gonna do?
We have no money.

Oh, that's okay, Lois.
We got a wonderful family.

No, we don't.
There's Meg and Dummy and Big Head.

Damn it, Peter.
I'm probably gonna have to get a job.

Oh, thank God.

Thought I was gonna have to go back to
being on <i>Live! With Kelly and Peter.</i>

So exhausting
having to do that open-mouth smile

while the guest does their bit.

We're here with
<i>The Good Wife's</i> Christine Baranski.

So, Christine, you've actually
won an Emmy, is that right?

Yes, for playing Maryann on <i>Cybill.</i>

Ah!

But my character on <i>The Good Wife</i> is
such a complete departure from Maryann.

Ah!

You've also had quite a stage career.

-I believe you won a Tony Award.
-Well, actually, I've won two.

Ah!

And one more question, darling.
Who are you?

Excuse me, would you mind
taking a look at my résumé?

I haven't had an interview in a while,

and I want to make sure
it's formatted correctly.

-Looks okay.
-Good. It's not too braggy?

Hi, I'm sorry,
I couldn't help but overhear you.

You have an amazing speaking voice.

My name's Randy.

I can get you steady work
with a voice like that.

(LAUGHS) Really? Wow, thank you!

This is great.

Now I won't have to become
a Mary Kay saleswoman.

So, what makes these shampoos different
from the ones at the supermarket?

These shampoos have been in my car.

-Guess what, everybody?
-Oh, my God! Tampons and groceries?

No... Well, yes, but also,
I got discovered today.

I could be one of those
famous voiceover artists

you hear on TV or in the movies.

Ugh! Her doing voiceover?
Who wants to hear that?

Maybe she could be one of those annoying
voices that goes,

"Uh, uh, uh. Not that product."

It pays two grand a week, sweetie.

Hello?

(STAMMERING) Hi there...

(CLEARS THROAT) Sexy.

I can tell you're good at this.

Listen, I want to double-team you

Oh.

Yeah, the family's kind of falling apart,
and

I'm just a dad trying to keep it
all together.

I see.

-Are you into guys in wheelchairs?
-Not really.

Oh, that's too bad,
'cause my son's in a wheelchair.

Hey, Lois.
So, how was your first day of voiceover?

(NERVOUSLY) It was nothing.

Turns out, I'm just doing
very obscure European commercials.

(SCOFFS) You know, I have got to
get myself back out there.

I haven't performed since
I was in StewMan group.

I don't get it. What is this?

We don't know either.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hi, my name's Classy.

What can I do for you, hot stuff?

Oh, hi, Classy.

-Listen, do you have a wallet or a purse?
-Uh, I have a purse.

Oh! Oh, baby.

I want you to take the money out
and count it really slowly.

Okay.

One.

Ooh! That's nice.

Two.

Oh! Oh, my.

I'm sorry,
the next bill I have in here is a ten.

Oh!

Oh, I love you! All that and everything.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hi, I'm Classy.

All right, let's get this going,
sweet cheeks.

-You got a handkerchief?
-Uh... Yeah.

Good, ball that up
and stick it in your mouth.

(MUFFLED) Okay.

Now, what else you got there?
You got a stapler?

Uh-huh.

Yeah.

Okay, why don't you go ahead
and stick that in your mouth, too.

(GAGS)

-How about a mouse pad?
-Uh-huh.

Yeah, go ahead
and roll that up and stuff it in there.

Did you get a packet from HR
when you started working there?

Mmm-hmm.

Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

And I'm pretty certain
you know what I want you to do with it.

(STRAINING)

Okay, you think you can fit
anything else in your mouth?

Uh-uh.

All right, so now let's start
filling up some other places.

Peter, I've had a long day at work,

and right now, sex is the last thing
I want to think about.

What the hell, Lois?
You never want to do it no more.

What if I told you
I'm holding in a very big dump?

Peter, can't you just
use Sock Lois tonight?

No! Sock Lois
doesn't feel authentic to me anymore.

Hey, Joe, how often
do you have sex with Bonnie?

Well, my HMO
only pays for the equipment once a year.

Why?

Lois barely wants to do it no more.
I'm going crazy here.

Ugh, I hear you.

Hey, Quagmire, do yourself a favor.
Don't get married.

-I wasn't gonna.
-Good. Don't.

-I wasn't.
-Perfect. Don't.

Joe, you telling me not to
has no effect on me whatsoever.

-I'm not gonna get married.
-Great. Don't.

I mean it, you guys,
this no-sex thing doesn't work.

I need some kind of outlet.

You know, Peter,
I got just the thing for you.

There's this new phone sex chick
I been calling, and she is amazing.

Gee, I don't know.
Isn't that cheating on Lois?

No, look, it's over the phone. It's like
they say, "Phonin' ain't bonin'."

Yeah. Well, I guess I could try it.

Trust me, Peter.

Hey, I was right about telling you
to go see the gynecologist, wasn't I?

I'd like to see some vaginas, please.

That's what we're here for. Come on in.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)

(SEDUCTIVELY) Hello there, handsome.
I'm Classy.

Um... Hi, Classy, I'm, uh, Peter.

Peter Night Shyamalan.

They call me that 'cause
I got a big twist at the end of my thing.

(WHISPERING) Oh, my God.

(CLEARS THROAT) Um...

Well, hello, Peter.

-What can I do for you?
-Um...

-You want to see some pictures
that I drew? -Um...

Sure.

This is me on an elephant.

Wow. That's beautiful.
Did you draw that all by yourself?

Uh-huh. And this is me on the Moon.

I didn't really go there.

It was just in my imagination,
so I drawed it.

Wow! You're really talented.

You know,
there's something about you, Classy.

Something special.

Oh, that's very sweet.

I like your voice.

It makes me want to
hear more of your voice.

-Hey, you want to see a funny comic?
-Sure.

He's scared
'cause his friends got killed in the pie.

So, Peter, how was your day?

Ah, it was okay.

Except for that Yokohama beef bowl
I tried for lunch.

Not sitting so well.

Just "okay"?

Didn't try anything new today?

-Talk to anyone interesting?
-No, not really.

Oh, that beef bowl is wrecking me.

My stomach feels like that time
I had explosive diarrhea.

(FARTING)

PETER: Brown house.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

Um, hi, Classy. It's Peter.

Oh, hi there.

(EXCLAIMS) I love when you talk.

Listen, um, I've had such a good time
talking to you these past few times

that I was thinking maybe we could meet.

But you're married! You've got a wife!

Yeah, but she's been
giving me the cold shoulder lately.

Besides, anything that comes out,
I can always take home to her.

(STAMMERING) I don't think
this is a good idea.

I mean, cheating on your wife
is a very serious thing.

You don't understand. I have to meet you.

I know it seems sudden,
but I feel a special connection with you.

Look, you name the place and the time,
and I'll be there.

You son of a bitch!

Okay. I'll meet you.

Yay! I did it!

Thanks, Fairy God Peter!

Peter, the power was within you all along.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting
Fairy God Quagmire and Fairy God Joe

down at the Fairy God Clam.

-That sounds like a gay bar.
-It is a gay bar.

That's right, fellas, I'm gonna meet her.

-Meet who?
-Yeah, what are you talking about?

Oh, I thought we were starting
in the middle to save time.

The phone sex lady.

I'm gonna meet the phone sex lady
in person.

Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute, Peter. I wouldn't do that.

Hang on, Quagmire, that's a bad idea.

You never want to meet
those phone sex women in person.

Yeah, I know, that's what I said.
I wouldn't do it.

Good. Don't.

Joe, Joe, you realize what you're telling
me not to do, I'm already not doing!

Okay, I know you should never
meet a phone sex operator.

All right? I'm not an idiot.

I would never meet one
of those people, ever.

Good. Don't.

Guys, I have to see if she's as special
in person as she is on the phone.

Besides, if I listened to you guys,

I never would've got that job
as a seat filler for fetuses.

Okay, let's take a look at your baby,
shall we?

<i>Hi. He'll be right back.</i>
<i>He's in the bathroom.</i>

Thanks for having me, Bonnie.
I just needed someone to talk to.

Sure, Lois. What's on your mind?

Well, it's kind of a long story.
You see...

Eight (BLEEP) hours later...

Oh, my God!

So, as far as Peter knows,
he's about to cheat on you?

-Lois, you got to draw the line here.
-I know.

There's a lot of crazy things
I'll let Peter get away with.

I even held my tongue
when he went through that anime phase.

Hey, Lois,
me make drive time to super fun Clam

with noble Quagmire
and wheel-monster Joe.

Go force!

Peter, what...

Why are you dressed like that?
What did you do to your hair?

Business trip, Lois.
Going to Chicago City.

Oh, okay. I see.

And in case you're wondering why
I don't have business charts, yes, I do.

All right, I got to say goodbye
to the kids.

Hey, champ.
I want you to have this pocket watch.

It still works, even though it's got
a lot of Civil War brains all over it.

Meg, I want you to have
this sad-sounding fart.

(FARTING)

Chris, people are gonna tell you that
you're stupid and that you're no good.

Bye, Otis!

That son of a bitch.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hello.

You're...

You're beautiful.

So you got to meet me.
Are we gonna do this or what?

Listen, I... I got to be honest with you.

I am not, in fact,
the president of Hot Wheels.

And I also lied about
the giant chef's hat. I do not have one.

Mmm-hmm.

Well, the small lies don't matter.

Let's go.

(SIGHS)

Why am I doing this?

You know, I got the greatest wife in the
world, and we have one beautiful child.

But did you ever feel like
something was missing?

You know, something you had once,
but now it's gone?

You mean like the loyalty
of someone you trusted?

Yes, I know exactly what that feels like.

Yeah, I mean, I was just goofing around
when I first called you,

but when I heard your voice, I felt like
I found some part of me that was lost.

Doesn't make any sense,

but it felt like some force
in the universe wanted us together.

That's kind of nice.

I guess I could understand that.

Now that you're here in front of me,

I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

(LOIS MOANING)

Eight (BLEEP) hours later...

Oh, I got to say, I was fantastic.

You think so, you dirty, rotten cheater?

(GASPS) Lois!

(STAMMERING) You is the phone lady.
You the phone... You the phone...

You is the phone lady... You is the
phone lady... You is the phone lady...

You cheated on me!

Lois!
Why the hell were you doing phone sex?

-I was providing for our family.
-You were lying.

I'm starting to think
that whole Chicago City business trip

was just a bunch of baloney!

That's not the point!

Well, if you think about it, I wasn't
really cheating 'cause it was with you.

Well, you didn't know that!

Yeah, but you know what?

In some way, I think I did.

You know, when I heard your voice
on that phone, I felt something.

It was like an instinct, you know?

Both my heart and my wiener
somehow knew you were my soul mate.

Well...

I suppose you did fall for me pretty hard.

Don't you see, Lois?
I fell in love with you all over again.

And, look, now we just had
the best sex in years because of it.

I know. It's like our privates

were shaking hands after
a successful business meeting in a swamp.

To me it, just proves that
we're truly meant to be together.

Oh...

-I love you, Peter.
-I love you, too, Lois.

BOTH: Mmm...

By the way, you may have to
become a full-on prostitute,

'cause our phone bill was $7,000.

Oh, Peter!

I want you to do me so hard
that we have to change churches.

Gross!

I want to wreck you so bad,
you'll look like an exploded Hot Pocket.

Oh, my God!

Shh, shh, shh.

That's right.

I bet you're hungry.

It's okay. (SNIFFS)

That calmed you down,
you (BLEEP) horse.

Maybe it's time
the three of us

do something exciting
to shake things up.

Hey, now that's
a good idea, Joe.

All right, okay,
I have two ideas.

One that I think is awesome,

and one that
I think is stupid.

See if you can guess
which one is which.

We could either,
A, rob a Mafia poker game,

or, B, skydive.

Skydiving, huh?
I'd be totally up for that.

Yeah, I've always
wanted to try skydiving.

Really?
Eh, could be fun, I guess.

Besides, I haven't
done anything new

since I learned to
use a palm frond.

So do I try to
match your speed?

Yeah,
just match my speed.

And do we stagger
our waves or do 'em at the same time?

Um, they should've
covered this in orientation.

Guards, have the
new guy executed.

Am I the new guy?

All right, we're almost
at our jumping altitude.

Does anyone have
any questions?

Yeah, I got one.
Can I listen to my iPod on the way down?

Of course. Just as long
as it's not Tom Petty's <i>Free Fallin'.</i>

I'll just keep it
in my pocket.

Any other questions?

Let's do this!

That wasn't a question.
Back of the line.

Okay, let's do this!
JOE: Hey.

Whoa, is that
Harrison Ford?

Yeah. It said in the brochure
that he assists with all the jumps.

Get off my plane.
Get off my plane.

Get off my plane.

Oh, look, he even brought
Calista Flockhart with him.

Uh, Peter, I think that's
just a piece of paper.

Good, 'cause
she looked fat.

Get off my plane. Get off my plane.
Get off my plane.

All right!
Yeah. This is amazing.

I know,
it's unbelievable.

Hey, guys, let's try to
re-create this feeling

for the rest of our lives,
with drugs.

Oh, it looks like
it's almost time for us to pull our cords.

Wait, wait, guys.
How about this?

Last one to open
their chute gets 20 bucks.

-Okay.
-I'm in.

Damn it.

I'm dead already, Peter.
You're looking at a dead man.

I might not even
pull the cord at all.

(WHIMPERS)

Holy crap, this is awesome.

I haven't felt a rush
like this since I won that marathon.

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

I'm Bob Costas, here with
Boston Marathon winner Peter Griffin.

Peter,
how did you do it?

I'll tell you, Bob.
I just got in my car and drove it.

And when there
was a guy in my way, I killed him.

Kids, have you seen your father?

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello?
PETER: Is dinner almost ready?

Yes, Peter. God, where are you?
I can barely hear you.

Pull back my chair
ever so slightly.

(SIGHS) Daddy's home.

All right, it's 4:59.

In just a few seconds,
all the unreturned

library books will
be officially late.

The wieners was already drawed
in the books when I got 'em.

"Libra. A strange man will drop
into your life." Hmm.

"Pisces.
Be careful at work today."

<i>(ANGRY BIRDS</i> MUSIC PLAYING)

Go, go, go,
go, go... Aw!

He so should've died.
This is bullcrap.

Stop smiling, 90% of the people
playing this are pooping.

Hey, Lois, when are you
gonna do the laundry?

I got, like,
six parachutes in there.

Peter, those things
are choking up the washing machine.

So now I got you a bad washing machine
for Christmas.

Little tip, Stewie,
love dies, and that's okay.

I write down all his advice
in a little notebook.

Yesterday's was,
"I've never seen a pigeon die

"from eating food
on the ground, so what's the big whoop?"

Peter, this skydiving
thing has gotta stop.

You've destroyed
half the neighborhood.

And I'm afraid you're
gonna really hurt yourself.

I'm sorry, Lois.
But skydiving is who I am now.

It's like they say,
fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,

and gay guys gotta criticize the host
of the party behind his back.

Oh, my God, look,
a bowl of M&M's.

What are we, six?
I know.

And remind me to get
the recipe for those chopped-up hot dogs.

(LAUGHS)

Oh, my God, Josh,
this party is so amazing.

Everything is perfect.
We're having so much fun.

Oh, thanks.
I'm so glad you guys could make it.

Come on.
He saw us. Let's go.

First time?
Yeah. You?

(CHUCKLES) No. No, not my first time.

Thanks for the lift, Gil.
I think I'll take the express down.

(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

(INHALES) Ah!

Just as gorgeous as ever.

Actually puts me in the mind
to write a spoken word poem.

Am I falling or am I flying?

Am I living or am I dying?

O, Great Spirit, free me from the bonds
of gravity and criticism.

Deliver me from
my greatest enemy.

His name is Peter.

More specifically,
Peter's Shyness In Public.

O, Great Spirit,
why do I hold myself back in such a...

Oh, (BLEEP)!
The (BLEEPING) ground.

(GROANS) Damn it.

The Eiffel Tower?
Oh, cool, I'm in Paris.

MAN: Hey, look at that douchebag
who got stabbed in the butt.

Aw, crap, I'm in Vegas.

(HORN HONKING)

Well, Peter,
I'm glad you're alright,

but I hope this is the end
of your skydiving career.

Yeah, I'm sorry, Lois.

You know, when I thought
I was gonna die,

I saw my whole life
flash before my eyes,

and we did way
too much <i>Star Wars</i> crap.

I should get the kids home.
It's way past dinner.

What she really means is
that it's shaky Mommy's white wine time.

Let's go, kids. Come on.
We really gotta go, kids.

Let's go. Come on.

Excuse me.
Now that your family is gone,

would you mind if
we turn on the TV?

Oh, hey. I didn't know
anyone was here.

I, uh, was just kidding
when I told my family I loved 'em.

I am Mahmoud.
I'm Peter.

You know, I never seen
a hat like that before,

so I'm very scared of it.

No, this is just a taqiyah.
It's a traditional Muslim prayer cap.

Oh. Hey, you know who'd look
funny wearing one of those?

The Monopoly guy. (LAUGHS)

Correct.

Go directly to jail
and convert to Islam.

(LAUGHS) 'Cause they do that.

Yes, that is
what I intended.

Hey, you're all right, Mahmoud.

You, too, Peter.

So, what do you
wanna watch?

Well, if you turn on
Channel 14,

we can probably catch the end
of <i>Muslim Looney Tunes.</i>

(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(STUTTERING)

As a pig, I am very dirty
and should not be touched by humans.

So, how was
the hospital, Peter?

Oh, my God,
that place was incredible.

They have this one jar,
whole thing was full of cotton balls.

It's amazing how far
medical technology has come.

Well, sure is good
to have you back.

Joe is, uh, (CLEARS THROAT)

chattier than
you'd think he'd be when you're not here.

Look, I'm just saying
if pro is the opposite of con,

what is
the opposite of progress? Think about it.

You know, I actually had
a pretty good time in the hospital.

I even made a new friend.
You did?

Yeah, his name's Mahmoud.

In fact, I told him
to swing by if he had time.

It's congress.

Hello, Peter.
Oh, hey. You made it.

Hey, guys, this is Mahmoud.

Mahmoud, this is Brian,
Quagmire and Joe.

Hello.
Hi, there.

Hello. How are you?
Have a seat.

Any friend of Peter's
is a friend of ours.

Hey, Mahmoud, you know,
I'm actually glad you're here.

Settle an argument
we were having earlier.

Which Spanish chick has better jugs.
Salma Hayek or the other one?

Oh, but I do not pay attention
to such things.

-I am married.
-What?

Okay, well,
how about this, Mahmoud?

You know "progress" has
the word "pro" in it, right?

Shut up, Joe.

Hey, you guys, come on.
Let's get the man a drink.

-What are you having?
-How about a ginger ale?

But if you'll excuse me,
right now, I have to go

bring great shame to myself
by using the restroom.

-Isn't he great?
-No, he's weird.

Why'd he order a ginger ale?
And who the hell doesn't look at jugs?

Yeah, and he's got
his cell phone clipped to his belt

like he's some kind of
big shot on vacation.

Oh, I see what's going on.

You guys are uncomfortable
with Mahmoud because he's Muslim.

What?
What are you talking about?

This is your
post-9/11 racism talking.

I, for one, think it's great

that Peter has enough of an open mind
to have a Muslim friend.

You know, a lot of dogs
just sit outside, tied to poles.

Look, Mahmoud's my friend, okay?

So he's Muslim.
Every culture has its quirks.

Italian guys talk
with their hands a lot,

Irish guys drink a lot,

black guys change their shirts
while they tell you a story.

So, how's Bernadette?
She's all right.

She's taking interior design
classes down at the community college.

I mean, she's good at
haircutting and everything.

They gave her the chair
right by the door.

But, I guess, now she wants
to hang plates on the wall or whatever.

And you know she gained the weight
back from the Lap-Band, right?

That Bernadette
and her pie.

You know it, brother.

Okay, I'm gonna go
eat this steak in the bathroom.

Thanks for
getting dinner, man.

(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Wow, this place is
really cool, Mahmoud.

It's like
ear-bloodening sounds

had sex with nose-bloodening smells
and this is their baby.

I am glad you are
enjoying yourself.

Would you like some
of my meat fooshnoosh?

It's a chicken that has
been yelled at for two hours

and then run over
by a Mercedes.

Mmm! Mmm! Oh!

You can really taste
the fear in the chicken.

You know, Peter,

a lot of people are not
as accepting of Muslim culture as you are.

Well, I think everything
about it is the best.

Like this hookah.

I mean, who doesn't want
to sit around a table with a bunch of guys

and suck on
the same thing?

Mmm, it's like smoking
my grandfather's jacket.

Man, I wish I could stay here
all night, Mahmoud.

But I'm supposed to pick up
the dry cleaning before it closes.

-I killed a mouse with my tie.
-Nonsense.

I'll have my wife pick it up for you.

What? She'd do that?

Oh, absolutely. (SNAPS FINGERS)

I need you to run an errand
for my friend, Peter.

Of course.
Anything for you, husband.

That was amazing.
She just listened to everything you said.

Of course she listened.

In Muslim culture,
wives are much more obedient.

No way. That's awesome.

So wait, let me get this straight.
Sweet hat, obedient wife,

and I get to shout,
"Admiral Akbar," when I do stuff?

You, sir,
have got yourself a Muslim.

Peter, where are you going?
And why are you dressed like that?

Well, Lois,
I happen to be a Muslim now,

which means I'll be spending
a lot of my time in mostly-empty cafes,

watching soccer
on an eight-inch black-and-white TV.

Yes. The team
I like is kicking it.

Oh, no. The team
I don't like is kicking it.

Yes. The team I like
is kicking it again.

I will celebrate
with finger cymbals.

(CLANGING)

Hey, is that for real,

that "Diarrhea Only" sign
on your bathroom?

Peter,
this is my friend Omar.

He can teach you many things
about our faith, including how to ululate.

What's that? It's this... (ULULATES)

Oh, my God.
That's terrifying.

I don't know if
I'm ready for that.

No, Peter, it's okay.

Just sing
the beginning of <i>La Bamba,</i>

-but don't say the "La Bamba" part.
-Oh, okay.

-(ULULATES)
-Yes, good job. You're doing it.

-Bamba!
-Ooh, so close.

All right, Lois,
I'm off to the bazaar.

What do you mean?
You mean the market?

Yeah, the bazaar.

Well, if you're
going to the market,

can you pick up some cereal,
some butter, and a loaf of bread?

I'll see what they have.

All right, Lois.
Here's six cobras,

a bolt of silk,
and a ram's horn.

Peter, what the hell?

Hey, can you help me with the 20 paper
bags of dates I got in the car?

Why the hell would you
get 20 bags of dates?

The monkey in the little vest
who was selling them

happened to be
very persuasive.

(SIGHS) You know what? Fine.

I'm just gonna
assume this will pass,

like your everywhere-is-a-
racquetball-court phase.

So, Mike, now that you've thoroughly
kicked my butt all over the court,

what do you say we
take one quick second

to talk about
the Wichita account?

And let me assure you,
my racquetball game

is no indication of how we do
business here at J.T. Stern.

(CHUCKLES) Okay, zero serving zero.

(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

I have to say, Peter,

I am impressed by how much
you have committed yourself to Islam.

Are you kidding?
It's awesome.

I even started wearing leather sandals
with way-too-long toenails.

See how the big ones
are getting yellow?

Ah, yes, very Muslim.

Listen, Peter, some friends of mine and I
are getting together tonight

and we wanted to
invite you to join us.

O-M-A.

I am so there.
Whose crappy van should we take?

Actually, we are meeting here.
Follow me.

Oh, hey, you guys.

Hey, is anyone gonna
object if I pick my nose with a dagger?

Mahmoud, who is this man?
Why would you bring him here?

Do not worry. This is Peter.
He believes in our cause.

How can you be sure?

Give him the test.

Who is better?
Hulk Hogan or the Iron Sheik?

Um, the Iron Sheik?

Okay. He is one of us.

I told you.

Look at him,
he is the perfect man

to help us blow up
the Quahog Bridge.

(IMITATES CAR ENGINE)

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

Ah! Oh, my God.
Everybody down.

(IMITATES GUN FIRING)

So are these toys just,
like, to take?

Hey, guys,
what football team should I like?

Mahmoud says we
all need to act

like we're fans of
American football

so we seem less...
(STAMMERS) "Buspicious."

What? What are you talking about?

I'm talking about Mahmoud.

You know, I actually
feel really bad for him.

Did you know he knew 19 guys
who died on 9/11?

I mean, what are the odds?

Peter, I think you joined
a terrorist sleeper cell.

What? That's crazy.

Look, I'm gonna call Mahmoud right now
on this cell phone he gave me.

-He'll tell you.
-(BEEPING)

(DISTANT EXPLOSION)

Damn phone's busted.
Maybe I dialed wrong.

(BEEPING)

-(EXPLODING)
-(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Peter, please stop
trying to call Mahmoud.

This is very serious. Your friends
are terrorists. Think about it.

They're meeting in secret,
they're creating cover stories...

Oh, my God, you're right.

See, I told you Mahmoud was bad news.
Those guys are all bad news.

Hang on there, Quagmire.

Just because these few guys are terrorists
doesn't mean all Muslims are.

Every ethnic group
has their nut-jobs.

We have the Unabomber,
Timothy McVeigh,

and even that fat guy
at the Atlanta Olympics

who didn't do it,
but he looked mean, so we said he did.

Joe, you don't get to talk
about the regular Olympics.

Well, I gotta go
down there right now

and tell Mahmoud
we can't be friends anymore.

Wait a minute, Peter.

This could actually
be an opportunity.

You're already
in their group. They trust you.

If you can find out
what they're planning next,

we might actually be able
to stop an act of terror.

You'd be a hero.

Well, I could try.

I mean,
I am a pretty good actor.

Remember how upset
I seemed to get

when Lois said she was leaving town
with the kids for a few days?

Oh, my God,
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

Don't forget to call and let me know
exactly when you'll be back.

Get out.

Okay, you're all set.

Remember, we'll be in the van
listening to everything,

so if anything goes wrong,
we'll pull you right out of there.

Don't you worry, Joe.

I'll blend in like a chameleon in
Courtney Love's crotch.

Oh, my God. Where did
you just come from?

A very, very bad
hiding place.

Okay,
before we get started,

I have an announcement
from headquarters.

"No more shorts."

And this isn't coming from me,
this is management.

This is about me,
isn't it?

They don't name names.
They just say, "No more shorts," okay?

All right, this is our target.
The Quahog Bridge.

We loaded a van
with explosives,

which we will
drive to the bridge...

Wait a minute.
Explosives?

-Is this not improv class?
-No.

Is this improv?
Are you doing improv?

No. Now get out that door.

The real door.

Yes, I have a question.
When exactly are we doing the bombing?

The attack will happen
tomorrow during afternoon rush hour.

And that's actually
where you come in, Peter.

In order to get past
the checkpoint at the toll plaza,

we will need an American
behind the wheel

to arouse the least
amount of suspicion.

Sorry, can you repeat all that?

I just had an itch
right by my microphone.

Microphone?

He's wearing a wire.

Hey, Joe,
can I ask you a question?

Can you fart?
Oh, of course I can.

I've got a button
for it right here.

(FARTS)

Aw, cool.

(PETER GROANS THROUGH HEADPHONES)

Hold on. Oh, no.

It sounds like they
found Peter's wire.

Change of plans.
The attack happens now.

Now drive.

Man, I never thought
it would end like this.

Why, what did you imagine?

Basically the same thing,
only Nathan Lane.

Now, drive!

(ENGINE STARTS)

Okay, you're good to go.

Pull over up here.

Please, Mahmoud,
don't do this.

It is too late.
The job must be done.

Look, I know you're mad
at our government,

but you gotta realize,
that's only part of America.

We're the land of the free

and the home of the sunburned,
freckled fat guy.

A place where
Jenny McCarthy has a role

in the debate over
childhood vaccinations.

A country where you can
walk into any IHOP

and see black women fighting.

And where Ubu is considered a good dog
even though he never sat.

We're the proud nation

where someone can shoot up
their entire workplace with a thing,

and then the next day
nobody talks about banning that thing.

It's the land that
lets people on Twitter

spell the word "their"
any way they want.

And where,
if you think you can dance,

that assertion will be
challenged and evaluated.

For we are America.

You will not convince me.
America must pay for its sins.

(VAN DOOR OPENS)

Hold it right there.

(GRUNTS)

Mahmoud,
you're under arrest.

Look, Joe,
I drove a van.

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTERING)

Oh, Peter,
I'm so glad you're okay.

Oh, me too, Lois.
That was some pretty rough stuff.

Oh...

You didn't cry,
did you?

Well, I mean,
I went through an awful lot.

Peter, if you cried,
we are done.

Great job, Peter.

Thanks to you,
30 terrorists are behind bars,

and every middle-class Arab
in this town is now under suspicion.

So what happens next?
Do those guys all get trials?

Well, you know...
(MUMBLING) It's a long...

It's the process,
and whatever.

Well, what do you
guys say we all go celebrate at The Clam?

That's a great idea.

Yeah, I think we
could all use a drink.

Tell you what,
let me call Horace

and tell him to
get our table ready.

(EXPLODING)

Peter, did you just...

Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

Are you afraid of the dark?

I thought we had an understanding
that the dark was off limits.

This press conference is over.

This has been
Tricia Takanawa with the news.

And now I will have
my normal post-news review

from my mom in her car.

You no good! You no good on news!
You stiff, like washing board!

Joan Lunden mother, so happy.
Tricia Takanawa mother, so sad.

Wow, he really did it.

I always knew Mayor West
was a little crazy,

but I never thought he was
capable of something like this.

The mayor's going to jail.
That means anything goes.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

I pushed a lady.

God, I can already hear the jokes

Jay Leno is gonna be
telling about our mayor.

-Yeah, like what?
-You know,

it's like you can already hear them.

-You know?
-Like what?

Like exactly what jokes do you hear?
Tell me one of the jokes.

Brian, all I have to do is
start fake sneezing around you

and you'll spend the rest
of your life outside.

Yeah, yeah, I can hear some of the jokes.

Well, I guess you just never know

what kind of rage
some people have bottled up.

Well, we all got anger, Chris.

The important thing is
finding a healthy way to channel it.

For me, as you know, it's the family bath.

Peter, how long do we have to sit here?

Until I'm not angry anymore,
you naked bunch of bitches!

Everyone, please be seated.

We will now hear
the defense attorney's closing statement.

I switched seats.

In closing, although it seems pretty clear
that my client committed this murder,

I would consider it a personal favor to me
if you found him not guilty.

That's your closing argument?

Those karate lessons
are really paying off.

Thank you, Sensei.

-Welcome.
-He came.

Jurors, you have now heard
all the facts of this case.

I remind you that
because we are a small town,

many of you may have ties
with the defendant or the victim.

You must set aside
these personal connections

and render an impartial
and unanimous verdict.

Does anyone have any questions?

Yeah, is Toblerone
the fanciest thing in the world?

I just don't understand.
How could Uncle Adam do this?

He's the mayor of our town.

Well, Meg, life isn't always as simple
as what they teach you at school.

I don't know, Mom.
I have a pretty realistic Home Ec class.

Okay, kids. Now I'm gonna
take the casserole out of the oven.

Okay, it's a little burned.
No reason to panic.

-(CAR SCREECHING TO HALT)
-(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

Oh, God, that's Daddy. He's home early.

Let-Let's get some spices in here
and fix this.

(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

Okay, he's inside the house.
Let's hope his meeting went well.

-MAN: God, that meeting went awful!
-Oh, boy.

MAN: What's that smell?
Did you burn dinner, you stupid pig?

Okay, kids, put your heads down.
Put your heads down.

And don't try to stand
between me and your father,

it'll just make it worse.

So I has been asked by the judge
to be the foreman,

and I want y'all to know

that we's gonna run
a fair jury and a clean jury,

so I brought some wet naps
for everyone to wipe off their areas.

'Cause one of us gets sick,
we's all gonna get sick.

And that may lead to some of us
getting sicker than others.

Look, can we get this underway?
I mean, we were all in that courtroom.

What is there to discuss?
It's obvious he did it.

(ARGUING)

Plus, I got to get back to the station.

If I'm not there by 5:00,
Joyce will anchor the news,

and I don't think anyone
wants that to happen again.

Our top story. Guys, right?

Yes, it's open and shut.

Now let's just vote him guilty
and get out of here.

Look, I know everyone's in a hurry,

but shouldn't we at least
go over the evidence once

before we vote, just to be fair?

You know what would shed
some light on the case?

If we huck water balloons
at people in the street.

They were carrying a trampoline.

Here's the facts.

There was a note from the victim,

threatening to expose the mayor
in a corruption scandal.

The murder weapon
was the mayor's own knife.

And finally, that lady

with the Peter Gallagher eyebrows
on the witness stand,

saw the whole thing.

Okay, let's get down to business.

All in favor of "guilty,"
raise your hands.

Guilty.

All "guilty." Good.
Well, that's it, let's get out of here.

Anyone for "not guilty"?

(ARGUING)

What the hell?

All right, looks like
we's gonna be here a while.

Who wants pizza for dinner?

And who wants
Purina Moist and Meaty Dog Chow?

(ARGUING)

I had that for breakfast!

What do you mean "not guilty"?
What's wrong with you?

Shoot, that was a stomachache.
I told that guy he had polio.

Look, the system specifies the defendant

must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Mayor West's life is on the line here.

I'm just saying,
it's possible he didn't do it.

(ARGUING)

That's for the jury to decide.

Mayor West is crazy. He should've
been locked up a long time ago.

Yeah, there's definitely
something off about him.

I'm his physician.

Okay, now we'll just test those reflexes.

-MAN 1: Hey, did you hear that?
-MAN 2: There's someone out there.

-MAN 3: Hello?
-WOMAN: We're in here!

MAN 4: There are six of us!

Look, we all saw that blackmail note.
Mayor West is the only one with a motive.

I don't even know why we're discussing it.

Well, was Mayor West
the only one with a motive?

I mean, there are people who would benefit
if he were put away for murder.

Political rivals, special interests.

I mean, it's possible
he could have been framed.

(ARGUING)

<i>Enough!</i>

Was a movie with Jennifer Lopez
that did not live up to expectations.

Well, Mayor West did say
he never saw the letter.

-And he was under oath.
-Yeah, he lied.

Of course he lied, he's a politician.
They're all liars.

Yeah! John F. Kennedy swore
he'd serve a full four-year term.

Liar.

Look, we should be sticking
to the facts, not stereotypes.

It's unfair to say
that all politicians are liars,

therefore Mayor West is guilty.

Brian's right.

I was a county alderman once
and I never told no fibs.

I bent over backwards and forwards
for them constituents.

It's important to make sure everyone
is happy, so I took a lot of polls.

Gay stuff.

Yeah, and I served honorably
as a U.N. interpreter.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Okay, he's mad about something.
He appears to be talking really fast.

He spits whenever he makes the "ch" noise,

which, in this language, happens a lot.

I'm expected to entertain him
and his wife tonight,

so if anyone knows a good
restaurant in the area...

Sushi or tapas,

something where they're always
bringing stuff to the table

so you have something to talk about.
You know?

"Hey, what's this? This looks good..."

War, war, war!
That last sentence was about war!

Look, an expert confirmed

that the blackmail note
was signed by the victim.

That points irrefutably to West.

Well, maybe we should
take a look at that letter.

Yeah, I'd like to see that.

'Cause I can read it
just like everybody else.

<i>And the charade continues.</i>

-Bailiff, please.
-Yeah?

Mr. Bailiff, we request that you
bring us the note from the victim.

Joe, what the hell
are you doing out there?

You're a cop, not a bailiff.

I'm undercover.
Someone's been raping all the bailiffs.

So you're just sitting around
waiting to be raped?

MAN: Hey, Bailiff, can I talk to you
for a second in this broom closet?

Sure, strange man. I can't wait to hear
what this is all about.

Well, there's your motive.

A note from the victim
threatening Mayor West.

What more proof do you want?

Yeah, are you trying to
suggest that Mayor West's enemy

faked a corruption letter
and then killed himself?

That's idiotic!

But it just might work.

What?

You know, something bothered me
about the stationery that note was on,

with the-the decorative "M" border.

It's from the office of the mayor.
The "M" is for "mayor."

-What are you getting at?
-No, no.

I'm pretty sure the "M" is for "Marriott."

How do you know?

Because I once got a note
from the Marriott

written on the same paper.

"Dear Brian.
You were amazing last night. Love, Ida."

(LAUGHS) This is from the night
you had sex with Quagmire's dad.

Come on!

I did a dog once,
but I was in the Philippines,

and I sure as hell
didn't write him a letter.

What? So what does that prove?

The victim had access

to all the office-of-the-mayor
stationery he could ever want,

yet he hand-made a letterhead
on stationery from a Marriott?

As far as I'm concerned, that casts doubt.

(ARGUING)

Look, you guys just say the word

and I'll put this ball with cheese in it
on the floor.

We won't hear from him
for an hour and a half.

Look, if I'm still the only one
who says "not guilty,"

I won't hold things up any longer.

Let's vote again, and I'll abstain.

If it's unanimous, I'll change my vote
and we can all go home.

Okay, everyone take one of these
here and write their vote.

Hey, Quagmire,
you gonna write something funny?

No, Peter, I'm not.

I'm starting to think all you do
is dick around.

Sorry.

Everyone vote? Okay, now let's count.

"Guilty." "Guilty."

Some hurtful slurs
followed by the word "guilty."

(LAUGHS)

"Guilty." "Guilty."

"El guilto."

"Guilty." "Guilty."

This one's just a squiggly line.

That's "guilty" in Latin.

<i>You're playing a dangerous game, Carl.</i>

"Guilty."

"Not guilty."

(ARGUING)

ALL: Ew!

I farted during the murmuring.

What monumental douche
voted "not guilty" on this no-brainer?

I think we know who the flip-flopper is.

Bruce didn't change his vote. I did.

(ALL GASPING)

I respect Brian's courage.

It's not easy to stand alone,
or find the child who stands alone,

but that's the one you want.

Look, we have been cooped up
in this room for five hours now.

I'm starting to feel
like an animal in a cage.

Yeah, or a T. rex trying to masturbate.

All right, Internet porn, check.
Tissues, check.

Lotion, check. Okay, let's go.

Aw!

(GROWLS)

(ROARING)

And that's why they were
such vicious killers.

<i>He couldn't masturbate</i>
<i>because his arms are too short</i>

<i>They feared him from Kilpatrick</i>
<i>down to Galway Bay Port</i>

<i>Luckily he found a wife</i>
<i>so he could have sex</i>

<i>The non-masturbatin' Tyrannosaurus rex</i>

Okay, look, tempers are starting
to get a little heated,

so why don't we all go take us
a little potty break?

Now you're all gonna have to witness me

taking an old-man pill that looks
way too big to swallow.

(GRUNTING)

(GAGGING)

(GULPS)

There we go.

It's his fault we're still here.

How is it you think
you know everything anyway?

You don't even understand
your feelings for the mailman.

(BRIAN BARKING)

You motherfucker, get out of here
or I'll kill you!

But come back tomorrow same time.

I get very sad on Sundays
when you're not here.

-PETER: Damn it.
-MORT: What happened?

PETER: I dropped my phone in the toilet.

-(SPLASHING)
-(PETER GROANS)

It's so cold and it's under everything.

I feel like I'm rooting around
a pitcher of sangria.

Where is it?
Oh, my God, why haven't I found it yet?

Oh, no, I didn't roll
my sleeve up far enough.

Why didn't I flush when I got in here?

(GROANS) This isn't even all mine!

Oh, no, there's a spider
crawling on my face.

(GROANS) Why didn't I use the hand
that was on the floor?

Why did I use my toilet hand?

Wait, here it is behind the toilet.

(CLOCK TICKING)

This is ridiculous.

Even if you don't believe
the note was legitimate,

there was an eyewitness
who saw the entire thing.

Well, I have questions
about her testimony.

She said she was at a party.
Not just any party, a sex party.

Now, how could a woman at an orgy
witness a murder?

The bedroom was 100 feet
from the window.

Okay, first of all,
the term "orgy" is outdated.

We call them, "Genital jamborees."

But still, I don't see how she could
look out a window and witness a crime.

Trust me, you're banging eight strangers
who responded to a flyer,

at some point
you're gonna look out a window

and question every decision
you've ever made.

Look, I'll demonstrate.
You people come here.

Okay, Tom, you're over here on all fours.

Carter, I need your face right here.

Nope, even closer.

You're gonna want to feel
the heat coming off him.

Okay, Consuela, I'm gonna
need you on your knees.

And we're probably partway into it here,
so one of your eyes is stuck shut.

All the way shut.
There are 11 of us, dear.

All right, Tom, you're squinting.
You're anticipating. Don't do that.

Carl, you can take your fist
out of your own mouth.

Bruce, great work.

Bruce seems like the only gamer here.

Thanks, it's okay to look the other way

when y'all pass me on the street
with y'all's wives. I understand.

And that places the witness right here,

next to the lubricating station
and the terrible-smelling guest book.

Would she be face up?

No, she had small breasts,
but a great ass.

She's definitely face down.

But then, how could she see the window?

Oh, my God. You're right.
She couldn't have.

And now to take my position.
This is what I call "The Butter Pat".

(CLOCK TICKING)

Okay, y'all, so we's now at six "guilty,"
six "not guilty."

So we's all gonna have to stay here
until we's unanimous in our verdict.

Well, so what if that woman
at the orgy couldn't see?

There's plenty of other evidence
that West is guilty.

Yeah, let's wrap this up.
I got the director's cut

of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
waiting for me at home.

-Don't look, Marion.
-Okay.

-By the way, I'm pregnant.
-Maybe just one quick peak.

Come on, people, he obviously did it.
You know his type, they're all guilty.

-Well, what type is that?
-He's one of those plain-lippies.

You know, no mustache
like a normal person.

Prancing around with his naked lip out
for all the world to see.

Sir, you are talking to a plain-lippy.

Now, don't take it like that.
Some of them are all right.

But you know what I mean,
they're all over the place.

How about me, Tucker, am I all right?

Well, of course you're all right.

(GASPING)

Imagine that.

What happened to me?
I've become my father.

Not guilty.

That really hurt because
it was a real mustache.

Okay, the majority of this room
now believes

that there is reasonable doubt
about Mayor West's guilt.

And what do the rest of you think?

Look, I just don't think
he could've done it.

Guilty.

Guilty is the other one?
Well, I don't know!

Okay, it's good we're talking this out.

Now I'd really like to hear
from the holdouts

because a man's life hangs in the...

Peter, what are you doing?

It's getting very tense in here.

Do you guys mind if I struggle
to open these blinds?

Damn it, come on, stay up there.

QUAGMIRE: You got to yank it
to the side, Peter.

I'm yanking it as far as it goes.

-CARL: You got to catch it on the thing.
-That's helpful.

DR. HARTMAN: The left side's getting lower
than the right side.

I can see what's happening.

-QUAGMIRE: Now twist it.
-All right.

See? Now it's open.

Okay, we's at 11 to one.

Carter, you're the only person
who still thinks he's guilty.

You're damn right I do. Look at the facts.

There was a dead guy found
in Mayor West's home.

There's no one else with any motive.

And the police detective
who examined all the evidence

named him the prime suspect.

Pfft. You guys paid attention
that whole trial? Lame. Not me.

I was too busy being cool.

The jury is instructed to disregard
the witness' last remark.

Yeah, whatever, Judge.

None of this stuff's ever
gonna apply to my real life.

I'm just gonna go work in the mines,
anyway, like my dad.

How would you like to stay
for an hour after the trial?

I'm real scared.

Is your dad hitting you, Peter?

Shut up, just shut up!
You have no right, man!

You don't know nothing
about my side of town!

Look, he's guilty, I just know it.

He's a double-dealing
spineless politician.

-But how do you know he's guilty?
-I know.

Mayor West has let people down.

Guys, I feel like all
we talk about is Mayor West.

Like who, who has he let down?

Someone who got him elected.
Someone who padded his expense account.

And all I wanted was to fire a missile
into a fault line

to sink half of Quahog into the ocean
and make my real estate waterfront.

You got that from <i>Superman.</i>

Nobody likes you.

I even let him marry
my daughter Carol, damn it.

I mean, doesn't that mean anything?
No, not to West, that ungrateful bastard.

It wasn't that aide
that got stabbed in the back,

it was me!

(SOBBING)

Not guilty.

Well, I guess that's it.

Yeah, looks like
we've reached our verdict.

You know what I just realized?
My jury duty's tomorrow.

Ladies and gentlemen of Quahog,
I feel vindicated.

Today the truth has prevailed.

And we've witnessed
the power of the greatest

justice system in all the world.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

Yes, Miss Takanawa.

Now that you've been acquitted,

what does the future hold
for Mayor Adam West?

I don't know.

<i>Into the great wide open</i>

<i>Under them skies of blue</i>

<i>Out in the great wide open</i>

<i>A rebel without a clue</i>

I'll probably just remain
mayor of this great city.

This also is part of my fantasy sequence.

I'll probably just remain
mayor of this great city.

And I know this is real because
you're not rabbit-people.

What a day.

You both did your civic duty
and you saved Mayor West.

Yeah, I mean,
it was a pretty intense experience,

but the important thing is, in the end,
justice was served.

All you did was let a guy go.
There's still a murderer out there.

Yeah, but we saved an innocent man today,
and that's something to feel good about.

"Feel good about"?
They found eight more bodies last night.

One of them was on this block.

There's a maniac out there.
He's cutting people's power off,

breaking into their homes,
and slitting their throats.

STEWIE: And we're dead.

It was awfully nice of our new neighbors
to invite us over for dinner.

I don't know, Lois.
Going to Cleveland's house

with someone else
living there just seems weird.

Like when a new pope
moves into the Vatican.

Hi, I don't know
who to complain to about this,

but I'm still getting XVIII's mail.

Yeah, no.
No, he's not here anymore, this is XXIV.

Yeah, no, I don't need <i>Newsweek.</i>

No, I don't need <i>National Geographic.</i>

No... Yeah, we'll hang on to <i>Boys' Life.</i>

Hello, neighbors.

Joe, you can walk.

How do you do? I'm Stan Smith.
Please, come in.

I'm so glad everyone could make it.

Stan, I need $50.

They're selling a biopsy of
Céline Dion's uterus on eBay.

What the hell kind of dog is that?

I was going to ask the same thing.

That's our alien, Roger.

He lives in our attic,
but nobody can know.

And don't tell anybody about our attic.

-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-Hello?

Hey, Quagmire.
Hey, you're not gonna believe this.

I'm over here with Joe,
and he's got a space alien.

(GUN FIRING)

(ALL SCREAM)

(WHIMPERING)

Peter, wake up. You're having a nightmare.

Lois.

Thank God, it was just a dream.

Hey. Lois, what's that fat man
doing in our bed?

(GRUNTS) Damn it, I always wake up

before I find out
if they can understand the baby.

(<i>KING OF THE HILL</i> THEME PLAYING)

Thanks for helping me
set up this jungle gym, guys.

Lois says Stewie's been
getting a little chunky.

Ugh! Everybody's always
commenting on my weight.

This is why I almost died from anorexia.

(MACHINE BEEPING)

You look fat.

All right, I got the monkey bars
all put together.

God, look at that,
they already got al-Qaedas all over them.

Get out of here. Scat!

Man, they're gonna be so good
at swinging bar-to-bar when they invade.

Wow, Quagmire, how did you
build that part so fast?

It was easy.
I just followed the instructions.

I couldn't find the English ones.

These are in Latin and those stuffy
Ivy League professors won't help me.

(CHUCKLING)

<i>Nullum gratuitum prandium,</i> Peter?

Yeah?
Why don't you catch a football, you nerds?

Nerds.

No, I just read the back,
where it's printed in French.

You speak French?

Sure, they love me in France.

-Oh, Quagmire!
-Shh! Quagmire!

<i>Silence! C'est Quagmire.</i>

(CROWD LAUGHING)

-Quagmire.
-Ah, Quagmire.

Quagmire, don't fall near the mouse trap.

Yeah, and French also comes in handy
when I have layovers in Montreal.

That place is the best.

I always wanted to go to Canada,

but then <i>South Park</i> went,
so we couldn't go.

Man, you guys should
come with me sometime.

Montreal has the best
strip clubs in the world.

-They do?
-Yeah, they're unbelievable.

The girls up in Canada are gorgeous.

And they all play ice hockey,
so they lose their teeth by age 10.

Wow.

In fact, I'd even go so far as to say

that a Canadian strip club
is the most magical place in the world.

That sounds incredible. We got to go.

Yeah, will you take us, Quagmire? Please?

All right, let's do it!

But I don't want to get any crap
from your wives

about me taking you to a strip joint.

So you guys are gonna have to
lie about where we're going.

-Okay, sure.
-Yeah, no problem. I'm a great liar.

Okay, we're good this way.
Is it clear in your direction?

Yep.

ANNOUNCER ON TV:
<i>We now return to</i> Stabbed in the Butt,

<i>the only game show where</i>
<i>if you get the answer wrong,</i>

<i>you get stabbed in the butt.</i>

<i>All right, Bradley, here's your question.</i>

<i>What is the atomic weight of nitrogen?</i>

<i>Get him, guys! Stab him in the butt!</i>

Okay, bye, you guys. I'm leaving now.

Peter, tell me again
why you're going to Montreal?

Hey, do I give you the third degree

every time you go for one of
those luxurious mammograms?

Dad, why can't we all go?

Because somebody's got to stay here
and round up all these rattlesnakes.

(ALL GASP)

Bye.

Hey, guys. Check it out.
What do you think?

A private plane?
How'd you swing that, Quagmire?

Well, let's just say I walked in
on John Travolta

with not Kelly Preston.

Oh, my God,
this plane is awesome, Quagmire.

-Hey, who's that?
-That's J. Private Planington.

He invented private planes.

He was also the world's
foremost squid hunter.

I've got a lot of big ideas, too,
but everybody's just so jealous.

Boy, this is nice.

Hey, Joe, I'm gonna go check out the john.

Oh, my God, have you seen this?
Look how fancy this thing is.

They even got a special map
that lets you choose

who you want to dump your poop on.

Geez, the synagogue button's
almost worn out.

Oh, my God, Joe,
there's a man on the wing.

Peter, there's no man on the wing.

-There is! I saw him!
-Peter, stop being ridiculous.

I'm telling you, lift up the shade.
There's a man on the wing.

(SIGHS) Fine.

It's me. I'm the man on the wing.

Peter, how the hell did you get out there?

Are you crazy? Get back in here, Peter!

What the hell's going on back there?
We're losing altitude.

Hang on, you guys, I don't know
if I can pull out of this. Giggity!

Wow, from up here, everything looks
so huge and coming faster.

What happened? Did we crash?

-Yeah, we crashed.
-Wow.

Still, you know, we saved so much trouble
not flying commercial,

-I think we came out ahead.
-Sure.

-Drive right up to the plane.
-Exactly.

If we went to Logan, that plane
wouldn't crash for another hour at least.

(AIRPLANE DESCENDING)

They made pretty good time.

I'm bored.

Peter, you made me crash the damn plane!

Okay, I know you're
a pilot and everything,

but not everyone likes to talk
about planes as much as you, Quagmire.

Well, we're out of cell phone range
and the radio's shot.

This is not good.

No one knows we're out here,
and we've got no food or water.

Relax, Quagmire,
there's food all around us.

The trick is just knowing
what's safe to eat and what's not.

Okay, these are a maybe.

You guys, I think, for the time being,

we're gonna have to start
thinking in terms of survival.

Yeah, we're just gonna have to do
what Davy Crockett would do.

I mean, that guy killed a bear
when he was only three.

Honey, don't you think it's weird

that our three-year-old son
is murdering animals?

Nonsense.
He's a healthy, normal, young boy.

Ma, Pa, I killed my pet raccoon.

Why, Davy?

So I could have this cool hat

and 'cause it felt like heaven
when I was doing it.

Well, it's getting dark.
We should probably start a fire.

Man, how do we do that?

Hey, do you think there's directions

about starting fires in the song
<i>We Didn't Start the Fire?</i>

-I don't think so.
-I better go through it all.

<i>Stuff, stuff, stuff and stuff</i>

<i>History and stuff and stuff</i>

<i>People, people, someone's name</i>
<i>History and sports</i>

<i>Big disaster, someone's name</i>

<i>Stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff</i>

<i>History, someone's name</i>

<i>Something I don't know</i>

<i>Famous guy, movie star</i>
<i>Don't know who these people are</i>

<i>Stuff and stuff and history</i>

<i>Yelling really loud at me!</i>

Okay, how's the fire coming?

(OWL HOOTING)

Okay, this should work. If it rains,
at least we know we can stay dry.

Yeah. So, now our number one concern

is
that predators are watching our body heat.

Peter, that's just a movie.
That's not real.

PETER: <i>No, I think we need to cover</i>
<i>ourselves in mud to avoid being seen.</i>

QUAGMIRE: <i>Peter, Joe's right.</i>
<i>That's only a movie.</i>

JOE: <i>Oh, God, somebody farted!</i>
QUAGMIRE: <i>It stinks!</i>

PETER: <i>We should not rule out the predator</i>
<i>having been the farter.</i>

Okay, we still got nothing to eat,

so it looks like we're gonna
have to hunt animals for food.

And since we have no weapons,
I set up some traps and snares.

Well, I was about to take a leak.

-Can I go in that direction?
-Yes.

-(SCREAMS)
-No.

Damn it, my legs! I think they're broken!

Yay, Joe. Now you have a friend.

Damn it, Peter, this is all your fault.

Listen, I wish you had a family
to take care of you, too,

but that's a choice you made.

Here you go, guys.

First time in a while
I've had wood in my lap.

Are we supposed to laugh at that?
'Cause it's upsetting.

Man, being out here sucks.

I mean, I'm not a forest guy.

I'm more of
a take-it-all-in-at-the-beach guy.

(SIGHS)

Excuse me, sir. This is private property.
What are you doing?

Just taking it all in.

You're staring at my daughter's bedroom.

She's really grown into her body.

This is gonna be a fun summer for her.

You guys, we've been out here
a couple of days now,

and I don't think
anyone's coming to get us.

It might be time
for one of us to go for help.

Well, what do you want us to do?
Peter's the only one who can walk.

What? You want me to just walk out there,
straight into the woods?

Peter, if you don't, the only other option
is we sit here and wait to die.

(SIGHS) All right, I'll do it.

If I just keep walking,

I gotta hit civilization
at some point, right?

-Thanks, Peter.
-Yeah.

And good luck.

Uh-oh.

What?

Well, I hate to ask you this, Quagmire,
but do you know how to change a diaper?

Yeah, of course I know
how to change a diaper.

I saw <i>Mr. Mom</i> four times.

(LAUGHING)

That's not how you dry a baby.

He has to do it
'cause his wife has the job.

But motherhood's a job.

Motherhood's a job too, though.

Morning.

What the hell! Where'd you come from?

Yeah, what are you doing
out here in the middle of nowhere?

Middle of nowhere?
No, I live right over there.

What? A plane crashes in your backyard,
and you don't say anything?

This is Canada, eh.

I thought it might be rude
to intrude on your plane crash.

Well, this is great news! We're saved!

Yes, I suppose so.

Listen, why don't we
head back to my place,

grab a bite to eat and watch
the big curling match on TV?

Canada is in the world final
against Mexico.

No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

(CROWD CHEERING)

<i>(LA CUCARACHA</i> PLAYING)

Okay, well, we have to
grab our friend, Peter.

He just headed out that way to get help.

Oh, that's not good.

There's nothing in that direction

but wilderness
for thousands of kilometers.

What? You're kidding.

Oh, crap. Peter!

Peter, come back! Peter!

Peter! Peter!

I think he's gone.

I'm afraid he might not have survived,
Mrs. Griffin.

We've been searching
these woods for weeks.

We've got to keep looking.
He's got to be out there somewhere.

Oh, my God, we're in Canada.

I get to use my new passport.

I hope my picture looks okay.

That's Liam Hemsworth.

No, it's not. It's me.
It's just a really good angle.

God, just look for Peter. God.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,

there's been no sign of your husband
for two months.

We're gonna have to suspend our search.

But there's got to be something we can do.

Well, the odds were always against us.

Most black men don't possess the skills
to survive out here in the wilderness.

My husband isn't black.

Oh, boy.

Well, then, we need to regroup, because...

We haven't been looking.

Wait! We may have
a possible lead on Peter Griffin!

What? Oh, my God, where is he?

Well, we didn't find him,
but we found this.

And there's some scribbling on the back
that says, "Mrs. G."

We figured "G" has to stand for "Griffin."

No. That "G" isn't for "Griffin."

It's for "Garrett."

This is Mrs. Garrett
from <i>The Facts Of Life.</i>

And <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>
Why does everyone forget that?

Kids, your father made this.

That's so weird.

Dad gets lost in the woods,
and he makes a doll?

It's not that strange.

It's kind of what Tom Hanks did
in <i>Castaway.</i>

I'm sorry, Wilson!

(SOBBING)

Right here is where we found the doll.

Okay, everybody fan out
and look for your father.

-Peter!
-Peter!

-Dad!
-Fat-ass!

(RUSTLING)

Peter?

Thank God! We found you! Are you okay?

(WHIMPERING)

What the hell!

It looks like he's become
some kind of feral beast.

Oh, my God!

(CONTINUES WHIMPERING)

I can't live by society's rules, either.

(GRUNTING)

Mom, I still don't get it.

How could Dad turn into
some kind of feral creature

just from two months in the wilderness?

Yeah, it's weird. He doesn't even talk.

Well, he was living among
wild animals for two months,

and you know how impressionable
your dad can be.

Hmm...

Peter, this is your home.

(GRUNTING)

This is the couch where you sit.

(SNIFFING)

Yes, that's the television.

Kids, I think he recognizes the TV.

We're all thinking it,
and he just does it.

You guys, this is gonna
be harder than we thought.

I guess we're all just gonna
have to work together

to reintroduce your father
to civilized society.

Well, that's gonna be a challenge.

But it can't be any harder than folding
that thousand-mile-long sheet.

All right, I got my corner.
Everybody ready?

Ready. Chris?

Ready. Meg?

You know, long ago, before this happened,

your father did make some videos
in case he ever became feral.

I guess they're worth a shot.

<i>Hello, feral Peter.</i>

<i>If you're listening to this,</i>
<i>you've probably become feral,</i>

<i>and you're probably thinking of</i>
<i>a nice, juicy rabbit right now.</i>

(GRUNTING)

<i>But this isn't who you really are, Peter.</i>

<i>We got to get you back on track.</i>
<i>Isn't that right, buddy?</i>

(GRUNTING)

Look, it's working!

<i>Okay, good. So, feral Peter,</i>

<i>why don't you put in tape</i>
<i>number two and let's get started.</i>

<i>Don't listen to that Peter!</i>
<i>That Peter is a liar!</i>

<i>Run! Be free! They will enslave you!</i>

(GRUNTING)

(GRUNTING)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

All right, now,
I've been trying to figure out

something we can do together,

and I think I've found it.
We're gonna sing a song.

Now, I'll start, and when I point to you,
you'll sing your part. Ready?

<i>-War!</i>
-(GRUNTS)

<i>Yeah! What is it good for?</i>

<i>Absolutely nothing!</i>

Okay, all right, good job.
Now, let's try something else.

<i>-I wanna get you home and...</i>
-(GRUNTS)

-Double up.
-(GRUNTS TWICE)

Okay, I like where this is going.
Let's take it from the top.

(PLAYS STEREO)

<i>I like big butts and I cannot lie</i>

(RUSTLING AND GRUNTING)

Damn it, he's in the garbage again.

Oh, my God!

Come on! Get out of the trash.

Who threw out my sequin top?

STEWIE: You're 43! Accept it!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

-Hey, Lois.
-Hi, Glenn.

We just thought we'd come by
and see how Peter was doing.

-Yeah, has he gotten any better?
-I'm afraid not.

He's still only speaking gibberish.

Yeah, and we could live
without the semen throwing,

I'll tell you that.

I don't know what else to do.

We've tried everything
to bring the old Peter back,

but we can't break through to him.

Lois, I think you've done all you can.

Hard as it is to admit,

it might be time to let
Peter be where he belongs.

What do you mean, Brian?

We might have to release
Peter back into the wild.

What! We can't do that.

We'll never see him again!

Eh, enough time passes,
you'll forget all about him.

Just like Inspector Gadget forgot
about that one-night stand.

-Suzanne, we have to talk.
-Okay.

Someone has made contact with me.

Someone from my past,
and, well, long story short,

go, go, Guatemalan son.

(GRUNTING)

Peter, we all love you very much,

but we think maybe
this is where you belong

and where you'll be happy.

This is barely even a forest.

I can see an Arby's through the trees.

You're free, Peter.

Whatever adventures lie ahead of you,

know that my heart
will always be with you.

Now, go! Go on! Get out of here!

(GRUNTING)

(CRYING) I always knew
one day this would happen.

We will never forget you,
but you're better off here.

Why are we dragging this out? It's 6:30.

Go ahead, Peter. Go on!

Be with your own kind!

We're all gonna miss you, Dad!
More than you know!

(GRUNTING)

-What?
-My God, I...

I think he's trying to talk to you.

Quick, Meg! Say something else!

Well, okay.

I love you, Dad,

and no matter where you are,
you'll always be my father.

(STRAINING)

Shut up, Meg.

-(ALL GASP)
-I don't believe it! Peter, you talked!

Shut up, Meg.

Shut up, Meg.

Shut up, Meg.

Shut up, Meg.

-Peter!
-Dad!

-You're back!
-(HALF-HEARTEDLY) Yay.

Jim.

Your name is Jim.

Close enough, Peter!

Come on, you guys, let's go home!

(ALL CLAMOR HAPPILY)

Yeah!

STEWIE: Is she letting him drive?

Boy, I sure am happy to be back.

Yeah, Peter, we thought
we'd lost you for good.

And luckily, I don't know many words,

so I was able
to relearn them all in a day.

Don't ever leave us again, Dad.

Sorry, Chris, but this weekend,

Quagmire's taking me
to a Canadian strip club.

He said he's put together a very
special surprise, just for me.

Peter, come on, it's time to wake up.
You got to get to work.

(DEEP VOICE) Ah, Lois,
I ain't feeling good.

Peter, what happened to your voice?
It's so deep.

I think I'm sick.

Well, you don't sound like yourself.

In fact, you sound kind of hot.

I just threw up
two chicken gyros out my nose.

They're on your side of the bed.

Oh, say that again.

(LAUGHING PLAYFULLY)

But I want you to keep talking to me
in that sexy voice while we do it.

Okay, great.

Let's pretend you're a tollbooth worker
and I'm molesting you.

Okay.

I don't have any change.

-Now take off that parka.
-Uh, uh, uh.

You're gonna have to pay a high toll
if you want to get into this tunnel.

Come on, don't say stuff like that.

I want you to be scared, not make puns.

<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>For those of you who turned out to see</i>

<i>I again apologize for what I said</i>
<i>about Moroccans.</i>

<i>But today's breaking news is that</i>
<i>the New England Toy and Game Company</i>

<i>has issued an immediate recall</i>

Oh, my God, that's the same

We got to send that thing back right away.

Boy, I wonder if there's anything more
on Channel Two about this.

<i>Our top story, Channel Five</i>
<i>news anchor, Tom Tucker,</i>

Oh, my God, that was amazing.
I'm gonna have to crawl to the bathroom.

Yeah, that was incredible.

It was the first time I had an orgasm
out the front and back.

Oh, Peter, this voice of yours
is really something.

Oh, I can't get enough of it.

Yeah, it's been pretty great.

You know, I even won a deep voice contest
with Joe yesterday.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

-I heard you coming.
-I made myself heard.

-Where have you come from?
-I've come from where I've been.

You still riding with that
mangy polecat Fletcher?

Fletcher met the long arm of the law

at the wrong end of a shotgun
and the deep end of a grave

at the far end of a dead-end road.

Winner!

(JOLLY MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, I should probably get going.

Me, Joe and Quagmire
are going bowling again.

We got a big tournament
coming up next week.

Well, hurry back, handsome.

Oh, Peter, this is so much fun.

I feel like I have a secret lover
nobody else knows about.

Just like Carly Simon.

Ms. Simon, enough years have gone by

since you wrote your classic hit,
<i>You're So Vain.</i>

Don't you think it's time to tell the
world who that song was written about?

No. That will always be a secret
between me and him.

<i>You're so vain</i>

<i>You probably think</i>
<i>this song is about you</i>

<i>You're so vain</i>
<i>You're so vain</i>

Come on, Rupert, let's go.

This is the first day we're allowed
to the end of the driveway,

and I intend to take full advantage.

Rupert?

Rupert?

-Hey, what's going on?
-Brian, I can't find Rupert anywhere.

-Have you seen him?
-Oh, I thought Lois would've told you.

She sent him back to the factory.

What? Why?

She was afraid he was gonna choke you.

Oh, that was a game we played.

Believe me, I was in control
the whole time.

No, the company issued a recall.

But don't worry, they sent a replacement.

-Here, the guy just delivered it.
-Replacement?

What the hell is this?

What? Come on, he's a cute little giraffe.

Maybe you could call him,
like, Gizmo or something.

Oh, look, he can fly.

(MAKES WHOOSHING SOUND)

I hate him.
His mouth is always open like P. Diddy.

Well, what do you mean?

You ever notice how
in every photo of P. Diddy,

his mouth is hanging open?

Well, actually, Diddy hired a guy
to close his mouth for him.

I'm telling you,
this kid is the next Justin Bieber.

Young girls love him,
but he makes real music that...

Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

(NORMAL VOICE) Good morning, Lois!
How's it going, Brian?

Peter, what happened to your voice?

Oh, you know what happened, you sexy minx.

My white blood cells attacked
the pathogens and created antibodies,

and then the pathogens were filtered out
by my kidneys into my urine

and then expelled from my body, you slut.

Peter, not now.

What the hell, Lois?
Yesterday you were all over me.

And then, for a confusing period,
inside of me.

I had no control over
what I did yesterday, Peter.

I mean, I'm glad you're feeling better,

but, boy, that sick voice of yours
was hot.

Damn it, this sucks, Brian.
I was getting laid left and right.

Yeah, sounds like being sick
was really working for you.

Well, you know what I got to do?

I got to make myself sick again
and get that voice back.

Peter, that might be the worst idea
anyone has ever had.

Well, you're wrong there.

The worst idea anyone ever had
was silver bullets.

Barbara Liebowitz's husband
just bought her a diamond broach.

You know how he afforded that?

He uses regular bullets.

He uses regular bullets.

-Meg, have you seen Dad?
-Yeah, he's at the dentist.

He's trying to get sick.

Okay, go ahead and spit.

It's okay, go ahead.

All right, Chris, I figured out
a great way to get sick.

I'm gonna be a woman at work
who cannot get sick right now.

(SNEEZES)

Sweetie, maybe you need to go home.

I'm not going home.
I cannot get sick right now.

I have way too much to do.

It's okay, everyone will understand.

No. I cannot get sick right now.

There's Kendra's birthday
and the baby shower,

and with this move,
I just cannot get sick right now.

I have to finish typing this...
Typing this...

(GROANS)

That's it, I'm taking you home.

-(SNEEZING)
-You did this to me!

-Lindsay!

Over here, Lindsay!

Excuse me, which one was
Lindsay Lohan's dessert fork?

Uh, I think it was that one.

Give me cocaine!

Do I sound sexy?

Tell me I sound sexy.

Peter, what the hell? You look terrible.

Clear off the couch, kids.

I'm gonna do your mother right here.

Oh, my God, Peter!

Oh, I'm leaving.
I cannot get sick right now.

Dr. Hartman, is Peter gonna be okay?

(GROANING) If one more person
asks me about a patient today,

I'm gonna scream.

What time is it?

Peter, what are you doing?
Get back in bed.

I can't, Lois. I got the bowling
tournament this afternoon.

Quagmire and Joe are counting on me.

Forget about bowling, Peter.
You're very sick.

You're not going anywhere.

But if I don't go, we'll have to forfeit.

I'm sorry, but you need
to stay here and get better.

Well, then, you're gonna
have to bowl for me.

What? Peter, I haven't bowled
since college.

Please, you got to do me this favor, Lois.

You owe me from when I took you
to see Shakespeare in the Park,

even though it was the part of the park
where the gay guys go to have sex.

To be, or not to be...

(MAN 1 GRUNTING)

MAN 2: Right there!

Ignore that, that's not part of the play.

That is the question.

Whether 'tis nobler...

MAN 1: This isn't love, by the way.

Brian, get your keys.

I need you to drive me to that toy factory
so I can get Rupert back.

Stewie, Lois sent him back
'cause he's not safe.

But, Brian, I miss him!

Without Rupert, I...

Are you watching porn in the kitchen?

Come on, man, we eat in here.

Anyway, I need you to drive me
to Middleborough.

Middleborough? That's, like,
two hours from here.

-I'm not doing that.
-Come on, Brian.

Tell you what,
you drive me to Middleborough,

and I'll teach you my secret
to picking up chicks.

Hey. You, me, ba-boom, huh?

Thanks for filling in for Peter, Lois.

Yeah, okay, but I hope
you brought it today,

'cause this ain't no ladies' lunch.

Well, I'll certainly do the best I can.

But don't worry, Glenn,

I'm one woman who knows
a thing or two about sports.

Yeah, I know you think you are.

Your softball chatter made that
quite clear.

Okay, that's two down, guys, two outs.

Two out of the three outs required.

Okay, guys, let's go.

Tom Brady is a quarterback.

Okay, heads up, two down.

College football is on Saturday.

Okay, come on, look alive.

NBA players are predominantly black.

Oh, hi, Lois. What are you doing here?

I'm filling in for Peter. He's sick.

All right, finally a little harpoon
in the bowling alley.

All right, what do you say
we get this thing started, huh?

-(LOIS GIGGLING)
-Whoo, nice roll, Lois!

My God.

If she chews gum,
she's got the whole package.

Yes! That's what I'm talking about!

Take that, you jagoffs! I hope you die!

God, Quagmire gets
so competitive with sports.

Hey, Quagmire, it's just a game.
Take it easy.

I'm not gonna take it easy!
These guys are going down!

You're going down
in front of all these people!

All right, Lois, it's all up to you.

We only need six to beat the Pinheads.

And it would be four

if someone could've hit
that seven-10 split, right?

Joe! Joey, Joey, Joey, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe!

(INHALES)

-Yes!
-Yeah!

Yeah! We did it!

Oh, what's this? What's this?
It says right here we won!

We won, you dicks! You suck!

Um, excuse me, would you mind
keeping it down?

We're having my son's
birthday party over here.

Yeah, sure, sure, sure, honey.

-What's his name?
-Mikey.

Happy fucking birthday, Mikey!

Yeah!

Well, this is great.

So when you guys aren't celebrating
a big bowling victory,

what do you normally do here?

Uh, well, sometimes we compare women.

Talk about who we'd rather have sex with.

Oh, that sounds fun. How do you play?

Well, it's like, um...

Okay, who would you rather do,
Kristen Stewart or Scarlett Johansson?

Oh, definitely Scarlett Johansson.

For one thing, there's the boobs,
which Kristen Stewart does not have.

Also, I get the sense that Kristen Stewart
is more of a bath person

when she really needs a shower.

She does seem kind of dirty.

Yeah, someone should write "wash me"
in the dust on that flat ass.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Move over, funnyman Richard Lewis.

We got Richard Lois!

Well, here we are.

Oh, great. Hey, maybe on the ride home,
someone else can tell a story.

So what exactly is your plan here?

I've got it all figured out, Brian.

This tour will take us deep into the
factory,

and when the time is right,
we'll slip away and find Rupert.

Does anyone have any questions so far?

Who's that up there?

Oh, that's our gunman.

Every once in a while,
one of our toys becomes real,

and we have to make sure
it doesn't get out.

Brian, look! That must be where Rupert is!

(GASPING)

Rupert! My God, you're all right!
Oh, you missed so much!

I had to deliver a speech to Britain,

and I overcame my stutter
through some pretty kooky means.

Brian, don't say anything.

Uh, Stewie?

Oh, crap.

This is not the way out!
This is not the way out!

Hey, Horace, get that
wiener out of your hand

and give us three more beers over here!

(CHUCKLES) Lois, you're always
giving me the business.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hey, I meant to tell you guys.
We shot some drug dealer this morning,

and he had three Red Sox tickets
in his pocket.

That's awesome!

Oh, this'll be so fun!

You know, if we leave right now,

we can probably still get there
before the first pitch.

-Hey, you guys.
-Oh, hey, Peter. How's it going?

Peter, it's so good
to see you up and around!

-Yeah, how ya feeling?
-I'm feeling shipshape.

If the ship is the <i>S.S. Minnow.</i>

Doctor said I'd be making bland jokes
for about a week, then I'd be good as new.

That's good to hear.

Well, we were just
on our way up to Fenway.

You got tickets? That's sweet.

You know, there's no better outing
than watching nine innings.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Sorry, I'll perk up at the game.

Oh, well, actually,
we only have three tickets,

and we're going with Lois.

With Lois?

Oh, yeah, we've actually been
having a great time with her.

And she's quite a bowler, too.

Is that all right, Peter?

Do you mind if I go
to the game with the guys?

Yeah, no, that's fine.
I mean, yeah, you only got three tickets.

I mean, that's cool. Have fun.

Okay, we'll see you later.

(SIGHS)

Hey, Horace, why don't you take that
wiener out of your hand and get me a beer.

Don't talk to me that way,
you son of a bitch!

-Oh, hey, Peter!
-Oh, hey.

-Did you have fun at the game?
-Oh, yeah, it was so exciting.

They scored the winning hit
right at the buzzer.

-I'm sorry you missed it.
-Yeah, no, that's okay.

I've just been hanging out here
having a great time with...

-Meg?
-Hey.

I thought you was a bag
of peeling potatoes.

Well, maybe next time you can come
with us when we go to Red Sock Field.

Nobody calls it that.

Quags and Swanny were so funny
yelling things at the visitors.

Quags and Swanny?

Lois, it's one thing to steal my friends,

but don't go giving them
stupid new nicknames.

What are you talking about?
I didn't steal your friends, Peter.

I'm only doing what you asked me to do.

No, I asked you to take my place
at the bowling tournament, that's it!

Look, Lois, I have my friends,
and you have groceries

and all those rusty pink razors
in the shower.

Now just stick to what's intended for you
and leave my things to me.

Are you saying you want me to stop
hanging out with Joe and Quagmire?

They're my friends. They're all I got!

And you know how hard it is
for me to make new friends.

Is this friends?

Stewie, we're never gonna find him.
They're all exactly the same.

Wow. I wish you could hear
how racist you sound right now.

Come on. Can't you give
that giraffe at home another chance?

You know, for every one they sell,
they save a giraffe in the wild.

(GUNS FIRING)

Sorry, giraffes! They only bought one!

Nah, they returned it!

And so Lois sweet-talks her way backstage.

Next thing you know, we're partying
all night with the trapeze people!

One of them drives a Volvo!

Drives a super-safe car,
does that for a living!

Go figure!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

So what? She can name a kind of car.
Big whoop. I can do that, too.

Vikki.

Vikki Carr.

Peter, relax.

It just happens that your wife
has some funny stories, that's all.

Well, I got some funny stories.

I knew a guy who choked on an almond.
And he had a stroke.

Now he can't take care of his own
bathroom needs. (LAUGHING)

-That's not funny. That sounds sad.
-Yeah, I feel bad for him.

Oh, don't feel bad for him.
He got his name in the paper.

-What?
-(LAUGHING)

(SOBBING) Please look at me!

What the hell's wrong with you, Peter?

Nothing. What the hell's
wrong with you, Swanny?

I'm Quags.

(CRYING) I don't know who
any of you are anymore!

Oh, he's really upset.

I haven't seen him like this
since he saw that Rocky Dennis movie.

Take off the mask! That's your problem!

Right?

That's it, Brian. He's not here.

-None of these bears are Rupert.
-Stewie...

(SIGHING) You don't have to say it, Brian.
I know.

So this is what it feels like
to be a grown-up, huh?

All alone in the world.

Look, Stewie, nothing lasts forever.

You and Rupert had
some special times together,

and you'll always have that.

(MACHINE CLANGING)

-What the deuce? What's that noise?
-I don't know.

Oh, my God! Brian, look!

That's him! That's Rupert!

-How do you know?
-You can't hear him calling me?

He's calling me, clear as day!

Oh! Yeah, now I hear him.

Rupert, yes, we're here to rescue you!

Stewie, wait! It's too dangerous!

I won't let it end like this, Brian!

Don't you give up on me, Rupert!

Hang on, Stewie! Maybe I can help!

Maybe I can use this helicopter
to knock Rupert off the conveyor belt...

Ahh! Son of a bitch!

Recall room, Brian. Nothing works in here.
Now come on! Rupert's in trouble!

Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

(BARKING)

Almost there. You can do this, Stewie.

-(SQUEAKING)
-Damn it!

Brian, do something!

(EXPLODING)

(SIGHING)

Oh, Rupert! Thank God you're alive!

I'm ready now.

I'm ready to get off the pill.

I think we should start trying.

Look, Peter, I think there's something
we should talk about.

I'm not reading the last page
of that dinosaur book.

I know something bad happens to 'em.

No, Peter, we need to talk about
this situation with the guys.

Look, of course I like hanging out
with Joe and Quagmire.

But I like hanging out with you more.

I mean, it's nice to make new friends,

but not if it means
losing the best friend I've ever had.

Yeah, well, I was probably
kind of a jerk, too.

I guess I shouldn't be telling you
who you can and can't be friends with.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Hey, you guys want to go with me and Joe
to the roller derby?

It's great. You get to see big, husky
chicks elbow each other right in the jugs.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

Yeah, and I'm bringing my grill

so we can eat corn in the parking lot
before we go in.

What do you say? Who's in?

-Sounds great!
-Yeah, that'll be really...

You know what, you guys?
I think I'm gonna just stay in tonight.

I got a huge stack of coupons
to go through.

Plus, I'm planning on having
my period really hard later,

and I want to be in the tub
when it happens.

-You what?
-Gross.

Oh, I get it.

Guys, I think Lois is getting a visit
from her Aunt Period.

Yeah, and lots of other chick stuff
you guys wouldn't be interested in.

Peter, go have fun with your friends.

Thanks, Lois.

Oh, hey, Brian. Where have you been?

Oh, just reuniting some old friends.

Huh. Me, too.

Feels good, doesn't it?

Sure does.

I love you, Rupert.
Don't you ever leave me again.

(SIGHING)

-(BUTTON POPS)
-(GULPING)

Now remember, we're here

so when you get the ball,
throw it like a cannon.

You must throw your arm out

Any other softball-related questions?

Yeah, I got a question.

Can we leave our bad-for-the-environment
Styrofoam coolers behind when we leave?

Yes, you must leave them behind,
and they must be in a crumbly mess

so that the city clean-up workers
have to chase the little bits

when the wind blows.

You know, Stewie,
this is actually a good park.

I've found a lot of old tennis balls here.

I don't care for this place.

Last time I was here, I accidentally
walked into a Spanish picnic.

Excuse me, has anyone seen

Oh, <i>es</i> baby.

Don't get any ideas about Julio.

That's right. We got to know each other

What's up, fools?

I'd like to dedicate my performance today
to Miss Whitney Houston.

Oh, we are (BLEEP).

Come on, Jerome!

Get a hit so I can bring
a sports trophy home for my parents!

Jeffrey Lipsitz has two soccer medals!

I can't play soccer,
I have newborn-calf ankles!

You know this, damn it!

I'm gonna tear the cover off this ball.

But, hang on,

Are you having a nice morning, dear?

Oh, yes, I love living here,

Everyone bring it in! Bring it on in!

Get a hit, babe!

You know it, babe.

All right, move it back! Move it back!

Peter, why do you look so nervous?

I promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit a home run for him.

Sorry, I struck out looking.
Wait, you're not the kid I promised.

No, he died last night.

Oh, phew.

All right, guys, one more out
and the game is ours.

Come on, Horace! Strike him out!

Oh, my God! He's really hurt bad!

You're out. Game's over.

-He's dead.

Let him rest in peace.

Let's put some leaves on him

I can't believe Horace is dead.

I can't believe we left Brian in the car
with the windows up.

I'm gonna pee!

Listen, I just feel awful about this.

Horace was a good bartender
and a good guy.

I wish there was something I could do.

Well, we know you didn't mean it, Jerome.
It's just a terrible situation.

Like when you're the only one at the table

where the waiter doesn't say,
"Good order."

-I'll have the halibut.
-Ah, great choice.

One of the chef's specialties,
you'll love it.

It was caught fresh
less than ten miles from here.

I'll have the New York strip steak.

It is a spectacular cut, superbly seasoned

And I'll have the chicken.

Mmm-hmm.

Good afternoon.

I'd just like to say that

Perhaps there are some men
who would like to say a few words.

Horace owned The Clam for over 30 years.

During that time,
he touched all of our lives.

He was a great bartender

I've been yo-yoing a turd

Oh, sorry. I was looking for the bathroom.

I shouldn't have left the door open.
Sorry if you're grossed out by this.

No. No, no, I'm just not used to seeing
corpses that big and not in a toilet.

Here, let me help you with that.

Now you're all set for your big day.

Of course. It's what he would've wanted.
Listen, we all got to move on.

on November 23, 1963.

All right, guys, I know that yesterday

All right!

Nichols, you should go home and change.

What the hell? Hey, pal,
what're you doing? This is our bar.

Not anymore.

Horace owed more than this place is worth,
so it's the bank's now.

I'm sorry, but The Drunken Clam
is permanently closed.

Closed?

PETER: <i>That was the start</i>

for businessmen to have
homosexual encounters.

Hey, thanks for the sex.

Thank you for notarizing those documents.

Peter, what's going on down here?

Why are there beer bottles
all over the floor?

Well, we needed a new spot to drink, Lois.

Forget it, Peter.

You're not turning our
living room into a bar.

Come on, Lois, we got
to have a place to drink.

Drinking is the only thing
holding this friendship together.

Everything we try to do sober
just ends badly.

I just don't think a good way

Yeah, and don't you think it's confusing

that every character in the movie

the Oscars are next week,

so let's get this done.

Meg, I'm needed upstairs,
so I'll let you finish up.

Just put some blush here and here.

It makes the eyes look
a little less dead and hollow.

Wow, that really works.
Hmm, maybe I'll try that on myself.

Oh, uh, you have what we call
a "closed casket face."

Hey, Meg, who's your date?
He looks like a real stiff.

-(LAUGHING)
-Chris, what the hell are you doing here?

I told you not to bother me at work.

I got locked out of the house,
and I need your key.

No way! You get to work
with all these dead people?

Hey, look, this guy's picking his nose.

(LAUGHING) Look, now he's eating it!

Chris! Knock it off!
You're gonna get me in trouble!

Meg, they're dead.
Would you stop being so uptight?

You're like one of those Asian-Americans
who fought in Vietnam.

Ah!

Oh, it's just me.

Peter, I thought you were taking us
to a new drinking spot.

What are we doing at The Clam?

Look, guys, we tried other bars,
we tried drinking at home,

we even tried the big end-of-the-year
high school party

that will change everything.

If we don't lose our virginity tonight,
we're never gonna make it in college!

Hey, where's Peter?

Only talking to Amanda Small,

But aren't you going out
with JoAnne Fuller?

JoJo? No, she's my neighbor.

Hi, Peter.

But I thought you was workin'
on your garbage sculpture.

There was someone I had to see first.

Sorry, Amanda. By the law of '80s movies,

a newly transformed tomboy
supersedes your long-standing hotness.

(GRUNTS)

<i>And all I ever knew</i>

<i>Only you</i>

Let's face it,
there's only one drinking spot for us,

and it's The Clam.

But, Peter, it's closed.
We can't go in there.

Quagmire, when a girl says
she doesn't want to have sex with you,

do you take that as an answer?

(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)

My lawyer has advised me
not to answer that question.

Look, I bet you could squeeze
through that window.

It's not even locked.
And all the booze is still in there.

Come on, guys, this is trespassing
and it's against the law.

Maybe we should just let The Clam go

and, I don't know, spend more time
with our families.

Yeah, I tried that.

I just spent most of the time
testing Chris to see if he's autistic.

(WAILING)

Not overly affectionate.

Guys, this is where we belong.

Yeah, no question about that.

Yeah, we got roots here.

We've been coming to this place
for 15 years.

Our roots go back further than that.

My grandfather used to bring me here
when I was a kid.

And his grandfather brought him here.

Good day, gentlemen!
Welcome to The Drunken Clam!

Can I get you boys a mug of stout?

Why, certainly.

This is a bully establishment
you've got here.

The doors are a little short,
but that's okay,

because we're smaller back now.

-To The Clam!
-Hear, hear!

And to brain-damaging venereal disease.

I wake up with blood on my penis pillow.

I'm gonna go insane in a wheelchair,
staring at the sea.

(MUMBLING) This is everything about...
It's The Clam, I love it.

I was just gonna... That's exactly.

(STAMMERING) Hey, remember...
Remember when...

Remember when Quicktime here
passed out in this booth,

this booth, and we did stuff to him
that you do to ladies

and we promised we'd never tell you.

What?

To The Clam!

Joe, you... Your hair looks stupid.

All the greatest...

All the greatest moments of my life,
I spent right here in this booth.

Maggie's first word.

Bart jumping that canyon.

Mr. Plow.

All the greatest moments of my life.

Why is Label Guy trying to punch me?

Punch you first, Label Guy.

I got to go pee. I don't want to get up.

Joe, where's that thing?

Where's the thing?
Where's the catheter thing?

No, it's mine, it's private.

What happens if I blow in this end?

Don't, I'll 'splode.

I'm gonna.

(AIR WHISTLES)

You do it better than Bonnie.

It takes a man to know what a man likes.

Meg, the Dougan family called

and they now want Mr. Dougan
in a gray suit for the wake tomorrow.

'Cause it so matters.

-Could you change his suit, please?
-Sure.

I'll be back in a bit.

Oh, my God!

All right, Chris, where is it?

And don't try to act like
you don't know what I'm talking about.

Fine, you caught me.

So I borrowed your bra.
My boobs hurt when I go down the stairs!

No, not that, you idiot.
Where is the dead body?

I know you took it.

And don't lie,
or I'll tell Jennifer Connelly

that you're the one who's been mailing her
those dog heads.

Yes, I'd like to mail this to a whore.

Okay, fine, Meg!

I used the body to get me
into R-rated movies.

After that, I took him swimming
and he fell apart.

Chris, Mr. Dougan's wake is tomorrow,

and there's going to be
a body in that casket.

If it's not his, it's going to be yours.

Hey, guys, what's goin' on?

And no one says anything,
which means they hate it.

Oh, God.

I am so hung over.

Me, too.

But luckily, when I'm hung over,
I can just molt into another Peter.

(GROANS)

Wow, that's amazing.

Yeah, but for the next ten minutes,
I'll be very vulnerable to predators.

(LION ROARS)

(GASPS) Mountain lion.
Make yourself look big!

(ENGINE REVVING)

What the hell?

There's a bunch of bulldozers out there.

Hold it, hold it! What's going on?

We're here to demolish this building
by order of the bank.

Like hell you are!

What are you talking about, Peter?

We ain't goin' nowhere.
This bar belongs to us.

(BELLS CHIMING)

Ice cream truck!

-You didn't get any ice cream?
-The ice cream man was handsome.

I got nervous.

<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>for a Channel Five breaking news report.</i>

<i>Three local men have barricaded</i>
<i>themselves inside a Quahog bar</i>

<i>and are currently</i>
<i>in a standoff with authorities.</i>

<i>We now go live to Joyce Kinney,</i>

<i>who attended her sister's</i>

<i>Thanks, Tom.</i>

<i>One of the suspects has been</i>
<i>identified as Peter Griffin.</i>

<i>But the real story is, I'd be married, too</i>
<i>if I were willing to date a Persian.</i>

Guys, they found him.
Don't bother with the posters.

My God, what is Peter thinking?

Yes, he's crazy as a serial killer.

All right, what do you
want for your last meal?

I think I'll just have a salad.
Dressing on the side.

I had a huge last lunch.

<i>All right, listen up in there!</i>

<i>Let's not make this</i>
<i>any harder than it has to be.</i>

<i>We have a lot of dumb cops here.</i>

Guys, this is crazy. Plus, I'm a cop.
I can't be a part of this.

Come on, Joe, this is our bar.

It's where the three of us
made that suicide pact

that Quagmire and I are gonna
back out of at the last minute.

I'm sorry, guys, but it's my job.
I got a family to support.

That jerk! How could he desert us?

Relax, Quagmire, he's just doing his job.
You'll forgive him.

Just like Kathleen Turner
forgave her mirror.

Sorry. Turns out you were right about me.

Officer, wait!
I'm his wife, give me that bullhorn.

<i>Peter, you get out here right now,</i>

<i>or else I'm throwing away</i>
<i>all of your Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.</i>

It's okay, she only knows
where the decoys are.

Swanson, there you are.
Listen, you hang out at this dump.

I want you to go in there
and end this thing.

I'll do my best, sir.

PETER: <i>This is our bar.</i>

<i>It's the cornerstone of our friendship.</i>

TIM GUNN: <i>Joe, this is Tim Gunn.</i>
<i>I agree with your friend.</i>

I got to get that guy out of my head.

Look, they're sending Joe in.

All right, listen up, fellas.

Joe, wait, put your gun down.

There's no point in fighting anymore.

We'll leave quietly.

Like hell you will.

This is our Clam,
and we are not gonna let them take it.

-Yay! All right!
-All right! Yeah!

We love Joe!

Swanson, what the hell's going on in here?

I'm sorry, Chief.

I just can't let them
bulldoze this building.

Hey, Joe, is this the same chief
whose wife is a real hog?

Swanson, don't be a fool.

You really want to throw away
your career on this?

Guys, your bar is gone.

And since it's bank property,

I have no choice
but to place you all under arrest.

JEROME: It ain't bank property no more.

Jerome? What are you doing here?

Listen, it's kind of all my fault
this happened in the first place.

I'm responsible for Horace's death.

Plus, as a former athlete,
it's my responsibility

to invest my earnings in a restaurant,
bar, or car dealership.

What sport did you play?

Lacrosse. Which is also my brother's name.

Look, I felt bad
about what I did to Horace.

So, when I heard on the news
that they were tearing down his bar,

I saw buying it as a way
to carry on Horace's legacy.

So I own the Clam now.

Chief, you can call off your cops.

And you can send those bulldozers home.

Yay, The Clam is saved!

Yeah! All right.

-We pulled it off, guys.
-Oh, thank God.

And all because I believed in myself
like Pop-Pop always said.

Please give me rat poison,
I want only to die.

No, we did it, Pop-Pop.

Meg, the family is here
for Mr. Dougan's wake,

so could you please bring in the body?

-Meg, I'm not doing this.
-You have to, Chris.

Siblings have to look out for each other.
Like the Mannings.

Eli, you threw for three touchdowns today,

which isn't bad, except Peyton had four.

Well, Cooper got pre-approved
for a Visa card today.

Come on, guys, we all had a good day.

(SOFT ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

-Stop it.
-I have an itch.

I don't care.
Dead people don't scratch their balls.

Well, I can't help it.
It's these damn wool pants.

I'm going bananas.

If I can't scratch them, you have to.

Shh!

Just straightening out his pants a little.

CHRIS: Oh, yeah, that's good.

Don't give up if it rolls away.
You scratch it. Scratch it.

Yeah, thank you.

Hello, I'm Helen Dougan.

My husband had filled out
an organ donor card

before he passed away,

and a woman just lost
her face in a freak accident.

Meg, though you cannot tell,
I am frowning.

Wow, Jerome, the place looks great.

Yeah, look at you, owning a bar.
You guys are doing pretty good.

First you get to run Somalia, now this.

Well, it sure is good
to be back in the old Clam.

Hey, there's some guys
sitting in our booth.

Maybe we should tell them it's our booth.

Uh-huh, or we could just sit on the floor,
next to these garbage cans.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you</i>

<i>a Channel Five News special report.</i>

Good evening.
I'm Joyce Kinney with this special report.

The latest police statistics have revealed

a significant rise in crime
throughout Quahog.

That's right, Joyce. And just to
put it out there, Tom Tucker is packin'.

I drive a 2006 Infiniti,
and I don't intend to lose it.

So come and get some, punks.

An increase in crime? That can't be right.

I haven't noticed anything like that.

You're in the house 14 hours a day.
What would you notice?

Well, I hate to admit it, Lois,
but over the last couple of years,

this town has changed a lot,
and not necessarily for the better.

Yeah, I mean, the other day,
I left a doodie

right in the middle of a Crate and Barrel.

Came back 45 minutes later, it was gone.

Yeah, even school's
getting more dangerous.

The bullies have been so busy, they're
outsourcing their bullying to India.

MAN ON PHONE: <i>Okay, do you see</i>
<i>the back of your underwear in the mirror?</i>

Yes.

<i>Okay, I want you to pull it up</i>
<i>as high as you can.</i>

Well, I disagree with you guys.

I think Quahog is still pretty great.

You know, it's hard for me
to take the things you say seriously

when I know what's been
in that mouth of yours.

Look, I realize Quahog isn't
the small town it used to be,

but it's still very special to me.

It's my home.

Yeah, come on, guys, she's got
dyed roots in this community.

Lois, I know you love this town, but
nothing is ever as innocent as it seems.

-Give me all your money!
-Okay, okay!

You have a white wallet?

Yeah, just like Truman Capote.

Who's Truman Capote?

What a surprise!

The mugger's never heard
of Truman Capote.

There's a library card in there! Use it!

And now, let's meet our star!

Give a warm Quahog Oceanland
welcome to Bojangles!

All the fish in the bucket now!

Not one fish at a time as a reward!
All of them!

Okay, okay, take it easy.

Okay, the one thing you don't want to do
is tell me to take it easy.

Now do that thing where you rub my belly!
I really like that!

Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, now I'm gonna balance
a ball on your face.

-One more push.
-(STRAINING)

There we go! It's a boy!

And he's got a gun!

(GUNSHOTS)

(CRYING)

Well, you guys, we did it.

We finally went to a restaurant
without somebody yelling at us,

and then the rest of the place
applauding them.

(ALL GASPING)

Oh, my God!

We've been burglarized!

Well, we'll just have to get that
$17 insurance check and start over.

Oh, my God, it's so creepy to think
there were strangers in our house.

I've never felt so scared.

I have.

And now we wait.

Oh, no, they took my gym shoes.

Sorry, glutes, no blasting today.

They took my dirty rope
that was tied in a knot!

They stole the chair I use in the shower!

They stole all my pens!

I... I don't have a lot of stuff.

Son of a bitch!
They also stole my sense of wonder.

Nope.

Oh, this is horrible!

Maybe you guys were right.

Maybe our town has changed.

I know, it's awful.

Pretty soon,
guys are just gonna be showing

their boners to babies and stuff, I bet.

It's sad to think that Quahog
isn't safe for families anymore.

I mean, all I ever wanted
was to raise our children

in a wholesome place,

far away from all the crime
and problems of the big city.

I'm reading you, Lois.

I'm reading you loud and clear.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

I'm looking for a wholesome place
for my family to live,

so I'd like to buy your farm.

All right, well, the going rate
for my farm is $875,000.

Uh... Nobody called ahead?

What?

Well, somebody from
Fox was supposed to call ahead.

They usually take care of it,
and then I just go ahead and do stuff.

I didn't get no phone call.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Oh, yes.

Yes, that'll be fine.

Ah.

Hey, Lois, you know how I'm always
buying things impulsively?

Well, that's gonna be very hard to do
now that we're living on a farm.

What? What are you talking about?

A farm, Lois. It's where vegetables live.

Peter, you went out and bought a farm
without even talking to me about it?

Well, Lois, in my defense, I have nothing
to back up the beginning of this sentence.

I can't believe this.

But it's not like it's the first time you
made

a big family decision
without consulting me.

(WHISPERING) Yes, I'd like to see
your quietest doctor.

Peter, where'd you even get the money
to make that kind of purchase?

I sold the house.

And I did it on craigslist,
so I also made a dangerous friend.

What? How could you sell the house?

Spooner St. is our home!

I mean, I have three aprons
that say, "Quahog."

What do you want me to do, start all over?

Lois, you were saying yourself

how you want our kids to grow up
in a wholesome place

away from the big city.

I... I did say that.

And, Chris, you've been telling me

how you wanted to watch animals
humping other animals,

what might not be okay with it.

That's true.

And, Meg, you yourself
said, "Lip gloss, unicorns,

"Channing Tatum, something
something, bullshit."

You were listening the whole time?

Don't you see, you guys?
I did this for the family.

Just think of this farm as
our next great adventure.

Like when we tried to
invade the city of Troy.

(SOLDIERS MURMURING)

LOIS: Peter, I don't think
this is the right horse.

PETER: I am 100% positive
this is the right horse.

Come on, guys, what do you say?

Will you join me in eating eggs
fresh out of a chicken's butt?

Yay! Now I can be one of those filthy
teens

with sad eyes at a farmer's market!

Well, with what's become of Quahog,
maybe it is time to make a change.

-I'm in, Dad!
-Me, too!

All right, let's do it.

Hey, what's going on?

Well, we've made a decision
as a family, Brian.

We've decided to take you
to a nice, big farm upstate.

What?

A farm with big open fields, Brian,
where you can just run and run and be free

and no one will ever hurt you.

Doesn't that sound wonderful, Brian?

Are you ready to go to the nice farm?

No! No! You'll never take me alive!

Okay, I am at full candy corn right now.

(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

Here we are, everyone.

The Griffin family farm.

Wow, look at us, Brian, frontier people.

I feel like those miners
who first struck gold in San Francisco.

(CLANKING)

Oh, my God, we did it! We struck gold!

This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!

Rich and gay.

Come here.

(COWS MOOING)

Peter, what are you doing?

Well, Lois, a big part of owning a farm
is crossing a road very slowly with cows.

Okay, okay, Bessie, now.

Get yourself out there. Easy does it.

-(BRAKES SQUEALING)
-(HORN HONKING)

Hey, come on, man! I got to get to work!

And so do they, sir.

-Hurry it up!
-(HORN HONKING)

Wait a second.

Now get in line, you!

Hey, I thought I told you kids
to go plow in the field.

But, Dad, we've been plowing all morning.

Yeah, I can't take any more plowing.

I can barely walk.

Look, I know it seems like dirty work,

but, Chris, you got to spread that seed
until your sack is empty.

And, Meg, you got to clear
away all that brush

so he can plant it deep
where it needs to be.

Okay, we'll keep at it, but I think
that hoe is pretty much worn out.

Well, flip it over, you can use
both sides.

(FANFARE)

Peter, there's a guy
standing out in the yard.

Oh, yeah, that's Larry.

Part of being a farmer is having
a best friend named Larry

who I spend huge amounts of time with,
but never actually talk to.

(SINGING) <i>Ooh, you make me live</i>
<i>now honey</i>

<i>Ooh, you make me live</i>

<i>Oh, you're the best friend</i>
<i>that I ever had</i>

<i>I've been with you such</i>
<i>a long time</i>

<i>You're my sunshine</i>

<i>And I want you to know</i>
<i>that my feelings are true</i>

<i>I really love you</i>

Peter, I'm dying.
This is the last time I'll ever see you.

Bye.

Peter, I've been running
the numbers on this farm,

and we're in deep trouble.

We haven't grown a single crop to sell.

And meanwhile,
you're spending half our money

down at the General Store,
and the other half at the Specific Store.

-Do you have almonds?
-What kind of almonds?

-Marcona almonds.
-From what region?

The Basque region.

The Basque region's pretty big.

-North? South?
-Southern Basque.

-How much should each almond weigh?
-Point eight ounces?

-Sorry, we only have point sixes.
-Aw.

PETER: Yeah, hi. Do you have stuff?
MAN: Yeah, we have stuff!

And is it true that you've been
spending the farm's money

on gingham shirts you tie into a knot
to expose your belly?

I bought a couple.

Well, with all this debt and no income,
there's no way we're gonna be able

to keep up our bank payments.

Peter, if something doesn't change,
I'm afraid we're gonna lose this farm.

Great, just what I need on my conscience,
another failed business.

Hi, I'd like to rent <i>The Proposal.</i>

Hang on, let me check the return slot.

I'm sorry, it hasn't been returned yet.

I have a poster from <i>The Proposal</i>
you can look at.

You'll get most of the story.

Huh. They seem pretty mismatched.

There you go.

Look, it's like I've been saying,
farming is very difficult.

When? When did you say that?

Farming takes incredible skill
and knowledge

and the sort of specialized experience
that takes generations to acquire.

Dad, my favorite hen laid
this crazy-looking egg!

Cheep-cheep.

What's your point, Brian?

My point is that maybe I should go
to the local state college

and take some agriculture courses.

With the proper training,

maybe I can actually learn something
that will save this farm.

Wow, Brian, that's a great idea.

And, hey, maybe I could give
the speech at your graduation.

I'm really good at that.

And so, as I look out at your
smiling faces filled with hope,

all I can think is,
"You are completely screwed."

As Martin Luther King once said,
"Ouch, I've been shot."

Thank you.

Okay, that's all my stuff.

I'm off to
State Tech Ag Central College Tech.

There's really two "techs" in there?

(SIGHS) The proudest day of a man's life
is when his dog goes off to college.

I'll learn all I can.
And I'll see you guys soon.

Oh, he packed a guitar? What a douche.

Guys, what's that over there?

(WIND HOWLING)

Oh, my God, it's a tornado!

And it's coming this way! We got to run!

Hang on, guys, it might just be
the Tasmanian Devil.

Come on! Into the storm cellar!

MEG: What is this place?
It's really dark down here.

PETER: Shh.
MEG: What? Did you hear something?

PETER: No, I just want you to
stop talking.

CHRIS: Wait, I think I found the lights.

What is that?

Sweet! It's some kind of lab.

Hey, maybe it has
one of those things that goes...

(IMITATES ELECTRIC BUZZING)

'Cause that's important for science.

Look at all this stuff.

Burners, plastic tubing.

12 cases of cold medicine?

You guys,

I think this is a meth lab.

Oh, my God.

You mean like as in...

D-R-U-G-S?

Aren't those I-L-L-E-G-A-L?

What's going on?
What are you guys talking about?

Uh-oh. Someone's getting cranky.

I think he needs an N-A-P.

What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

Man, I got to crack this code.

Oh, my God!

You guys, there's a fully functional
meth lab in our basement.

Boy, we should clean this place up.
It's a meth.

Brian?

Oh, right, you're at college.

We have to call the police.

Whoa, whoa, hang on, Lois.

Now, I know you're freaked out, but
when you really stop and think about it,

this meth lab is our family's best chance
to make meth in a lab.

What are you talking about, Peter?

I'm talking about saving the farm.

Don't you see? This lab is just
what we need to get back on our feet.

No way, Peter.

Dealing drugs is morally wrong,
not to mention incredibly dangerous.

Come on, we've always been risk takers.

You remember when we did it
in the bathroom at that restaurant?

I can't believe we're actually
gonna do this.

Yeah. You go in first,
and I'll go in a minute.

PETER: Oh, wow!

Oh, my God!

Oh, this is amazing!

You dirty girl.

Peter, I haven't left yet.

You sick whore.

Look, it'd just be temporary, Lois.

Just for a bit, just till we get
the farm back on its feet.

Till we get our family back on its feet.

I don't know...

Lois, we've always given our family
whatever it needs.

Well, right now, our family needs us

to sell illegal drugs
to the tank top community.

What do you say?

All right, Peter, we can make one meth,
and that's it.

And it's only because I don't see
any other way out of this.

Thanks, Lois.
Oh, this is gonna work out great.

Hey, are you guys
gonna feed us anytime soon?

No, sorry, we're doing meth stuff now.

I'll eat that.

You just got clean.

Everyone, now that I'm a meth dealer,

I'm going to respond violently
to outside noises

that the rest of you don't hear.

Okay, Peter, but I...

What was that?

Dad, I think that was just a cricket.

Then what the hell was that?

That was just me saying,
"That was just a cricket."

Dad, settle down.

There's no one out there, Peter.

You sure?

Yeah, yeah, you're right,
it's probably just a...

Did you guys lock the truck?

Dad, we don't even have a...

What the hell is going on out there?

Come on out, whoever you are!

I want to show my kids
what it looks like when a bitch dies!

Peter, there's no one there.

Well, maybe I should just fire
a couple of rounds into the darkness.

Don't hear those crickets no more.

(STRAINING) I'm not gonna make it.

You hang in there, you hear me?

Listen to me.

I want you to take care of my kids.

I will.

And I want you to be there
whenever there's a bad joke.

(HOARSELY) Let them know.
Let them know.

Gee, I hope I didn't scare the cows.
I don't want to put them in a bad mood.

(CRICKET CHIRPING)

(SOBBING)

-What's that, Dad?
-(PIGEON COOING)

It's my new meth distribution system.

I've trained this carrier pigeon
to do all my deliveries for me.

Fly away, Benjamin!

Ah, perfect, perfect.

Now this is the money I owe Peter.
I want you to take it back to him.

Do you understand?

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Yes, hello, I'd like to buy
400 blister packs of Actifed,

or similar pseudoephedrine-based
decongestant.

Why?

I have a cold.

(PRETENDS TO SNEEZE)

Hang on, let me check something.

Okay, you're fine. Be right back.

Well done, Stewie.
That could've gone really wrong.

Like that Kid Rock concert.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(GROANS)

Oh, my God, help!
He's having a heart attack!

Is anyone here a doctor?

No fucking way someone's a doctor here.

Hey, everyone, I'm back!

Hello?

What the hell?

(GROWLING)

PETER: Hey, Brian's home!

What the hell is going on?

Nothing, nothing.
Just working on a family project.

Getting in some together time.

-I have a crossbow!
-Chris has a crossbow.

Okay, well, uh...

I'm back from agricultural school,

and I might have the solution
to our farming trouble.

I brought some heirloom tomato seeds.

That's nice, Brian.

Here's a new kind of meth
you put in your pee-hole.

What?

-Oh, yeah, we're meth dealers now.
-Yeah, you missed it.

My teeth came in and then fell out again.

I don't believe this! Are you guys insane?

We're rich is what we are!
Look at all that cash, Brian.

He don't get none of that!
He wasn't here for it!

Well, this is just great!

I turn my back for a month,
and this place turns into a drug den!

For your information,
it is also a drag queen hangout.

Hey, look, our meth is on the news!

<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

<i>Our top story, methamphetamine is</i>
<i>flooding into Quahog in epidemic amounts,</i>

<i>and is believed to be originating from</i>
<i>the nearby rural community of Farmton.</i>

Farmton, that's the name
of the place we live.

I forgot to mention that earlier.

<i>For more on the story, we now go live</i>
<i>to Asian correspondent, Tricia Takanawa.</i>

<i>Tom, meth is fine! Everything's fine!</i>
<i>Go back to your own business!</i>

<i>Thanks, Tricia.</i>

<i>She's doing fun things for me, for money.</i>

Oh, my God.

We're hurting our own hometown.

All those drugs that are
flooding into Quahog are from us.

Oh, yeah?

Well, if we're dealing
so many drugs to Quahog,

why is the Quahog envelope
so light this week?

Yeah, I say we go down there
and talk to those people in Quahog.

No! This is what I'm talking about.

Meth has turned us into monsters.

-Lois, take it easy.
-No. You know what?

This is my own fault for listening to you.

I forgot you don't even know your ass
from a hole in the ground.

Is that my ass?

Lois, where the hell you going?

I'm going back home to Quahog,
where I belong.

If any of you want to come with me,
you're welcome to.

First of all, you sat in something green
and it's on your butt,

so no one's gonna follow you.

And second, no one's gonna leave a place
where there are tons of beakers

for a place where there are zero beakers.

Peter, don't you see?

We left Quahog
because of the crime problem.

But now we've become part
of that problem.

Yo, what is this bitch trippin' about?

Look at our lives, Peter.
Look at our family.

I don't recognize us anymore.

It's time to go back to Spooner St.
and be the Griffins again.

Let's go, Peter. Let's go back to Quahog.

But what about this farm? And this house?

And the lab inside the house,
which is currently producing

an incredibly volatile and explosive batch
of thermo-reactive...

(EXPLOSION)

(THUDDING)

There were a lot of Rottweilers
in that house.

Well, it's good to be back in
our old house.

How did we get this place back,
by the way?

Well, luckily the value
of this place plummeted

because this is a meth town now.

You know, I think the lesson here is that

if your community has problems,
you don't abandon it.

It's better to stay put
and help fix those problems.

That's right, Lois,
'cause wherever you run to,

your problems have a funny way
of finding you.

-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-WOMAN: Hey, are you guys in there?

Peter, I need a taste!

Oh, my God, it's Jodie Sweetin.
Quick, everyone lie on the floor.

JODIE: Peter, come on!
I've got Maureen McCormick with me.

She'll let you finish anywhere.

Okay, everyone hide upstairs.
Daddy's gonna take care of this.

(BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

Thanks for encouraging us
to come to Gay Pride Day, Brian.

Yeah, this seems like it'll be fun.

Real fun,
not "Entertain-your-wife's-parents-

"while-your-wife-is-at-work" fun.

Laura gets home at 7:00,

so I figure we can stare
at our wine glasses till then.

So, uh... So, when...

When do you guys think you're gonna die?

Wow, a parade.

It's like I'm walking past stuff,
but I'm not going anywhere.

Look, there's the float
commemorating sham marriages.

Sorry, this stomach thing
is acting up again tonight.

Oh, and I'm going on a business
trip to Mykonos for July.

And it says this next one
is the "Shocking Reveal Gay Float."

(GASPING)

I had no idea.

Hey, check it out. There's an air show.

(PLANES WHOOSHING)

Oh, my God, they're gonna crash!

No, no, don't worry. It's a gay air show.
They're just gonna lightly touch tips.

CROWD: Aw!

Well, listen up, everybody,

'cause it's time for our grand prize
drawing for those tickets

to see Celine Dion live in Las Vegas!

MAN: <i>Infertility!</i>

Here we go! Our grand prize winner is

Brian Griffin.

(ALL CLAPPING)

(ALL CHEERING)

Wow, I don't believe it!

Hey, congratulations, buddy.
You know, you're a lucky guy.

The only thing I ever won
was an extra day of summer.

Okay, Peter, one more day.

Yay!

I saw what I look like in a car window,
and now I don't want to go.

ANNOUNCER: (ON TV)
<i>We now return to</i> Franklin & Bash

<i>with indicators to show</i>
<i>which one is Franklin</i>

<i>and which one is Bash.</i>

Defensive blows to their heads
were to send a message...

ANNOUNCER: <i>Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

...help me get into used car sales.

Hey, Stewie, I don't know
if you have any interest in this,

but I was wondering if you want to go
to Vegas with me and see Celine Dion.

Are you kidding? Of course I want to go!
Wow, these are good seats!

I know. Apparently, they were donated
by Goldman's Pharmacy.

Turns out Mort's cousin
is Celine's opening act.

-Really? What's his talent?
-I understand he's a magician of sorts.

All right, for this next trick,
I need a quarter from the audience.

Okay, thank you.

-(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
-(DOOR SLAMMING)

(CAR STARTING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

You almost ready, Stewie?

We should probably start heading
to the airport.

Yes, I was gonna
talk to you about that, actually.

Last night, I was thinking to myself,

"Why fly,
when we can get there instantly?"

What? What do you mean?

Well, you see, I recently completed
construction on a teleportation device,

and it occurred to me, this
may be the perfect chance to try it out.

(BEEPING)

(WHIRRING)

Stewie, that's incredible!

Oh. Hey, guys.

Peter, what do you have there?

Give me the scissors.

I was just gonna make some masks!

-Use your scissors.
-They're not sharp!

(WAILING)

-So, what do you say?
-Hmm.

Teleport to Vegas, huh?
All right, let's do it!

(TYPING)

Okay, now,
the device is powered by kinetic energy,

so you've got to dance to make it work.

You, uh... Really?

Yeah, you've got to dance.

(LAUGHING)
What are you doing, you tool?

Do you know anything about science?
You just saw me program it.

(CRACKLING)

What the hell, Stewie? It didn't work.

Oh, that's odd.

It appears there may still be
a few more bugs to work out.

Well, it was worth a try.

(FAINT BEEPING)

(ENERGY PULSATING)

Oh, my God, Stewie, it worked!
We're in Vegas!

Yeah, all right!

Well, let's hit the hospital,

get checked for teleportation cancer
and then party!

Well, since the teleportation machine
failed to get us to Vegas,

I suppose we should just catch our plane.
I'll repair it when we get back.

You know,
this is going to be a good trip, Brian.

I really feel like fate is on our side.

Scissors are jerks. And I'm an owl.

Oh, wow, look at that, Stewie.
Perfect timing.

Oh, it's beautiful.
Everything's just so beautiful here.

Ugh. This is miserable.

Three-hour delay
and a completely full flight.

Don't look at us, you fucking pig.

Take your Juicy sweatpants
and your dirty pillow from home,

and your bucket of Coke,
and get the hell out of my sight.

What was her problem?

CROWD: Oh!

You see that, Brian? That's
going to be our penises later, right?

Stewie, that teleportation machine
is amazing.

It's so great that we're already here.

Yep, drink it in, Bri. Time
to enjoy all the Bellagio has to offer.

Classic architecture. Beautiful art.

Plus, the air is clean because
they suck up all the cigarette smoke

and dump it in the bad hotels.

Smell that, kids?
It's been in a rich person's mouth.

-Hi. We're checking in. Griffin?
-Ah, yes.

I see you've requested a bed
that's good for bouncing and jumping?

That is correct. I am a businessman.

Just sign here, please.

And you can actually keep
that pen if you'd like.

No way! Really?

Wow, you see that, Brian?
Good luck already.

You know, I know
we're switching to a digital world,

but I think
this little guy's still got a place in it.

Hey, we should try one
of those slot machines by the entrance.

You know, they always set those things
to pay out more

so they can lure people into the casino.

Well, that's a great idea.

(RINGING)

Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

Brian, we won! We won the jackpot!

This is unbelievable!

I haven't had this much fun
since I hosted the Oscars.

Good evening.

I just want to say that I have
the utmost respect for women everywhere.

And also, the Jews. Good night.

Thank God, we're finally here.
That plane ride took forever.

Kind of weird
they showed <i>Flight 93</i> on Flight 93.

Hi. We're checking in. Griffin?

Hmm, I do have a Griffin here, but
that room was checked into hours ago.

What?

Yes, and I'm afraid
we have no other rooms available.

I see. Is there a less heavy person
that could check again for me?

I'm sorry, we're all booked up
because the Slut Convention's in town.

-Slut Convention?
-Yeah.

They were promised a single millionaire,

but it's really just a bunch
of horny squirrels in a rich-guy suit.

So, you made your money in business?

Where's your room, handsome?

-Can I at least have that pen?
-No, that's Bellagio property.

Oh.

Well, this sucks.

Hey, I'm gonna go try one
of those slot machines by the entrance.

They always set those things
to pay out more

so they can lure people into the casino.

(GROANS) Damn it, Vegas!

Excuse me,
where can I find some smoking Asians?

Oh, everywhere? Okay.

(MUSIC STOPS PLAYING)

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, my God, this place is a dump.

Well, let's not be so quick to judge. It
says here there's a continental breakfast.

Oh, the continent is Africa.

Stewie, this place is a complete pit.

I mean, doesn't it seem weird to you

that we have to re-check-in
every 20 minutes?

Also the porn is free,
but we have to watch it in the lobby.

Okay, let's see
if we can turn this trip around.

I'm gonna try some blackjack.

Here, take $40.
I'm gonna go get some ice cream.

All right, I'll catch up with you.

Hey there, Denise.

-How you doing today?
-I don't know.

I usually have to check
with my boyfriend first.

Oh, uh...

Hit, please.

Twenty-four? Crap!

Do you know what it's like
to go to the doctor

and see your own foot in the garbage can?

Okay, you have a good night.

Hey, Stewie, I need some more money.

-I lost it all, Brian!
-What?

Well, I was on my way to get ice cream
and I passed a roulette table,

and I put it all on 16 because
of that Taylor Swift song, <i>Sixteen.</i>

-That song is called <i>"Fifteen."</i>
-It came up 15!

Stewie, that was all the money I brought.

I knew
I should've brought Peter instead of you.

Oh, come on,
you would've done much worse with him.

He's got a terrible tell.

(GASPING)

-(FANFARE PLAYING)
-(BICYCLE BELL RINGING)

-Any cards, Peter?
-No, I'm good.

Oh, this is gonna be great.
I hear she puts on an amazing show.

She does. You'll be amazed that
that voice comes out of that face.

Oh, thank God, we made it in time.

I didn't realize how far
that awful hotel is from the Strip.

The woman who cleaned our room
had no ears.

-I'm sorry, these tickets are invalid.
-What?

It's showing
that they've already been scanned.

I can't let you in.

God, this trip has been a disaster.

I know.
I actually thought I was gonna win big

and get
that plastic surgery I always wanted.

Oh, my God! Look at him.

He's so cute.

(BARKING)

I'm small, so this is okay.

You know what, screw it.
I say we just cut our losses and fly home.

Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

-What? Why?
-Well, I may have...

And... And you are gonna laugh about this
if I know your dark sense of humor,

but I may have gambled away
our plane tickets.

You what? How do you even do that?

It's Vegas, Brian. You can gamble
anything.

I'd like to bet my daughter's
virginity on 23.

I'm sorry, it's 31.

Ow!

How's it going here?

-Not great.
-I know what you mean.

We just took a pounding at
the craps table.

Look, why don't we just call Lois
and the fat man?

-Maybe they can help us.
-I don't know about that.

You know that 500 bucks we lost? I sort
of took that from Lois without asking.

-If she finds out it's all gone, she'll
kill me. -Oh.

Did you fellas say you were in a
bit of a fix?

My buddy's got the inside track
on a basketball game.

It's a sure thing.

I like how all your teeth
are different shapes.

Why are you telling us this?
What do you want from us?

Honestly, I'm trying to sell my condo,

and I need people
to come to the open house

and talk about how nice it is.

Wow, the price per square foot
is quite competitive

with similar homes in the area.

Yes, I also love it.

I will likely purchase it
unless others put in a rival bid.

Well, what's stopping you?

You know, you've always been
so noncommittal in our relationship.

Do know how much it hurt my feelings

when you paused before
introducing me to your parents?

And it's the same reason
you didn't take that job in Denver.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to waste
your time.

I just remembered
my husband is a total chicken shit!

I'm not 100% sure
what we're doing anymore.

It's like I say,
the best thing you can see in Vegas

is bar, bar, bar.

Yeah, and
he's not talking about slot machines.

Ooh!

Stewie, I'm still not sure
this is a great idea.

Relax, Brian,
we're betting on one basketball game.

That's it.

Then we'll be out of debt
and on our way home.

I suppose. I just wish we didn't have to
borrow money from a loan shark.

I mean, that guy seemed pretty serious.

Okay,
and just a couple of remaining items.

Please indicate here
if I look like a schmuck to you.

I'm gonna say no.

Great.
Then please check here and initial there.

Uh, next, do you think
this is some kind of game?

-Um, no.
-Okay, initial, please.

And finally, my date of birth.
Was it yesterday?

ANNOUNCER: <i>And that'll do it for us here</i>
<i>with Duke losing by just three points.</i>

We... We lost, Brian.

Oh, crap, we're screwed.

Hey, Stewie,
give me $100 from the backpack.

I want to pay a Wayne Newton look-alike
to beat up a Rita Rudner look-alike.

I'll give you $1,000.
Pay him to beat up Rita Rudner.

Stewie, we got to get the hell out of here
before that loan shark finds us.

Yes, you're right.

I've got a bad feeling, Brian.

I've got a good feeling, Brian.

I'm gonna get me that honey.

I say, Brian, this backpack feels
a bit lighter than it did before.

Well, I wasn't gonna tell you till later,

but I actually used part of my portion
to take care of some personal business.

All right, fine.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

Hey, boss, it's me.

I just spotted those two idiots
who borrowed all that money.

Yeah, well, now they're strutting around
in flashy suits.

Don't worry.
I'll get that money back no matter what,

and for sure I'm not gonna stop first
and get some crepes in the lobby.

(WHISPERING)
Where can I get some crepes?

Hey, Stewie, thanks for coming with me.
This really has been an amazing trip.

Yeah, it's been great.

Um, listen, Brian,
this might be a good time to tell you, uh,

I invited, um,
somebody to come to the room.

-Well, what do you mean?
-(LOUD KNOCKING)

Oh, that must be him now.

(GRUNTS)

Okay, come on, you
look nothing like your picture in the ad.

Shut up and give me the money!

What? What the hell are you talking about?

Okay, I'm starting to think
you're not Apollo.

You bastards think you can just borrow
a bunch of money from a loan shark

and then waste it on tacky suits?

Tacky? Sir, I'll have you know
I bought this in the lobby of a casino.

Well, don't shoot. You must have us
confused with somebody else.

We didn't borrow any money, I swear.

Sounds like somebody wants to die.

No, no! Stewie, just give him the money
from the backpack.

Okay, okay. Don't shoot.

Wha... It's empty.

It's just Cheerios and coloring books.

What? Where the hell is the money?

Sir, we can't give you any money,
but if you've got some milk and a bowl,

we can give you
a pretty healthy way to start your day.

All right, enough of this.

You, dog,
pick which one of you two is gonna die.

What? You can't ask me
to decide something like that.

The life of every being
is sacred, just like the life...

Fine. I'll kill you.

No, no, kill him. He's a baby.
He won't even remember he was alive.

-You son of a bitch.
-(GUN FIRING)

Ahh! Stewie!

Now, get us the money you borrowed.

(SOBBING)
Oh, my God, Stewie, no!

Yeah, I was booked for three hours
by Archibald Meatpants.

He's... He's dead.

Okay, well, either way, I'm getting paid
and somebody's getting torn open.

What the hell are we gonna do, Stewie?

We have no money, no way to get home,

and one of the loan shark's goons
is probably gonna

bust through that door any minute
and kill us both.

I wish my daddy were here.
He always knows what to do.

(ENGINE REVVING)

Son of a bitch.

Well, I better leave a note.
It's the right thing to do.

God, I've never felt so hopeless.
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

-Just wait for them to come kill us?
-Well, we could go on the run.

With what money? And they'd still find us.

Well, why don't we just hitchhike home?

Even if we could get back there,

we'd just be putting
the whole family in danger.

I don't see any way out of this.

Well, there is one thing we could do.

What? What's that?

We could go out on our own terms.

What?
You're saying we should kill ourselves?

Well, think about it.

We're stuck here, just waiting
for some mobster to do it.

At least this way, we can go out together.

But think about what you're saying!

Brian, we're dead no matter what. At
least this way, it'll be quick and clean.

Well, not clean for the staff
of the hotel,

but that's not really gonna be
our problem anymore.

I don't know.

Look, it's not like we've got a lot
to live for.

I mean, I'm just gonna end up like Chris,

only I'll be smart enough to realize
how miserable I am.

And you've only got
a few good years left anyway,

and that's if we even get out
of here alive.

(SIGHING)
All right, Stewie. Let's do it.

Yeah, see, I'm glad you came around.

You know, the only thing
that was holding me back even a little

is knowing
how much Lois is gonna milk this.

Everyone, I truly want to thank you
for your support

and remind you that as far
as casseroles go, we're good on pasta,

but we could use some more dessert items.

(SOBBING)

Oh, I miss my baby so much,

and I'm more of a chocolate person
than a fruit person.

Well, this is it.

I guess so.

-Count to three?
-Yep.

-One, two...
-One, two...

-Three!
-I'm sorry. I can't. I want to live!

I didn't really think we were gonna do it!

-You dick!
-(SPLATTERING)

Oh, my God, Brian! Brian, no!

Good Lord, what have I done?
I better get the hell out of here.

What the deuce?
Where did this come from?

Well, looks like Archibald Meatpants
is gonna have a fun night.

One-way to Providence, please.

Yeah, how much to get to Providence?

-Brian?
-Stewie, what the hell?

But how can you be...

(GASPING)
Oh, my God. Could it be?

What the hell is going on?

My teleportation machine worked.

Of course it did, that's how we got here.

No, that's how you got here. I flew.

The machine must have created
two pairs of us.

One that was teleported to Las Vegas,
and the other that wasn't.

You're kidding. That's unbelievable.

I know, it... Wait. Where's the other me?

Oh, um... What?

Where is the Stewie you came with?

Oh, well, these thugs came to shoot you,

and I tried to throw myself
in front of the bullet,

but it must have gone, like,
under my armpit or something

'cause it exploded your face.

Wait, what about the other me?

Oh, it was so sad. You took your own life.

I tried like hell to talk you out of it,
but you jumped off a balcony.

People keep coming back every hour
because they think it's a regular show,

like the volcano or the pirate ship thing.

Wow.

Well, I'm so glad you're alive.

Yeah, same with you.

-Well, we should probably head home.
-Definitely.

Um, the only thing is, I'm a little short.

Is there any chance you could cover me
for the ticket?

Let me see how much I have.

Good news! I have just enough.

ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
<i>Now departing for Providence.</i>

-No, that seemed lame.

You know,
the other you was a lot more fun.

Which one is <i>O?</i> Is that the swimming one?

Don't try to demean it.

I want to watch <i>The Weather Channel.</i>

There are tornados in the Midwest,

and I like watching poor people scramble
to save what little they have.

-I don't know where the remote is.
-All right, I'll find it myself.

Oh, my God, my old harmonica!

I'm going to play this really loud tonight
to get back at our Armenian neighbors.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey. Hey, looks like a fun party.

Um, hey, listen, it's 2:00 in the morning.

Uh, when is your five-year-old
going to go to sleep?

Soon. Very soon.

You want weird food
wrapped in weird leaves?

Yeah, look,
I'm guessing there's some kind of

soccer match from your home country
going on,

and I get that, I do.

But some of us are trying to sleep,
and I could almost deal with the noise,

but it's the cologne, all right?

I can smell it in my bed,
and I live two houses from here.

That's how powerful it is, okay?
That's how powerful it is.

You like it?

Yeah, I kind of like it.

Okay, so I know you're a harmonica,

but right now you're a 40-year-old woman
with a good body in a hotel pool.

"Hey, everybody, look at me.

"I work out seven days a week
for these five minutes.

"Your attention is going to keep me
from swallowing a bottle of pills."

LOIS: Hey, everyone, I made brownies!

(GASPS) I better hurry up.
I'm going to miss the show.

(SOBBING) What did I do? What did I do?

I love brownie day.

Hey, so, uh, I'm digging a hole
under the fence in the backyard.

Brian, you have a car.
You don't have to escape.

Just don't (BLEEP) say anything, okay?

Oh, you know what?
Hang on, I left my harmonica in the tub.

I think Peter's in there taking a bath.

PETER: (SCREAMS) Son of a bitch!

What the hell did I just sit on?

Where is it? Where's my harmonica?
It's not here!

Peter, have you seen Stewie's harmonica?
It was in the tub.

Oh, my God, it was in the tub,
and now it's in my butt!

No!

Stewie, Daddy needs your tiny hands
for a very special project.

Well, good heavens,
that's something, isn't it?

By the way, Mr. Griffin,
regarding your X-rays,

we're making a coffee table book.

Can you sign this release, please?

Okay, but first can we address
my husband's situation?

Well, the harmonica's
up there pretty good.

Unfortunately, removing it
would require a very expensive surgery

that's not covered by
your T.G.I. Friday's gift card.

-(HARMONICA PLAYS NOTE)
-(LAUGHS)

-What was that?
-I don't know,

(SNIFFS) but suddenly it smells
like John Popper in here.

That was me. I got musical farts.

-(HARMONICA PLAYS NOTE)
-(LAUGHS)

Holy crap, this is awesome.

I will not allow this opportunity
to go to waste.

Hey, Lois, how was your day?

Terrible. I accidentally backed over a kid
in the grocery store parking lot.

(HARMONICA PLAYS BLUES RIFF)

Peter, I'm serious.

I ran right over
the soft part of the face.

I had to run away.

I ditched the car
and jumped on a passing train.

(PLAYS TRAVELLING TUNE)

I was so scared,
I didn't get off until I was in the South.

(PLAYS SOUTHERN TUNE)

What'd you do today?

I pushed a boy behind your car
so I could do all this harmonica stuff.

All right, Chris,

Meg loves to listen to music
when she sleeps.

Let's see how she likes this.

Uh, Dad,
I don't think that's how it works.

This had nothing to do with the harmonica.

Everybody, brace yourselves,
'cause I have got big news.

I have been selected to be a contestant
on <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

And they're going to fly us all
to America for the show!

What? Oh, my God!

(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) Finally, we make-a
da dreams come true in America!

I am going to make this family proud,
and not just you guys,

but that old painting
of my ancestor in the attic.

I did it! I'm going to be on TV!

-Did you kill the others?
-I shan't!

-You must.
-(SIGHS)

I'm going to go talk
to the statue in the basement.

Did you kill the painting?

This place is a nuthouse.

Yo, welcome back to <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

Let's welcome our next performer,
here to play the harmonica, Peter Griffin.

Hi.

So, where are you from, Peter?

I'm from Quahog, Rhode Island.

LOIS: (WHOOPS) Quahog!

That's my family.

My wife daytime-drinks on vacation.

Okay, Peter, let's hear what you've got.

(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING)

(MURMURING)

(HARMONICA PLAYING)

-Wow, he's nailing it.
-I know, shut up.

(CHEERING)

(FARTS)

(ALL GASPING)

Well, there goes my music career.

I wonder if I can get my old job back
painting kids' faces at birthday parties.

There you go, Timmy.

Sir, you're going to have to leave.

You're just drawing penises with a Sharpie
on children's faces.

I don't know how to draw a cat.

-Hi, I'm Amanda.
-I'm Chris.

You look nice,
so I'll blow my burps the other way.

(LAUGHS)

-You're funny.
-Oh, thanks.

Usually people just find me awkward.
I have a hard time with small talk.

Did you find everything
you were looking for?

Eh, I did all right for a guy

who just had his first homosexual
experience with his guitar teacher.

All right, guys,
keep an eye out for our stuff.

I got tired of not being able
to find my bags,

so I tied a vaguely Hanna-Barbera
looking character to it.

This trip was impoceros!

There we go.

I really enjoyed
sitting next to you on the plane, Chris.

Me, too.

I'm sorry I screamed when that guy
from India got up to stretch.

Look, I'm having brunch tomorrow
with my grandparents

at the Barrington Country Club.

-Maybe your family could join us.
-Okay, that sounds like fun.

Oh, my God. Chris is dating a Barrington.

Who are the Barringtons?

They're the richest family
in all of Rhode Island.

(GASPS) I must notify Gossip Girl!

"Pass this along to Gossip Girl."

I still can't believe
Chris is dating a Barrington.

They own this whole club.

Yeah, look at all this luxury.
It's like being in a gay guy's dream.

-Enjoying the view?
-It's glorious, Edwin.

Would you like another salad bowl
of chocolate-covered oysters?

-Is that gay enough?
-And then some.

This has been the gayest vacation
I've ever had.

I love smelling me on your breath.

Peter, what are you doing here?
You're not a member!

And that means me and the other jocks
get to throw you in the pool.

Hey, Banks, Duffy, get over here!
This guy's going for a swim. Grab him!

(STRAINING)

All right, you're kind of heavy,
so, we're going to pee on you.

Not happening. All right, all right,
we'll just spit on you.

(LAPPING)

(SIGHS) Nothing we have works.

Daddy, we're here to have
brunch with the Barringtons.

The Barringtons! How is that possible?

That family is the pinnacle
of high society.

They haven't worked in eight generations.
All the kids have drug problems.

Most of them have OD'd.

That's terrible.

Well, not all kids make it, Lois.
Just ask the Sugar Smacks frog.

I'm sorry,
I'm afraid you've lost two more.

-What should we do about the graves?
-Dig 'em.

-You look really handsome today, Chris.
-Thanks, Amanda.

STEWIE: Hey, Chris, say it.

I use Stewart Griffin Facial Cleanser.
Try some.

Give her the web site.

-StewieGriffinFacial.com.
-No, no, no, that's something else.

It's StewieGriffinFacialCleanser.com.

Hey, listen, Mr. Barrington,
your granddaughter ain't no tease, right?

'Cause Chris really wants to get in there.

Oh, you're a funny guy, Griffin.
I like that.

Well, you should hear
my prank phone calls.

-Hey, is your refrigerator running?
-MAN: <i>Yes, it is.</i>

<i>-Are your doors unlocked?</i>
-What? Why?

I don't know,
they all kind of look the same.

What do you mean,
"They all look the same?"

Hey, there's all my favorite people!

Oh, no, not this suck-up.

What are we talking about?
Black people? Mexicans? Jews?

So good to see you, Barrington.

Hey, hey, where we going today, Reginald?
Huh? Huh? Where we going today?

You and me is pals, ain't we, Reginald?

Pewterschmidt, settle down!

I was having a nice conversation
with Peter.

Peter, why don't you tell me
more about your job?

You said you like to drink at work?

-I do.
-Oh, me, too!

Me, too. I'll drink anything.
Even that hollandaise sauce. Give me that.

(MEG SCREAMS)

Hey, Brian, Meg's Benedict.

(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

Oh, God.

Stop. Stop. Stop.
I'm sorry I even said it.

I'm so... It was a mistake.
It was a mistake. I'm sorry I said it.

Peter, why don't you and I
grab some air, huh?

Daddy, you're making a fool
out of yourself.

Why are you acting like this?

Look, I've been trying to get

into Reginald Barrington's
inner circle for years.

They've been the most elite family
in this country ever since it was founded.

They were the ones who invented
the buckle on the hat.

-Hey, I like your zipper hat.
-I like your zipper hat.

Morning, fellas.

Oh, that's going to be a game changer.

Do you hunt, Peter?

Well, I went to three stores
to find this shirt.

(CHUCKLES) Peter, you've got moxie.
I like that.

Hey, I've got moxie, too! Watch this!

Pewterschmidt, you imbecile!
You think that's funny, wasting fruit?

There are people
dying in hilarious places. That is it!

You are officially
kicked out of this club!

-What?
-Griffin.

We just had an opening.
Congratulations, you are now a member.

Oh, my God, really?

And to think, yesterday I was just a guy
at home eating catnip.

Excuse me, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

but you're no longer
a member at this club.

Don't worry, he's my guest.

Now, look, Peter,

just because you're a member now
and I'm your guest,

that doesn't mean things
are going to change between us, right?

No, no, of course not.
Excuse me a moment, Carter.

PETER: Hey, guys, I just bumped into
Carter Pewterschmidt outside.

-What a loser, huh?
-(ALL LAUGHING)

Okay, when he wasn't looking,
I stuck a springy snake in his wallet.

What? (YELLS)

PETER: And I switched out
one of his eyeballs

for a gag exploding eyeball.

What? That's... (SCREAMS)

PETER: And then I paid
a couple of Mexicans

to run over him with their car.

I hope they don't just take
the money and skip town.

Okay, you ready for some polo?

All right, this is more like it.
Where's Buttercup?

Oh, only members can ride Buttercup.

Guests have to ride Topsy,
the 'roid rage horse.

(SNORTS)

Now, whatever you do,
don't say his trigger word.

-What?
-(SCREAMS) That's his trigger word!

(SCREAMING)

Don't yell!
His parents were slaughtered by yellers.

-Just submit.
-I am submitting! It's getting worse!

-No, I mean really submit.
-Okay, okay!

Oh, my God, I meant say you're sorry,
not take off your pants.

Carter, what are you doing? Oh, my God!

And now that I've made you aware
of the misunderstanding,

you're still continuing with it.

Oh, my God! And I'm still watching.
What's wrong with me?

Oh, my God!

(SOBBING)

-Daddy, what happened to you?
-I can't live without the country club.

You did this, Peter!
This is all your fault!

-I like your hair.
-Well, Daddy,

you've been treating Peter like dirt
for years.

It's choppier, it's more texturized.

Did you go to the Asian guy
with the one name?

Well, now that you know how it feels,
maybe you want to give him an apology.

You went to Taki, didn't you?

Look, Peter, I'm sorry
for the way I treated you,

but is there anything you can do
to get me back in the club?

Well, I suppose
I could talk to Barrington.

Really? Oh, Peter,
you don't know what this means to me.

(SIGHS) You know, I was so desperate
there for a while,

I even tried a Jewish club.

You don't want to get involved
with them religious groups.

They believe in all kinds of weird stuff.

If I believe in Jesus hard enough,
I will not die.

If I believe in Snake Jesus hard enough,
he will die.

If I believe in Tree Jesus hard enough,
both of them will die.

Yay! Thank you, Tree Jesus!

Hey, Mr. Barrington.

Oh, hello, Peter. I'm so glad you're here.

We're shooting bald guys under 5'7" today.

Hey, there's the guy
who denied my health insurance claim.

Sir, your nipples are fine!
You don't need to reconstruct them!

I want Hershey Kiss nipples,
and I want you to pay for them!

Look, Mr. B., if it's okay with you,

I'd like to give my membership
back to Carter.

I'm sorry, Peter, but I just don't think
Pewterschmidt is country club material.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm about to shoot Michael Stipe.

(STIFLING LAUGH)

-Is that him in the corner?
-Yes, that is him in the corner.

-Is that him in the spotlight?
-Would you... Oh!

Damn it! Now he got away!

Oh, no. I said too much?

I want you out of here!

Look, Mr. Barrington,
he's my father-in-law.

So if he goes, I go.

Fine, I don't care.

Your low-brow antics
no longer amuse me, Griffin.

You're both out of the club.

Well, I guess that's it then.

Oh, there is one more thing, actually.

Can you talk to that angry little boy
down by the river bank?

Uh... Yeah, sure.

-Hey, what's eating you?
-Grown-ups.

Yeah, grown-ups suck.

Why do they get to make all the rules?

I know it seems unfair, but, hey,
there ain't no rules in a tickle fight.

-(LAUGHING)
-Stop! That tickles.

Timmy, there you are!

Who the (BLEEP) are you?
Get away from our son!

-But Mr. Barrington told me to...
-Who's Mr. Barrington?

-From the club.
-What club?

-You're in a lot of trouble, mister.
-(YELLS)

I'm sorry
I got us both kicked out, Carter.

I was just trying to help you out.

Mr. Barrington told me
I couldn't see Amanda anymore.

We never even got a chance to have sex.

Everyone knows rich, waspy girls
are the best at it.

I'm really going to miss that club.

You know what part I liked the most?

Walking around the locker room naked

and offering people
sections of a tiny clementine.

-Clementine?
-Oh, thank you.

-Clementine?
-None for me, thanks.

-Clementine?
-Yes, thank you.

-Clementine?
-Yeah, I'll have one.

-Ooh, softly.
-Sorry.

-Yes, I'll have one.
-There you go.

God, it's good to be old and nude.

Look, Carter, you can't be that surprised.

I mean, it's just human nature
to suck up to the people above you,

crap on those beneath you
and undercut your equals.

Well, then we just got to figure out a way
to make you fancier than Barrington,

so he's got to suck up to you.

I don't know, Peter.
That'd be pretty tough to pull off.

We just got to be bold.
Like those backwards-knee birds.

What? What? What?
What are you looking at?

Oh, you coming for me?

No, no, I'll just take

a big backward-knee step
in the opposite direction.

Yeah, yeah, you think I'm afraid of you?

I slept on your back last night,
you (BLEEP).

Yes, I'll have the filet mignon,
and they can start the sunset now.

Where are you fine gentlemen from?

We are European,

The Barrington Room?

Peter, that's the most exclusive room
in all of New England.

Yeah, I hear it's even harder to get
in there than the University of Arizona.

Well, it's beating.
Welcome to the Wildcats.

This is the Barrington Room.

Have a seat in the deepest,
most luxurious leather chair in the world.

Oh... That's nice.

-Sir, may I offer you a shoe drink?
-Why, yes, that'd be lovely.

Ah! The finer things.

-So, what brings you gentlemen to town?
-We're here on business.

In fact, we just came from a meeting
with the venerable Carter Pewterschmidt.

Outstanding man.

Really? Yeah, well,

he used to be a member here,
but he was very annoying.

Oh, my, that's surprising.

I've heard he has quite
the blue-blood pedigree.

You know,
he got a piece of Jackie Kennedy

before she was defiled
by that hairy olive-eater.

Yeah, and he once made me
a grilled cheese sandwich after this.

Well, I wasn't sure about Pewterschmidt,

but after hearing you gentlemen talk,
maybe I could give him another chance.

-Really?
-Oh. wow!

That's great news, Carter. You're back in!

Hey, let's get a couple of girls

and have seventh-grade
in-the-same-room-make-outs.

"Carter"? Wait a minute.

You're not Duke of Lacrosse Team!

And you're not
Viscount James Earl Tennis Racquet!

Security! Come throw these frauds
out of my club!

-Damn it, Peter, you blew it!
-(WHIMPERS)

I knew I couldn't depend on you!

You're not worthy
to lick my designer shoes,

you fat, low-life slob!

But, Carter, please!

Here, skip this rope
and do a lively schoolgirl chant.

But, Carter,
I don't know any city girl rhymes.

Do it!

(SINGING) <i>Lettuce, carrots</i>
<i>peppers and peas</i>

<i>Cabbage, taters, spinach and peas</i>

You already said "peas!"

I don't know any more vegetables.

Wait a second, hang on there.

The way you abused that man just now,
the way you treated your lesser...

I underestimated you, Pewterschmidt.

I thought you were just
some suck-up loser,

but you have shown me that you've got
the mettle to be one of us.

You are back in the club.

Oh, thank you, Mr. Barrington!

Yes. Now, I believe
there is just one last piece

of unfinished business
to take care of here.

(GROANS)

I'm sorry, but
the Viscount James Earl Tennis Racquet

and Duke of Lacrosse Team
already arrived two hours ago.

But that's impossible!

Peter, I'm sorry you've got to give up
the country club life.

Oh, that's okay, Lois.

'Cause you know, I got to say,

I don't think those rich guys
have it all that great.

Too much stress.

You know, you give me the choice,
I'll choose our life any day of the week.

Me too, Peter.

Can I have $50 to get my hair cut?

Absolutely not. That's a waste of money.
I will cut it myself.

-Oh, my God, Dad!

Peter, your breath! It's horrible.

(SNIFFS)

Is Whoopi Goldberg working out down there?

Peter, I think what everyone's saying

is that you've got "dad breath."

What the hell's "dad breath"?

You know, "dad breath."

Guys get older,
they stop paying attention to hygiene,

their bodies are changing...

It's just a fact that, at a certain age,

men start to rot from the inside out.

I don't smell it.

Huh. Maybe that explains what happened

All right, that's it, Peter,

we've got to do something
about that awful breath.

I'm making an appointment,
and you are going to the dentist.

Geez, you are not gonna let this go,
are you?

You're as stubborn
as a four-hour erection.

Well, she's long gone,

This shrimp was lodged
under one of your gums.

Wow, that must've been in there a while.

It's been weeks since I ordered
from Hurry Up, Shrimp.

I ordered that shrimp two hours ago.

Hurry Up, Shrimp?
Well, that just sounds fast.

On average, Americans spend

waiting for shrimp

When I heard that, I thought to myself,

"Why on earth don't these guys
just hurry up?"

So that's just what we did.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Come on! Come on!

you can order anything you want.

get to go to the dentist?

When you're older, Chris.

Good evening, countrymen.

-And women.
-(GIGGLES) Oh!

Welcome to The Founding Father.

Hey, little guy.

You know, that's a real treasure map
you've got there.

Okay, well, I guess
treasure hunting isn't for everyone.

Treasure, you say?

Ah, yes. You see, legend has it

that Quahog founder
Miles "Chatterbox" Musket

hid his fortune in fear of it being taken

by British soldiers
during the Revolutionary War.

He died before he could retrieve it,

and left behind only this map.

Many believe his treasure is still buried

right here in Rhode Island.

Okay, I'm gonna go do diarrhea,

and then I'll be right back
to take your order.

Lois, I know where this is!

Peter, please, that's just a place mat

to distract your children
while you're eating.

-There's no treasure.
-Well, what if there is?

Ah, see? Surprised you with that one.

You see, you see that rock
next to the "X"?

I know that rock, Lois.
It's right near Route 2.

-I'm finding that treasure.
-Peter, the map is a joke.

You're being played for a fool.

Like George McFly.

Hey, Lorraine,

whatever happened to that guy
Marty from high school?

Don't know. Never saw him after the prom.

Really? Sure you didn't run into him,
oh, say, about 16 years ago?

George, what are you talking about?

I'm talking about the fact that our son,

who you insisted
we name after that guy Marty,

looks exactly like him!

You think I'm an idiot?
That I wouldn't notice

that our son is a dead ringer
for the guy who fixed us up?

Mom, Dad, I accidentally set fire
to the living room rug!

I am not going easy on him!

Hey, guys, who wants to dig
for buried treasure with me?

What? What are you talking about?

Well, this child's place mat is telling me

to dig for buried treasure
by the side of the highway.

-Who's in?
-Aw, forget it, Peter. That's crazy talk.

Yeah, we're not going along with
another one of your stupid ideas.

I don't have stupid ideas.

Haven't you seen my documentary film?

You've been out here digging all day.

I-I told you this whole thing
was ridiculous.

(SIGHS) What the hell
was I thinking, anyway?

I must be some kind of idiot.

-(SHOVEL CLANGS)
-(GASPS)

-(GASPS)
-What was that?

Holy crap! Lois, it's the treasure!

Oh, my God!

Peter, you were right!

Oh, no, it's the one kid
who also followed the treasure map.

I don't believe it!

There really was something
buried out there!

Well, it's not the treasure,
but it looks like

it's a clue to where the treasure is.

"Face the circle in the square,

"you'll see me, I'll show you where."

Interesting.

Interesting, interesting.

Okay, well, if there is
a treasure out there,

we don't want anybody else
to know about it.

None of this leaves this room, okay?

Obviously. We're not idiots, Brian.

Hey, look! Dad's on TV!

<i>Hello, I'm Tom Tucker,</i>

(READING)

<i>We were a little late getting a website.</i>

Quick, Neil!
Sign into the neighbors' Wi-Fi

so we can get that clue.

Nurse, write down that clue,
and then go out in the waiting room and...

maybe start lowering expectations.

Treasure?

Yeah, baby?

Bring me a grape wine.

Peter, what the hell!
Now everyone has the clue!

Why would you do that?

Because I'm tired of people saying

I don't know nothin'.
Everyone doubted me,

so I wanted to rub it
in their faces that I was right.

All right, where is it?

Give me that! Is this all there was?

Yeah, is there anything else
we should know before we start looking?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is our thing.

We're not sharing this with anyone.

Peter, come on, are you serious?

If Joe or I found this,
we'd want you right alongside us.

Well, yeah, we're like peas in a pod.

Wait, wait. Don't go in there.

He's doing his podcast.

Oh, that's cute.

Now, that I like.

What do you think about this, you old bag?

Oh, no.

Look, you guys doubted me, mocked me,

constantly handled my Eggo
despite my clear instructions,

and now you want a piece of my treasure?

I don't think so.

Well, fine! We don't need you anyway!

Peter, I don't like this.

It seems like this treasure

is already turning people
against each other.

Hang on, you guys. I think I might
have figured something out.

"The circle in the square."

That could be the clock
in the town square.

Wow, that... You're right!
Brian, that could be it!

Well, let's get down there
before anyone else does.

(TOWNSPEOPLE MURMURING)

Son of a bitch! Everyone's already here!

Let's see,
"Face the circle in the square."

"Face the circle."

"Face."

Okay, the gesturing needs to stop.

No one else is doing that.

Look! When you face this way,

you're looking at the statue
of Miles Musket.

Crap, you guys,
there's already other people here.

They must have figured it out, too.

You're right. Okay, gather round, kids.

Family suicide.

Look-- there's a plaque!

"This square shall forever honor

"the memory of my son, Timmy Musket.

"Always a chip off the old block.

"May he rest in peace.

Miles 'Chatterbox' Musket."

Wait, when I played Jane Musket
in the school play

the last three weekends--
thanks for coming...

I couldn't. I had a thing.

I had a lot of dog stuff that day.

Yeah, weekends I like
to spend with my kids.

I learned that Timmy Musket is buried

in a cemetery on Block Island.

I remember it because
my big speech was, "Timmy..."

Meg, please. That must be what
"chip off the old Block" means!

That's it! Meg, take the car home!

Your mother and I are taking the ferry
to Block Island!

Chris, we need to find that treasure
for ourselves.

What do you mean?

Even if Dad finds the treasure,
he's not gonna share.

He'll just blow through it all.

Maybe you're right.

I mean, last time we came into some money,

he just wasted it on all those
diamond pinkie rings for everybody.

-What?
-Uh, well, uh,

yeah, we should probably go.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

What the hell? Where are they going?

Oh, forget them. They're dead weight.

If this treasure's going to be found,

it's up to you and me, Brian.

-What do you mean?
-Come on!

You think the fat man's
gonna figure out those clues?

-He's an idiot.
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

Yes, I mean, he's the guy who put
all those little bald men in incubators

because he thought they were babies.

(YELLING, GRUNTING AND MUTTERING)

Oh, my God, look at 'em.

Lois was right.

This treasure hunt has
turned them all into animals.

There's more where that came from, mister!

He was right. There was more!

Oh, look who's back--
the grave robber.

Hey, Lois.

So, what happened? You find your treasure?

No. I realized something after you left.

It's not the treasure that matters.

All that really matters
is the money you get

in exchange for the treasure.

I guess I had to learn that the hard way.

Peter, you were a real jerk out there!

(SIGHS) I know.

You were right.
I took this thing way too far.

And I'm really sorry
about how I treated you and the kids.

But you know me.
If I read anything on a place mat,

I just kind of go nuts.

Can you forgive me?

Chris forgave me.

I can't wait for you
to fall asleep tonight.

Of course I forgive you, Peter.

So I guess everyone else
came to their senses, too, huh?

No, they all ran off to McCoy Stadium.

What? Why? What's at McCoy Stadium?

Ah, there was a clue at the graveyard.

Here, I took a picture with my phone.

Oh, it's the next picture.

Just swipe it to the next one.

She saw me.

"You've crossed the miles,
you've pawed through clues.

"Find where he hits,
misses, cheers and boos."

Peter, this can't be leading them
to a baseball stadium.

Baseball wasn't invented until the 1800s.

Wow, you're really smart, Lois.

You know, Peter,
in the first eight minutes

of Meg's play, before I walked out,

they said Miles Musket
was a horrible drunk

and a wife beater.

So, when it says "hits, misses,"

it might be talking
about hitting Mrs. Musket.

And he probably misspelled "missus"

because he was drunk when he wrote it.

Or maybe he misspelled it
because cursive is hard,

and everyone should get off his back.

And "cheers" and "boos"
might be referring to a bar

where he would "cheers,"
and drink his "booze."

"Hits missus, cheers and booze."

Wait a minute--
it's got to be an old bar, right?

The Clam's the oldest bar in town.

(GASPS) That must be
where the treasure is!

All right, let's you put some makeup on

and get right down to The Clam!

Oh, no, they're closed.

Hang on. I got an idea.

But you have to believe.

-What?
-You have to believe.

Say you believe.

Okay. I believe.

This is worse than the time
we were in The Clam right now.

Yes!

Peter, look!

That's Miles Musket!

-It is?
-Yes!

How have you never seen
this painting before?

Lois, I'm completely hammered
every time I'm in here.

(GRUNTS)

(BOTH GASP)

We did it!

We found the treasure!

You know what, Peter?

Why don't you open it?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, okay, I'll-I'll open it.

Here, hold this.

"Congratulations.

"You have won
The Founding Father Restaurant

"Treasure Hunt Challenge.

"Please enjoy one free meal

"at select Founding Father locations.

"Expires May 16, 2006."

Wait a second. What year is it?

It's 2013, Peter.

-So that's...
-It's before.

The coupon's no good.

Oh, man!

Um, this sucks worse

than when I went
to that strip club without Lois.

-(DANCE BEAT THUMPING)
-(MEN WHOOPING)

Yay!

Well, Peter,
I hope you're not disappointed

we didn't find any treasure.

No, it's fine.

You know, the important thing is

we figured out those clues together.

I mean, so what we won't be able to pay
to fix them veins in your legs.

You're my treasure, Lois,

and I want you on my team for everything.

Except for sports.

Me too, Peter.

I love you.

I love you, too, Lois.

-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-No way that's the shrimp.

Peter, come on, get dressed.
We're late for church.

I don't want to go to church.

I always feel like that
priest has it in for me.

Body of Christ.

Body of Christ.

Butt of Christ.

-Aah! Lois, trade me.
-No.

You're not wearing that
to church, are you?

What? Yeah. Why not?
This is what I always wear.

She's right, man.
It's Sunday. Get noticed.

I'll be in the car.

I'm getting tired of you wearing
the same thing every day.

Look, that shirt's got
a hole in it.

I'd like to point out that Jesus
wore the same thing every day.

And you didn't hear Alice
giving him a hard time about it.

-Who?
-Wasn't that her name?

Let's just get to church.

And afterward, you're going to the mall
to go clothes shopping.

Well, you're coming with me.

Last time I tried shopping
without you, it was a disaster.

Hey, I'm home.

I got groceries. You what?

Yeah, I was driving past there,

and we were out of some stuff, so I...

You listen to me, you son of a bitch!

I've got one thing in this lifetime!

-One thing.
-(GROANING)

You always say I never
do anything around here.

Yeah, I like saying that more
than I like you doing things.

Dad, I got the rest from the car. Where...

Chris, run! You were right!

She didn't appreciate it!

Oh, crap!

CHRIS: Ow!

That's right.

I do groceries.

All right, even though
we just walked in,

and this whole place is one
hallway, let's consult the map.

Okay.

Uh-oh.

(GUNSHOT)

I'll bet we can find you
some new clothes in here.

PETER: Hey, Lois, are you sure
this place is for men?

Yes, Peter, it's for everyone.

Really? 'Cause this-this
kind of looks like a dress.

Peter, it's fine. Come on out.

Ha! You gaybo!

Hang on, Peter.

I'm gonna go look for a couple
things for me in here.

I'll be right back.

Okay, Lois, I'll be right here,

standing uncomfortably close to
the unnecessary piano player

in the middle of the mall.

So, what's it like
now that you've made it?

Did you ever have a bank account

full of pedestrians' disinterested smiles?

You're amazing.

I'm gonna sit Indian-style
on top of your piano.

There aren't enough verses
in any song I could write

that would express how much
hatred I have in my heart.

You talk like a book.

Hey, Lois, how about we try Sears?
They got good stuff.

Peter, nobody's been
in Sears for decades.

Oh, come on. When I was a boy,

we always used to go
clothes shopping at Sears.

Trust me. They'll have everything I need.

What the hell happened here?

Look out!

(MUFFLED SPEAKING)

He wants to know who you are.

We seek clothes for the cold times.

(MUFFLED SPEAKING)

He says he'll take you to
the clothes for herbs and meat.

Well, we can probably come up

with some herbs and meat, right, Peter?

Peter?

I'm with them now.

No girls allowed.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

See, Lois, now, this is more like it.

What the hell? Why won't this button?

It's the same size I always get.

Maybe you put on a few pounds, sweetie.

Lois, I weigh the same 293 pounds today

that I weighed in grade school.

Perhaps it's this lump
on the side of your neck, sir.

Oh, my God, Peter!

How long have you had that thing?

I-I don't know.

We got to go see Dr. Hartman right away.

Oh, my God, what if
it's something serious?

It's all right, it's all right.

We'll be in good hands
with Dr. Hartman.

He handled my reassignment surgery.

I think, emotionally,
I've always been a lizard, you know?

And now, I feel comfortable finally

in my leathery, scaly skin.

Kids, if you need me,

I'll be on the wall making
rapid, darting glances.

Is this just to get out
of my parents' visit?

No.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

BABS: Hello!

No, you're stupid!

Oh, hello, Griffins.

What can I help you with today?

Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge
lump growing on his neck.

Mrs. Griffin, that's called a "head."

I've been fooled by that one before.

Well, will you take a look at it?

I think it might be a tumor.

Okay, let's have a look.

Oh, yes, it appears that there is a...

Great rack, by the way.

Thank you.

Well, thank Grandma Griffin, really.

It appears you have
a subcutaneous vestigial twin

growing on your neck.

What is that?

Well, it's an incomplete twin

that never developed
into a fully-formed person

but still exists as a growth
feeding off your body.

Now, hold still.

I'm just gonna give you a little topical
anesthetic, and we'll have a closer look.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Hi, everybody!

Aah! What the hell is that?

Oh, my God! It's a little me!

Well, it looks as if he's more
fully formed than we thought.

Wow, your wife is gorgeous!

Is that a foot?

Almost!

This is awesome!

Finally,
I'll have an interesting silhouette

for the beginning of
my spoken-word jazz.

my poem...

at home.

MALE ANNOUNCER (OVER TV):
<i>We now return to </i>Quantum Creep.

<i>Al, what year is it?</i>

<i>-1972. </i>
<i>-Cool.</i>

<i>I'm gonna go show my penis</i>
<i>to some kids.</i>

Hey, Dad. How'd it go at the hospital?

Kids, remember how when you were little,

you always wanted a neck uncle?

No. Well, now you got one!

(SCREAMING)

What is that thing?

This is my vestigial twin.

I named him Chip.

You know, like "chip off the old neck."

I like to poke him
'cause it makes him happy,

and I feel it a little bit in my nads.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Well, keep that freakish thing
under wraps.

I don't want it cramping my style

while I'm macking on toddlers.

See you around, bitch.

You know, Lois, a lot of times
you go into someone's house,

and it's just a house, but you can tell

this is a home by all the love here.

-Aw! Aw!
-Aw! Aw!

Peter, this seems unnatural,
and, quite frankly, dangerous.

Hey, you must be the owner
of that Prius outside.

Thanks for saving the world.

He gets it.

He gets what we Prius
owners are trying to do.

Wow, the world is such a cool place.

There's so much I want to do and see!

Oh, he's such a great
energy to have around.

Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you
all kinds of cool stuff.

My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts,
even my new musket.

(RAPID, RHYTHMIC WHIRRING)

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

Lois,
I thought I heard a noise downstairs.

Go stall 'em for 20 minutes

and pray that it's not too damp in here.

(STRUMS CHORD)

Man, how do you know
so many songs?

Oh, when you're trapped
under a layer of fat,

a muffled folk song
is like manna from Heaven.

Give me a C.

(STRUMS CHORD)

<i>Michael, row the boat ashore</i>

<i>Hallelujah</i>

BOTH: <i>Michael, row the boat ashore</i>

<i>Hallelujah</i>

<i>Sister, help to trim the sail</i>

<i>Hallelujah</i>

<i>Sister, help to trim...</i>

(ROARING)

Aah! Run!

No, Peter, gently stroke
his snout counterclockwise.

Wow, it's working.

There's a universal language
for all creatures,

and it's called love.

Now, how about that River Jordan?

<i>River Jordan is deep and wide</i>

<i>Hallelujah</i>

Join us, bear!

<i>on the other side</i>

(STRUMS ENDING CHORD)

Good morning, boys.

What's in store for today?

Well, I thought we'd start
with a vigorous power walk

around the neighborhood.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking
we would just watch <i>Dr. Oz</i>

and eat cold cuts off our stomach.

Those people ain't taking
good care of themselves.

What? But there's so much
to do and experience!

Did you know

that the Quahog Museum
has an interactive display

on the history of the garment district?

Oh, look, Chip, Chip,
slow down, all right?

You know, just because
everything's new to you

doesn't mean
you have to do it all at once.

Peter, where's your sense
of fun and adventure?

You're starting to sound
like a stick-in-the-mud.

Well, that stuff sounds exhausting.

I'm just being honest,
like George Washington.

George, did you chop down
our cherry tree?

I cannot tell a lie. Yes.

And what is this pamphlet
I found under your bed

called "The Boston He Party?"

Not mine.

Wow! Is there any better time in the world

than 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday?

You already have two days
of hard work under your belt,

and there's so much more work to come.

Look, I'm trying to get
this stuff done here.

Griffin, did you finish
those purchasing reports?

Oh, that voice!

It's like God sneezing!

What the hell is this?

They found a guy on my neck.

Hello there.

I've never met a supervisor,
slash supermodel before.

Do you like crab?

There's a knockout crab place
right around the corner.

What the hell are you doing?

I'm using my knowledge
of the local food scene

to get this woman to go to bed with me.

Well, now we know.

I can taste what he eats.

-What are we watching?
-Oh, it's just a tennis match.

So this is tennis!

-(RACKET HITS BALL)
-Wow!

than sitting

through those
parent-teacher-cheetah meetings.

So, in short, your kids
are all doing great.

Keep reading to them every night,

and I think we're gonna
have a great year.

So unless there are any questions,

thank you all for coming.

Uh, yeah, I noticed
the hot lunch menu

doesn't feature any gazelle.

(OTHERS GROAN LOUDLY)

I'll bring that up to the board.

Yeah. See, I-I heard that last year,

(CHUCKLING) and...here we are again.

Listen, Doc, is there any way

you can have this thing
on my neck removed?

Well, Mr. Griffin, your organs
and his are intertwined.

That would be a highly
dangerous procedure.

You could die.

On the other hand, if you live,

I'll let you pick any prize
off that shelf.

Even the tiny pinball machine?

Oh, that-that shouldn't
have been up there.

Look, Doc, you got to do
the procedure, all right?

I-I don't care if I die.

I mean, maybe in my next life,

I'll come back as an
air bag or something.

(RHYTHMIC TICKING)

It's okay. It's okay. Peter's got you.

Don't you worry.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Is my wife okay? No, the ski boots
that was in the back

flew up and chopped
her head off.

You can turn your blinker
off now, it's very annoying.

Nurse, have somebody
fix that clock.

It's very distracting.

All right, let's get this started.

(MACHINE BEEPING)

All right, halfway done.

Time for a break.

<i>I hate myself</i>

<i>For loving you</i>

<i>Can't break free</i>

<i>From the things that you do...</i>

Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

little to understand.

Look at him over there,
playing that board game.

Ah, three.

Okay, one, two...

Sorry!

ANNOUNCER: <i>Sorry! The board game</i>
<i>that teaches you to be a dick.</i>

Dr. Hartman, is everything
all right with my dad?

Griffins, I'm afraid we lost him.

What? Oh, my God!

-Hey, guys.
-Oh, there he is.

It worked! I'm free at last!

But what about Chip? Where's Chip?

Hey, everybody, look who's walking!

OTHERS: Chip!

Oh, Chip, I'm so glad you're okay.

Yeah, and I'm okay, too.

So, uh, you know, Chip,
now that you're a free man,

this is a chance for you to go out

and make a real life
for yourself someplace.

I'll tell you what,

anywhere you want to go, I'll FedEx you.

What are you talking about, Peter?

Chip is part of our family.

-He's staying with us.
-What?

-Yay! Yay!
-Awesome!

Hey, hey, Dad?
Yeah, I'm done.

Can you pick me up?

Oh, that's okay. I have a book.

Oh, hey, Peter.

Lois, where's the couch?

Chip redecorated the room
to improve the feng shui.

He said our old furniture was
blocking the flow of energy.

I had my life's
fart savings in that couch!

-And where are the drapes?
-Chip took them

-to make play clothes for the children.
-What?

(CHIP AND OTHERS LAUGHING)

(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

Oh, hey, Peter. You're home.

Hi, Dad! Hi, Daddy.

We dug a lake for this!

ALL: Whoa!

Come out of that water at once!

Gosh, isn't Chip wonderful?

No, he's not wonderful, Lois,
he's annoying.

I don't get why everyone's
so in love with that guy.

-What's so great about him?
-Well, to be honest,

the same thing that used to be
so great about you.

What? What are you talking about?

Just that when you were younger,

you were as passionate
and full of life as him.

(HIGH-PITCHED) Hey, boys,
catch me if you can!

Oh, crap!
I didn't realize they had bikes!

(GROANS) What are they gonna do
when they catch me?

Oh, boy, I got
a back-of-the-head punch coming,

I just know it!

(PIANO PLAYING)

LOIS:

You're singing our song without me?

Oh, sorry, Peter, we couldn't find you.

Do you want to sing your part, Peter?

Go ahead.

<i>But where are the fashioned</i>

<i>Good fashion...</i>

I don't want to! (SOBBING)

I tell you, Chip is making my life
a living hell, you guys.

Remind me again, Chip is
that African kid you adopted?

No, that was Chocolate Chip.
We gave him back to Kenya.

But I can't take it anymore.
I got to get rid of him.

-Well, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know yet,

but I'll come up with something.

-Peter, what the hell is that thing?

It's a dingo. I named him Bingo.

If you can't have fun
with that, you're crazy.

(GROWLING)

Hey, Peter.

Wh-What's that?

Oh, he's gonna turn you
into a pile on Joe's lawn.

-What?
-Here, let's play steak catch.

Oh, boy, I got it!

-Hey, back to you, Peter!
-Ah, cool! Steak catch!

I'm gonna use my one

-(GROWLING)
-Aah! No! Not me! Not me!

Attack him! Aah!

Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.m.
Should I give up on breakfast?

Aah! Brian!

Browser history... clear it!

Peter, that dingo was meant
to eat me, wasn't it?

Why would you do that?

Because my life was fine
before you showed up.

My family liked me,
and-and I didn't feel bad

about not ever doing new stuff.

Well, I never asked to
grow out of your neck.

My life was better before I met you, too!

You're a terrible brother,
husband and father.

I'm out of here, and you could go to hell!

Wow, what a nice day out! Look! A rainbow!

I did it.

He's gone.

Just as easy as
the creation of techno music.

Wait a minute, what key are we in?

No, no, no, no, no, none of that.

Oh, hey, Peter. Where's Chip?

I haven't seen him all day.

He likes to yell out "Good luck!"

after they read each lottery number.

He's gone. I threw him out.

-You what?
-No!

Peter, how could you?

Whoa, whoa, what are you all
coming down on me for?

Meg throws away people who come
out of her body all the time,

nobody says nothing.

Peter, Chip was a part of our family.

And he's so little.

He can get hurt out there on his own.

We got to go find him.

We should look for him
in the ball pit at McDonald's.

You can just leave me there,
I'll conduct the search.

Meg's right! Come on, kids,
let's go find Chip and bring him back!

You guys do whatever you want.
I got stuff to do, anyway.

I got to get ready for my Bar Mitzvah.

<i>Baruch atah Adonai</i>

Great. I have to walk
down these stairs

the one day I wore heels.

(YELLING)

(SCREAMING)

(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

Son of a bitch!

I think I broke my leg!

(GRUNTING)

There's no way I'm gonna make it
back up those stairs.

(PHONE RINGING)

Nope.

Peter? It's me, Chip.

Listen, I... I'm sorry
for the mean things I said.

-Help!
-Peter?

Holy smokes! Peter, are you okay?

These books was already down here!

I'm not a nerd!

Oh, my God!

We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the <i>Ghostbusters</i> cars!

(GRUNTS)

(GRUNTING)

(LOUD GRUNTING)

-(HIGH-PITCHED FLATULENCE)
-(GIGGLES)

If you had only done that
while you were here,

we wouldn't be in this mess.

Mr. Griffin, you're a lucky man.

If it weren't for Chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

The bad news is, we did an X-ray,

and your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

Gosh, Chip, I don't know how to thank you.

No problem, Peter.

You would have done
the same thing for me.

You know, Chip, Lois
was right about you.

You are special.

You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

I got so used to watching TV

and looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

Thank you for showing me that.

As far as I'm concerned,

you're a permanent
part of our family now.

Well, that sure is nice of you,
Peter, but...

there's a big old world out there.

I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

-ALL: Aw!
-Why?

Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip.

I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

Safe travels, buddy, and keep in touch.

I will!

Whee!

-Good-bye, Chip!
-Bye!

Come back soon, okay?

Hey, thanks for helping me pick
out a new computer, you guys.

Oh, no problem, Quagmire.

God, this place is
always so crowded.

We gotta find someone
who works here.

Can I help you, sir?

Sorry, all I got is a quarter, pal.

Oh, excuse me, sir.

My buddy here is looking for a computer.

I would like to elect you president.

What are you doing? You gonna get
a new phone while we're here?

Maybe. But I gotta see which one

I wanna take in and out of
my pocket every 30 seconds

for the next six years.

What do you think, Peter? Peter?

I touched a iPhone headphone.

You know what?
I think I'm gonna go with this one.

Guy said it's the newest version.
Just came out this week.

Ah, good call, Quagmire.

You're gonna be like the first guy

in the neighborhood
to own a Model T.

(ENGINE CHUGGING)

See ya, suckers!

I'll be there an hour after you
with throw-up all over my legs!

Are you getting excited
for Halloween, Stewie?

You know, we'll have to start thinking

about your costume soon.

All right, but let's make sure
we don't cover up this, all right?

It's what puts candy in the bag.

Oh, look, Chris, here's your costume

from the year you went as a condom.

What the hell are you supposed to be?

(GASPS) Oh, Stewie, look!

It's your very first teddy bear!

Oscar?

Wow, I remember that bear.

That's the one Grandma
and Grandpa brought Stewie

when he was still in the hospital.

Oh, and here's the card they sent me.

"Three kids on $40,000?
Have fun with your crap life."

I guess he got tucked away up here.

You want him back, sweetie?

What, this old thing?

No, no, thank you. I've grown.
I've changed.

You sure you don't want him?

I said no, okay?

Don't you have a wedding dress

to try halfway on
and then cry about?

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire. What's up?

Hey, Peter, I need
some help with my computer.

I can't find my photos.

Did you look under "Photos"?

What is that?

It's a folder called "Photos."

Yeah, I-I don't have that.

I just have 40 folders
all called "New Folder."

Okay. You know what?
Click on your hard drive.

Okay, now-now the arrow
on the screen,

that's me, right?

Yeah, yeah, that's you.
Okay, now-now just...

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's a calculator on this thing?

(SIGHS) Listen, Quagmire,
what are you trying to do?

I just wanna put pictures of my cat
on everyone's Internet computer.

Like, how do I do that?

Okay, wait.
There's an agreement that just popped up.

Hang on. Let me read
the whole thing.

Just hit "Accept."

Well, that seems a little foolhardy,
doesn't it, Peter?

Look, do we have to do this now?
I'm watching something.

I know. I'm sorry.

I-I'm just nervous
that somebody else

is gonna get pictures
of their cat on the Internet first,

and then I'll always be known
as the second guy

to get pictures of his cat
on the Internet.

Quagmire, I don't know
how to tell you this,

but there's already
cats on the Internet.

Wait, it's-it's giving me
that pinwheel thing.

It's frozen. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, it crashed!

The whole thing just crashed!

Geez, Quagmire, calm down.
We'll figure it out.

No, Peter, the whole thing's fried!

I can't even...

(GASPS) Ah! damn it! What the hell?

Hey, you clicked "Accept."

Hey, what's going on?
You doing some reading there?

Yes, well, you know I turn to poetry

when matters of the heart
weigh heavily on me.

"If you're happy and you know it,

"then your face will surely show it.

"If you're happy and you know it,

"clap your hands.
"Anonymous."

Wait... matters of the heart?

What are you talking about?

Well, Lois found my old teddy
bear, Oscar, in the attic.

And I'm just not sure how to handle it,

what with Rupert and all.

Who cares?
Just play with them both.

I can't do that!
Oh, it would be so awkward!

Um... okay.

Oscar was my...

well, he was my first, you know.

And that's always exciting.

But-but I've been with Rupert for so
long now.

-Uh-huh.
-Most of our finances are intertwined.

We've built a life together.

On the other hand, Oscar...

Oscar's the only one who can
really make me laugh.

I hate to say it, but I'm mostly with
Rupert because of his insurance.

Stewie, I think you're overthinking this.

No, you're right. You're right, Brian.
I'm with Rupert now.

I just need to forget Oscar.

No matter how intense
our relationship was.

(STEREO PLAYING JAZZ)

That's amazing.

It's like you took
all the colors that exist

and said, "(BLEEP), here's a new one."

Hi, can I help you?

Well, that depends.

Do you know how to fix pieces of junk?

Haven't been stumped yet.

(COMPUTER PLAYS WOMAN MOANING)

Okay, I see what your problem is.

I-I-I tried to buy a sweater online,

and I-I think I got a virus.

No, the porn's not the problem.

Your browser history shows

that you've been going
to kinkylatinas.net.

But that site has a bunch of malware.

Oh.

Personally, I'd recommend College Latinas.

I mean, I wanna see Latinas,
but I also want them to

-Speak English. speak English.
-Yes, exactly.

Wow. So you're into that kind
of stuff, too?

(SULTRY) Uh-huh.

Would you, uh,
would you have dinner with me?

Absolutely.

Excuse me. I bought this
laptop here yesterday,

but when I got home I noticed
the apple already had

a bite taken out of it!

So, yeah, I was the first woman

to ride her bike cross-country
with no seat.

Gosh, that's neat, Sonja.

And-and where'd you go to college?

I think Syracuse, but I don't know.

My face was buried
in a pillow all four years.

Wow, sounds like you took
a full class load.

(LAUGHS)

Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad
you asked me out.

Whenever I talk about stuff like this,

most people look at me

like I'm some kind
of disgusting perv.

Me, too, but who cares?

You should never be afraid
to be different.

Hoo.

Hoo.

Whom.

Morning.

(YAWNS) Morning.

We kind of had a crazy night.

Yeah, we... Did we?

I don't really remember,

but I do feel like I might
be down a couple of quarts.

(EMPTY METAL DRUM BANGING)

Well, even though you seemed
like a sure thing,

I really wanted to make sure.

Oh, my God! You roofied me?

Are you mad?

No. I'm in love!

Sonja, honey, stay right here.

I just have to go to the bathroom.

Wait, Glenn.

Take this wine glass.
We can use it later.

(VOICE BREAKS) My God, I...

I've never been so happy!

I'm telling you guys,
Sonja is the perfect woman.

She's every bit as kinky
and as insatiable as I am.

Really? I thought you said she was
just some computer geek.

She is.

Her mouth has enough storage
space for a giggity-byte. Oh!

(TEXT ALERT BEEPS)

Geez, you changed your
relationship status already?

When you know, you know.

All right, but just be careful, ya know?

You don't wanna rush
an important decision.

I'll take the cheeseburger meal.

Would you like to make it
an extra large meal?

Uh...

(LASERS ZAPPING)

N-No. Yes.

No.

You sure? It's only 29 cents more.

Yes.

No.

What the hell?

Stewie, what are you doing up here?

(GASPS) Brian!

It's not what you think!

All right, I came up here
for a photo shoot

and it just got way, way out of hand!

You're having tea.

How is that out of hand?

Is your shirt on backwards?

Please! You can't tell Rupert
I was up here, all right?

He wouldn't understand.
He'll kill himself, Brian!

He's been through so much already!

He can't take much more!

Brian, he watched his brother drown!

Stewie, relax.

You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

Says the guy who freaks out

every time a fire engine goes by.

(SIREN WAILS)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

(HOWLS)

-Peter, Peter, you hear that?
-(HOWLS)

I'm matching the sound! (HOWLS)

Is what I'm doing helping?

Glenn, why did you bring me here?

Well, I've always had this fantasy

of having sex on the basketball court

in front of my high school principal.

Only problem is
he's now completely senile.

Yeah, you like this,
Principal Goodrich, huh?

Remember you once suspended me
for showing my wiener in school?

I did?

This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

I'm sorry, Sonja,
I don't think I can finish.

You never could finish, Quagmire!

Donahue, get in there!

Okay, Glenn, now that we've
covered ourselves in black ink,

let's do it until we've created

every character in the Chinese alphabet.

When all said and done,

Quagmire body tell story of sadness.

Oh, wow, I can't even imagine
what twisted deviant act

you've thought of this time.

I want you to have sex
with your father.

What?

Yep, and I'm gonna watch.

Hi, Glenn.

Are you crazy? No! No way!

Glenn, remember,
the thing we love most about each other

is that we push each other

way beyond our normal boundaries.

Did you enjoy your stay at the Marriott?

No, I did not.

STEWIE: Oh, well, excuse me for not
being six months old anymore!

Oh, and here come the tears!

The show is starting, everyone!
Come on down!

What's all that noise?

What the hell's going on up there?

We're in a fight is what's going on!

Brian, I need you to settle
an argument for us:

am I Hitler?

Because I don't think that I am,

(CHUCKLING) but maybe-maybe
I'm off base on this.

Stewie, take it easy.

No, you know what?

You may as well call your family now

because I'm not going to Sarasota.

I don't care if we can't get a refund,

we're through!

Here, Brian, you take him.

Maybe you can make him happy.

-What?
-You heard me. Take him.

Do whatever you want with him,
I don't care.

Rupert and I are over!

-Are you sure?
-Yes, we're done.

I just hope we can handle it better

than blue and yellow
did when they split up.

You were supposed to have
the kids here by 5:00.

We have plans.

It's 5:15.

Stop busting my hump, Alicia.

Okay, you know what, let's not...

let's not do this in front of the kids.

God, you're right.

What ever happened to us?

Hey, baby, you ready for dinner?

What's up, Scott?

We gonna get some barbecue.

Hey, guys.

No, indoors, not okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

Don't do it. Nighttime, not allowed.

What? There's nothing wrong with this.

No, no way, give me those.

Oh, my God.

Quagmire, what the hell happened?

Is this another one
of those sex-related injuries

you keep getting?

Yeah, it seems like lately

that girlfriend of yours is
taking things a little too far.

No, she's not, everything's great with us.

Are you guys still talking about Sonja?

All right, I should probably get going.

Sonja and I are supposed to go

to a "Brown Eyes Wide Shut" party.

Geez, I don't know what's
going on with him.

But I guess love does
funny things to people.

Look at Forrest Gump.

Hi, Forrest.

I know you just got back
from Vietnam and you love me,

but I'm gonna go run a train

with this group
of Black Panthers I just met.

Okay, Jenny.

Hi, Forrest.

I know you came all this way
to New York to visit me,

but I'm gonna go do blow

and have sex with a bunch of stockbrokers.

Okay, Jenny.

Hi, Forrest.

Now that I have the most contagious

and incurable disease
known to mankind,

I'll finally have pity sex with you.

Okay, Jenny.

And I'll mow the grass
and raise the AIDS baby.

SONJA: Hey, sexy.

Sonja, what are you doing here?

Well, I got tired of waiting
for you to get home,

so I thought I'd come to you.

Come on, Sonja. How about...

how about we take a night off, huh?

The sex has just been nonstop.

I mean, I understand
that "no" doesn't mean "no,"

but certainly some word
has got to mean "no."

This is one of your fantasies, right?

Public humiliation?

Mmm, it's sexy, isn't it?

(CRIES OUT)

(CRYING) Sonja, stop, please!

Come on, you love it.

Ow! Ow! Ow!

You're hurting me, and I really
need to clean out my trunk!

Oh, I'm gonna clean out your trunk.

Giggity.

That's my word. That's my word!

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

Okay, Joe, Joe, you're drunk, okay?

You're drunk, give me your keys.

And-and I'm drunk,
so I'll give you my keys.

Okay, now we're both good to drive home.

You been drinking tonight, sir?

Uh, no, Officer, I just had
a glass of dinner with my wine.

Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

and walk a straight line, please.

All right, you be safe, sir.

There's a lot of crazies
out there tonight.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, hey, Mr. and Mrs. Quagmire.

Hi, Peter.

I'm a little worried about Glenn.

I haven't heard from him in days.

Have you seen him?

I haven't seen anybody.

I've been grounded
for pinching a girl.

Hey, are you guys talking
about Quagmire?

He never showed this morning,

and today's the day
we usually go apple picking.

Get that one.

Get that one!

Hey, get that one.

Get that one over there.

No, not-not that one.

I already got it! I can't put it back!

Well, it's not going in the pie.

Well, if you're so smart,
why don't you come up here

and pick them yourself?

And now there's no pie at all.

I've already checked Glenn's house,

and there's no sign
he's even been there.

I'm afraid something terrible
has happened.

Now let's not jump to any conclusions.

I'm sure if we just check
his usual hangouts,

someone will have seen him.

Wait a second.

He hangs out at the Clam
with some fat loudmouth.

You find Loudy McFatass,
you find Quagmire.

Come on, let's go.

But, Dad, it's the night of my big show!

Oh, Chris, I was never gonna go to that.

We should get some food in you, mister.

You hardly ate any of that cereal

I smashed on your mouth yesterday.

(GASPS) Brian?

Oh, hey.

What the hell are you doing?

Oh, I've been kind of using
Rupert as a chew toy.

Chewing him with your crotch?

Hey, dogs like humping
stuffed animals.

What can I say?

Besides, you said
I could have Rupert.

I thought you liked Oscar better anyway.

Well, I just changed my mind.

And you know Rupert's a dude,
right, you gaylord?

Okay, you guys, where should
we start looking for Glenn?

Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out

under all the clutter in my garage.

So, why don't we just start sorting stuff

and throwing stuff away

but obviously checking with me first

-before you throw stuff away.
-No problem, Peter.

Quagmire, if you're in
there, hang tight, buddy.

We're coming.

Right, and if we can't find him in here,

he sometimes likes to hang out

in between the blades of grass in my lawn.

And also in the firewood
that needs to be split.

Might he be under the leaves
in your gutter?

Great question, and yes, he might.

So, while you guys
are taking care of that,

I'll be around back flicking pinecones

at a tree with this hockey stick.

<i>Aloha</i>. Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians.

Hey, how you doing?

Amazing.

Have you seen this man?

Glenn Quagmire?

Nah, the last time I saw him
was three months ago.

Sold him 70 red shirts.

Yeah, he does look
good in that shirt.

Uh, everyone looks good in my shirts.

How about you, Big Island?

Uh, I don't know.

Do you want to be an oldies' DJ

or a 1980's wrestling manager?

Yes, both.

This is beautiful.

Heart disease looks better

when it's wrapped in a
tropical, floral pattern.

Oh, my God, this is hopeless.

We've been searching for hours.

Glenn could be dead by now.

I know, and if you guys are really hungry,

I suppose I could eat.

Come on, we can't give up.

Someone's got to have seen Quagmire.

Or if not him, at least Sonja.

Excuse me, did you just say "Sonja"?

Yes! I did!

That was my dog's name.

Excuse me, did he just say "Sonja"?

Yeah, it was his dog's name.

Oh, I thought he might have been talking

about this super kinky woman
who's always down here,

trying to lure men to her sex slave shed.

No, I think he was talking
about his dog.

No, Peter, that's the
Sonja we're looking for.

Sonja must have taken Glenn there.

Where exactly is this sex slave shed?

I'm not sure,

but I've heard she has a unit
at Quahog Storage.

Apparently that chick's a complete psycho.

We got to get over there!

Come on, you guys, let's go!

Oh, man, I hope we don't catch
them doing something freaky.

I'm still weirded out
from when I walked in

on that masturbating Eskimo.

Dinner time, Tikaloo.

Oh, my God!

Doesn't anybody knock?

Hey, Stewie, look, I want
to apologize about earlier.

What the hell is this?

Brian, I think it's time
that Rupert made his choice.

What are you talking about?

Talking about love, Bri.

Talking about adult decisions.

Rupert's been with me,
and now he's been with you.

It's time for him to pick.

Stewie, this is stupid.
I'm not doing this.

Brian, either you cooperate or I
blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

Hey, my voice isn't that high.

It is.
It is though.

All right, Rupert.

Who will it be?

And before you answer,

think of all the good times we've had.

The time we met The Beatles
on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

That winter we lived on the sun.

And here's my favorite.

A blank one we can fill up

with a future together.

Yes!

Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm
so sorry for everything!

I missed you, too!

Whatever.

Hey, you done
with that weird octopus doll?

It's you and me forever, Rupert.

I just hope Oscar
didn't take it too hard.

This is it, number 92.

This is Sonja's storage unit.

Quagmire, are you in there?

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

Oh, he's eating.

We'll come back when you're done eating.

-Glenn!
-Hurry, she'll be back soon.

I can't believe the
guy with the ponytail

and the facial tattoo
at the front desk would let this happen.

SONJA: Well, what's this?

We got company?

Hold it right there.

Please.

Do you think I'm afraid of you?

Boy, if you were ever gonna stand,

this would be the time, Joe.

Everybody, just shut up!

You idiots should've
minded your own business.

This is our business.

You kidnapped our friend.

You're going to jail.

Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you!

Oh, I don't think you're gonna shoot me.

You don't got the boobs.

What?

I-I don't know.

Now, just hand me the gun, Sonja.

Oh, I swear to God,
you get one inch closer to me,

and I'm gonna shoot you.

(GUN CLICKING)

What the hell?

Like I said, you're going to jail.

Oh, my God, Joe,
that was so close.

How'd you know the gun would jam?

It didn't jam, Peter.

The gun was never loaded.

Sort of had a mental breakdown in April.

No more bullets for this guy.

Oh, Glenn, I was so worried about you.

-Are you all right?
-No, no,

I'm pretty (BLEEP) far from all right.

Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

Happy birthday, Joe.

You dick!

Thanks for your help, guys.

I might not be alive
if it weren't for you.

Hey, no problem, buddy.

Yeah, you would've done the
same for us, Quagmire.

You know, I guess
what I realized from all this

is that when it comes to relationships,

I need to be the kinky one.

Ah, we're just glad
to have you back, Quagmire.

Yep, and it's good to put
all those troubles behind us.

My dad told me he's pregnant.

<i>It worked!</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. It's weird.</i>

<i>You're, like, really good</i>

<i>Up, up, and get it done</i>

<i>We're having a party.</i>

Hey, Brian. Can you come
in here a sec?

Sure, Peter, what's up?

You're a well-read guy, right?

Well, I don't know. I guess
when I read my Henry David,

I tend to be pretty Thoreau.

-STEWIE: Shut up!
-Yeah, 'cause, you see,

I been reading this
novel about three guys,

happen to be pigs, uh,

that decide to build
their own houses.

So, now, one of 'em builds
his house out of straws.

Right? Now, how the hell do
you build a house out of straws?

And-and three pigs
living together?

Gay. You know?
And so's the wolf.

He's chasing pigs and
blowing everything in sight.

Peter, what are you doing?

I'm just getting ready for bed.
What's wrong?

You're-you're naked.
I'm-I'm right here.

Who cares? You're my dog.

Everybody gets naked
in front of their dog.

Besides, you're always naked,

except for when Lois dresses
you up in that rain gear.

Okay, everyone in the car!

We're going to Martha's Vineyard!

-Do I have to wear this on the ferry?
-Yes, you do.

What about Peter?

Why-why doesn't he
have to wear this crap?

Peter's in his crate.

I'm actually relieved.

The ferry would be overstimulating.

Mama!

What are you doing
out of your box?

Hey, Megan. Oh, hey, guys.

Wait, did you
just call me Megan?

That's your name, isn't it?

Actually, "Meg" is short
for something else.

Peter, would you give this
to the nurse?

Uh-huh.

about that new kid?

No, this other guy, Mike Pulaski.

He's a complete psycho.

I heard he knifed a kid
on the playground,

then beat up the knife.

I heard he can watch
<i>Friday</i><i>Night Lights</i> without crying.

I heard the volleyball team's

playing a tournament
in San Diego.

There's a lot of exciting stuff going on.

You're very judgmental lately.

I don't like this, Brandon.

Oh, hey, Brian. Don't worry,

there's no blade in the razor
'cause I'm learning.

Peter, what the hell?
What? What's the matter?

What do you mean what's the
matter? You're completely naked!

I told you I'm not
comfortable with that!

Brian, I can get nude
whenever I want, all right?

This is my home,
and a man's home is his castle.

PETER: Halt, wench!

State your business.

Peter, will you please
put down the drawbridge?

I got a car full of groceries.

Hmm. Anything else? (SIGHS)

I also went to the video store

Hey, you guys want
to sleep over this weekend?

I mean, it's like,

Stewie, do you even know
what a menstrual cycle is?

Uh, yeah, Brian.

(HONKING, SQUEAKING)

It's a good way to get around
town, that's what it is.

Oh, good, you're alone.

Hey, Lois.
Why are you wearing a robe?

Well, I heard about how Peter's
making you see him naked lately,

so I thought the only way to get
even is for you to see me naked.

Wh... Really?
Yeah.

It only seems fair.

You know what, that makes sense
to me. I mean...

All right, here we go.

Oh, my God, you guys,
what am I gonna do?

That psycho
is going to kill me.

Meg, you've got to find a way
out of this fight.

Yeah, Meg. You can do it.
You're a smart woman,

and women can do
anything nowadays.

I guess you're right.

It's not like it's the 1950s.

So I see you graduated
number one

-in your class from Princeton.
-That's right.

And I'm certified as an accountant and
also have a law degree.

That's all very impressive.

We'll keep you in mind.

Let's see, Pointy Boobs,
Medium-Pointy Boobs,

Not-So-Pointy Boobs.

That's a shame.

Hey, Mom, I need to transfer
to a different school.

Meg, we've been over this.
Just because a Facebook page

has over 2,000 likes doesn't
mean you have to kill yourself.

I-It's not that. Mom, please?

There's other schools.

Carlisle Academy leads the state
in teen pregnancies.

So... I might meet somebody.

Meg, Carlisle Academy's
a private school.

We can't afford it.

Don't you remember how much
money your father wasted

so he could make grand
staircase entrances?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

(SOUTHERN ACCENT)

(GRAND ORCHESTRAL THEME PLAYS)

I figured out how to get out
of this fight.

All I have to do is get expelled.

That sex tape I released
should be everywhere by now,

and then they'll have
to kick me out of the school.

Come on! Really?

(BEEP)

(GASPS) Ooh.

You know what?

Good for her.

Hey, guys, you four are pretty much

the toughest guys in school, right?

What would it take to get
you to beat up Mike Pulaski?

Mental Mike? Are you kidding?

Come on, guys, I'll do anything.

I-I'll give you a Swallow Friday.

You mean a Follow Friday?

Oh...

I've been doing Twitter all wrong.

Okay, okay. I-I'll just pay you.

Oh, yeah? Well,
you're looking at 1,000 bucks

for something like that.

$1,000? All right.

But it's gonna be hard
to get that kind of money.

(SNIFFLES) You guys, I've tried
everything, but it's hopeless!

I can already picture my funeral.

(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

Thanks. Didn't want
to pay for the hole.

This is such a nightmare!

At least I have you guys.

I don't know what
I would do without you.

Yeah, uh, about that.

Listen, Meg,
we decided that maybe it's best

if you don't talk to us anymore.

Yeah, we could be
targeted by association.

I don't want to get
beaten up by a guy

unless it's in a limo after prom.

So you're all gonna ditch me
when I need you most?

Yeah, Meg, it's natural selection.

This is how it works in the wild.

-Hey. Hey, how you doing?
-Hey there.

Hey. Nice spot, huh?
Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah, it's great.

Especially 'cause of
that thing over there.

You know what's in there? Corn.

Really? Wow.
I could go for some corn.

(CRACKLING)

(LAUGHS)

You're dark, Rog.

I don't care.

Good luck, Meg.

Now we must retreat
into the shadows.

(WIND WHISTLING,
BELL TINKLING)

(CRIES)
What am I gonna do?

QUAGMIRE: Sounds like you have
a pretty big problem, Meg.

Huh?

Mr. Quagmire?

What are you doing in here?

This is my base of operations.

WOMAN (OVER INTERCOM): <i>Mr. Quagmire,</i>
<i>the girls' gym class</i>

<i>will be in the showers in 20 minutes.</i>

Thank you, Shirley.

She's been with me 12 years.

It's her birthday today.

Didn't get her anything.
(GROANS)

So, I guess you heard
about the fight, huh?

Oh, yeah, they're talking about
it in all the girls' bathrooms.

-I'm so dead.
-No, you're not,

because I'm gonna help you
defeat Mike Pulaski.

-You are?
-That's right.

Be at my house first thing tomorrow
morning, and we'll get started.

Wow, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

Well, I better get home.

(HORNS TOOTING
AND WHISTLES BLOWING)

What a good way to get around town.

Okay, Meg, you've got a bully
problem, and I'm gonna help you.

But, Mr. Quagmire,
why would you want to help me?

Because I was once
in your shoes, Meg.

I wasn't always the confident
guy you see before you.

You see, I, too,
was terrorized by a bully.

It was 1986, and the cola wars
were at a frenzy.

<i>I was sitting in the RC section</i>
<i>of the cafeteria</i>

<i>when Tracy Bellings approached.</i>

Why aren't you drinking
Coke, you dork?

Pepsi would also
be acceptable!

It doesn't have to be a two-cola system!

RC is what keeps the big guys
on their toes!

You know what "RC"
stands for, don't you?

"Chicks Rule!"

QUAGMIRE:
<i>She was dyslexic.</i>

<i>Anyway, that was the beginning</i>

<i>of a long, abusive relationship.</i>

<i>It's one thing if you put</i>
<i>your penis inside-out</i>

<i>in the safety</i>
<i>of your own bedroom,</i>

<i>but to have it done</i>
<i>in the cafeteria...</i>

<i>To this day,</i>
<i>I can't have sex with a woman</i>

<i>against her will</i>
<i>without thinking about rape.</i>

And that's
why I'm gonna help you, Meg.

I never faced my bully.

I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

But how?

Over the years,
I've tested the limits of the human body.

How much it can stuff in,
swallow or choke on.

How a scrotum can be stretched

into a makeshift sail
if stranded at sea.

All this knowledge is gonna
help you win your fight.

Oh, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

I'll take any help I can get.

I haven't been this scared

since my dad stopped showering
for six months.

Great meatloaf, Mom.

Thanks, honey.

PETER: Hungry!

(FLIES BUZZING) Hungry!

Pour food on my pile!

Okay, Peter, here you go.

Mmm. I will assimilate
this new smell

into the larger Borg
of my smells.

Oh, by the way,
Rupert, good news.

I pooped out your bow tie.

(GASPS) Gaah!
Geez, what the hell, Brian?

I can't take it anymore!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

PETER:
Message for Brian Griffin!

(GROANING)

(GRUNTS)

I lost my ass gambling.
Have you seen it?

Leave me alone, you jerk!

Stewie, you got to help me.

Peter just won't let up
with the nudity.

Well, you know how
the fat man operates.

He won't stop
unless he's stopped.

The only way
you're going to end this is

if you find a way
to even the score.

You've got to be nude.

Stewie, I am nude.
I'm just covered with fur.

Well, shave it off.

Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

Maybe you're right.

I mean, I got to do something.

This is just one of those things
he won't let up with.

Like when he was guest hosting
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio.</i>

Jeff Daniels, what
is your favorite Care Bear?

I, uh, uh... I don't know
any of the Care Bears.

Right, but if you had to pick
one, who would be your favorite?

Well, like I said,
I'm not really familiar...

You can just say the color.
I know all the Care Bears.

I... I don't know. The blue one.

There's, like, 11 blue ones, Jeff.

Are you here to dick around,

or you want to do
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio?</i>

All right, Meg, the best way
for you to focus your rage is

if I wear the mask of the person

who's bullied you
every day of your life.

Now, when I give the word,

I want you to come at me
with everything you got.

Oh, hey, Meg. Hey, Peter.

You know, Peter,
I'm glad I ran into you.

We really need
to talk about Quagmire.

You got time for a beer?

I don't know.
He's just so needy.

And I feel like
he's jealous of our friendship.

You all right, Peter?

You seem a little quiet today.

-I'm fine!
-Oh, okay, good.

Hey, Peter. Hey, Joe.

I'm glad you guys are here.

I've got terrible,
gross medical news for Quagmire.

Maybe you can help me
break it to him.

Mr. Quagmire, how am I supposed

to beat a guy like Mike Pulaski?

He's massive!

He may be stronger
than you, but you're grosser.

And you're gonna use that.

Your weird body can be
a dangerous weapon

-if used properly.
-Okay.

Now, did you ever
play old-school Nintendo?

No.

Well, then what we're about
to do may seem strange,

but just go with it.

(UPBEAT SYNTHESIZER

(ELECTRONIC VOICE)

Now, Meg, in order
to get you into fighting shape,

I want you to drink
this glass of raw eggs.

I don't see any yolks.

Just drink it.

-Gotcha!

Wha... what the hell?

BRIAN: Hey!

You looking for me?

Oh, God, what the hell is that?

What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable.

Here, let me give you a hug.

Aah! Get away from me,

Aah! No!

Why don't you rub

It's like I'm just

Ugh! Why do you have
so many nipples?

-You gonna put your clothes on?
-Yes! Yes! I swear!

You gonna keep 'em on?
Yes, I promise!

I'll never bother you
again with my body!

(CRYING)
Please, just make this stop!

Good.

Oh, what's the matter, Mike?

Can't punch a girl in the face?

You'd be surprised
what my face can do to you!

Ugh! What's your problem, dude?

You've got major issues!

Oh, my God, she's crazy!

Huh, not bad for a loser.

Thanks for your help,

I guess I get
to die another day.

Meg, I got a feeling

you're gonna be around
for a real long time.

Come on, let's
get out of here.

MEG: <i>But I</i> wasn't <i>around</i>

Thanks for your help, Stewie.

If I knew you were

I wouldn't have

You look like my foot that time
Lois made my bath too hot.

Come on! It's not that bad.

My fur will grow back
in about three months.

Well, I can't look at
this for three months,

so I've come up
with a solution.

Put these on.

-Stewie, I...
-Hold still.

Oh, there's the concrete park again.

Peter, I'm talking about real travel.

We can finally afford
to go somewhere good.

Joe and Bonnie went to Europe
and had the time of their lives.

Hey, I know a place
you can go, Lois: Hell.

There, I said it. Now shut your mouth.

Lois, I hate travelling.

Besides, my passport picture is awful.

Ugh, you look like a human cigarette.

But it's not just about you, Peter.
Think about the family.

It would be an amazing experience
for the kids.

It would give them some culture.

Lois, the kids can get all the culture
they need right here in Quahog.

Really? More culture than Europe?

That's right,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

I got more culture in my pinkie toe
than all of Europe put together.

(SINGING OPERA)

(WILD APPLAUSE)

Oh, my God!

I got ringworm, too,
but it's not classy like this.

Okay, kids, now this is
the Quahog Museum of Science.

A magical place of cultural exploration.

That sucked.

Now, one thing that makes us more cultured

than our European counterparts
is high school football.

Then why are we standing here
in the parking lot?

Because sometimes your team loses,
and you have to beat up the ref.

What part of Eatonville you from, huh?
What part of Eatonville you from?

Ow! West Eatonville.

Oh, really? West Eatonville?
Do you know Bob Hanley?

-I'm Bob Hanley.
-No kidding!

Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin.

Oh, my God, how the hell are you?

I'm doing great. I'm doing great.
Well, hey, oh, listen.

I was really sorry to hear about your dad.

Oh, that means a lot.

Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the wake. I was out of town.

It's okay. Thanks for the flowers.

Oh, it's the least I could do.

Hey, Chris, get over here.
You got to meet my buddy Bob Hanley.

Hi, Mr. Hanley. I'm Chris.

I heard a lot about you, sir.

ANNOUNCER:<i> We now return</i>
<i>to </i>Downton Syndrome.

Well, if I must accept
your proposal in order

to break the entail
and save my family's estate,

then yes, I will marry you.

Yay!

Everyone, I've got a surprise.

Whoa! I did not see that coming.

No, Chris, I haven't said it yet.

Today was the last day
of the low airfares,

and I couldn't let
the opportunity pass, so...

I got us tickets to Italy!

That's amazing, Mom!

Lois, is Peter okay with this?

Well, Brian, I haven't quite told him yet.

But what if he says no?

He can't say no.
I already bought the tickets.

Tickets for what?

Uh, uh, tickets for the,
um, the grand opening

of the biggest water park
in all of Rhode Island.

Hmm, well, pardon my skepticism, Lois,

but I didn't read
about this in the latest issue

of <i>Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.</i>

Well, they, they had
to, um, keep it secret.

For fear that, um,
that this new park would put

all other water parks out of business.

Typical Big Water.
Always keeping the public in the dark.

So this one's bigger than Raging Waters?

Yeah, Dad. It's way bigger.

How does the boy know?

Uh, because I, I told him.

I know someone who,
who helped, uh, build it.

Wow, so we really got
an inside track on this thing.

But it can't be bigger
than Six Flags Atlantis.

Oh, it is, Peter, it is.

Because it's Seven Flags Atlantis.

(GASPS) That's a whole flag more of water!

Get in the car!

Okay, everyone, put the sunblock on now,

so when we get off the plane,
we go right to the park.

Wait, why are we on a plane?

Uh, you want to beat the lines,
don't you, Peter?

All right, Brian, enough.
I, I can't do this anymore.

Peter, we're not going to a water park.

We're going to Italy.

What! But what about Seven Flags Atlantis?

Peter, don't be silly.
There's no such place.

(OVER P.A.) <i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

<i>If you look out the left side</i>

Why are you such a dick, Jim?

I'm just mad about pilot stuff.

I can't believe you tricked me
into going to Italy.

Peter, our family could use
a trip like this.

Plus, it might be good
for you and me, too.

It's the most romantic country
in the whole world.

And God knows we could use
a little romance in our marriage.

What are you talking about? Just
the other night we did that role-playing.

Did you like that game
of mysterious intruder, Lois?

I told you, I don't know who you are.
And my name isn't Lois.

Mine is. Let's do it again.

Is it true there's no drinking age here?
And they serve wine at every meal?

Oh, Meg, nobody likes a drunky-chunky.

In college, a lot of guys
are gonna make you a dare.

Hey, you know what, guys?
We're six hours ahead here.

I'm gonna call Joe
and tell him the future.

(BUTTONS BEEPING)

Hey, Joe, guess what's about to happen?

-JOE:<i> Who is this?</i>
-It's Peter.

<i>That's impossible.</i>
<i>Peter died six hours ago.</i>

(GASPS) We can't go back.

Look, kids, this is the Forum,

where the ancient Romans used
to have their famous political debates.

And this is the <i>Penthouse Forum,</i>
where dirtbags write letters

about boning
in the back of grocery stores.

Well, who wants to see
where the ancients established

the foundation of our American democracy?

And who wants to hear a story about a girl

who moved to New York
without any underpants?

I don't know why we even go places.

We always just end up reading pornography.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to </i>Italian Star Trek.

<i>I know I supposed to be-a so logical,</i>

<i>but I get-a so steaming a-mad!</i>

Peter, the kids are going
to the Italian circus,

so I thought it might be romantic

if we watched the sunset
from St. Peter's Basilica.

You go ahead, I'm gonna stay
here and get frustrated

with this nonresponsive hotel TV remote.

Come on! Guide!

I'm pressing "Guide"!

Stupid remote's not doing anything!

Stop what you're doing!

Peter, you can't just sit in front
of the TV the entire vacation.

I'm really getting tired of you being
such a complete stick-in-the-mud.

Is that some kind of gay slur?

I can't believe it's too much for you
to watch a sunset with your wife

in one of the most romantic
cities in the world!

But, you know what?
It's probably for the best.

Because you'd just complain about it!

Well, what do you expect, Lois?
I didn't want to come here

in the first place.
I'd rather be back home.

You know, I could be
riding seesaw with Joe.

Yay!

-Well, I guess we're stuck.
-Hang on. Let me empty this bag.

Yay, gross.

Fine, you just sit here on the couch.
I'll go enjoy Italy without you!

God, what the hell's her problem?

You know, sometimes I think you forget
how lucky you are to have Lois.

Otherwise, you wouldn't be
acting like such a jerk.

Oh, I'm getting it from you now?
Don't worry about Lois.

She's an American woman in Italy.

She'll go out, kill her roommate

during a sex game,
and then she'll be fine.

She might come back even hotter.

Well, you might want to look out there.

What the hell's she doing
with that Italian guy?

Hey, Lois, what the hell's going on here?

Ah, we're just having fun, Peter.
Something you know nothing about.

Oh, man, she really is upset.

MAN: Having lady problems, are you, pal?

Dean Martin? What are you doing here?

I thought you were dead.

Well, <i>paisan, </i>as long as love is alive

Now, look, buddy,
there's a million ways to lose a gal,

but there's only one sure way
to get her back.

Turn on the old Italian charm.

But I'm not Italian.

Well, you're in Italy, ain't you?

I think so,
I haven't been paying attention.

BRIAN: Hey! Get away from him!

Peter, you okay?

(GRUNTS) Brian? What happened?

I was watching you from the window.

When Lois pulled away on that motorcycle,

you laid down on the ground
and went to sleep.

Well, I'm awake now, Brian.
And I know what I've got to do.

Well, before you do anything,
for God's sake, put some clothes on.

Brian, calm down.
In some countries, this is a compliment.

Mmm. Mmm!

Oh, my goodness! Mmm-mm!

Oh, please, come on.
Is just something I threw together.

-(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
-What the hell?

<i>Mi amore! </i>I am here to put you
on a pedestal with Italian romance.

Look, Peter, showing up here
in that stupid costume

isn't going to win me over.

That's because you lack
the passion of a true Italian.

<i>-Mi amore!</i>
-Peter, stop it.

Speak with your heart, not your mouth.

Ugh, damn it, Peter!

You mean "Pietro."

Well, by the laws of Italy,
I must now kiss myself passionately.

Peter, are you all right?

Are you kidding? I'm great!

(SINGING) <i>Bouncing around Italia</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

Peter, put me down!

Lois, to prove my love,
I have convinced 20,000 soccer fans

to hold up a romantic message
just for you.

-Peter!
-Oh, they missed a letter.

Okay, I'll admit it,
this is pretty romantic.

Listen, Lois. I'm sorry
for being such a jerk, all right?

I love you.

(PETER MOANS)

I want to have your baby.

Peter, not on a boat.

Peter...

Oh, Peter...

Come on, Lois,
I got a ninety-percenter going.

It could go either way.
Let's start making choices.

Oh, Peter...

(MOANS) I love you.

I love you, too.

Wow, Peter, last night
was the best sex I've ever had.

Me, too. We haven't done it like that
since we were engaged

but allowed to sleep with other people.

What, what are you talking about?

The point is, Italy is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

I know, it's been wonderful.

I wish we never had to leave.

Well, then, let's not. Let's live here.

What? Peter, but...

But we've built a life back in Quahog.

Yeah, but you were right, Lois,
we were stagnating back home.

Let's start a new life,
right here in Italy.

Peter, those were our passports!

We don't need them anymore.

Kids, I got an announcement.

He's wearing a rubber.

We're staying in Italy. We're Italian now.

-What!
-Are you kidding?

Well, if we're going to be Italian,

I guess we should start
murdering our brothers.

What are you... (GAGGING)

You break-a my heart, Chris.

You break-a my heart.

Why you make-a me do that, Ruperto?
I no wanna do that!

Peter, I know you love it here,

but riding your bike around town
isn't paying the bills,

and the kids aren't learning anything
at that Italian school.

Look at these big ones, huh?

Rut-ta-ta-ta ta.

Rut-ta-ta-ta ta, rut-ta-ta-ta ta!

Is this calculus?

I don't know.

Rut-ta-ta-ta ta!

I think maybe it's time
to go back to our real home in Quahog.

But I thought you loved Italy.
And Italian Peter.

And Southern Italian Peter.

Olive oil!

I do, but I love American Peter even more.

Lois is right.
We're barely surviving here.

I mean, you have to give
most of what you earn

to the mafia that terrorizes this village.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Peter, I think it's time
we all go back home.

(SIGHS) Of course we have to leave
as soon as I get an Italian boyfriend.

You know, I still don't understand
what he does for a living.

He gathers coins from the air

Mario said-a you were

So, you see, Mr. Consulate,

all we want to do is get back
to our home in America.

So, can we have our new passports now?

Mr. Griffin, it's not as simple as that.

Your family must take a citizenship test

and go through the immigration process
like any other foreigner.

Foreigner? We're not foreigners.

Sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

Not only did you destroy your passports,
you renounced your citizenship.

When did we do that?

Oh, I did that
on the Italian social networking site,

"Shut-Up-a-You-Facebook."

All right, Meg,
part of being an American citizen

is having an opinion
on certain hot-button political issues.

Now, what is your abortion stance?

It's pretty much this.

Now, if you will, please sing
the national anthem of the United States.

Okay, I've reviewed your application.

Now, where you listed employment,
some of you wrote<i> Family Guy,</i>

and others wrote The Family Guy.

Which one is it?

(SIGHS) It's <i>Family Guy.</i>

All right, now that you've completed
your initial application,

it will need to be filed
by an immigration lawyer

at a cost of approximately
$5,000 per person.

And assuming that all goes through,

you should have
your citizenship back in 16 months.

Sixteen months?
If I didn't know any better,

I'd think you were making it hard
to become a citizen on purpose.

Like you don't want
any immigrants coming to the U.S.

I wish that were true, Mrs. Griffin,
and it probably might be.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on my fat wife.

Oh, this is terrible.

You went back to 17th-century Jamestown
and you gave guns to the Indians.

And now they're running everything!

I said I messed up, all right!

I guess I just have
this pathological need to be liked.

Well, it's not a good trait.

Aw, come on. Don't say that.
Let me buy you lunch.

Thanks to you, the Indians killed all
the white people and took over America.

I mean, you're the one who's

Oh, come on, Brian, let's be honest.
I frequently alter the past.

All right, so, I guess
we'll split the bill 13 ways?

Hey, Judas, he ordered,

All you had was a salad.

-Hmm.
-What? What is that?

What is that, "Hmm"?
What are you looking for?

What are you looking for, specifically?

Yeah, that's right.

But I'm afraid our only hope
is that perhaps the alternate Stewie

in this universe has created
his own time machine that we can use.

Well, let's hope so,
because otherwise, they're gonna kill us.

Yeah, or stick us

Don't give them any money.

They're just gonna spend it all

Oh, it was so annoying.

Everyone was coming around with

Hey, shot in the dark,
but, uh, is anyone else in the mood

to run really fast in one direction?

Look, there it is!

"Zero results found."

a hundred times, Brian.

So I've decided to get rid of it
before something irreparable happens.

But, Stewie, your time machine,
it's, like, your crowning achievement.

I can't believe you'd just destroy it.

Trust me, Brian, it's for the best.

And, hey, at least
I've had some fun with it.

Do you know what I did last week?

I time-traveled ahead to Christmas
so I wouldn't have to wait all year

for the new toys to come out.

Wow, good timing, little fella.
This just came out today.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah,

Oh, sure. And would you like
to come home and clean my toilet,

a failure as a human being?

No, I mean it. Like, here,
look at this street hockey net.

It's in great shape.

You know, we should take this
home and set it up.

Get some fresh air, get some exercise.

Well, I suppose I could use a new hobby
now that the time machine is gone.

You sure you're not gonna miss that thing?

Nah, I was getting bored of it anyway.

You know, not every historical event
is all it's cracked up to be.

Women, we've spent decades fighting
for our right to vote.

So, when you go
to those booths and cast your ballot,

remember, Warren G. Harding
is way the cutest!

(ALL SQUEALING, GIGGLING)

<i>Oh, girls just wanna have fun...</i>

Okay, Brian,
I'm just putting this out there,

but I'm a baby,
and only dicks don't let babies win.

God, look at this day, huh?

You know, usually,
I'd be sitting inside writing,

you'd be working on one of your machines.

But here we are enjoying it.

Yes, it is a nice change of pace.
Oh, wait, I got to go grab my knee pads.

I was using them for...
for this other thing.

Anyway, I'll be right back.

(TIRES SQUEAL)

Brian, look out!

Ah, Brian!

Oh, my God!

Brian! Brian, can you hear me?

Holy crap! What the hell happened?

That guy sucked.

Mom, is Brian gonna be okay?

I don't know, Meg. But this is
the best veterinarian in Quahog.

Brian's getting the finest care there is.

He had to share the ambulance
with a chicken.

Um, aren't you supposed
to be running around?

Don't talk to me.

You have a bad reputation
in the chicken community.

Doctor, how is Brian? Is he gonna be okay?

I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but Brian's injuries

are just too severe for us to save him.

I don't know how much longer he has,

but I suggest that you all go in
and say your goodbyes.

Oh, my God! Brian, no!

I can't believe it.
You... You're really...

Damn it, Brian, you can't die!

We were gonna do so many things together.
We were gonna become windsurfers.

I was gonna be a little better than you,
but we were both gonna be good!

(GROANS SOFTLY)

You guys, I think,
I think Brian's trying to say something!

You... You've given me a wonderful life.

I love you all.

(MONITOR FLATLINES)

I'm sorry, he's gone.

Oh, my God, he's...

(VOICE BREAKING) Yes, Chris, I'm afraid...

I'm afraid that our Brian is dead!

Guys, I'm gonna need
a few minutes alone upstairs.

I got to do, like, a sad yank.

Stupid street hockey.
I wish we never went to that dump.

Oh, this is all my fault.

I'm the one who had to throw away
the damn time machine.

Wait a minute. That's it!

I've just got to rebuild the time machine,

and then I can go back and save Brian!

(TIRES SCREECH)

Oh, happy birthday, Neil!

Stewie! How are you?

Oh, not well, Yusuf. I need your help.

I have to track down a titanium capacitor,

for a high-wattage mainframe
I'm going to construct.

Titanium capacitors? Sorry,
there's no way to get those anymore.

What do you mean?
You've gotten them for me before.

I know, but the one guy who made
those drew a doodle of Muhammad,

so he's not around anymore.

He wasn't even doing it on purpose,

just absentmindedly
while talking on the phone.

But it was Muhammad, so you know.

Oh, that's awful.

Okay, Yusuf, thanks, anyway.

Oh, dear, Rupert,
without those capacitors,

it'll be completely impossible
to build a functioning time machine.

(SIGHS) I guess that means
Brian is really gone for good.

(SOBBING)

Thank you so much for coming, guys.

Brian would be very thankful
that you're here.

No problem, Lois. You know,
I usually don't come to funerals.

Since I'm a cop, I always wind up
getting hit by a black woman with a purse.

You find the man who did this.

-Ma'am, what's your relationship to Brian?
-You bring him to justice!

Make sure this angel child
didn't die for nothing!

Are you sure you're at the right funeral?

-Ma'am, Brian's a dog.
-You show the world why you became a cop!

Okay.

Thank you, everyone, for coming today.

None of you people came to my funeral!

I know Peter wanted to say a few words.

(SIGHS)

Oh, boy, this is, um...

This is probably the worst pain
I've ever had to go through,

and I've sprained my ankle twice.

Um, the truth is,
Brian wasn't just my dog.

He was my best friend in the whole world.

He was smart, he was loyal,

and I guess what I'm trying to say is,
he was like a brother to me.

(VOICE BREAKING) And I, I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life missing him.

(SNIFFLING)

We're all gonna miss him, Peter.

We're all gonna miss him very much.

(CRYING)

Damn it, Ortiz. Stop swinging at junk.

Oh, my God, I almost served Brian again.

I can't believe he's been gone
a whole month.

Can we at least get rid of the doggie door
so Chris doesn't keep getting stuck in it?

Every day I get a little further in.

You know, I hate to say it,
but I'm starting to think the only way

to stop missing Brian is to get a new dog.

Or do we all get Ghostbuster jumpsuits
with our names on them?

<i>Who you gonna call?</i>

<i>The Griffins</i>

I'm serious, Peter. I know it might
take time to find the right dog,

but I really feel like it might be
the best way for us to move on.

-Yeah, Dad.
-That would be nice.

All right, well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to look.

Really? Another dog?

Look, I miss Brian more than any of you,

but at least now no one's forcing us
to watch those awful PBS documentaries.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now PBS presents:</i>
Albino Children Are Normal.

So, with the exception
of not being able to go out in the sun,

you're completely normal?

Yes. The moon is my sun.

I like to kill beetles.
Beetles are teachers.

I sleep with a fork.

(CATS MEOWING, DOGS BARKING)

All right, guys,
time to find a new family dog.

Hey, Chris, you're kind of a creep.
You should get a ferret.

You're right, I am. And I will!

(DOGS BARKING)

I don't know how to choose
between all these dogs.

(NEW JERSEY ACCENT) Hey, you, green pants.

I hear you're looking for a dog
or something.

Oh, finally, someone who sounds
like they went to college.

-Hi, I'm Peter.
-Vinny.

Oh, Vinny, like the Pooh.
Hey, that's kind of cool.

-So, what's your story?
-Well, you know, I'm just a regular guy.

You throw a stick, maybe I bring it back.

Maybe I bring back
an iPhone that fell off a truck.

So, what do you say?
You want me as your dog?

Yeah, I think I do!

Hey, just out of curiosity,
what breed are you?

Actually, I'm a pussy hound.

Really? All right!

That just means I'm one-sixteenth cat.

Oh, I wish you hadn't told me that.

Well, Vinny, welcome to our home.

All right, this is good. This is good.

Hey, you guys got a good
banging-broads couch, you know that?

Vinny, you must be starving.
What can I make you for dinner?

Are you kidding?
You're a hardworking lady.

So, tonight, I'm gonna make you dinner.

Wow. (CHUCKLES) Well, thank you, Vinny.

Whoa, whoa, hang on, Lois.

You promised me we were all eating
my Play-Doh pasta tonight.

Oh, Stewie, did you make something?

Mmm, oh, it's so yummy.

Mmm! Num, num, num, num, num.

You better mean those "nums."

-Hey, you, what's your name?
-Chris.

How about I call you Hat Boy?

Hell yeah!

Lower your voice, Chris.

It's Hat Boy, bitch!

Wow, look at you, Vinny. It's like
you're already part of the family.

I don't know, fat man,
I think you're jumping the gun.

I mean, crucifixion seemed great
at first, too.

Why are you doing that?

'Cause I'm mad at this guy.

I'm mad at this jar
of pickles I can't open.

Nail it up.

Hey, guys, I want you
to meet our new dog, Vinny.

Vinny, this is Joe and Quagmire.

-Hey, Vinny.
-How you doing?

Real good. Hey, so I hear you're a cop.

-That's right.
-Hey, that's great.

Maybe sometime you could take me

on a ride-along with you,
show me the neighborhood.

Yeah, I don't take people out
on ride-alongs anymore.

I had a bad experience with Grimace.

I got to be honest,
I can't get a bead on you, man.

Oh, boy, Vinny, hanging out
with you has been the best.

-You want another beer?
-No.

-I'd love one!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

What? What?
The first thing you said was...

(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) Oh, my God!

You're on... You're, like,
on another level, Vinny!

Congratulations.
You've won over a complete imbecile.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Did you just speak ill of the man
who busts his tail providing for you?

He spent my college fund
on puppet clothes.

Hey, don't get fresh with me, Estudio.

That's not my name. That's not even
an Italian version of my name.

Oh, whatever.

PETER: Hey, Vinny,
you want to see a puppet show?

They all got leather jackets!

God, what a jerk.

If this guy thinks he's sticking around,
he's sorely mistaken.

I'm going to ruin him.
Just like I ruined that magician's act.

(APPLAUSE)

People, people, people.

This man drives a Saturn.

All right, Rupert,
I've been left with no choice.

I'm going to tell Vinny so much bad news

about Italian-Americans
that he goes into cardiac arrest.

Vinny, there you are.
I have some terrible news.

Sal Annuncio's kid
was killed by a falling piano!

Oh! How could this happen?

That kid was an honors student!
He'd just applied to SUNY Albany.

He just got into SUNY Albany.

Oh! This is too much,
Stewie. I can't take it.

Oh, my God, it's working.

Hey, Vinny, Bobby Lammaduro's kid
just got out of the hospital.

He beat the cancer!

Oh, thank heavens!

Big man in the sky knows what he's doing.

Chris, what are you doing?

Call me a creep, you piece of crap!

Hey, <i>Doonesbury, </i>how about a joke
that ain't for fancy millionaires?

(STEWIE SNIFFLING)

(SOBBING)

(SOBBING CONTINUES)

Stewie, what's with the waterworks?

Oh, um, um... I, I just...

I realized I paid too much for my muffler.

Come on, kid, quit crying.
You're gonna get your pants wrinkled.

What's the matter?

(SIGHS) Fine.

Do you want to know
what's the matter? You're the matter.

Everyone in this family
is so damn thrilled with you,

they've forgotten all about Brian.

Well, I'm not thrilled.
I'll never forget Brian.

He was my best friend.

You're not supposed to lose
your best friend at my age.

You're not supposed to lose him ever!

Look, Stewie,
I know it doesn't seem like it now,

but you're gonna be okay.

Yeah, right. How do you know?

Because, I once had a thing
happen to me with some stuff.

Really? That's what's
happening to me. Stuff.

You know, before you guys
found me at the shop,

I lived with an old man named Leo.

It was just him and me
in a tiny apartment,

and we got pretty tight.

He kind of became my whole world.

By the time he passed away,
it was real tough.

So, how did he die?

He tried to go to a yoga class,

and on the first pose,
his ball sack split in half.

-Really?
-Yeah, it was on <i>Dateline.</i>

It was a whole thing.

Anyway, I guess
Leo was kind of like my Brian.

Well, so, how'd you get over him?

Well, I met your family in the pet store.

When I saw you guys looking for a dog,

I kind of sensed
you were all going through

the same feelings of loss that I was.

And it made me think,
hey, maybe I was meant to find these guys.

Maybe we were meant to be together.

You know what, Vinny?
I'm starting to think that may be true.

(CHUCKLES) Bring it in, Stewie.

Hey, Stewie, now that we're pals,
maybe you can answer me something.

Why does your living room
smell so much like puke?

Somebody throw up a lot in there once?

Vinny, my friend, you got a lot
of stories to catch up on.

I got most of them on DVD.

Oh, cool. Like, by season and stuff?

(CHUCKLES) No, not by season.

Boy, I can't remember the last time
Stewie fell asleep this early.

Well, I think the little guy
had a long day.

All right, come on, time for bed, Vinny.

I'll tell Peter to turn off
the night-light this time.

PETER: No! I need it
for in case there's witches!

You know, actually, Lois,

I think I'm gonna sleep
in here with Stewie tonight.

Oh, well, isn't that nice.

Sleep tight, you two.

(YAWNS) Good night, Vinny.

Good night, Stewie.

Hey, you guys know which room is Peter's?

Across the hall.

Ah, it's too bright in there. Never mind.

-Or we could try singing.
-Yeah, singing, that's good!

Wow, finally, something in my life
that makes me feel special.

I mean, except for when

Oh, we'll get some more down at Mort's.
But, Quagmire, we are on fire here.

We're gonna be the best thing

but I don't feel like eating

two whole loaves of bread.

Well, it was based on actual events.

Although, I don't have
as cavalier an attitude

toward my debt as the song suggests.

I'm actually up most nights

I've taken to throwing up in the yard
so my wife won't hear me.

Well, you guys have got something special
with those harmonies.

They could give me
five years' salary, tax free,

and it wouldn't put a dent in my problem.

-Oh, yeah.

And I should know. Back in the 1970s,

but what you need is a manager.

Someone with no talent who can take
a lion's share of your earnings.

You'd do that for us?

Sure I would. So, what do you say?
Can I be your manager?

-You betcha!
-All right! Put her there!

No, I've seen your prescriptions.
Let's just say we're doing it.

Well, Mort, I hope I can trust you.
I've been lied to before.

Well, I'm off to work.
Bye, guys! Love you!

-Love you, too!
-Bye! Love you!

I could have gone hiking with the girls.

We don't hike.
We just wear tight pants and get coffee.

Well, I guess no one cares
about our music.

I thought we were pretty good.

Yeah, I've seen worse performances.

I was walking home around
8:15 p.m. to my car.

It was very dark, and then
I, I heard the footsteps...

Boo! Get to the sex!

-Guys, I got great news!
-Oh, what is it, Mort?

I put your performance on JewTube.

The promoters of the New England
Music Festival saw it,

and they want to book you!

What? Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God, you hear that, Quagmire?

We're on our way! We got to celebrate
like girls in their 20s!

(CAMERA CLICKING, ALL GIGGLING)

PETER: Oh, my God, we are so random!

You got booked
at the New England Music Festival?

Oh, my God, Peter, that's amazing!

I had no idea you and Quagmire
could even sing!

Now let this be a lesson to you kids.

If you randomly stumble
upon an amazing talent,

and then someone important
sees it by wild coincidence,

great things can happen
without any hard work.

I'm gonna go jump off
the roof and see if I can fly!

That's it, Chris, pursue your dream!

A singer, huh? You as good as the guys

who sing "Happy Birthday"
at Macaroni Grill?

Oh, don't compare me...
Look, they've been doing it for years.

Imagine, my Peter, the big singing star!

Don't forget about us squares
back at home.

Don't you worry, Lois.

No one has stronger marriages and more
well-adjusted kids than rock stars.

It's working!

What you doing with that doll?

Oh, hello, Vinny. Rupert and I are just
having a spritzer and some cheese

in advance of the performance.

-I wouldn't do that.
-Why not?

You know, there was a guy
on my old block, Johnny Chickstuff.

We called him that
because he used to like to, uh...

-Do chick stuff?
-Do chick stuff! Exactly.

Anyway, a bunch of us got together

and beat him with a grill lid
and windshield wipers,

and let's just say, uh,
he don't do chick stuff no more.

'Cause of the beatin's?

Yeah. He wasn't exactly like us,
so we had to almost kill him.

That sounds terrible.
What happened to him?

I don't know. Soon thereafter,

a girl in the neighborhood
married a black guy,

so we all kind of turned
our attention to that.

(GUITARS TUNING)

Look at us, Quagmire.
We're making music, living the dream.

And to think, just last week,

my only creative outlet was
picking hockey fights at work.

Griffin, I need these shipping reports
filled out by 5:00 today.

(WOMAN GROANING)

Hey, Peter, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
What's your name, honey?

It's me, Lois.

All right, backstage whore,
here's the key to my hotel room.

-You can flush the dump I left in there.
-What!

-Hey, you guys were great.
-Aw, thanks.

My name's Ricky. I'm with Sony Records.

Our company's gonna be around
for at least three more weeks,

and we want to sign you.

I'll need to discuss this
with my associate.

I don't know, it seems
wrong to just dump Mort.

He's our friend. Doesn't that matter?

Quagmire, you remember
I told you about that dream I drew?

-Yeah?
-We're halfway there.

I think if we do this,
we'll get the giraffe.

Okay, okay, I'm in.

You got a deal.

Great! I'm gonna get you on tour.
This is the beginning of something big.

Great news, guys!

I may have gotten you booked
at a horse's birthday party.

-Mort, you're fired.
-What?

Sorry, Mort,
but this is a cutthroat business.

And we need someone tough in our corner.

Like Indonesian kickboxer Agoos Bahnwati.

Come on. Come on.

Come on, come on.

Disappear, disappear.

Come on. Come on.

Peter, I heard you fired Mort.
He's your friend.

He's the one that got you
to where you are today.

Lois, my transcendent talent
got me to where I am.

Peter, I don't like what
success is doing to you.

Yeah, well, I don't like
what time is doing to you.

Droop, droop.. (IMITATES EXPLOSION)

Hey, Chris, you ready with my luggage?

Luggage? For what?

We're going on tour, Lois.

Here you go, Dad.

I emptied this out
so it'd be easier to carry.

Oh, you're right, it is easier.
Good thinking, son.

All right, see you guys in two months.

Peter, you can't go away
for two months now.

You'll miss Thanksgiving.

I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to choose
between music and family.

If I choose family,
does it have to be this family?

Yes, Peter, this family.
So make your choice.

Very well. This scavenger hunt
will provide you with my answer.

Here it is, a penny from 1858!

We're getting closer to our answer.

Wake up, Mom! He chose the music!

(SIGHS) You know, Quagmire,
I feel kind of bad

leaving the family like this
with Thanksgiving coming up.

I mean, if I'm not there,
who's gonna carve the turkey?

I don't understand!

Come on, guys,

Peter, quit screwing around!
We're about to go on national television.

Now, please welcome
our very special musical guests,

Griffin and Quagmire.

Wait, Quagmire,
you got something on your face.

Aah! Damn it, Peter, that was my eyebrow!

What was that about?

This is my time.

Don't ever (BLEEP) talk to me

Meg, keep painting!

<i>I'm so sorry that I left my family</i>

Peter, what are you doing here?

Me and Quagmire kind of had a falling out.

And after that, I realized I...

Meg, can you please stop
stuffing your face for two seconds?

Look, I'm sorry for being a jerk,
and letting a little fame go to my head.

I just hope you guys can forgive me.

Oh, Peter.

(MOANS)

I missed you so much.

Oh, we missed you, too.

But I understand.
You had to go chase your dream.

And a part of me is glad you did.

But now I'm just happy that you're home.

Welcome home, Dad!

So, did you get a lot
of trim on the road, Dad?

Chris, that's inappropriate.

QUAGMIRE: Hey, you got room for another?

Quagmire? I thought
you were still out on the road.

I was, but then I thought,
what was Simon without Garfunkel?

Wildly successful?

Yeah, but all that success would
mean nothing if I lost my best friend.

Do you... Do you think you can forgive me?

Oh, Quagmire.

Well, I'm glad to have you back
home for Thanksgiving, Peter.

And I'm glad to be here.

'Cause everyone knows
that life after being famous

is even better than it was before.

Hey, be careful.
There's cars on the floor here.

Thanks. That's weird, huh?

Yeah. The doorknob was really hot,

but I just let go
instead of holding onto it.

And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

so I guess
just don't go down there.

Just so you guys know,
I have a tarantula.

Well, now there are no witnesses.

Come on, everybody, let's go to the mall.

It's time for the Christmas Carnival.

It's Stewie's first Christmas.

Again?

I love the Christmas Carnival!

Chris, calm down.
You're giving yourself a nosebleed.

You know, the best thing
about the Quahog Mall

is going into Tiffany's
and doing everything possible

to make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

Oh, this is lovely. Just lovely.

-How much is this?
-$1,200.

Great, great.

That's all? A-And how late
are you open this evening?

-Until 7:00.
-Perfect, perfect.

And you accept credit cards and cash?

-Yes.
-And what's your name?

I want to make sure you get credit
for this sale.

-Evan.
-Oh, that's a great name.

Oh, and these watches here,

if I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

could they each get engraved individually?

-Yes.
-And you do that on site?

-Yes.
-Fantastic.

Now, the groomsmen's names
are Blake, Hayden, Edgar,

Blake D, Elliott, Milo, Cooper...

Why aren't you writing
any of these down?

You're wearing Sbarro wrappers
for shoes, sir.

There may have been a trade.

Hey, nice outfit.

Fancy pair of shoes, too.

Do you... Do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

Great question, smart guy.

What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

And the big Christmas tree?

-Oh, look, there's Santa.
-Peter, no.

-That's a Hells Angel.
-What do you want?

-Meth?
-Okay.

There's no Christmas Carnival, Dad.

You seem to know a lot about this, Meg.
What did you do?

No Christmas Carnival?

Whoever is responsible for this
shall suffer my eternal wrath.

(CHUCKLES) Who's this guy?
Tough don't sell in curly-toed shoes.

Leave me alone.

Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at Macy's?

I want something I can wear on the street
that a broad can smell on a fire escape.

There's gotta be an explanation for this.

Let's ask that security guard

who has everything on his belt
except a gun.

-Excuse me, sir?
-It's "officer."

-No, it's not. It's barely "sir."
-Yeah, I know.

Where is the Christmas Carnival?

Canceled. I don't know why.

I'm just a small cog
in this operation.

You hear that, Dad?

You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

PETER AND LOIS:
I told you that in confidence, Chris.

Daddy, where's Santa?

Was he killed by Muslims?

Oh, my God, poor Stewie.

He's so disappointed.

Of course he is, Lois.
I feel the same way.

How come every time
I'm feelin' happy,

somebody's gotta
come along and ruin it?

Are you enjoying your coffee, sir?

Yeah, it's very smooth. Good flavor.

What if we told you
that we secretly replaced your coffee

with Folgers Crystals?

Wouldn't you feel like a dumbass?

'Cause of how
you just raved about it just now?

You stupid son of a bitch.

(ANNOUNCER SPEAKING)

Boy, Stewie was really upset

about the Christmas Carnival
being canceled.

He's been acting out all week.

Ah, I'm sure he'll be over it in no time.

Besides, how much trouble can he cause?
He's a baby.

(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

Turns out I know a guy
who knows a guy

who knows another guy who knows a girl,

which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

some guy named
Carter Pewterschmidt.

Oh, my God.

So I got another guy workin' on
findin' out who that is.

It's my father.

Oh! This is a twist I did not expect.

Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "Oh" this out

until I'm not surprised anymore.

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh. Oh.

Lois, before I get mad at your dad,

h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?

No, Peter, we've been through this.

Good. I could never be mad at that guy.

He says my favorite word twice in a row.

Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father

and get him to bring back
the Christmas Carnival.

-Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.
-Sure, it will.

The nerve of your dad,
takin' the fun out of Christmas,

like some kind of gluten-free Santa.

Hey. Hey, what's in these?

Huh?

I'm okay if it's, like, coconut flour.

But anything with actual grains,
I can't do.

I'm not sure.

Well, who is sure?

(SQUEAKING)

WOMAN OVER SPEAKER:
<i>Mr. Pewterschmidt, there's a man here</i>

<i>who says he's the guy whose picture</i>
<i>is on all the money.</i>

Holy cow. Send him in.

Griffin!

That's right, and this is my own
<i>People</i> magazine from home

and not from your
waiting room just now,

and why did you cancel
the Christmas Carnival?

Because I hate Christmas.

You know what it's like being
rich at Christmas, Griffin?

Everyone expects an expensive present,
and I get nothing.

Did you... Did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

No.

Sheesh, Carter, you know what?

I am gonna help you find
the Christmas spirit

so you bring back the carnival.

Look, are we done here?

Um, yeah, uh, just one more thing.

Can I choose one thing in your office
to take home with me?

No.

Aw, too bad.
'Cause I was gonna choose you.

You're weird. You're a weird guy.

No. No-no, no.

I want to zip it.

(GRUNTS)

It's okay, Peter,
you're good at other stuff.

So you're gonna help your old man

find his Christmas spirit again, huh?

Oh, yeah, that sounds real bad,

her father don't like Christmas.

My father was drowned to death
in a birdbath

by an officer of the law.

His will just said,

"Kick Jimmy in the sack for me.
Go, Eagles."

My sympathies, Vinny.

Don't worry about it.
He was a scumbag.

Are you sure about this, Peter?

I mean, I know Stewie was disappointed

about the carnival, but he'll get over it.

He's a happy, resilient baby.

I don't know, Lois.
I feel like if we don't do something,

Stewie's first words are gonna be,
"Why did you kill Christmas?"

And I want the carnival back, too.

You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

you know what the thing
is that keeps me going

more than anything else?

Wonder. A sense of wonder.

Well, you have your work
cut out for you, Peter.

My father's always hated Christmas.

Hey, happy June 16.

Thought I'd see how you like it
when someone

breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

Hey. Knock it off.

I'm touching this.
And this over here.

You're a creep, is my point.

All right, Carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

to put you in the holiday mood?

Write a Christmas letter
to all your friends and relatives.

And keep in mind, it's traditional
to embellish a little bit

to make yourself look better.

"Peter had a great year,

"and is now starting quarterback
for the Jacksonville Jaguars."

What? People can easily fact-check this.

Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

"Chris refurbished a vintage motorcycle,

"and Stewie can slam-dunk a basketball
from a standing start..."

-Peter, that's impossible.
-Read what it says about you.

"Lois's father, Carter Pewterschmidt,
bought a small stool for his balls."

Damn it, I'm not proud of that.

Well, you have to throw in
some real facts.

That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

Now, everyone knows the best way
to get the Christmas spirit

is to drink a whole lot of thick,
frothy eggnog.

-So get going.
-I don't like eggnog.

Drink the nog, Carter.

I don't... I don't want to.

Take it, Carter. Take all the nog.

(COUGHS)

-No.
-Yeah, you like that nog.

Don't spit the nog out.

Now look at the camera for a POV shot.

Say thank you
with the nog in your mouth.

-Thank you.
-Louder!

-Thank you.
-Good.

Now go down to the hotel lobby
and check out

-with nog all over your face.
-All right.

You know, I still don't like Christmas,

but I kind of like what we just did.

Okay, Carter, a big part
of Christmas is masturbating

like you would any other day,
but feeling guilty about it

because it's Christmas.

(SIGHS) What's wrong with me?

-Griffin, this isn't working.
-What? What do you mean?

I-I'm not getting the holiday spirit,
so you can stop trying.

But Carter, it's not just for me.

Think about Stewie.
He's all upset 'cause there's no carnival.

Heh. Different dog.

Yeah, this one's, like,
Italian or something.

Anyway, I think we're done here.
No Christmas Carnival.

Wow, Carter.
I had no idea you were Jewish.

What? Is...
Is that how this is coming off?

Yeah, kind of.
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

People think I'm Jewish?

Oh, this Christmas Carnival
has everything, games, food...

Oh, my God, it's the carolers
from <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

(SINGING) <i>Deck the harrs</i>
<i>with boughs of horry</i>

<i>Fa ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra</i>

That's right, America, don't forget.

Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

And flom not that rong ago.

What's wrong with you, Stews?

You're next up to see the big guy himself

and you look like a piece of spaghetti
on the street.

I don't know.
I thought having the carnival back

would make me happy,

but it still feels
like something's missing.

Yeah, it's always somethin'.

Like when I finally got to sleep
with Mary Lou Gallo.

She had a look,
but when you got up close,

she also had a smell.

Oh, Stewie, you're next.

Ho ho ho.

Mall Santa is brought to you
in part this season by Chipotle.

Between good and garbage, it's Chipotle.

So, what do you want for Christmas?

Oh, what do I want for Christmas?

What do I want for Christmas?

You know what I want for Christmas?

I want my friend back.

-Your friend?
-Yes. My best friend.

My dog, Brian.

He's dead.

It's our first Christmas without him

and no one's even mentioned his name.

I don't care about this stupid carnival
or Christmas.

I don't care about anything except Brian.

I want Brian. (SOBS)

You want me to put a dead dog
under your tree?

(SOBBING) Yes.

(SNIFFLES) And, uh,
I-I'd like a bike, too.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i>
The Year Without a Santa Claus or Sex.

Daddy, where's Santa Clau...

-I don't know, okay?
-Should I ask Mom?

(LAUGHS) I don't know,
she's so busy with her job.

VINNY: Hello there, Stewart.

What's this?
What are you doing, Vinny?

Vinny? Who's Vinny?

My name is Brian, aka your favorite dog.

Hey, whose leg do you gotta gagoosh

to get an Amaretto Disaronno
around here?

Oh, forget it, Vinny.
You're not Brian.

Come on, I went to a lot of trouble.

For example, I know Brian
was rather into politics,

so I read the newspaper.

What is goin' on
with all these politics, huh?

Well, that is about Brian's level
of political awareness.

Yeah, and you know how Brian wrote
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It?</i>

Well, I wrote a book, too.

A little something called
<i>Wish It, Want It, You Blew It.</i>

-Really?
-Yup. Let me read you an expert.

"You wish you were a millionaire.

"You want more money. Guess what.

"You blew it.

"You wish you could change
the neighborhood.

"You want to be a selectman.

"You blew it.

"You wish you could
open up a restaurant.

"You did not want to pay protection money.

"Knock, knock. Who's there?
You blew it."

-You blew it who?
-You blew it bad.

You know what the last
page of the book is?

A mirror.
So you can see exactly who blew it.

Being you.

Look, I appreciate all this, Vinny,

but there's only one Brian,

and it's tough for me that he's gone,

especially around the holidays.

Okay, I know what'll cheer you up.

How about you open up
one of those Christmas presents?

It's from me. Merry Christmas.

What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

That was supposed to go to somebody else.

I'm very sorry.

Well, my friends, I think
Johnny "The Foot" Giatelli is dead.

Oh, no. They killed
Frankie "Choo-Choo" Chinelli instead.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

You sure that's what this means?

Could be they killed
Davey "The Box" Frateli.

-Ooh. Ooh.
-Ooh.

Hold on, it could also be they killed

Jimmy "Tissue Paper" Scungili.

I just saw Jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

So maybe it wasn't Jimmy.

Maybe this means they killed
Anthony "The Air Around the Box" Minetti.

(GUN FIRES)

Oh, no, they killed

Sal "Holding The Box
That We Can't Figure Out

"What The Box Means" Casella.

Here, I got this for you, too.

A bowling shirt?

You can wear it anywhere.

To the beach, a wedding on the beach,

beach graduation, beach funeral,

business conference
which could be at a beach,

a stroll through the park,

should that park be adjacent to a beach.

Thanks.

What, you don't like it?

How's about we go to the mall
and pick out something you do like?

Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

Possibly pick up a new action figure.

That's the spirit.

All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

before I kick my own ass.

Okay, Stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

I don't know. I hate the toy store
this close to Christmas.

It's always been picked clean.

There's plenty of good stuff here.

Look at this, heavy bronze sheep bookends.

What kid wouldn't want to play with these?

"Baa. What are you lookin' at?"

"Not much, that's what I'm lookin' at."

"You want to have a go?"

"I'd watch what I say
with that other sheep right behind you."

I played this as a kid.

'Course, I had to do it with ashtrays,

but I think the sheep is better.

Wait a minute. Who is that?

I think... I think I know that boy.

Vinny, that stocking cap.

It's mine.

That boy is me.

Of course. It's me from the past.

Several months ago, I time-traveled ahead

to purchase that Christmas toy.

I don't understand,
so I'm angry and hungry.

I'm gonna go punch a sandwich.

Wow, good timing,
little fella.

This just came out today.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
I kind of knew that already.

The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

that other Stewie is wearing.

I must get my hands on it, Vinny.

Vinny?

That was a tough sandwich.

As tough as your mom's fat face.

Hey, leave my mother out of this.

That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

I heard she was
good with her hands.

Nice.

Hey, everybody,
we got a funny sandwich here.

(BLEEP)

Vinny, I need you to get that Stewie
to take off his backpack.

Listen, Stewie, I'm not following.

I don't have time to explain.
I've got to steal something...

That's it. You've already explained.

You got to steal something. Got it.

Wait-Wait a sec, what's your plan?

Trust me, I think I know you well enough

to know how to distract the other you.

Hey, how you doing?

This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

but, uh, you ever do any modeling?

Well, not professionally,
but I-I-I have thought about it.

You ought to. What are you,
like, six-three? Six-four?

Y-Y-You're in...
You're in the ballpark.

I carry myself taller.

Good posture, very important.

Oh, I agree.

Let me see, let me see.

That's good.

But I feel like the backpack
might be hiding some figure flaws.

(LAUGHS) Well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

You know, my friends ask me,

"Stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

This. This is why.

All right, whatever you gotta do,
do it quick.

The other you is in the back

changing into a pair of tap shoes,
for some reason.

OTHER STEWIE: (SINGING)
<i>Animal crackers in my soup...</i>

Hey, where did that guy go?

Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

to the moment before Brian got killed

and I can save him.

Oh, yeah, Scott Bakula and all that.

Yes, Vinny. Scott Bakula.

-Well, thank you for everything.
-You bet.

You realize if I save Brian,

my family won't
get another dog,

which means we will never have met.

I'll probably never see you again.

Oh.

So, I think this is good-bye.

Hey, I'm man's best friend,

not some stupid baby's best friend, right?

Good dog, Vinny. Good dog.

Georgette, I'm coming home.

Who the hell is Georgette?

Okay, Brian,
I'm just putting this out there,

but I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

God, look at this day, huh?

You know, usually,
I'd be sitting inside writing,

you'd be working on
one of your machines.

But here we are enjoying it.

Yes, it is a nice change of pace.

Oh, wait, I gotta go grab my knee pads.

I was using them for...
For, for this other thing.

Anyway, I-I'll be right back.

Brian, look out!

What the hell?

You're alive, my friend.

What? Of course I'm alive.
What the hell's going on here?

Brian, that car killed you.

And when it did,
a little part of me died as well.

I couldn't live without you.

So I came back from the future
to save your life.

Whoa. Wait, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

I saw you destroy your time machine.

Yes, but luckily,
I ran into another me from the past,

so I stole his return pad
and came back here.

Oh, that reminds me. I've gotta
send this back where it came from.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that guy
wasn't a real modeling agent.

And I'm starting to think that other guy
wasn't a real penis-butt inspector.

Wow, Stewie, thank you for saving my life.

You know, a whole lot of other families

would've just gotten
a different dog and moved on.

Oh, oh, we could, we could never
do something like that, Brian.

Stewie, what's happening to you?

I think... My timeline is being erased.

The timeline
where you died no longer exists.

Merry Christmas, Brian.

Hey, who were you
talking to out here?

A pretty awesome guy.

Oh, "pretty awesome guy."
Why don't you marry him, huh?

-All right, game on.
-Argh!

(IMITATES CROWD CHEERING)

Stew-S-A! Stew-S-A! Stew-S-A!

Oven mitts. Wow, thanks, Mom.

Now you don't have to ask me
if everything is hot before you touch it.

Are... Are the oven mitts hot?

Here you go, Stewie. Merry Christmas.

Brian, it's-it's wonderful. Thank you.

Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

I'll tell you about it sometime.

Brian.

Are we pregnant?

What? No, Stewie, it's nothing like that.

Okay, well, I have to tell you,
I'm a little bit relieved.

Look, just, just,
thanks for everything, Stewie.

You're my best friend and I love you.

All I can say, Brian, is you've been
making really creepy eye contact

with me all morning
and I want it to stop right now.

-Morning, Stella.
-Morning, Peter.

Hey, listen, I-I got to ask you something.

Last night, I heard, uh, the song
<i>Pour Some Sugar On Me,</i>

and-and this question popped into my head.

Are you, and please say yes...
Are you related...

And even if you're not, please say yes...
Are you related to...

And please say yes
because I need the attention

from my friends...
Are you related to Def Leppard?

Griffin, can I talk to you privately?

Stella, turn around.

You know, that is one nice thing
about having a deaf coworker.

Well, that and I can work
on my verbal sound effects

and not feel self-conscious about
the ones that aren't quite there yet.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about this,
shabba dabba dabba dabba dabba.

That's a helicopter hovering over a woman
swimming in her pool.

I also do animals.

Here's a mouse.

(HIGH-PITCHED) Mouse?

Oh, that one's ready.

Griffin, I actually came to tell you

that you're being promoted
to forklift operator.

Really? That's awesome!

Yeah, Frank retired, and since you're
already required to wear a helmet here...

Which, by the way, put on your helmet.

Oh, sorry.

Anyway, the job is yours.

Which means you'll be receiving
a five percent raise.

Wow, a raise!

I guess this means I can afford
to set up this cutaway

with a fancy new transition.

SINGERS: <i>Cutaway</i>

(MOTOR STARTS)

SINGERS: <i>End of cutaway</i>

All right, you beautiful
bastard, show me what you got.

(ENGINE STARTS)

Peter, you can run now,

and no one will call you a quitter.

What am I saying? No.

I learned how to use stickers,
and I can learn how to use this.

(FORKLIFT BEEPING)

(FORKLIFT BEEPING)

Oh, this is awesome.

Oh, guys, good, you're here.

I am so excited. Guess what.

I hope this isn't about
your podcast again.

Why? Did you finally listen to it?

Yeah, it was just
15 minutes of you listing

all the hats you could think of.

Sherlock Holmes hat.

Football man hat.

Angry working-class Irish idiot hat.

Underwear 'cause you're a cat
in the laundry basket hat.

Vietnamese the sun is my enemy hat.

Halloween mask that
I flip up to eat my candy hat.

College guy wearing a pizza box hat.

Blue hat.

I think that's all the hats.

No, you guys, this is really big.
You're not gonna believe this.

Peter, we've been over this.
You're not allowed to say that

unless there's a forklift outside.

BOTH: Forklift!

Wow!

I know, awesome, right?

Oh, my God, I want to get on!

Hold on, remember the first thing
we said we'd do.

Wow.

So that's what the tops of cars look like.

All right, walking speed.

Afternoon, ma'am.

Afternoon to you, normal sir.

(WHISPERS) No one can tell.

Uh, how's the weather
down there, you short idiot?

Should we tell him his pants fell off?

No, let's wait awhile.

(SINGING) <i>Well, you can tell by the way</i>
<i>I use my walk</i>

<i>I walk all the time</i>

(AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)

Uh, are you gonna stay for the bris?

Nah, I don't want to see that.

This whale's beached himself.

He needs to get back
in the water or he'll die.

PETER: Step aside,
I'll handle this.

Give me some room.

You're whale-come. (GIGGLES)

Aw, cool shell.

Ah, this is what
it's all about, huh, Duke?

Six hundred gallons of beer
in one big thing.

This is what we do, Peter.

You know, I always thought
I could chug that,

but I never tried 'cause
I figured I couldn't lift it.

Until now.

Are you nuts?
No way you can chug that.

No, I can totally do it.

I've only had, like,
four beers this morning.

(ALL CLAMORING)

(CHEERING)

(GAGGING)

He's doing it!

It's killing him, but he's doing it.

(GAGGING CONTINUES)

So, as you can see,
sales are going very well.

Griffin, you're fired!

Eh, see if I care.

Hello, COBRA?

I'd like to pay $1,300
for one month of health insurance.

How's the job search going, Dad?

Eh, not great, Chris.

I'm looking at the paper right now.

I don't see a lot here.

Hey, Lois, how much
you think a Sagittarius pays?

I think you're in
the wrong section, Peter.

Oh, pardon me.

Oh, looks like the Dodgers just cut Peña.
Might be something there.

Peter, put the paper down.

Okay, kids, off to school.

Now, I know it's picture day,

but we can't afford them anymore,

so just run behind another kid

when they're getting their picture taken.

Peter, we should talk about
this job situation.

Our savings are getting pretty low.

You know, actually, Peter,
there's a lot of job training programs

sponsored by the state

that could help you get the skills
you need for another occupation.

You know, Brian,
you could get a job.

I have a job.

I-I'm a writer, Peter.
I'm working right now.

See this, all of this?

This is the raw material
of a picture of life

that I'm gonna paint with words.

Yesterday, it took you 30 minutes

to lap up a cold cut off the floor.

That's my process!

It's been three weeks

and you haven't had a single job lead.

Oh, that's not true.

I came really close
with that job at the school.

So, what makes you want
to be a crossing guard?

I don't know,
I just thought it would be cool

to decide which kids
do and don't get hit by a car.

Well, Peter, since you've been
having such a tough time,

I was thinking,
maybe I should look for a job.

Lois, I'll be damned if I will
let my wife be a prostitute.

What? No, I'll get a regular job.

(LAUGHS) What, like a lawyer?

Peter, there are jobs for women
between prostitute and lawyer.

Wartime nurse?

We need money.
I'm gonna look for a job.

(SIGHS) I guess you should,
and that'll give me more time

to focus on expanding
my record collection.

-How's this one?
-Oh, Bach.

Is very good. I recommend.

-And this one?
-Oh, Mozart.

The boy genius. The best.

-Okay, how about this?
-Oh, Debussy.

I love Debussy.

Sometimes all I can think about
is Debussy.

Oh, look at the pianist.

The pianist is so good with Debussy.

So, you like his early work?

Oh, yes, when Debussy was young,

that's when you want Debussy.

Okay, I'll take these two.

Very good, sir.

Just make sure you finish on the Bach.

Never finish on Debussy.

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

CROWD: Bravo! Bravo!

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

All right, you can do this.

You've shopped here for years.

You know this place
like the back of your hand.

Now, Mrs. Griffin,
where did you go to college?

Groceries.

Are you available to work weekends?

Groceries.

Very impressive.

This next one is a trick question.

Groceries?

I'm hired.

Welcome aboard.

Hey, guys, great news.

You're looking at
the new assistant store manager

of Stop 'N Shop.

You got a job at the grocery store?

That's great!

You get to see all the food
before it's famous.

Well, you know you've made it
when you've got a teenage boss.

Lois, that's awesome!

Now I can spend my days at The Clam

like we've always talked about.

No, Peter, if I'm gonna
be out of the house working,

you're gonna have to take over
for me in the house.

Wait, wait, what,
I-I got to do what you do?

Spending the whole day
taking Tylenol PMs

and straddling the bath faucet?

Well, the guy knows what's going on here,
I'll give him that.

No, I mean, you're gonna need to
cook the meals and do laundry

and take care of Stewie,
like I've been doing.

Are you serious?
Dad's gonna run the house?

Hey, I can do it.

I mean, it can't be
any harder than that job

I used to have at the bowling alley.

Bowlarama. Yes, we're open.

Oh, yes, we have
a wide selection of balls

that are way too heavy
or have too-small finger holes.

Uh, no, you will not
be able to do anything

with your wrist for seven days afterward.

Yes, sir,
all of the joysticks in the arcade

are completely covered in pizza grease,
no worries there.

What's that?

Oh, absolutely, there is always
a group of teenagers

throwing the ball real hard
and scaring everyone.

No, there is no smoking,
but we do let you smoke.

Yes, it's all terrible, come on down.

Why are you doing laundry
in the dishwasher?

Oh, I can't use the washing machine,

it's really been acting up lately.

What the hell?

What's going on down here?

This is washing machine stuff.
Go back upstairs, suck-bag.

All right, Stewie,
I'm gonna change your diaper now.

Which, unfortunately, means
I have to touch your privates.

All right, so here I come with the cloth.

Okay? This is not sexual.

All right, I've made contact
with your undercarriage.

I am moving it upwards
with a cupped hand.

I'm looking you in the eye now.

Please meet my gaze.

And we're done.

That was intense.

All right, kids,
you are really gonna love

these Cornish game hens
I cooked for dinner.

Now, I don't want
to pat myself on the back,

but I worked all day
getting 'em just right...

Holy crap!

Oh, my God. Then that means...

And that also means...

You know what, Peter?

You tried hard,
and you still earned that wine.

I'm home.

Wow, Peter, the house looks amazing.

Yeah, well, let's take off our shoes

and try to keep it that way, huh?

No, really, Peter,
it seems like you've really

taken to being a househusband.

Well, it hasn't been easy.

Between doing the laundry and vacuuming,

I barely had time to put on a nice sweater

and clasp a cup of tea with two hands.

(SIGHS) Ah.

And now to tie this sweater
around my waist

and walk around the neighborhood.

Well, what do you say I reward you

for all your hard work?

Geez, Lois, is that all you think about?

I'm tired.

Come on, Peter.

I need this release.
I had a long day at work.

Oh, work.

I suppose work is why you missed

Chris's father-son picnic.

Peter, you're still Chris's father.

Why can't you just listen
instead of trying to fix everything?

Get in here, Peter.
Don't you want to have sex?

I don't think we've done it
since I started working.

PETER: Yeah, I guess you're right.

Come on, where's my big, strong man?

Putting on one of your dress shirts
to look sexy.

(PURRS)

Mmm.

I want to do it on top of the comforter.

I don't care if we make streaks.

Well, of course <i>you</i> don't,
you're not the one who cleans it.

Peter, just shut up and take me!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Peter, get up! Get up!
There's a caterpillar in the bed!

PETER: Oh, that's, uh... That's me.

-What?
-How do I put this delicately?

My hog cannot partake
in the slop this evening.

Peter, are you having trouble
getting ready?

Yes, obviously, I'm having trouble!

Well, somebody's gonna
have sex with me.

Lois, don't say that. Quagmire will
show up like the Road Runner.

It's okay,
your vagina's just a painted-on hole.

Oh, Peter, you're up.

-That's not what I heard.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

Hey, Peter, you want
a little something

to put in that orange juice?

What? Why? It's 9:00 a.m.

Well, I figured you'd like
to start your day with a stiff one.

(ALL LAUGHING)

You can't get a boner!

You're a failure as a man and a father.

Peter, it's nothing to get upset about.

There's treatments available.

We'll go see Dr. Hartman.

I don't want to do that.
I'm embarrassed.

This shouldn't embarrass you.

The size should embarrass you.

How about now?
Is this doing anything for you?

No.

Hmm. Well, what if I show you my tattoo?

-Nothing.
-Well, you got a dead rat

in your pants, mister.

There's got to be something you can do,
Dr. Hartman.

Have you tried getting a divorce?

I've never seen this problem
in a single man.

Doctor, what about Viagra or Cialis?

What about them?

Well, if Peter could try them,

they might help with his problem.

Those are for man troubles?

I've been prescribing them
as antidepressants.

Everything's just getting
harder and harder.

Hey, you guys want another round?

Oh, I don't know, Peter,
it's getting kind of late.

Yeah, I got to get going.

It takes me three hours
to get ready for bed.

Oh, please don't make me go home
and disappoint my wife yet again!

What are you talking about, Peter?

You know how earlier tonight
we all said we had erections?

-I lied.
-So did I.

Dr. Hartman says I'm impotent.

Oh, you don't have to take that from him.

You know, Dr. Hartman
once told me I had gonorrhea.

So I hit him in the head with a bat.

I give gonorrhea,
I don't get gonorrhea. Okay?

It's terrible, guys.

I tried the pills he gave me,
but even they didn't work.

Well, look at it this way, Peter:
without sex, you'll have more time

to do the things you've
always wanted to do.

For me, it was learning
to play the trombone.

Why the hell would you
want to play the trombone?

For moments like this.

Peter can't get an erection.

(PLAYS DESCENDING NOTE)

Peter, I am gonna help you beat impotence.

We can do this together.

Thanks, Quagmire, 'cause this sucks.

I think even the people

at the office supply store can tell.

Um, excuse me, where do you keep

your three-ring binders?

Those are on aisle...

Hold on a sec.

We're all out of binders.

All right, Peter, now,
when it comes to curing impotence,

sometimes you have to get creative.

-So, we're gonna try the Boston Method.
-What's that?

Well, basically, some dirtbag from Boston
yells at your junk

to scare it into working again.

So you got a stupid penis, huh?

I-I guess so.

You hear me in there, dum-dum?
Let's look alive.

Listen, I could be nice about this
or I could get my brother.

And he did some serious time

for throwing a turkey off a bridge
into a car.

It's-it's not working.

All right, well, I got to go.

There's a ripped screen door
that needs slamming.

How could a town
with so many great colleges

produce nothing but dopes?

You sure this is gonna work, Quagmire?

Of course. This isn't the first time

I've rigged up a sex puppet.

I now have full control
over your genitals.

-Are you sure?
-Yeah, check it out.

(GIGGLES)

It looks like an unmanned fire hose.

Stop smiling, this is serious.
You got to have your sex face.

Okay, okay, my sex face
is a ton of underbite.

Okay.

Lois, I'm ready.

LOIS: Oh, Peter.

PETER: How about this?

Damn it, Peter,
I'll set the pace, you idiot.

All right, now to let some line out.

Let her dance with it a little.

(WIRES WHISTLING)

LOIS: Oh, come on, Peter,
get out of my water glass.

I need to take a pill later.

PETER: Oh, sorry, I guess I need
to be a little more to the left.

A little more to the left!

Come on, Quagmire,
you were a Navy pilot for six years.

Land this thing.

LOIS: Oh, Peter, that's new.

Let me try.

LOIS: Eh, tired.

Nothing seems to be working, you guys.

Is it gonna be like this forever?

-Yes.
-No.

Yes.

Hold on, Peter. You didn't start
having trouble in the bedroom

until you lost your job, right?

-Yeah, so?
-Well, that explains it.

I mean, you've been completely emasculated

because you're no longer the breadwinner.

What are you getting at, Quagmire?

There's only one thing

that's gonna restore your masculinity.

We got to get you your old job back.

It was a mistake for me
to ever take that promotion.

Wait a minute.

It was a mistake giving you a promotion.

(GASPS) Quagmire.

I'm not following you.

So, by promoting an incompetent man,

you were at fault.

Nice try, but I'm not the one

who drove a forklift
into a conference room

and sent two people to the hospital.

Come on, since this man lost his job,

he can't pleasure his wife.

Is that true?

I-I have what the kids call
"maje wien probs."

Angela, I really need my job back.

And I could stand here
and give you a big speech

about second chances and promise
to work harder than ever before.

And I could remind you
that one day you might be in my shoes

and maybe you'll need a second chance.

But I'm not gonna do that.

I'm gonna cash in this coupon
you gave me last Valentine's Day.

"One Redo For Being Fired
For Gross Negligence."

"And One Hug."

The hug one is expired, Griffin.

This one's for free.

Welcome back, Griffin.

CROWD: Aw.

Who's that?

Oh, I hired a studio audience
to do your old job.

You guys are fired.

CROWD: (DISAPPOINTED) Aw!

Peter, I can't help you shake DVDs

out of the Redbox again.

I got in trouble last time.

Now, go away, I'm working.

You don't have to anymore,
because I got my old job back.

Peter, I'm so proud of you.

And you know what?
Something else is working now, too.

Oh, my. Let's go home.

No. I am gonna do you right here

on a stack of pita bread.

LOIS: Oh, Peter.

PETER: Yeah, the bread's all
soft and doughy, isn't it?

And the inside of the bag's always wet

because those hairy dummies
put it in too hot.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

This is a cool place.

Good night, Lois.
Sorry about hitting you at dinner.

It was nice of the manager
not to call the cops.

Yeah, it worked out.

Happy anniversary.

STEWIE: Hey, hey!

I can't remember if I'm supposed
to sleep on my stomach or my back.

What does the current literature say?

Peter, go check on Stewie.

Fine.

-(PANTING)
-Oh, my God, look at you.

You're out of breath.

It's 15 feet from your door to mine.

Aw, what's the matter, Stewie?
You a little scared in here?

Don't worry, there's no monsters.

Of course there's no monsters.

Or are you worried about what happened
to that family down the street?

Those three guys broke in,
beat up the father with a croquet mallet,

and then stole the baby,
and nobody knows where the baby is now?

Is that what you're thinking about, buddy?

I am now!

Tell you what,
Daddy'll read you a bedtime story.

Ah, let's see.

Dr. Seuss, <i>Peter Rabbit...</i>

Ah, here we go, James Michener's <i>Hawaii.</i>

Let's skip three feet in.

Aah, Pearl Harbor!

Okay, let's see, uh...

Ah, here we go. <i>Fairy Tales.</i>

Oh, not on your lap. Aah, gross!

<i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

Now, that title could be
a fairy tale or a porn.

Let's find out.

Jack, we need to put food on the table.

Oh, give me a break, Wife.

You know, if you could
spin straw into gold

or-or maybe meth, I wouldn't need a job.

Well, then, sell the cow!

And be sure you get real money for it.

What else would I get?

I don't know. Magic beans?

There are magic beans?

I don't know. Who cares?

Well, what's magic about them?

Don't get magic beans, you idiot.

What? I-I'd never even freaking heard
of magic beans till you said them.

If I do get them, it's you what caused it.

So, you're selling me?

Yeah, well, you heard her back there.

She wants her stupid magic beans
so the whole world has to stop.

Halt, travelers!

Oh, my God! Why do you look like that?

Ah, all of these stories
were written by Germans.

But nobody can cross my bridge
without paying a toll.

A toll? Like what?

You have to name
three great Jewish athletes

or pay a thousand gold coins.

Uh, Hank Greenberg,
Sandy Koufax and, uh, Gal Fridman,

Olympic windsurfer.

Took gold in Athens in 2000
and the bronze in Atlanta in '96.

I can see you're on your phone.

Oh, come on, I'm supposed to go into town
and sell this cow.

Ooh, you're selling that cow?

I don't have much,
but I'll give you some magic beans for it.

(GASPS) That's exactly
what I was supposed to get!

I said not magic beans.

Look, le-let's just admit we both
kind of got our wires crossed,

and commit to being clearer in the future.

Jack, I'm sick of your
irresponsible behavior.

Like when you were supposed
to be babysitting Georgie Porgie

and his sleazy brother Rick Porgie.

Hey, Rick, you want to kiss
some girls and make them cry?

No, but let's thumb-blast them
and make them puke.

What the hell are we supposed
to do with these anyway?

I knew you'd be mad,
so I've asked the band Heart

to explain these beans
in a way you can dreamily digest.

(SINGING) <i>These beans</i>

<i>Go on when I close my eyes</i>

<i>Every second of the night</i>

They changed the word "dreams" to "beans."

I-I was hoping they'd change
a few more words

to pertain to our situation,

but I-I-I'm just happy they did this.

Jack, this is ridiculous.

Tomorrow I want you to go back out there
and look for a job that pays actual money.

These things are worthless.

I know she's gone,
but can you do the other one?

(SINGING) <i>What about beans?</i>

<i>Don't you want someone to care about you?</i>

(ROOSTER CROWS)

"Mary Davis gives birth to...

Lamb?"

Holy crap!

Oh, my God! Wha-What is that?

I think those magic beans
grew into a giant beanstalk.

Hey, where the hell'd
that thing come from?

It's blocking my view
of Little Miss Muffet's tuffet.

MISS MUFFET: Ooh, isn't my tuffet
soft and pink and wonderful?

Ah, damn it! I need to see that
so I can make curds and whey.

Relax, Rumpleforeskin.

This is a magic beanstalk
that grew overnight.

And I'm gonna climb it.

Jack, what are you talking about?
You can't climb all the way up there.

I have to. My old gym coach
is over there with a whistle.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

Come on, Jack, your brother
was varsity beanstalk climbing.

(CRYING) He's dead!

(SIGHS) And now to throw
this handful of change down

because I'm a psychopath.

QUAGMIRE: Aah, damn it!

STEWIE: I say, who the devil are you?
Go away!

Aw, I-I'm sorry.
Are you taking a goose poop?

I'm not defecating, you nitwit.
I'm laying an egg.

(GRUNTING)

(GASPS) Golden eggs!

Oh, my God!

This is probably what famous black rappers
eat for breakfast.

CHRIS: Who goes there?

Oh, boy. You woke up dum-dum.

Fee-fi-fo-fum.

I smell the blood of an English man.

It's odd that you would speak gibberish
of your own choosing

and not make it rhyme.

How did you get here?

By beanstalk.

How did you get up here?

This is just a house floating in the air.

I fell from a higher cloud.

That is not what happened.
H-He's out of his mind.

He just sits in his room all day
and inhales hair spray.

Well, you can't have my goose.

Okay, two men fighting over me.

Neat.

All right, we're just gonna
have to quietly run away.

I'll create a diversion.

Aah! Look at me! Look at me!
Look at me! Aah!

Damn beanstalk.

Hey, Little Boy Brown!
You said you were gonna help me saw.

CLEVELAND: I can't find no gloves!

(GRUNTS) Aah!

Aah!

Jack six, giant zero.

What? What? Why-why is that six points?

Oh, Jack, you're safe. I was so worried.

And I got this golden goose.

Our troubles are over.

Well, our-our money troubles are over.

Our sexual troubles are still...

Are still very much alive.

Now we wait.

"The end."

So, the lesson there is if you steal,
you better be ready to murder, too.

What do you say we read another one?

Wow, you got a great view
into Bonnie's window from here.

Man, how do you get any work done?

What do you mean?
Lois is prettier than Bonnie.

Oh, I get it.
It's worse, but it's different.

Okay, all right,
so that's something. Okay.

So I got out of the car to take a leak,
because I'd been drinking,

and I didn't know
it was next to a children's park.

But anyway, that's why this lady
has to watch whenever I play with you.

Both hands on the book, please.

It's my son! Come on! Geez!

Red, don't forget this basket
of food for Grandma.

This whole thing is way too heavy.

Wh-Why are you putting
a bag of ice in here?

Is this... Is this a Coors Party Ball?

Is Grandma gonna be entertaining
Florida Jet Ski people?

Remember, stay on the path
and you'll be fine.

Oh, yes, great advice
from mother of the year.

Grandma lives 68 miles away, right?

If you're gonna hit the king,
you better kill the king.

(ROARS)

Oh, hey. You're the wolf, right?

BRIAN: Yup, and don't forget
"big" and "bad."

(GROWLS)

(CHUCKLES) Nah.

So, um, what happened with you
and those three little pigs?

Wh-Why did you want to eat them so badly?

(SIGHS) It-it's so amazing that
that's what people think happened.

First of all,
I didn't want to eat them, all right?

-I wanted to talk to one of them.
-About what?

Well, she was my ex-girlfriend,

and I believed I was due an explanation
about why she was such a (BLEEP) whore.

All right, well,
I'm off to my grandmother's,

but before I go,
I better take a deep-woods dump.

Her bathroom is right off the dining room.

So, it's either now
or three days from now.

Where are you going, dear?

I got to go check
on my shoe apartment complex.

Old woman breeds like a gopher.

(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

Hello? Is anyone home?

CONSUELA: <i>Ay,</i> no, no.

I can hear the muffled Mexican music.

(IMITATING STEWIE)
It's your granddaughter, Red.

How do I know it's you?

Oh, come on, that's a perfect imitation.

Open up. I brought strawberry shortcake

And what?

(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, sorry.

All right, fine. I guess we're doing this.

My, what big eyes you have, Grandma.

All the better to see you with, my dear.

My, what big...
You know what? I-I'm sorry, I-I can't.

I can't do this. I-I'm not an idiot.

My grandma is a human woman.
How-how was this ever a scene?

(IN NORMAL VOICE) All right, fine, yes.
It's me, the wolf.

Must we go through this charade?
It's insulting.

I don't know why you're complaining.

I'm the one who's about
to get violently bisected by the woodsman.

-What woodsman?
-(CHAIN SAW BUZZING NEARBY)

Ha-ha!

You know, I'm not sure if that's our hero

or just a lunatic

PETER: Ha-ha!

(CHAIN SAW BUZZING)

(MAN SCREAMING)

(THUD)

Yeah, he-he-he just did it again.

I think we should...
I think we should call somebody.

Aw, look at the little guy.

So peaceful.

-Hey! Wake up! We got one more!
-(STEWIE YELLS)

Now, if this don't get you to sleep,
nothing will.

<i>Cinderella</i> by nobody remembers.

<i>in a magical, faraway land,</i>

<i>several women lived together</i>
<i>and, surprise, surprise,</i>

<i>they didn't exactly get along.</i>

Hey, Cinderella,
how's the scrubbing going?

God, we have so few
female characters to work with.

You just keep scrubbing that poo spot

so I can come back
and poo on that spot again.

You guys are gonna regret
being mean to me someday.

Mean to you? Us?

When are we ever mean to you?

Remember the time you told King Midas
to go to third base with me?

Now I'm dealing with this.

(METAL DINGING)

I dated him, too.

It's so unfair that we're called
the "evil" stepsisters.

Yeah, I mean, you'd be evil, too,
if your stepdad was Bruce Jenner.

Hey, girls, feel my cheek,
it's like a bottom!

(PLAYS FANFARE)

He stole me horn!

(PLAYS OFF-KEY)

Well, I don't, I don't know what that was,

but th-the first one has
a parchment from the Charmings.

(GASPS)

It's an invite to a party for the prince!

I hear he's looking for someone
to spend the rest of his life with.

Well, it won't be you.

Yeah, there's a reason
this story's not called <i>Cinderella.</i>

Actually, it is.

Ah, that does not bode well for us.

Now, since we're all planning on drinking,
I called us a pumpkin.

LOIS: Wait for me!

You said, if I had a nice dress,
I could go to the ball.

How did you even make that dress so fast?

Oh, you know, I-I have an eye for fashion,
and I'm pretty good with my hands.

Unbelievable.

Now I'm worried
about that screenplay we gave her.

You're not going to the ball!

It's for ladies, not scumbag nobodies.

Girls, shred her dress
and divvy it up for monthlies.

(LAUGHS)

(CRYING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Well, that's not cool, either.

They're all kind of bitches.

And then they ripped up my dress
so now I have nothing to wear.

Well, sometimes
"nothing to wear" is a fun time.

You know, just get weird.

Cinderella, I am your fairy godmother.

"Fairy" in the magical sense,
not about kissing guys.

Oh, my God!

I want that bitch Snow White
to just admit she had an abortion.

Whoa, whoa! I was thinking more like
a new dress for the party.

Or a bunch of chew toys. Your choice.

Chew toys. Take the chew toys.

A new dress?

Well, that means I could go to the ball!

Oh, what a beautiful dress.

B-But how will I get to the ball?

I-I don't have a horse or a carriage.

(GRUNTING)

Oh, yeah, that's...
Yeah, just change me into whatever.

Yeah, that's cool. Thanks.

Well, is everything all right in here...

(YELLS) This hurts! This hurts!

This ball is kind of lame.

All these royal types are inbreeding,
walleyed, bucktooth monsters

who have to be wheeled around
under a blanket.

I say! Wherever is Grandmum-mum?

She would so enjoy the festoonities!

That's not a word, sir.

My mind races from the damp!

Hey, how are you?

Hey, hi, there. Thanks for coming.

These are my daughters,

and they will do anything
to be your princess, right, girls?

See anything you like?

Oh, I'm so fancy and moist.

Ew, you guys are gross.

But stick around in case
I don't find anyone else.

(BOTH GRUNT)

Okay, first of all, obviously the dress.

Wow.

And you smell slightly less worse
than everyone else in the kingdom.

Oh, why, thank you,
I just bathed last year.

(BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING)

(BELL RINGING)

(GASPS)

Hey, wh-where you going? Come back here!

You brushed up against it!
You gotta take care of it now!

Wait, wait, you forgot your glass slipper.

And a box of condoms.

Aw, man! Things were gonna happen.

We almost kissed.

Why couldn't the magic
have lasted five more minutes?

Now I'll never get to be a rich,
do-nothing wife.

Sorry your dreams haven't come true.

My lord, there is no sign of her,
and we searched far.

-Did you search wide?
-No.

You got to search wide,
that's like half of it.

(NEIGHS)

PETER: <i>And so the prince</i>
<i>searched</i><i>all over the kingdom</i>

<i>for the foot</i><i>that fit the glass slipper.</i>

<i>Well, not "all" over.</i>

<i>He skipped the, uh,</i><i>south side of town,</i>
<i>which, uh, even</i><i>in fairy tale times,</i>

<i>was, um...</i>

<i>Let's just say "loud."</i>

And so, whoever fits

Or prince.

I'm bi.

Oh, there's my slipper!
Oh, I've been looking all over for it.

Well, when I'm not doing gymnastics.

Ah, this hunting trip is long overdue.

Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad
that all the-the animals

are so spread out, you know?

I mean, wouldn't it be awesome
if-if they were all grouped together,

like in a cafeteria,

and you could just go in there
with a trench coat and just waste them?

Well, maybe I can stir up
some quail or pheasant

Ah, ah, ow!

Hey, Peter, you got your safety on, right?

Yeah, of course.

Okay, 'cause your gun
is pointing right at me.

Well, you want me to pull the trigger
and prove it to you?

No, I just want to make
sure your safety's on.

-(TRIGGER CLICKS)
-There. See, Quagmire? Safety's on.

Now this is a gun without a safety.

-(SCREAMS)
-Quite the difference, huh?

Damn it, Peter, you son of a bitch!
You shot me!

Oh, my God, Peter!

That might be the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

No, the dumbest thing I ever did
was open that can of whup-ass.

A writer who inherits a magic typewriter

I earned some banana bread.

(PHONE RINGING)

Oh, crap. It's Dylan.

Dylan? Your son?

I haven't heard you mention him in ages.

Yeah, I-I decided to step away
from the whole situation.

The last thing he needs is a father who's,
you know, sometimes there, sometimes not.

Really? When-when was the part
when you were there?

Hey, if I click "ignore," will he know
that I'm sending him to voice mail?

Hey, Dylan! Hey, it's Stewie!

Yeah, I'm right here with your dad!

Hey... Hey, Dylan.

Hey, Dad!

I know we haven't talked in a while,

but I'm calling because
I'm on my way to Quahog.

Oh, really? W-When are you getting here?

-Tuesday...
-Oh, don't say Tuesday!

Aw, aw, I'm at the... I'm at the...
I'm out at the project all day.

Aw, hands on, indispensable.

They-they need me there, so, wow.

Rats. Bummer.

I can cover for you at the project, Brian!
Go see your boy!

DYLAN: <i>Dad, who's your coworker?</i>
<i>He sounds nice.</i>

He's widely disliked here, but, uh...

I'll meet you Tuesday at the coffee shop.

<i>Sounds great. I'll see you then.</i>

Okay, b-bye.

See? Don't you feel better?

You're gonna go to that lunch,
you're gonna reconnect with your son.

-It'll be great.
-I don't know, Stewie.

Trust me, you should take my advice.

I mean, I'm the guy
who told Michael Chiklis

to wear tight shirts.

I'll tell you anything you want,
just get your boobs out of my face!

You know the difference
between you and me, dirtbag?

No matter how muscular I get,
I will never be muscular.

Hey, Quagmire, what's with the cast?

Did you hurt your arm
after I shot you in the arm?

The shooting was the injury, Peter!

Look, I already said I was sorry,
like, a hundred times.

Oh, and before I forget,
I want my Huey Lewis CD back.

Well, I want a new drug.

Okay, at least you've been using it.
But I want it back, Peter.

-This is it.
-Ooh-ah.

Damn it, Peter, just give it back.

I can't give it back.
I lost it in a poker game.

-What?
-I didn't think he could beat a two.

Where the hell do you get off
betting my CD in a poker game?

I don't think I like your tone.

W-What? You're-you're saying
I'm being the unreasonable one?

Geez, calm down, you guys.

No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe,
it's time somebody said this to him.

Peter Griffin, you are an idiot!

You can't even walk
and chew gum at the same time.

Peter, come on! Walk over here.

(CHEWING)

I'm doing something. One thing at a time.

Damn it, Peter, that's it!
I am done! I'm done with you!

I'm done with all your crap!
I never want to speak to you again!

This friendship is over!

Well, fine! I don't need your friendship!
I got other friends.

I got my silent movie friends.

I've been thinking about it.

Wow, my son Dylan on a TV show.

Funny how life turns out, isn't it?

You remember that weekend
we watched TV together?

Boy, little did I know
how much that was gonna rub off.

Did we watch TV together?

Oh, probably. But, wow, huh?

And-and you know what's weird?

You're on a show... I'm a writer.

It's-it's almost like
the universe is trying to,

(CHUCKLING) I don't know,

make us work together or something,
I don't know.

You... You want a job on my show?

Hey, hey, don't put the universe's words
in my mouth, okay?

I don't know, Dad.

I've-I've barely seen you
in the past few years.

So, what better way to reconnect
than by working together every day?

Well, I suppose I could talk to them,
see if they'd go for it.

Why wouldn't they?

I-I mean, it wouldn't be

All right, guys, before we begin today,

I want to introduce our newest
staff writer, Brian Griffin.

Hi, guys. Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.

You probably have my novel,
but just so you know, in here,

I'm just one of the guys, all right?

You have my novel, right?

Nope? No?

You got it, though. Nope?

You got it?

Nope, nobody's got it.

All right.

Okay, so we got to come up with a story
for next week's episode.

How about we do one
where DJ gets his driver's license?

-That could work.
-I don't think we've done that.

Love that idea.

No, no, no.

Guys, guys, come on,
where's the STWISTUSION?

Really? Really?
I'm the only guy here who's heard of that?

Stakes, twists, conclusion... STWISTUSION.

That sounds made up.

Let me ask you something.
Are you afraid right now?

What? No.

That's what's wrong.
You should be, you know?

Art is scary.

This is writing, man.
The viewer wants to be raped.

Are you saying my nine-year-old daughter
wants to be raped?

Now you're asking the right questions.

Now you're being creative,
thinking outside the box.

Take what you think you know
and go a different way with it.

Like-like, for instance,
what if the daughter in <i>Taken</i>

was Zooey Deschanel?

Send me her head.

Peter, Quagmire,
I've called you here today

because this has got to stop.

The petty vying for my attention,

the late-night phone calls,
the attack ads.

NARRATOR: <i>Glenn Quagmire claims</i>
<i>to be</i><i>Joe Swanson's good friend.</i>

<i>But would a "good friend"</i>
<i>not return a leaf blower</i>

<i>for four months</i><i>during the leafy season?</i>

I'm Peter Griffin,

and I broke into a news station
to make this.

-MAN: Hey, who's that guy?
-(GASPS)

(STATIC CRACKLING)

Well, look, you guys
have given me no alternative.

I have to choose one of you.

So I choose Quagmire.

-What?
-Suck it!

I'm sorry, Peter,

it's just that Quagmire's been there
for me in some pretty dark days.

And he's been a wonderful godfather
to Susie.

(GIRL GIGGLES)

There she is, my little Susie-woozie!

(BOTH LAUGH)

I love Susie more! Come here, Susie!

Uncle Peter's gonna give you a raspberry.

(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Peter, that's not
where you do a raspberry.

I closed my eyes too early.

I think it's best if you leave.

Oh, yeah?

Well, maybe I'll hang out
with my godson, Kevin.

KEVIN: Get out!

He was masturbating with a knife.

DIRECTOR: We're rolling!

My stupid parents
want me to wear a bike helmet.

Parents are lame.

Hold on, other kids.

Maybe they just recognize
that nothing can protect us

from the tedium of our mundane lives.

Aren't we all on bikes without helmets?

Sometimes I just want
to put this gun in my mouth.

Cut! Your line is "That's right, Cameron."

I know. My dad wrote that one for me.

Again with this?

Yesterday, you had Dakota give herself

an abdomen-punch abortion
during her volleyball tournament.

Hey, seventh grade can be hell.

Brian, you're fired.

-Wait, what?
-Sorry, Brian, but you're done.

Oh, come on! You can't fire
a writer in the middle of a show!

That'd be like a doctor leaving
in the middle of a surgery!

(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

Help! I'm supposed to have surgery,
but my doctor disappeared.

Okay, Josh, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

Okay, Derek, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

Dylan, Dylan, there you are.
Listen, you can't let them fire me!

You're the star of the show!

Dad, believe me,
I want you to work here with me,

but you can't keep doing things like that.

And they know you took those cases
of Diet Coke home last night.

I thought they were anybody's Diet Coke!

-They're for work!
-I work at home!

Oh, hey, by the way,
are we all getting those backpacks

with the name of the show on them?

You know what, Dad?

I'm starting to think

that you've just been using me
to advance your career!

God! You're a terrible father!

I never want to see you again!

(SIGHS) My God, he's right.

I am a terrible father.

Brian, do you know where...

What the hell are you drinking?
Is that Rite Aid-brand whiskey?

(SIGHS)

Stewie, I just feel so awful
about what happened with Dylan.

I mean, every terrible thing
he said about me is true.

Well, you're a terrible guy, Bri.

I think being a paid writer again
just went to my head.

I mean, I just...
I can't believe I was so selfish.

It's-it's like Dylan
just held a mirror up to me,

and I could finally see
how poorly I'd been treating him.

I guess I didn't realize how lucky I was
to have Dylan back in my life

until I lost him all over again.

Well, maybe you should just apologize.

I tried to.

I mean, I texted him "S-R-Y frowny face."

I mean, he knows that I'm sorry
and that I'm sad.

(GASPS) What are you guys
doing up so early?

What-what are we... Where have you been?

Well, I certainly
wasn't at the Shriners' convention.

You know what I think, Brian?

I think you've got to get down to that set
and apologize face-to-face.

(SIGHS) You're right.

I just... I hope he's willing
to hear me out, you know?

(GROANS) I'm the worst father ever.

I'm even worse than Marvin Gaye's dad.

Happy Father's Day, Dad.

Marvin, if this another tie,
I'm gonna kill you.

Well, looks like
it's just you and me, shadow.

CROWD: Shadow!

Oh, hey, is, uh... Is Dylan back here?

Sorry, Brian, Dylan says
he doesn't want to see you anymore.

We're not allowed to let you in.

Well, you know what? I'm sorry, too.

-For what?
-For this!

(GRUNTS)

Yeah, you know, you probably
would've had a better shot

if you hadn't yelled "For this!"

You know, that-that kind of telegraphed
what you were gonna do.

Ah, Stewie, it's no use.
They're never gonna let us in.

Well, maybe you can't get in,
but I think I know someone who can.

Zac Sawyer?

I'm Zac Sawyer. Say "when."

-Okay, I'll be in the garage.

Peter, put that knife down.

Lois, I don't have any friends!

So I'm gonna kill myself
and get a full page in the yearbook.

Then they can't ignore me.

Who's that?

I don't know.

Okay, Zac, remember, your character's name
is Tevin Ashe-Taylor.

You surf and enjoy surfing.

In this scene, DJ Slopes is thinking
of quitting the detective agency,

and you're like, "No way."

Got it.

We're rolling!

Listen, Tevin,
I think I just need more time

to focus on my snowboarding
and web series about energy drinks.

No, man, you got to stay
in the detective agency.

It's what your dad would want.

What? What are you talking about?

What the hell's that new kid doing?
This isn't in the script.

I'm talking about your dad, DJ.

He sent me here with a message.

He said he can't believe
he was so selfish.

It's like you held a mirror up to him

and he could finally see
how poorly he'd been treating you.

He didn't realize how lucky he was...

Stay on me, camera one.

...to have you back in his life,

and now he feels like
he's lost you all over again.

But how do I know
he won't just hurt me again?

You don't. You never know that.

But isn't taking a risk
better than not having a dad?

Yeah, I guess you're right.

You're damn right I am.

Cut!

You know, I don't know where any of that
came from, but I liked it.

Who are you?

I'm Zac Sawyer.

And I go where I'm needed.

<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

<i>Going down the only road I've ever known</i>

Where you headed?

Wherever I'm needed.

No, no, it does not work like that.
I need to put address in machine.

Okay, maybe you can
just take me home then.

Where is home?

I-I don't know.
It's-it's my mom and dad's house,

but I don't know the address!

I take you airport.

Okay!

All right, Quagmire,
I have given this a lot of thought.

I need you to shoot me in the arm
so we can be friends again.

-Okay.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

No, no, I was supposed to offer,

and then you were supposed to say,
"No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you,

"although I do appreciate the gesture."

Hand me the gun, Peter.

I, uh... I passed the test?

No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you
like a dirty animal.

But-but just the fact that I would make
the offer is so meaningful to you.

Your offer means nothing, Peter.

The only thing that means anything to me
is a bullet in your arm. Now give me that!

Stop! Stop! Quagmire, let go!

Come on! You're not leaving
here without being shot!

Look, I was trying to do the decent thing,
like you'd see in a movie!

I'm putting that bullet
in your arm, Peter!

Ah! Son of a bitch!

It's over. We're all friends again.

What the hell, Joe?

I'm just trying to settle this nonsense.

Nothing got settled! You shot him!
I'm the one who has to shoot him!

Wait a second. All right,
then I get to shoot Joe, all right?

He shot me! I mean,
if we're doing things fair here, then...

(GUNSHOT)

All right, we're good.

-Hey, Dad.
-Dylan?

I went to your house,
and Chris told me you'd be here.

Look, Dylan,
I-I'm really sorry I hurt you.

I've been a really bad father,

like Ernest Hemingway
or-or some other great writer.

But if-if you'll give me a chance,
I-I'd like to try to change that.

I'd like that, too, Dad.

Peter, I'm so glad you patched
things up with your friends.

(SLURRING) Have I told you
that we're all friends again?

Yes, Peter, we were just talking about it.

They're gonna take me to the zoo
and roll me around.

We're all friends again.

-Peter...
-No, no, Lois, l-l-let's get it all out.

I'm sure you also heard
that someone walked into my office

while I was sucking on my own toes.

And do I go fast-walking in nurse's shoes
every Saturday in the park?

Yes, I do.

Peter, we're not here
because of any of that.

Okay, I know what this is about.

Somebody saw me holding hands with a guy
at Quiznos this morning.

All right, and was I involved
in the Oklahoma City bombing?

A little bit.

No, Peter, you're not getting it.

Okay, we'll go deeper.

Yeah, I was swindled by that cat
who said he was from the future.

Turns out he was just a present-day cat
with a smooth sales pitch.

Dad, you don't understand.

Oh, I understand.

I understand I've made
hundreds of deadly enemies

by shouting racial taunts
up at the jailhouse windows.

Oh, and another thing,

raise your hand

And up it goes! Peter's the only one.

Peter, that's not why they're here.

A-And no, none of us heard about
you soiling yourself at work.

Oh... Well, why is everybody here?

Peter, your mother is dead.

She had a stroke
this afternoon and she died.

You don't die from that, Lois.

You just host New Year's Eve
and talk funny.

Peter, it's true. I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God...

I don't believe it.

She's gone?

All right, well, I'm gonna go

I just, I just can't believe
she's really gone.

And I can't believe this funeral home
has a skylight

with a sinister clown staring down at us.

Thank you for coming, everyone.

We're here to celebrate
the life of Thelma Griffin.

Here to say a few words about Thelma
is her son, Peter.

My mother always hoped to be buried
with her pet cat, Mittens,

so I'd like to thank
the Quahog Veterinary Society

for putting Mittens down so quickly.

Yeah, just-just go ahead
and toss it in there.

P-Probably, probably just
stuff it in by the feet.

Okay, I will now take questions
from the audience.

No? None? They don't
have to be about my mom.

Is anyone else here watching <i>Revolution</i>
and wanting to talk about it after this?

No! No! No! No!
I'm not caught up! I'm not caught up!

Lotta white socks
with dress shoes in this bitch.

God, I hate funerals.

Yeah, they're stupid.
Thank God I'm not going to die.

What do you mean? Of course you are.

I'm not gonna die, Brian.
I'm like Jim Belushi.

I am worried about
my funny brother, though.

Food fight!

(GROANS)

This is tragic,
but will also open a door for me.

Stewie, everyone is gonna die
at some point. Everyone.

So like... Even me?

Yes, even you.
You are going to die someday, Stewie.

Wow... I guess you learn
something new everyday.

Like the Black Eyed Peas.

Hey, what's that?

This is a guitar.

Wow...

Oh, Peter, look,
your mom's old photo albums.

Oh, look at your little baby footprints.

Yeah, my mom took my footprint
every single year.

When I was eight, I was a dragon.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, hello. You must be Cocoon.

We don't have any rocks to make
you stronger here, but welcome.

(LAUGHING) You must be Peter.

I'm Evelyn, a friend of your mother's.

Oh, oh, hi. This is my family.
They're of no comfort.

Oh... I know it's tough
what you're going through.

You're where I was 17 years ago,
when I lost my husband, Walter.

He died of pancreatic cancer.

That sounds sad, but I didn't know him.

Man, I miss my mom so much.

Well, I knew your mother
better than anyone.

I could tell you stories...

Well, that sounds nice.

Peter, the two of you
should hang out together.

I'd like that very much.

Well, it's 4:00. I'm off to bed.

Wow, Peter, looks like
you made a new friend.

Yeah, a-and maybe she can be my new mom,

you know, just like Greg Evigan
and Paul Reiser were briefly my two dads.

I keep forgetting your names.

Can you just be "Jew Dad"
and you'll be "Earring Dad?"

Stewie, could you please
stop tossing and turning?

It's hard enough to sleep in here
without my memory foam pillow.

Uh... Don't tell me, don't tell me...

-Brian!
-Yep.

Yeah...

I can't go to sleep, Brian. I'm scared!

-Of what?
-Of death!

Well, you're not alone.

The world is full of people
who can't accept death.

And they've all got their own ideas
of what happens when we die.

Really? Like what?

Tell me, are any of them
blindly reassuring?

Look, it's late.
We'll talk about it first thing tomorrow.

Geez, you know, I gotta say,

it's weird to see you
so worked up about this.

I mean, you're not afraid of anything.

Even that monster in your closet.

Ah, he's on his way out of here.

Ever since he violated
the section of his lease

that doesn't allow subletters.

What are you talking about?
I don't have anyone else in here.

Just tell him the truth, Ethan.

Thank you for doing this, Brian.

No problem, Stewie.

Our first stop today
is a Jewish synagogue.

Wow, every brick in this place
is named after someone.

Yeah, they do that to honor their donors.

So that side of the building
was donated by someone named,

"Get Out of Our Town"?

No, I-I-I think that was the work of some
shaved-headed gentlemen,

but, but we're here to talk about Judaism.

So, where do they think
they go when they die?

Well, you should try asking the rabbi.

Although, I should warn you,
you might not get an answer.

So, where do Jewish people
think they go when they die?

Where do you think we go?

Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

Why do you think
you're asking all these questions?

I-I just, I just really
want to know what happens.

Do you think that's
part of God's infinite plan?

I think your whole religion is a sham,

just so you can get
extra holidays off from work.

Oop, gotta go. It's Buchwuch.

I say, this is quite impressive.

Buddhism is an Asian religion

that also has a significant following
of annoying white people.

Okay.

See, these guys believe that
after you die, you're reincarnated

and you come back
as a pig or a cow or a rooster.

Okay, okay, that's good.

I already know what noises
to make if I'm one of those.

But they also don't believe
in demonstrating emotions either way,

so they're the worst people
to buy birthday gifts for.

I know you've been having
trouble getting around,

so I bought you a new Lexus.

And I got you this tie clip.

Thank you both. These are equal to me.

Screw you! You don't even own a tie!

Now, the Catholics believe that as long
as you accept Jesus before you die,

anyone can get into Heaven.

Really? Anyone?

I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior!

Yes!

Peter, thank you so much
for your help in making this cake,

but don't you think it would be easier
if you stood on the floor?

Yeah, but when I baked with my mom,
I always stood on a chair.

Another memory is my Uncle Roy
putting his thumb in me.

Ah, the best memories are family memories.

Oh, hey, Evelyn, I got a riddle for you.

What newspaper do cows read?

The <i>Moo York Times.</i>

That's very clever, Peter.
Did you make that up?

Nah, I got it off a yogurt.

Still, very impressive.

God, you know, Evelyn,

you've really helped me
through a tough time.

I haven't been this grateful
since I met the Sane Hatter.

Excuse me. How do I get back
through the looking glass?

Oh, yeah, take two lefts
and it's the first door on your right.

Cool. Great.
Thanks for not giving me the runaround.

I-I asked that guy over there,

but he just told me
a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

Oh, yeah. He's, like, a well-known dick.

What are you still doing awake?

Changing the oil in my car!
What the hell do you think I'm doing?

Sorry, I stole that
from the Italian family next door.

They've been going at it all night.

GIRL: Dad, can I have $5
for lunch tomorrow?

MAN: Yeah, sure, just let me just go check
my room full of gold and jewels.

You see, every first thing
he says is not the real thing.

Anyway, Brian,
I'm trying to figure out death!

It's not that complicated, Stewie.

Well, which of these religions
has the right answer?

What-What about you, Brian?
What do you believe happens when you die?

Nothing. Lights out. That's it.

That's not comforting at all!

Well, I just think it's pretty clear

that we're all just bags
of bones and flesh

that eventually break down
and decay into worm food.

We come from nothing,
and we're gonna become nothing.

The end. Night, Stewie.

Lights out.

Did you hear him, Rupert?

Life is just a big joke.

It's just sitting around waiting to die.

Well, I can't live like that.

I'd rather just end it.

I'm going to take my own life.

But first,
I'm gonna play ball in the house.

(GASPS) Parents are right!

I've been dying to introduce
you guys to Evelyn.

We've just been having

Evelyn, tell them how many sodas
I combined at the movie theater.

-Two.
-It was more than that. She fell asleep.

She let me drive

But you were a good little navigator.

Yeah, I just remembered,
I gotta get the hell out of here.

I was saving it
for Susie's wedding day, but...

Your friends seem lovely.

Ah, they a'ight.

You know, Evelyn,
I am having such a good time with you.

You're like my aboveground mom.

Oh, Peter, you know, sometimes
I think your mother brought us together.

Yeah, tha-that's how I feel.

Good.

(WHIMPERING)

<i>(THE PRICE IS RIGHT</i> THEME PLAYS)

Come on. Are you molesting me
or watching TV?

I can't believe that old woman kissed you!

Oh, it was horrible, Lois.

There were still crumbs
in the corners of her mouth

from that Nilla Wafer she had at lunch.

Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

No, no, those were
definitely Nilla Wafers.

And it really bums me out, you know,

'cause I thought she was
something special.

She was like a mom to me.

Well, then you should go talk to her
and try to clear this up.

It sounds weird,
but maybe it was innocent.

I mean, this wouldn't be the first time
you thought someone was hitting on you.

Would you like to add chips and a drink?

Here we go again.

All right, Rupert, here we go.

Well, I'm not dead, but I do have a boner.

So that is something new about Stewie.

Okay, death by cop.

Hey, copper, come get me!

(FLATLY) Oh, no, an armed assailant.

I definitely don't want to die today.
I have so much to live for.

Come on! Shoot me!

The one day I don't wear
my bulletproof vest!

What are you waiting for? I'm wide open!

Don't you hate how the heart
is right about here?

Just kiss, you fruitcakes!

All right, Rupert,
the old toaster in the tub never fails.

(GASPING, SHUDDERING)

Oh, damn, I wanted to die,
not turn into Toaster Man.

I don't know about this Toaster Man.

is left to clean up the crumbs.

(GASPS) My breakfast bread
just got perfectly browned!

I just wish I could thank him!

Oh, I think he knows, Pop.

I think he knows.

Evelyn, we need to talk.

Oh, Peter, I owe you an apology.

I'm afraid my new medicine
made me act foolishly yesterday.

-You must forgive me.
-Oh.

So it-it was,
it was just your medicine, huh?

Well, I guess I can understand that.

You know, I'm addicted to nasal spray.

I smell everything! I'm invincible!

(PANTING)

I'm probably gonna be a little down
until I use the spray again.

That's okay, Peter. Now come along.

I've got quite the day planned for us.

Evelyn, I think it's best
that we don't see each other anymore.

But Peter...

No, Evelyn, I trusted you,

and all this funny business
keeps happening,

and I don't think
it's your medicine at all.

So I'm afraid this is goodbye.

But Peter, I thought we were friends.

Yeah, right. You tricked me!

You're as bad as those predators
on the Internet.

That's wild, Stacey.
I'm a 12-year-old girl, too.

My name's Jenny.

Want to come over to my place
and help me move?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, you're not a 12-year-old girl!

Neither are you, Jenny!

Huh. I guess
we aren't so different after all.

Yeah. You know,
this isn't a whole lot of stuff.

We can probably knock this out in an hour.

What the hell?

Stewie, what the hell are you doing?

MAN: He's doing his taxes!
What's it look like he's doing?

WOMAN: Vito, get away
from the neighbors' house!

I'm killing myself, Brian.

You said it yourself,
when we die, there's nothing!

We just rot in the ground!

Well, if life has no purpose,
why not just cut to the chase?

Look, Stewie, I know you're worried,

but you can't live your life
being scared of death.

Nobody knows what comes next,

so all we can do is pack the most we can
into each day we've got.

So for you, that's taking

a 45-minute shaky-leg poop
on the front lawn?

I'm just saying there's something
to be said for living in the moment.

So what you're saying is
I've got to find my shaky-leg poop.

Exactly.

Well, I-I have always wanted
to be a singer-songwriter.

Um... Yeah. No, yeah, you could do that.

You-you paused. Why-why did you pause?

Uh... No reason.

You did it again! I swear to God,
I will throw myself right out that window!

Okay, welcome to the Apple Tree Pub.

-I'm Stewie Griffin, and these...

Hey, Mom, I-I gotta talk
to you about something.

You know, ever since you turned
into a rock with your name on it,

your friend's been
really inappropriate with me.

Hello, Peter.

Oh. Hi.

What are you doing here?

Peter, I want to apologize.

I did behave inappropriately.

It's just that since
my beloved Walter died,

you're the first man
who's paid any attention to me,

and I guess I took advantage of that.

Huh.

Well, you know,
when-when you put it that way,

I guess maybe it's a little bit
my fault, too.

I missed my mom so much,

and I guess maybe
I sort of used you as a replacement.

I'm glad we became friends, Evelyn.

JOHN WAYNE: Saddle my horse.

John Wayne only ate beef
and coffee for every meal,

so the director had to shoot
around the fact

that he was on the toilet all the time.

Yee-hoo! Yee-hoo!

Reach for the sky, pilgrims.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

Big Bill Doyle!

That's right.

And I just made a Big Bill coil.

Damn it, I'm so angry

the stupid Pats lost.

And to Buffalo!

Buffalo's got everything.

They don't need a win like this.

You know, I am gonna channel this anger
into something useful.

Like trying to get sand
out of my backpack.

(YELLING)

It's been four years
since I went to the beach!

Try turning it inside out.

Don't you think I tried that?

That's the first thing I did!

ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) <i>We now return</i>
<i>to the Fox NFL Post-Game Show.</i>

I'm here with C.J. Spiller.

C.J., you ran for 200 yards today.

How did you manage that
against the Patriots' defense?

Well, we just gelled as a team today,

and was fortunate
to come away with the win.

All thanks and praise goes to God.

He really won this one for us.

Mario Williams, you scored
the winning touchdown.

How does it feel to beat the Patriots?

I'd like to thank God
and a jury of my peers,

who are both responsible for
me being able to play today.

What the hell? This is such bull crap!

-Well, what are you talking about?
-Isn't it obvious?

God hates the Patriots.

He made 'em lose again!

Peter, uncross your legs.

It's weird to yell with your legs crossed.

Come on, don't you notice that
whenever the Patriots lose,

the other team always thanks God?

Huh. Peter does kind of have a point.

Guys, I'm tired of God
messing with football.

We got to do something about it!

Like what?

We got to find God
and tell him to cut the crap.

How many times
is God gonna ruin our Sunday

with both church and bad football?

It's time someone told God
to stay where He belongs,

in our schools,

and... And telling people where
they can stick their wieners.

Now, what do you say?

Let's go find God!

-All right, I'm in!
-Me, too!

Let's do this!

Whoa, whoa, Joe, Joe! What the hell?

What?

I thought, uh, "Find God" was a code word.

No. We meant literally go and find him.

Oh. Well, I already texted Bonnie.

(PHONE BUZZES)

(GLASS BREAKING)

(EXPLOSION THUNDERS)

Ugh. What a night.

Whew! What a night.

Ca-ray-zy.

Uh, yes, telegram for hungover.

Yes, I'll... I'll sign for that,
thank you very much.

Oh, boy. (SIGHS)

How was your night, Stewie?

Ugh! Get your own life, bro.

Get off my sack.

Well, Lois, the guys and I
are off to find God.

Peter, that's ridiculous.

This is ridiculous?

There's 500 old grocery bags neatly folded

and crammed into one of our cabinets.

I'm leaving those for the kids.

Peter, the idea of God, let alone

that he'd care anything
about football, is absurd.

Well, it's absurd to think that
my hand scratching on the couch

is some kind of animal, but you do.

What the (BLEEP) is that?

Okay, this is God's house,
so we'll just go in there,

talk to Him, and take care
of this whole thing.

It'll be easy as one, two...

(INAUDIBLE)

(BRITISH ACCENT) Three.

Hang on, guys.

I want to enter the church
like Sherman Hemsley in <i>Amen.</i>

There was a baby's funeral
going on in there.

Huh. God's all over this Bible,

but they never give you an exact address.

You guys, look.

I saw this article in the paper today.

"First Headline Read Aloud
Often Incorrect."

No, no, not that one, the one below it.

Oh. "Carrie Underwood Credits Her Success

"to Personal Relationship With God."

You think she knows where we can find Him?

I'm sure she does.

She's smart. She won her job in a contest.

Guys, we are going to Nashville.

<i>Don't worry.</i><i>That wasn't our line.</i>

<i>Here comes our line.</i>

Wow, the Country Music Awards!

And you know it's huge 'cause
it's on a Tuesday night.

Hey, look, there's Taylor Swift.

And there's Taylor Not-So-Swift.

<i>I broke up with a birthday cake</i>

Ugh. We went on, like, two dates.

Hey, you're Carrie Underwood, right?

I sure am. You want an autograph?

Yeah, can you get me Randy Travis's?

Uh, I don't think so.

Hey, in that song, <i>Jesus, Take the Wheel,</i>

was that, like, the real Jesus,
or was it just some Mexican guy?

No, it was the real Jesus.

Wow. So, you know Him?

We're actually looking for His father.

Do you know where we can find God?

Well, God is everywhere.

He's in our hearts, and we take
Him with us wherever we go.

Yeah, we're looking for, like, an address.

Look, you guys, I don't know who you are,

but I have to go perform.

Peter, I don't think
she knows where God is.

Let's go.

Hey, you know I don't like
you talking to other guys.

-I'm sorry, Jesus.
-Whatever.

Give me 40 bucks.
I want to get a Toby Keith hat.

You sure you don't want
to stay for the show?

Nah. This place gives me the creeps.

Like when I went to that Pedophile Opera.

OPERA ANNOUNCER: <i>We are proud to present</i>
<i>Mozart's</i> The Magic Flute

<i>in A minor.</i>

And you still won't give us an Emmy?
Come on!

If <i>Modern Family</i> did that joke,

you'd be carrying 'em around
on your shoulders!

Well, God wasn't in Nashville either.

Maybe it's time to throw in the towel.

All right, look, maybe I'm
not like other football fans,

but I don't have a fulfilling
career and a rich family life.

-Football is all I got.
-Peter's right.

We all live and die with the Patriots.

Yeah, we got to do this.

Even if it means travelling
to the ends of the Earth.

That's the spirit, guys. We'll find him.

It can't be any harder
than finding that cheese.

I think the cheese is that way.

I'm pretty sure it's over here.

Guys, guys, finding the cheese
is what they want us to do.

Let's just chill.

I don't know where they're
getting all this weed.

"In Greece, it was commonly held
that one could speak to the gods

"from the top of Mount Olympus."

We should probably go there.

What do you mean "gods"?
There's more than one?

Yes, Peter. Greece is polytheistic.

PETER: <i>Quick, Peter, say something</i>
<i>so he thinks you know</i>

<i>what he's talking about.</i>

Words.

Yeah, you get it.

Apparently, the Greeks have
a bunch of different gods.

Athena's the goddess of wisdom.

Poseidon is the god of the sea.

And I am Chronos, the god of time.

Oh, cool, what do you do?

I tell the time and make gift baskets.

So are you also the god of gift baskets?

I don't know, you tell me.

Rosewood-mango candle?

Chronos!

I know, I know.

It's 4:30, by the way.

(TIRES SCREECH)

All right, what better place
to find God than the birthplace

of all of Western civilization's
great religions and one really mean one.

I had a feeling this is
what this place would be like.

-Oh, God, it's so hot out.
-Why is there never any parking downtown?

-Who gets married on a Tuesday?
-I got to get off these bad feet.

Ailments!

Oh, look, Joe's feeding 'em pennies.

Oh, oh! Somebody take a picture.

I can't believe we didn't
find God in Jerusalem.

Well, we'll have to keep looking.

Oh, here's our bus to the airport.

(COUGHING) Wow.

(CHUCKLES) That was super loud.

Ah, India, the most spiritual
country in the world.

(HORNS HONKING, ENGINES RUMBLING)

(BELL TINKLES)

God is not here.

Well, that whole trip was pointless.

Yeah, plus I left my Jacuzzi on
the whole time,

came home to a boiled raccoon.

You guys, I feel terrible.

I'm sorry I dragged you around
the world looking for God.

I guess it was a huge waste of time.

Like bringin' a married guy to Vegas.

-So I'm thinking steak house.
-Do they have salad? I can't eat red meat.

-Yeah. Then we hit the tables.
-I'm already down 30 bucks.

-Maybe the sportsbook.
-Is that near Caesars?

I got to get Brandy a Celine Dion T-shirt.

-And then the strip club.
-Guys, we have a 7:00 a.m. tee time.

And are we just gonna bail
on the Hoover Dam?

Hey, guys.

Hey, Death. What are you doing here?

Actually, I'm here for your show.

Oh, come on, man. I'm on vacation.

Wait a minute, Death, you work with God!

Will you take us to Him?

Sure, I guess I could.

But don't you mean "her"?

(LAUGHS) Look at your faces!

Of course it's a dude. Come on, let's go.

Aw, Death, we really appreciate
you taking us to see God.

No problem.

I was supposed to kill Russell Brand,

but I'll just do this instead.

Oh, well, wait, wait now.

I mean, you could just pick us up after...

What the... Where the hell are we?

-This is Heaven.
-This is Heaven?

It looks like a Sandals.

Oh, hey, I'm God. Welcome to Heaven.

Oh, you got to be kidding me!

Handicapped is still a thing up here?

Oh, yeah, you're like this forever.

Hey, how come everyone
has different kinds of towels?

Well, we don't provide towels,
you have to bring your own.

It's very important
that you die holding towels.

Have the priests
not been passing this along?

It's very important.

You know, I actually can't
believe they let me into Heaven.

They won't even let me umpire
little league games anymore.

Strike two!

And, Ricky, you have got
the best ass on this field.

Look, God, the reason we're
here is we wanted to tell you

to stop messing with the Patriots!

(LAUGHS) What?

You really think I'd get
involved with football games

when there's people dying in Africa?

Are you gonna do something about
the people dying in Africa?

No, but I'm pretty upset about it.

Come off it, God,
you know what you're doing.

Stop making the Patriots lose!

I'm God. I don't have to do anything.

Ah, so you admit it!

Maybe.

Oh, my God, it's true?

You don't, like, pay attention

to how much each individual tips
at each meal, right?

Look, look, God, why...
Why you got to hurt Patriots fans?

These are good, drunk people

who work hard to get
absolutely nowhere in life.

There are three million fishermen

and only seven fish left in the sea.

But they live to watch football,

many of them still on Zenith
or Sylvania television sets.

Please, God, we're beggin' ya,

leave football alone.

It's all we got.

(SIGHS)

Look, it... It's not the fans.

It's just... It's Belichick.

I don't like him.

I gave that guy three Super Bowls,
and he never smiled once.

Not even at home. Be grateful!

But... But that's just Belichick.

Yeah, come on, God.

Um, I'm locked out of my room again.

Oh, yeah, go directly to the boss.

Don't even try to ask an employee.

You got to lock the doors in Heaven?

One guy lost a laptop,
and everybody went nuts.

All right, all right, I'll tell you what.

If you make Belichick smile,
I'll let the Patriots win again.

Oh. Okay, you're on.

I don't know, Peter,
that's gonna be tough.

Don't worry, I got a lot of
practice making people smile.

I used to be a celebrity
baby photographer.

Okay, Apple, Apple, smile for Peter.

Smile for... No? No?

Okay, okay, look over there.
Who's that? Who's that?

Who loves you over there? That's right.

Can you smile for Nanny Number Two?

-(GIGGLES) That's it!
-There you go.

And your mommy said that
she'll be able to Skype at 8:30

if drinks don't turn into dinner.

Okay, okay, shh, here he comes.

Hiya, Mr. Belichick!

Who the hell are you? What do you want?

We are here to make you smile.

And if there's one thing
that always gets me to smile,

it's a child's laughter.

So, I found this kid in the parking lot,

and I'm gonna make him laugh for you.

Come on, laugh.

Who's your bubba?
Wudgie, wudgie, wudgie, wudgie.

(MONOTONE) Don't touch my son's face.

Get over here, little man.

This flight is cleared for liftoff.

Vroom. Liftoff.

(MONOTONE) Whee.

-Who's flying?
-Whee.

-You're flying.
-Again.

Who's daddy's little jet?

I love you, Daddy.

Oh, God, you guys again?

All right, Coach,
another surefire equation

for comedy is tragedy plus time.

(YELLING)

And now we wait.

All right, Coach, now one
thing that's always funny is

when I dub my voice over animal footage

and introduce human foibles
into their situations.

PETER'S VOICE: <i>Tough day at the bank?</i>

PETER'S VOICE: (DEEPER)
<i>No. Just had a bad lunch.</i>

<i>What did you have?</i>

<i>Serengeti and meatballs.</i>

(GIGGLING) How absurd!

Look, you guys have been
following me around all day

making fools out of yourselves.

Would you just leave me alone?

I've got work to do.

Oh, guys, I guess we failed.

Sorry for wasting your time, Coach.

We got to get to the hospital anyway.

Our friend Joe here has
to have his fluids changed every 72 hours,

or else he swells up and
his eyes turn yellow.

-BELICHICK: Huh.
-What was that?

Oh, my God, Joe, quick!

Tell him more about your sad life.

Uh, every morning, I wake up
drenched in my own urine.

My feet are just shoes sewn
to the bottom of my pants.

Last week, the handicapped seat
on the bus was taken,

so they put me on the front,
like a bicycle.

After I injured my legs,

my doctor said I'd be walking
again in two weeks.

(MONOTONE) Huh. That's hysterical.

Oh, my God, yes!

-All right! All right! He smiled!
-We did it!

Aw, man, this is my biggest accomplishment

since my 1920s solo flight
across the Atlantic.

(CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)

<i>Vive</i> Pierre Griffin!

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Don't look in there.

Don't look in there. It's all craps.

All right, we got to put toilets
in these things

if we're gonna be in 'em
for more than two hours.

Wow. You guys pulled it off.

Well, a deal's a deal.

I'll leave the Patriots alone.

Oh, thanks, God!

-Yeah!
-Really appreciate it.

Aw, come here, you! (LAUGHS)

Ah, ah, ah! Get off me!

-Get off me!
-What the hell?

God's mildly autistic.

You can't touch Him,
especially on the head.

It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

Just... Just... Just don't do that!

Sorry about that.

Well, uh, again, thanks.

We won't forget this.

Oh, by the way,

Conway Twitty says cut it out.

Just write a joke.

Well, Peter, I'm glad you're home,

and I'm happy you guys found
what you were looking for.

Yeah, and this trip made me
realize that 98% of the world

is just making each other blankets.

So, Brian, you still an atheist
now that Dad's met God?

Stewie, who knows who he met?

Every time we go to Disney World,

he thinks Mickey Mouse just
happened to be there that day.

I'll tell ya, seeing God in
Heaven was just like that time

I met Mickey and Donald
outside Thunder Mountain.

I mean, what are the odds?

But, Peter, I still don't understand why

you would go to all that trouble

to find God and only ask
about the Patriots.

Oh, I asked for one more thing.

Ahhh! What's happening?

Don't look at her. Don't look at her.

It's okay. Just go with it.

It'll all be over in a second.

Hello, Tree. Thank you for shade.

Hello, Mountain Cat.

Thank you for controlling
local rat population.

Hello, Windmill.

Thank you for the cheese ride
and ball cooling.

Next week, bullet trains.

Hello!

Hey, Dad. Are you busy?

I was thinking we could
spend some time together.

Okay, are you a television set
or the Internet?

-No.
-Oh, then no. No, thank you.

Are you sure?

'Cause there's a
three-day weekend coming up

and I thought maybe you and
I could finally go fishing

like we've been talking about.

Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.

(YELLING HYSTERICALLY)

Pinwheels! Pinwheels in my head!

Voices! Angry fish!

-How's he doing?
-Not good.

He still thinks this is
"practice" of some sort.

But you promised we'd go fishing.

Aw, Chris, I was just lying
to you so you'd go away.

But, if you leave me alone now,
I'll give you a billion dollars.

You've got a deal!

Peter, you know, it might help Chris

to be able to spend
some time with his father.

Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?

He's your son.

Don't you want someone to bond with?

No. I only form unspoken bonds.

Okay.

I'll talk to you later. Bye.

You guys, that was my mom.

She said that Daddy broke his leg.

How?

Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.

Carter, please stop doing that.

We need to get you some new corduroys.

No! None of the other boys
are wearing corduroys!

I want dungarees!

You're going to get hurt doing that.

No I'm not! I'm the champ at doing this!

Ow! You jinxed me!

Aw, damn it!

Hey, call that beeping cart
that carries around the fat black people.

Well, I guess Babs has
her work cut out for her.

Actually, Mom can't take care
of him, she's out of town

doing a photo shoot
for the cover of <i>Veins Magazine.</i>

So, are you gonna go
take care of him, Mom?

I can't go. I've got to go get
my hair very minutely changed

and then spend the next 14 hours
trying to get people to notice.

Well...

Lois, move. You're blocking the TV.

(LAUGHS) What do you think?

I think you're blocking the TV.

Peter, is there anything
you want to say to me?

(SIGHS) All right. Amy at work kissed me.

It is true that I did not step away,
but I did not lean in.

However, in my defense,

she had recently gotten
her hair done differently.

I was actually thinking that
maybe you could go help Daddy.

Well, not me, Mom.

Last time I was at Grandpa's,

I beat him at checkers and he
punched one of my hogans.

Well, what about Chris?

(STAMMERS) Wait, where is Chris?

He's upstairs in his room.

That's odd. He never misses a meal.

I'd better go check on him.

Yeah, good idea.

I'd better check on my
hairless twin in the storm shed.

Close the door, the moonlight burns!

It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.

Christmas?

Yes. Keep being good

and all the eggshells
and coffee grounds will be yours.

Can I meet the family?

You've overstepped! No Christmas!

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

Hey, Chris. Are you okay?

Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.

Those are my farts.

Why doesn't Dad ever want
to spend time with me?

Chris, come here.

Sit down.

You know I love you, right, sweetie?

Mom, not in front of my posters.

And your father loves you, too.

He just has trouble
expressing his emotions.

PETER: I love <i>Mike & Molly!</i>

I love Mike and I also love Molly!

And I don't care who knows it!

You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa

who could use your help right now.

I'm sure he'd enjoy
spending time with you.

Okay, I'll give it a shot.

You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?

That would be a severe black
mark on my record as a mom.

Oh, I'd have to make up stories
of a severe mental illness.

Make it seem a miracle
you made it this long.

I could do that.

Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.

How you been doing?

Well, let me tell you, this is awful.

I... I'm so bored.

I can't sleep, I...
I just have to lie here

and wait for my stupid leg to heal.

Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.

And the worst part about
it is, I can't have sex.

God! I wish there was a way
I could just do it myself.

You know, just-just to be done
and napping within four minutes.

Let me show you something.

That

was

amazing!

And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?

No! That was just in your mind.

Incredible!

So... So you can do that, like,
what, once a year or something?

No. You can do it basically
whenever you're not doing something else.

Cool!

Hey, next time I want to
try it with my hand.

Hey, Grandpa. What should we do now?

You want to order a pizza?

That doesn't sound very exciting.

But now you can follow your order online!

There it is. It's on Van Buren!

Oh. Oh. He's almost here!

-Wow, he's really fast.
-Hey, I got an idea,

let's put in two different
orders and have 'em race!

(GASPS) You think it'll crash the system?

Only one way to find out.

Here's your pizza. That's $16.50.

We were playing a game with you.

That's what you are. You're a clown.

Are you gonna pay for the pizza?

Yes. Your money is in
this pile of mashed potatoes.

Eat your way out. No hands.

(MUNCHING, MOANING)

This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.

Don't look up. You're not a part of this.

(PLAYING ROCK MUSIC)

It's sounding really good, Grandpa.

I know, I know.

Sorry I'm late.

Look, Jason, are you
taking this seriously?

Because Chris and I take this seriously.

You know, if you're not
gonna show up to rehearsal,

we'll find someone else
who will, all right?

-We want to get some paying gigs!
-Sorry. Geez.

Remember, this is about writing music
that means something to us!

Okay, from the top.

<i>Halls Mentho-lyptus</i>

<i>You can feel it in your nose</i>

<i>That's how you know</i>
<i>it's a medicated cough drop</i>

<i>And not just a candy</i>

Hey, can we play one of my songs?

No! No one wants to hear
your stupid songs about nothing!

Now, let's play <i>I Fell in the Shower,</i>
<i>So Maybe We Do Need That Bar.</i>

Five, six, seven, eight!

Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you

for coming to take care of me
and helping me get well again.

-Oh, it was no big deal.
-Well, it is to me,

and I want to give you some
money for all your time.

(SCOFFS) Come on,
you don't have to do that.

I just like getting to spend time
with my grandpa, you know?

I... Wait, wait, what?

You're... You're not gonna take the money?

No, I don't want your money.

I had fun hanging out with you.

Well, all right, then.

Hey, Grandpa, check it out.

When I make my elbow like this,

it looks like women's private parts!

(LAUGHS) Oh, Chris!

You just have a way of looking at things
that's delightfully fresh!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

We're not supposed to be doing this.

I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.

Daddy! You're all better!

That's right, pumpkin. And I have
an important announcement to make.

I have decided to change my will

and name my grandson Chris

the sole heir
to the Pewterschmidt fortune.

-You what?
-What?

(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)

Oh, no! My hairless twin got out!

(GUNSHOT)

Hello, family.

Let's eat all the garbage we want.

Daddy, you're seriously leaving
your entire estate to Chris?

I... I mean, what about Mom?

I promise she'll be dead
before I am. I promise.

But, Grandpa, I don't even want the money.

See? This is exactly
why you should get it!

So refreshing!

Well, I... I don't want it, either.

Good, 'cause you're not getting it.

Come on, what are you doing?

Listen, Carter, you take
me out of your will,

I'm taking you out of mine.

Peter, that wasn't your will,
that was your birth certificate.

Oh, no!

(GASPS)

There's no light!

There's only fire!

Look, Carter, I suppose
you're entitled to do what you want,

but, you know, I'm just
saying, if it were me,

I would give all the money to charity.

Oh, yeah? Which charity?

Well, there are just so many
that do such great work.

Name just one.

Um, well, you know...

Poor... Green...

Whale... Guns...

Books?

You are such a fraud.

Why won't anyone help us?

What the hell? I can't believe your dad's
giving all his cash to Chris!

I know it's strange,
but in the end it's his money,

so who really cares?

Well, yeah, but...

But what?

Peter, did you marry me for my money?

Of course not, Lois,
but even you can't deny

it was always gonna be a huge perk.

-Did I use that right? Perk?
-Yes, Peter.

Yeah, I thought so, but then it just
sounded kind of weird when I said it.

-It was fine.
-Thanks.

Anyway, I don't plan on losing out
on any of that money.

So if you ask me, we got to start sucking
up to Chris right away.

What? What are you talking about?

I'm talking about brownnosing Chris
and getting on his good side perk.

No, that's wrong. No "perk."

Okay, my bad. But I've been
counting on that money, Lois.

It's always been critical
to my master plan.

What master plan?

Look, I never told you this, but,

for years now, I've been
planning on retiring at 45

so I can work on
finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.

Peter, are those testicles?

Where did you get those?

(CRYING) I don't remember!

Hey, hey, there he is!

Oh, boy, hot dogs and Nintendo,
huh, Chris?

Dad, what are you doing? What's going on?

(LAUGHS) Good one, Chris!

(LAUGHING)

-Good one!
-Why are you dressed like that?

I don't know. I... I just kind of felt
like this is what cool people wear.

Hey, hey, Chris, how about you
and me do a secret handshake

that has way too many steps
to remember, all right?

Okay. Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook,

pretend to slick your hair back,
represent, bump,

one spin, slap high, slap low,

reverse spin, bump, explode,
shake, belly rub,

fake yawn, finger gun,
hitchhiker, hitchhiker,

shimmy shimmy sham sham,
shake, shake, shake, bump,

something smells and shake again.

Okay, ready?

Oh, my God, it's nighttime.

MAN: (ON TV) <i>We now return to the</i>
<i>director's cut of</i> Mission: Impossible 5,

<i>with the step stools not edited out.</i>

You're coming with me
because I'm definitely over six feet,

and you're not handsome.

Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid
you said was bullying you at school?

Well, here's his head!

(SCREAMING)

That's not even him!

That's the deaf kid!

Oh, that was sign language.

I thought he was trying to defend himself
with terrible karate.

Chris, I want to share with you
a timeworn father-son tradition.

I am gonna show you a film comedy
from my youth that won't hold up.

Welcome to the classic comedy, <i>Meatballs.</i>

Oh, that sounds great.

Is it about a pasta factory or something?

No, that's part of the joke.

Who's the guy?

That's not a guy. That's the hot chick!

Where are her boobs?

Flat with a decent face was the best
we could hope for back then.

Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger
at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.

This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.

All right, you know what? Forget it!

I'm just gonna take my VCR,
my VCR head-cleaning tape,

my VCR head-cleaning spray,
my head-cleaning rag,

and my rewinder, and just
get the hell out of here.

MAN: (ON TV) We now return
to <i>At the Movies</i>

<i>with Two Guys Who Watch</i>
<i>the Films on Their iPhones.</i>

Good evening. First off, we're going

to review Paul Greengrass'
<i>Captain Phillips.</i>

What did you think, Bill?

Well, it got off to a great start,

<i>but when it was my turn to</i>
<i>play Words with Friends,</i>

it really took me out of it.

Well, that's a shame, because visually...

-(PHONE WHOOSHES)

ANNOUNCER: <i>When we come back, the guys</i>
<i>will review</i> American Hustle.

Hmm?

Hey, you guys.

Geez, Peter, you look exhausted.

Ugh, I am. I've been busting my ass

for the last week trying
to suck up to Chris.

To Chris? What the hell for?

Well, Carter kind of decided

he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.

So I've been trying to
get on his good side.

I even cleaned his room
for him the other day.

Wish I hadn't done that.

Chris, our bath is ready.

I, uh...

I don't... I don't know what to do now.

I... I don't have the parenting skills
necessary to deal with this.

I say we never speak of this again.

I... I might move.

You know what? I say, good for Chris

and whatever lucky girl
he ends up marrying.

Yeah, or lucky guy,
if he ends up being gay.

Lucky guy?

Wait a minute.

You guys just gave me an idea!

(PLAYING TUBA)

(LAUGHS)

What's he doing up there? He's a cat.

He can't play no tuba.

No, wait!

Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!

(SNORING)

Mumbling while I sleep
to indicate dream content.

Chris, Chris, wake up.

I have something very
important to ask you.

Chris, there comes a time when
every man looks at his son

and thinks, "I want to take
this to the next level."

Chris Griffin, will you marry me?

What? Is it even legal
for a man to marry his son?

It is in Vermont.

As long as it's a man and a man,
anything goes up there.

They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.

I don't know. It seems really weird.

I mean, aren't men
supposed to marry women?

No, no, no, that's just
all of human history

except for the last five months.

We'll just be like best pals.

And besides, there's plenty of people
who are married and don't have sex.

Like Will Smith and that pit bull.

Why do you even want to marry me?

It's time to settle down
and simplify things,

like maybe having one ATM card
and one bank account.

Say, yours.

Oh. I get it.

So, what do you say?

When you're married, you get
to spend all your time together,

doing things like playing catch
and going fishing, right?

Well, the best marriages
give each other space, but, yes, Chris.

Then, yes, I will marry you, Dad!

Oh, that's wonderful news!

You should know this ring is very special.

It used to belong to your mother.

Wait. What about Mom?

I'm afraid that's over, Chris.

Lois, wake up.

I need you to sign this legal document.

Huh? (STAMMERS) What is this?

It's a petition to force that hot mom

to wear something appropriate
at PTA meetings.

Oh, thank God.

(CANS RATTLING, TIRES SQUEAKING)

(ENGINE REVVING)

No, Dad.

I don't know what normal is anymore.

So now you know my complete
sexual history, Chris.

Wow. I'm surprised you got
fooled by a bear in a wig.

It wasn't a wig, it was a hair system.

Well, whatever.

Why do we have all these appointments?

Wedding DJ, florist.

Because, Chris, it takes time
to plan a perfect wedding.

You don't want to jump the gun.

You know, like when you
respond to a text too quickly.

(WHOOSHING)

(WHOOSHING)

So, should we get started
with your bridal registry?

Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen
as if I'm the greatest chef in the world,

even though I've never cooked before.

-That's what we do!
-Okay, great.

All right, we'll start with the nine grand
in copper-bottom cookware.

Holy wack-a-zoly!

-Dad!
-What?

Don't "what" me. You know what you did.

Hey, I may be your husband and
your dad, but I'm still a man.

Yeah, we're looking to plan our
post-wedding Sunday breakfast.

-You know, when everyone's sick of us.
-Of course.

Excellent. Do you have
a table for the couple

that barely made it through the weekend
without breaking up?

Absolutely. Can I put them near the couple

that hooked up drunk and now
have to make awkward small talk

until their cab to the airport arrives?

Sure. And maybe they could go next
to the vastly-underdressed cousin

who thinks the world revolves around him?

I have just the spot.

Will there be a physically-frail,
fall-down uncle?

Indeed. And we'd like to have him walk
through a maze of chair legs.

-Anything else?
-Yes.

We did invite a black couple.

Um, even though we only met them
three months ago,

but we would like them
to be prominently featured

to let the other guests know how
tolerant and wonderful we are.

I'm excited for your first dance.

And now we're ready to add music.

What's your song?

You know, I've given it a lot of thought,

and I went with the most
romantic song ever,

<i>Stars and Stripes Forever</i>
by John Philip Sousa.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

March! March! March! March!

Can you feel the soldiers, Chris?

So many have fallen.

And this is why they were fighting.

For a man to marry his son

in a state with enough trees around
that nobody can see what's going on.

(ORGAN PLAYS GENTLE MELODY)

It was nice of the guests at
the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.

Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy
we're getting married on a Thursday.

School, yuck, right?

Welcome, friends, loved ones,

and people who are waiting
for the 3:00 check-in time

with nothing better to do.

Just let us put our bags in there.

I'm literally gonna grab my shorts
and leave.

I understand the two of you
have written your own vows?

Chris, to express my love,

I turn to the words of the only poet
that blue collar,

New England scumbags like me know,
Robert Frost.

"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...

"I took the one less traveled."

Now, I ain't no scholar,
but if that's not a metaphor

for major-league butt stuff,
I don't know what is.

Thank you. Chris?

LOIS: Stop the wedding!

Lois! How did you find out about this?

Peter, several people
have called the police

about a man marrying his son.

It's not normal!

Peter? Peter Griffin?

Oh, God.

Is everyone from your past here
to walk you down the aisle?

Peter, you cannot do this!

You cannot marry your son!

I don't care how much money
Daddy's left him.

Don't listen to your mother, Chris.

It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!

Chris, come on, we're going home!

He can't make you do this.

But, Mom, I want to do this.

What?

I know he's marrying me for my money,
but I don't care.

Dad and I spent more time together
planning this wedding

than we ever have before.

And if being married means

I get to spend even more time with my dad,
then it's worth it.

Wait. You knew all along I just wanted you
for your money?

Yeah, Dad, I did.

Wow.

Oh, boy, I've been a real jerk.

I'm sorry, Chris.

But you know what?

I'm gonna make it up to you,
starting right now.

Chris Griffin, will you be my son?

Yes, Dad.

OMG, the photographer is, like,
obsessed with me.

Well, let's all go home, you guys.

I think we've had enough
excitement for one day.

Yeah, and I guess I learned

it's wrong to take your son to Vermont
under false pretenses

to try to marry him for his inheritance.

You... You should've known that.

Well, we should probably get going.

I think this adventure is over.

PETER: <i>Interestingly, however,</i>
<i>I did run into Chris again.</i>

<i>It was on the Upper West Side</i>
<i>of Manhattan.</i>

<i>He was with another dad.</i>
<i>I was with another son.</i>

Okay, Brian, here we are.

Hey, thanks for fitting in
the ride to school

in between your texts.

Totally, Chris, totally.

I'm sure it'll all work itself out.

And good luck on that thing.

You know, that was a stroller,
not a speed bump.

Uh-oh. This looks like trouble.

I'll know they're bullies
if they use my full name.

Well, look who it is.

Chris Griffin.

Oh, boy.

Hey, fat ass.

Your boobs are bigger than your sister's.

Oh, yeah? Well,

you have a sister as well.

That's your comeback?

(BULLIES LAUGH)

Oh, man!

Oh, my God. Poor Chris.

He's a social outcast like Scarface.

Okay, we have a deal.

You bring the money, I get you the coke.

You got it, Scarface.

Oh, my God!

You can see that?

The doctor said you wouldn't be able to!

Yes, everyone can see that.

That's why we call you Scarface.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! "We"?

Well, I have officially seen
every video ever on YouTube.

Got to say, there's not a bad one.

I need these shipping invoices
filed immediately.

I'll be right back.

There she goes again.

How come she always skips out

when there's work to do?

She's just taking a smoke break.

A deaf person smoking.

That's... That's weird.

Why is that weird?

That... I mean, there's
no reason that that's weird,

but it... It... Itis weird, right?

Yes, Griffin, it's weird.

Wait, so you mean to tell me,
if I ever want to get out

of something, all I got
to do is take a smoke break?

Well, I suppose.

But you don't smoke.

Well, actually I do.

All right, Griffin.

You're clearly a smoker.

Enjoy your break.

Wow, I can use smoking
to get out of anything.

Finally, I'm above the law
like my 14th century ancestor

the King of Denmark Griffin.

More wine! More women!

More table!

(LAUGHING)

(GROANING)

I'm having a heart attack!

Is anyone at the table a doctor?

I am!

Come here! Hurry! Run!

"But the very far-away doctor
couldn't make it in time."

And that's why here in Denmark
we have very small tables.

Okay, Stewie, time to change your diaper.

Ooh! Oh, smoke break!

Well, this is how Scott Caan was raised,
and he turned out okay.

Hey, Dad, want to hear a story
about my day at school?

It's about my hot friend Melissa.

Okay.

She didn't wear a bra to school today.

Okay.

And someone spilled water
all over her white shirt.

Okay.

And it was cold, so you
could see everything.

Okay.

Then she left and I realized
I was all alone...

Smoke break!

Hey, Chris?

I... I wanted to talk about
what happened at school...

Is that a dead gerbil in there?

That's a fur fish.

It's a weird species.

You put them in there,
and they swim like hell

for, like, 30 seconds,
and then they go to sleep.

This joker still hasn't woken up.

Get up, lazy!

You know, the way those kids

were picking on you today in school,

you really got to stand up for yourself.

Stewie, it's not so easy.

What would you say if I said,
"Hey there, shorty"?

I'd say, "Have another doughnut,
you albino gorilla."

Oh, yeah? Well,

you have a sister as well.

Oh, Stewie, I... I could never
come up with stuff like you do.

Of course not. You're sweet and simple.

But even you could learn
enough to outsmart

those cretins at your school.

And they'll respect you for it.

In fact, I'll teach you how.

Why would you do that for me?

I'm your brother, Chris.

We're a team and we've got
to look out for each other.

Like Owl and Costello.

I mean the fellow's name on first base.

-Who.
-The fellow playing first base.

-Who.
-The guy on first base.

-Who.
-I'm asking you who's on first!

-Who.
-That's what I'm asking you!

Nothing will ever be funnier
than misunderstandings.

All right, Chris, here they come.

Now, remember what we practiced.

Now, what are you gonna call
the one in the middle?

Isosceles triangle?

What? Come on, Chris!

We worked on this all night.

I know! I also had a geometry test!

Well, how'd that go?

Hey, look who it is.

Dorky Pig.

Go on, Chris. It's now or never.

Let them have it.

Nice muscles.

What, do you belong to a gym?

Oh, for God's sake, Chris.

Here, put me on your back
and repeat what I say.

Quick! Here they come!

You're even uglier up close, Griffin.

Okay, now say... (INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

I heard you were born
out of your mom's butt.

I heard that from your mom
while I was doing her.

You're a butt baby.

That's why you've got moles
all over your chest.

Leftover birth dook.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, man! Griffin schooled him!

I can't believe I'm moving tomorrow,
and I won't get to see how this works out.

Wow, Stewie, we're gonna
work perfectly together.

Like Sherlock Holmes and Watson.

Watson, a clue!

The intruder has tracked in a red clay,

which can only be found near
London's homosexual bathhouse.

Amazing, Holmes.

How did you know that?

Just from, like, books and stuff.

Your turn.

You know, Peter, it's so nice

that after all these years
we've been together,

-we can still...
-Smoke break!

What? Peter, what are you
doing down there?

-Nothing.
-Well, it doesn't seem like nothing.

(COUGHING)

Peter, since when are you a smoker?

Put that out right now!

Smoking is highly addictive.

I'm not addicted.

I just need a couple every hour or so,

so I don't go completely insane.

Peter, that's exactly what addicted means.

You have a serious problem.

Cigarettes will kill you.

Relax, Lois. I can quit any time I want.

Look, I'll toss this one out right now.

I'm so sorry I threw you out the window!

Hey, man, can you keep it down?

Sorry. Wait, whose bedroom are you in?

Meg's.

Okay, that's fine then.

Where's Dad?

Your father got up early
and went for a run.

Ah, nothing like an after-run mint

to get rid of that jogger's breath.

Okay, now sit down
and have some breakfast.

I made your favorite, waffles and...

Hey, uh, did anybody get the paper today?

Ah, nothing like an after-paper mint

to get rid of that paper-getting breath.

You know, I feel like
these waffles could use

a little fresh air. Come on, boys.

Peter, sit down.

You need your breakfast.

Oh, Peter, I meant to tell you.

Remember my cousin Sylvia's
husband Robert? Well...

Does this story have an end?

Peter, I just started.

Oh, Meg's out of milk.
I'll get you a carton.

Hey, good story, Lois.

You wrapped it up nicely.

I know it's technically not illegal,

but it seemed wrong
when your music teacher

wrapped a trash bag around his waist
so he could change pants.

BOY: Hey, Jew-bacca!

Passover's stupid and I'm gonna
prove it by breaking your nose.

Hey!

Why don't you pick on someone
your own religion

who can fight for themselves?

And you're not so tough.

You frequently opt out of swim class

because of your gross microcephalic penis.

It's not gross!

It's special.

I can use it to reset my cable box.

Hey, Chris, what you did there
for that sweaty Jew?

That was really nice.

Back away, foul wench!

Your wide hips hold no temptation for me!

Uh, I mean,

you have...

A... A vulva

and fallopian tubes.

Finally! A guy who listens!

Here's my number. Call me.

Peter, when'd you start smoking?

Well, you know, at first
it was a way to get out of work,

but then I discovered
it's a delightful habit

-that has lots of benefits.
-Yeah? Like what?

Like I get to punctuate
tough conversations

by ashing a cigarette.

Joe, your marriage is over.

Oh, please. Bonnie and I
are stronger than ever.

Your marriage

is over.

(SIZZLING)

(SIGHS) Well, now that you
say it with the cigarette...

God, there's, like, no one hot
at this school this year.

<i>Okay, students, take your seats.</i>

<i>First off, we have a new rule,</i>

<i>no more asking the gym teachers</i>
<i>if they went to college.</i>

<i>They did not.</i>

<i>Next, it's time for nominations</i>
<i>for student body president.</i>

<i>As of now, we have</i>
<i>the perpetually upbeat black kid</i>

<i>running unopposed.</i>

Come on, yo, this is gonna be
a great year for all of us!

<i>Surely there's another student</i>

<i>who'd like to throw his hat in the ring.</i>

I nominate Chris Griffin!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Chris, they love you.

I'm a better coach than God.

Come on, you're getting
crucified out there!

JESUS: I know. It's a crucifixion.

Well, yeah, I know.

But that doesn't mean
you should stop trying.

Dad, you're not the coach!

(FARTING)

(GASPS) Peter, your fart didn't go off
until 8:30.

Get up. We're late!

(GASPS) What the hell?

-What? What? What?
-Peter,

(STAMMERS) it's horrible!

STEWIE: Other people live here!

Oh, my God!

How did this happen?

It's from smoking!

It's not that bad.

Peter, you can't live like this.

I'm taking you to Dr. Hartman.

No! I hate the doctor!

Are you sure?

There are Cheez-Its in there.

Cheez-Its?

Huh? Wait. What's going on?

I'm scared! I'm scared!

Oh, it's nighttime.

Good night.

Mr. Griffin, I'm gonna need
to ask you a few questions.

Do you think I can jump
and touch that pipe up there?

-I don't know.
-The hell I can't!

There, got it.

Yeah, I guess your fingertips grazed it.

Yeah, that counts as a dunk.

Dr. Hartman, we're here for you
to help Peter quit smoking.

Mrs. Griffin, I can't do that.
It's an addiction.

I can't even get my son to quit being gay.

Well, you got to do something!
He's killing himself!

(GROANS) All right, how many Vicodins
for you guys to just leave me alone?

Forty.

Well, it's too bad
Dr. Hartman couldn't help us.

I guess we should go
to the Stop Smoking Clinic

and then maybe get
a couple bottles of wine.

Oh, hey, Stewie. Ready to go to school?

Well, actually, Chris, I've got good news.

Aw, I'll take the bad news first.

No. What? There is no bad news.

Oh, all right. Then give me
the good news first.

(SIGHS) The good news is, I've taught
you everything you need to know

to fend for yourself.

So from now on, you can
go to school without me.

What are you talking about?

I'm running for class president.

I need you!

What are you doing?

You're coming to school with me
whether you like it or not!

Let me out! You can't keep me
in here forever!

I have too many plans for the future!

I'll never win a Nobel Prize!

I'll never be a member of Parliament!

I'll never get to express
disappointment with young people

while putting in my dentures!

Stupid younger generation.

Back in my day, we had
Katy Perry, Justin Bieber.

That was real music.

(SLURPING SOUNDS)

Lois, why do all the people in here look
like Emperor Palpatine?

Because they're all heavy smokers, Peter.

I'm gonna sign you in.

Would the driver of a 1978
Camaro please move your car?

(OTHERS COUGHING)

Man, how the hell am I gonna quit smoking?

I wish smoking could just quit me instead.

Thank you for meeting me here.

I have something
very important to tell you.

I have something
important to tell you, too.

Peter, I think we should see other people.

(TEARFULLY) Okay.

Uh, good, that's what
I was gonna say, too.

Excuse me, I'm Mr. Stone
with the ad agency

of Anderson, Wheeler and Thirdname.

And I think you'd be perfect for
our new anti-smoking campaign.

Me? You'd want me on TV?

Even though I'm hideous?

Sure. Have you seen <i>Boardwalk Empire?</i>

It's just a crap-fest of faces.

There is one catch,
if you're gonna be our spokesman,

you have to keep smoking.

We need you to stay wrinkled and sickly.

But my wife brought me here
to quit smoking.

(CHUCKLES) Wives, huh?

Okay, now I'm on your side!

Oh, this is awesome!

I'm gonna be on TV!

But no more talk of quitting, right?

You got it. So, um,

does somethin' like this
pay a lot of money?

What do you think a lot of money is?

I... I don't want to say. I'm embarrassed.

ANNOUNCER: And now a word
from the American Lung Association.

Oh, hey, hey, guys!
Here comes one of my TV spots!

Hi, Peter Griffin, sickly smoker.

This is your heart.

This is your heart on cigarettes.

Any questions?

Yeah, where'd you get that heart?

Hey, Peter, now that you're a celebrity,

could I get a picture
of you to put on the wall?

Sure, here you go.

Thanks, man.

I'll put you up next
to these black celebrities

who are just confusing strangers to you.

Who's Marlin Johnson?

Oh, come on, man. Stand-up comedian?

He got that whole thing
about the "Oh-Ee-Oh-Ee-Hey-Yo."

(LAUGHING) I can't even get through it.

MAN: Hey!
You talkin' 'bout Marlin Johnson?

You know it! Oh-ee-oh-ee-hey-yo!

(CHUCKLES) That's right.

Hey, Lois.

Peter, I saw your ad on TV,
and I got to say,

I'm glad you're finally
doing the right thing.

Yeah, it feels good to be helping people.

Peter, what are you doing?
I thought you quit!

Hey, if George Michael
doesn't have to give up butts,

why should I?

I'm serious. You have to stop smoking!

Have you looked in the mirror?
You look terrible.

Eh, what do you care?

It's not like you have to look
at my face when we have sex.

Not since we started role-playing.

Peter, I'm ready.

Okay, now put on yours.

Wow, isn't it weird that
we both picked Mario Lopez?

Yes, Peter. It's very weird.

Yeah, it shows that we both
go Latino but soft Latino.

Day five of my imprisonment
inside Chris' backpack.

Feces and the buildup thereof
continues to be my number one problem.

I think a teacher saw me
the other day but said nothing.

I waved and he looked away.

This could be my chance
to escape this canvas cage!

(GRUNTING)

That sounds like an open door.
Which way is out?

STUDENT: God, I love walking in the hall!

There! That way!

Must escape!

(SLURRED) Must... Escape.

(MUMBLING)

You're gonna die in there.

Welcome back, Mr. Griffin!

You look terrible!

Thanks, man named Sandy!

Oh, hey, uh, you know,
I don't know if you're the guy

to talk to about this,
but when I went to my trailer

this morning, there was
a hairy naked guy in it.

We don't provide trailers.

-We're just next door to a trailer park.
-Ah.

That would explain the violent
lovemaking that followed.

Listen, Peter, we need to talk.

I'm sorry to tell you this, but
we no longer need your services.

Wait... What?

How could you do that?

Well, I went to a NASCAR event

and realized you're just
an average-looking man.

Please! I'll do anything to keep my job!

Name anything you want and I'll do it!

Touch your toes.

Please give me something else!

I'm sorry, Peter, it's over.

(CRYING)

(CREEPILY)
Why are your eyes crying, Peter?

They fired me, Larry!

Come on. Let's go kidnap my neighbor's dog
and tell them we don't have it.

<i>Good morning, students.</i>

<i>First of all, I don't care</i>
<i>what the courts say,</i>

<i>let's thank the Christian God together.</i>

<i>Now then, we're here today</i>
<i>for the presidential candidate debate.</i>

Okay, remember,
people think I'm smart now.

So it's got to be clever
and it's got to pop.

I'm done! I'm not saying another word.

You can't hold me prisoner
in here forever!

Why not? Name one person who loves you.

Wow. Not a proportional response.

All right, let's begin
with an opening statement

from the perpetually upbeat black kid.

Thanks for letting me go first.

I got an hour-and-a-half drive
home after this.

You're not getting it, Chris, are you?

You were being bullied day in and day out,
so I tried to help you.

I tried to be a good brother.

And you've repaid me with abuse.

You're the bully, Chris Griffin.

Oh, my God. You're right.

PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD: <i>And now an opening</i>
<i>statement from our second candidate,</i>

<i>the King of the Zingers, Chris Griffin.</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

<i>Go easy on me, Chris.</i>

<i>My sister has MS.</i>

<i>I'm worried what you're</i>
<i>gonna do with that.</i>

<i>I'm out. I'm not running.</i>

<i>And neither is she.</i>

<i>I knew you'd have something.</i>

<i>No, you don't understand.</i>

<i>I'm dropping out of the election.</i>

(MURMURING)

<i>I'm a big fraud,</i>

<i>and I've treated people terribly.</i>

<i>Much like Jeff Zucker when he ran NBC.</i>

I'm sorry, Stewie.

Can you forgive me?

Well, I may no longer be on your back,

but I'll always be on your side.

(SIGHS) <i>All right,</i>

<i>this election is postponed.</i>
<i>Go back to class.</i>

<i>Oh, and another thing,</i>

<i>stop making fun of teachers</i>
<i>who don't have cars.</i>

<i>Life's not as easy as you think</i>
<i>it's gonna be right now.</i>

You know, Chris, what you did
on that stage took a lot of guts.

Thanks, Stewie.

And thanks to you, I'm no
longer getting bullied.

Well, that's great.

I guess we put those bullies
in their place, huh?

Yeah. Two of them shot themselves.

Oh, that's so good to hear, Chris.

Are they done? They're...
They're all done?

Okay, all right, let's finish ours.

Well, I finally quit smoking and
I'm ready to go back to normal!

Peter, that's not how it works.

The damage you've done is irreversible.

Yeah, Lois is right. As bad as you look,

the damage you've done
to your heart and your lungs is,

-no doubt, exponentially worse.
-What?

Well, try cuttin' to the outside
of the house over some music.

That usually works.

Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.

It must've been around 1979
when Animal started

snorting crushed-up pieces of felt.

It got pretty ugly.

Me had big problem
before me found God.

He, like, threw me down and he said,

"I hope your puppeteer has big hands,
because I'm not using lube."

Me no remember that,
but me believe it happened.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-I got it.

Huh, it says "Glenn Quagmire."

But if you squint and imagine
it says "Peter Griffin,"

-it says "Peter Griffin."
-Peter, it's Quagmire's.

-Take it next door.
-Now, now, hold on, Lois.

Now, this poses a very
difficult ethical dilemma.

Do I deliver the package
to its rightful owner?

Or do I open it up
and see if it contains He-Mans?

Do not open that box.

You know, Lois, physicists believe
there are two alternate universes,

one in which I don't open the box
and one in which I do.

I'm not gonna open the box.

I'm gonna open the box.

Aw, sweet! It's a whip!

Peter, be careful with that thing!
Remember, we're renting this house.

That's depressing.

Wow, I haven't felt this powerful

since I got to decide which
ant lives and which ant dies.

You shall battle to the death,

and the winner
will be given his freedom.

Why are you looking at me like that?

Peter, would you like a glass of...

Oh, my God!

I told you not to play God
with those ants!

All right, Meg, stay incredibly still.

I'm gonna whip that cigarette
out of your mouth.

And maybe not slice your face in half.

Dad, I don't want to do this.

-Stay still!
-Argh!

Okay, tha-that's pretty cool, too.

Hey, Dad, that's a cool hwhip.

Argh! I thought you couldn't
understand me!

<i>When a good time turns around</i>
<i>you must whip it</i>

<i>You will never live it down</i>

<i>-Whip it good...</i>

-(BEEPS)
-Ooh, a message from Joe.

JOE OVER VOICEMAIL: <i>Hey, Cleveland.</i>
<i>I just wanted to give you a heads-up</i>

<i>that Peter has a whip,</i>

-(KNOCKING)
-Grape soda-gram.

I know this is very risky,

but the upside is so good,
I'm taking it.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>

-Should we bury them?
-Nah, leave them for the buzzards.

-I like that guy.
-Oh, boy, here comes Harry.

He thinks no one will notice
he got his neck done.

Hey, fellas, I'm back
from that family wedding.

(GROANS)

Hey, what you watching?

-<i>The Outlaw Josey Wales. </i>It's a Western.
-Ah.

When do the cowboys
go into the tent,

lick their palms
and have sex with each other?

Different kind of Western.

Ew! What's Clint Eastwood
doing with that Indian chief?

Oh, they're-they're
just becoming blood brothers.

"Blood brothers"? What the devil is that?

Well, it's an ancient ritual
where two friends

intermingle their blood,
thus sealing a bond

even deeper than friendship.

Yes, yes. Let's do that.
Brian, I want you inside me.

You-you don't have to say it like that.

-Oh, come on, we're best friends, right?
-Stewie, I'm not...

Actually, we're even more
than best friends.

I mean, we share the same home.

We've been on countless
adventures together.

And, besides, you owe me, Brian.

Remember what you did to
my last Halloween costume?

I am going to be the cutest fire hydrant

in the whole...
Argh! What are you doing?

(GRUNTS)

Okay, your turn.

(GROANS)

I think we should
hold hands more often.

There you go, we're blood brothers now.
You happy?

Actually, yes.
I mean, I really feel the bond, Brian.

I feel like we're closer now.

You know, more connected,
more intertwined.

Yeah, I guess in a way we are.

Hey, are-are you blood brothers with Meg

because you ate
her tampon out of the trash?

No, tha... No, that's...
That's something else.

Oh, man, I could use a cold beer.

Yeah, me, too.
I just had a killer rehearsal.

-I'm not biting.
-Me, neither.

You forget how many scenes Tevye's in.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this?

That's our booth!

Uh, uh, excuse me. Hey, fellas.

Uh, hey, listen, this is,
uh, a little awkward,

but, uh, you guys
are sitting in our booth.

Listen here, pencil neck.

This is our booth now,
and we ain't leaving.

So, what are you gonna
do about it, bitch?

Look, dudes, clearly you don't
want to move. And that's fine.

We'll come back in an hour.

Nice try, wheelie,
but this ain't your booth no more.

That's right, we see you losers
anywhere near this booth,

and we'll bust your kneecaps.

-We're willing to take that risk.
-Shut up, Joe.

All right, I was hoping it wouldn't
have to come to this,

but you fellas are in big trouble.

If, uh... If you could just
move back like eight feet.

-Is that my whip?
-Hey!

Is that my Taser?

All right, I'll just strangle him
with this Hawaiian shirt.

Will you stop going through my mail?

All right, bitches,
either you tuck your little wangs

between your legs
and waddle out of here

or we're gonna beat the crap out of you.

So, what's it gonna be?

Uh, I think we're gonna
do the wang thing.

(YAWNS)

(GASPS)

What the hell?

Ow!

Ew! What's this?

-(STEWIE YELLS)
-(RAPID FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

You son of a bitch!
You gave me herpes!

What? What are you talking about?

When we swapped blood!
Look at my lip!

It's a disgusting herpes sore!

And now I have some
very uncomfortable phone calls to make.

(PHONE RINGING)

<i>Hola.</i> Handy Manny's repair shop.

-You break it...
-TOOLS: We fix it!

STEWIE: <i>Manny? Manny?</i>

<i>I'm gonna need you to take me</i>
<i>off speakerphone for this.</i>

Stewie, that's crazy!
There's no way I gave you herpes.

Then how do you explain this?

-I don't know. You're a gross slut.
-(GASPS)

Look, it-it can't be my fault, Stewie.
I don't even have herpes.

Oh, yeah? Let me see!

Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing? Stop it!

Ugh! Oh, my God! Look at you!
You're more herpes than dog!

Okay, fine! I admit it.
I gave you herpes.

You bastard!

You knew you had herpes,
and-and you still agreed

to swap blood with me!

-Relax, it's not that big a deal.
-Not that big a deal?

It's a disgusting, unsightly,
unsavory disease, and it lasts for life!

Yeah, but, you know, I mean,

isn't the worst thing about herpes
just the stigma?

I mean, like,
what if it wasn't called "herpes"?

Like-like, what if it was
called "boppo," huh?

Oh, I got a little boppo.
Oh, that's cute. Ah, I want boppo.

You know, my uncle was in the Army,

and he got genital boppo
from a Saigon whore...

Shut up! Just shut up!
You should be ashamed of yourself.

I mean, look at me.

And on the same day
I'm supposed to help

with my friend's wedding invitations.

So, I was thinking,
I know they're kind of overused lately...

but your colors should be,
like, yellow and gray.

You know, I've always been
against destination weddings,

but it's nice to finally see Denver.

who killed my daughter.

It's water under the bridge.
I'm just getting my mail.

Aw, what happened?
I couldn't see.

I have no idea.
The TV is, like, directly over my head.

All I can see are the spider veins
of alcoholics wearing shorts.

-What?
-I said...

-Huh?
-All I can see is...

What? You can't see what?

-I can only see...
-What? Damn it, Peter!

-Ow!
-Joe, what are you trying to say?

Eh, it doesn't matter.
I just... I hate sitting at the bar.

I wish we had our old booth back.

Well, what are we supposed to do?
Fight those guys?

-They would've kicked our asses.
-Peter's right.

We just got to accept
the fact that, well, we're...

-We're kind of cowards.
-I know.

Yesterday, I even went
to a Cowards Anonymous meeting.

Hello. My name's Cowardly Lion,
and I'm a coward.

I'm afraid of small dogs,

girls with pigtails, flying monkeys...

Wait-wait, th-there's...
There's flying monkeys?

That's a thing?

Sure. They got sharp fangs, claws...

God, they sound terrifying!

Wait, you think so, too?

Yes, and fear is a logical response
to actual danger.

Huh. I guess you're right.

Hey. I'm the Rational Lion.

So, (bleep) you guys.

Whew, what a morning.

By the time I got done with my pubes,

I just didn't feel like shaving anymore.

Hey, Charlotte.

That's very cute, Stewie,

I'll do what he tells me to do.

I was in the military for 30 years

back when that meant something.

I don't deal with gay people.

See? Him I respect.

Hey, Bonnie, you want to fool around?

I bought one of those

crippled-guy robot suits from <i>Avatar,</i>

so now I can be on top.

No, thanks, Joe.

I heard about what happened at The Clam,

and I'm not interested in having sex
with a quarter of a man.

Hey, I'm half a man!

Not anymore.

Fine. Well, I'm gonna
go sleep on the couch.

You need something, Joe?

Yes, Elton, I'd like
to sleep on the couch.

-(BUZZES)
-All right, Joe. Come on.

<i>Love lift us up</i>

<i>Where we belong</i>

Hey, Chris, your mom's
done with the laundry.

Can you help her fold?

No, but you know what?

You put on her bra.

I-I don't want to.

Well, you're gonna.

Everybody heard about what
happened over at The Clam

and how those guys made you their bitch.

Um, okay.

(WHIMPERING)

That's right, you wuss.

In fact, the way I see it,

I'm the man of the house now.

Which means there's gonna be
some big changes around here.

It's not very
comfortable, Chris.

My back kind of hurts.

I'm just staring up at the ceiling.

Shut up! I promised changes,
and I delivered!

ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to </i>Bryan Cranston Sneezes.

(SNEEZES)

Thank you.

Um, Rupert?

You know how we promised
never to lie to each other?

Well, I lied earlier tonight.

It's not a burn
from Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

It's herpes.

You should get yourself tested.

CHRIS: Hey, Stewie.

(GASPS) How long have you been there?

Long enough to know you have herpes

and do weird stuff with your teddy bear.

Yeah, he does weird stuff.

I-I just don't stop him.

Yeah, well, I just wanted to
let you know you're not alone.

Oh, yeah? How so?

Good Lord!
You've got herpes, too?

This house is like backstage
at a Whitesnake concert!

Not only that,
but I also got it from Brian.

We're blood brothers, too.

You... You are?

Yup, he knew he had herpes
and he didn't say anything.

Maybe he was mad I gave him fleas.

I don't know.

That bastard!

Well, we need to teach him a lesson.

He's a menace.

Like that coked-up giraffe at Studio 54.

Yup, yup, people are watching.

I'm that good.

-Are you Donna Summer?
-Why, yes, I am.

I just want to thank you
for helping me reach

a state of cocaine-fueled 1970s euphoria.

Robert Mapplethorpe?

Can I put this fire extinguisher
someplace interesting

and take your picture?

I would love that!

Um, uh, Meg, can you, um...

Can you please pass the milk?

Shut up, Dad.

Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

-I'm sorry. I'll shut up.
-What?

She's right, Lois. She's right.
I-I don't need milk.

I'll just moisten my cereal with spit.

(SPITS)

Mmm, mmm, good spit.

Peter, what the hell is going on?

Please tell me this isn't still
about how you punked out

in front of those guys at The Clam.

Oh, God, you're angry.
I'll clean the dishes.

Peter, stop it!

Are... Are you crying?

-(CRYING) No!
-Oh, this is insane.

Peter, I want you
to march down to The Clam

right now and get your booth back.

Oh my God, Lois, you're right.

If they see me crying,
they'll have to give us our booth back.

No! I'm saying you got to go
down there and take it back.

Like a man.

Yeah. I mean, I mean, yeah!

I am going to The Clam
and I'm getting my booth back.

-And, Meg, you're gay.
-No, I'm not.

You like guys, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, that's called being gay.

-Hey.
-Uh, hey, Kevin.

You, uh...
You smell like a rabbit, buddy.

Did something just happen with a rabbit?

I'll go get my dad.

Listen, you guys.

I think we're all suffering

from what happened down at The Clam.

Yeah, I had to start taking pills
so I'd stop thinking about it.

Quagmire, that's a Cialis.

That's right,
I'm not thinking about it anymore.

I'm thinking about that couch.

Well, I think we gave up too easy.

We need to march back down to the Clam

and take back what's ours.

He's right.
We need to sit up to those guys.

No way.
You want to get yourselves killed,

that's your business, but I'm not going.

Fine, me and Joe will go without you.

But just know you're letting us down.

We're supposed to stick together.

Like goatee guys at a barbecue.

Do you mind if I stand next to you
while we eat standing?

No problem.

Hey, let's go grab some good beer
even though we brought the bad beer.

NARRATOR: <i>And these two barbecue scumbags</i>

<i>formed a lifelong friendship</i>

<i>until their deaths</i>
<i>at the ripe old age of 52</i>

<i>in separate ATV accidents.</i>

You know,
I'm so glad you finally agreed

to go out with me, Jenna.

Me, too.
I'm having a really nice time.

You seem like a great guy.

STEWIE: Yes, thank you,
we'll take the table in the corner,

next to the herpes dog.

Oh, hey, Brian.

And who's your date?

Wow, you must be such a good person

to knowingly go out
with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.

Ew! I'm sorry, Brian.

I-I've got to go.

Damn it, you guys!
Her dad's really rich!

-Wow, you weren't kidding.
-Yeah.

PETER: Hey, you bums!

If you bastards want our booth,

you got to go through us to get it.

Smells like this guy's
already wet himself.

Don't flatter yourself.

That was from this morning.

Oh, man, this is gonna be fun.

Yeah, and there's only
two of you losers.

Where's your skinny friend?

-(DOOR OPENS)
-QUAGMIRE: Right here.

Quagmire! You came!

Sure did, Peter.
Thanks for calling me skinny, by the way.

I realized you were right.

If we don't stand up
for ourselves now,

we'll regret it for the rest of our lives.

And this might be the stupidest thing
I've ever done, but...

(GRUNTS)

Oh, now you're gonna get it.

(GRUNTS)

Whelp, I'm out.

Argh!

Hey! That was my pool cue.

I brought it from home.

Oh, sorry.

It screws together.

And I even have
this special little case for it.

I-I feel bad now. I...

Ahhh!

Hyah!

Hey, that was my
Pawtucket Patriot sign.

I brought it from home.

Okay, now I'm starting
to doubt everything you said.

(GROANING)

All right, guys,
I know this looks desperate,

but I've got this can of spinach.

Argh!

Aw, God, it's all watery.

Argh!

You know, I almost said
"no chairs" at the beginning.

Haven't you guys had enough?

Why don't you just admit
you're beat and get out of here?

-BOTH: Okay.
-No! Never!

We will never stop fighting
for this booth.

This booth is my home.

I was born in this booth.

I was married in this booth.

My children were all conceived
in this booth.

Hell, I witnessed
every significant historical event

in my lifetime right here!

I was in this booth
when the <i>Challenger</i> exploded.

Oh, my God, no!

I was in this booth on 9/11.

Oh, my God, no!

I was in this booth when
President Obama was elected.

Oh, my God, no!

So, if you want this booth,
you're gonna have

to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

Why are we even bothering
with these idiots?

We're shipping out to
Afghanistan tomorrow.

You guys are soldiers?

It's our third tour of duty.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

If I could touch my own head,
I'd salute you.

(GRUNTING)

With his head, I salute you.

Everyone, I declare this to be

These Three Guys Day.

And not These Three Guys Day.

(ALL CHEERING)

I can't believe I have
to root for Afghanistan now.

-(COMPUTER CHIMES)
-Ah, damn it!

Stewie! Chris!

-Yes, Brian?
-You hacked my Facebook account!

Oh, yes, we actually just
changed your profile picture.

(COMPUTER DINGS)

Argh! Damn it!
Look, enough, okay?

What the hell do you
guys want from me?

I want to drive your Prius

to the end of the block
all by myself.

-That's it?
-Yes.

-Okay.
-Yay!

(ENGINE STARTS)

That's, uh...
That's way past the end of the block.

Yeah, his room's empty.
I don't think he's coming back.

Huh.

Well, what about you?

I want to go on a date with Neve Campbell

so I can give her a nice ladle of Stew.

What? How am I supposed
to even find her?

Damn it, Stewie, why are you
being so vindictive?

Because, Brian,
for the first time in my life,

I realized I couldn't trust you.

I couldn't trust
my own best friend.

(SIGHS) I... I'm sorry, Stewie.

You're right. I let you down.

I guess... I guess
I was just too embarrassed

to admit I had herpes.

It was a rotten thing to do,

and I promise I will
never lie to you again.

Thanks, Brian.
That's all I really wanted.

So, do you forgive me?

Yes. I do.

So, I'm gonna have herpes
for the rest of my life, huh?

Yeah, but most of the time,
it won't even be an issue.

It only really flares up
during periods of great stress.

Like your wedding day
or a big job interview.

So, what would you say some
of your weaknesses are?

That... That-that's
probably one of them.

I think next time

Now, you'll be watching Stewie,

Take him to the park.

I want him to get some fresh air.

Fresh air is bad for a kid, Lois.

-What?
-I don't know.

Peter, you are taking Stewie to the park.

It'll do you good to spend
some time with your son.

I spend lots of time with him, Lois.

Just last week,
I took him to the doctor.

Mr. Griffin, you're here

Yeah, this is me.

Is that your little one there?

Oh, no, it's-it's just the way

your name is Stewie, all right?

I'm your new dad.

-Peter!

I'm gonna go give my baby

Uh, Lois, I had an affair,

Peter, jamming yourself

-Ahhh!

-He didn't have a hat.

Oh, I am so sorry.

I just got home myself.

I left my husband in charge,

which was obviously a terrible mistake.

Thank you so much.

I took a bath with the dad.

Mmm. Oh, my baby's back home.

Mommy missed you.

Congratulations, Lois.

You passed the test.

You really do love Stewie.

Now, what do you say we all sit down

Weird Al Yankovic documentary?

It's called <i>An Inconvenient Tooth.</i>

-(LAUGHING)
-What's wrong with you, Peter?

Lois, I'm sorry.

How the hell can you possibly
mistake another baby for Stewie?

Now, calm down, Lois.

You're gonna say something you don't mean.

Oh, no, I'm not! You're an idiot!

You don't mean that.

I already got a Facebook
friend request from the dad.

Is that weird?

Peter, I have put up

You left a helpless baby in a public park.

And that's something

All right? There's worse things to be.

Okay, we're only gonna tackle
one thing today.

Peter, maybe you need to
broaden your horizons, you know?

Read a book, travel.

Oh, yeah, I love traveling.

You see new things,

inconvenience thousands of people.

You know what? You guys are right.

It's time to travel, to learn,
to experience new things.

I've been letting opportunities pass me by

ever since I was a kid.

Hey, kid, get in my van,

No, my mom says I shouldn't.

Okay!

I can't. This week is the Deaf Games.

Why does every fight
have to go to the death?

Angela, if you got business traveling

that needs to be done, I'm your guy.

Griffin, I'm not gonna look over there

until you first assure me
you've got pants on.

It's not a rule unless
there's a sign on the wall.

-I won that court case.
-Fine.

So you'd be willing to take that trip

to Chicago for the company?

Yeah, you know, I was just saying

I need to broaden my horizons.

You see, my wife thinks I'm an idiot.

She's always making me feel
small and insignificant.

Honey? My inside left boob stomach
did that thing again.

Um, I don't know about any of that,

Well, gentlemen, thank you for coming.

Mr. Griffin, I believe
you have something for me.

-Yes, I do, Mr. Franks.
-Terrific.

We were completely out of these tubes.

Well, thank you all for coming.
Good day.

-Nicely done, Mr. Franks.
-Thanks, Chief.

-Wait, so that's it?
-Hey, you nailed it!

But I'm here till tomorrow night.

What am I supposed to do?

Get out there and explore Chicago, Peter.

It's one of the great cities of the world.

There's museums, a symphony,
a Lyric Opera.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Did you say "chicken fashion show"?

-No.
-Oh.

But that-that other stuff,
they all sound like

the kind of things I could do
to expand my horizons.

Wow.

Chicago: "The San Francisco Treat."

I haven't felt this sense
of limitless adventure

since I went cave jumping.

Here we go!

(ECHOING) I told no one
what I was doing today!

Man, I'm, like, the fifth most
attractive woman in Chicago.

Hi. Welcome to the museum.

Thanks. Just to be clear,

I should touch everything, right?

No, please don't touch anything.

Sorry, it's my first time
at an adult museum.

I'm used to petting the starfishes.

Well, maybe you'd find
our audio tour helpful.

You have your choice of narrators,

our senior curator

or Chicago's own Dennis Farina.

Hmm.

FARINA: <i>Hey there, chief.</i>
<i>Dennis Farina here.</i>

<i>And welcome to our museum.</i>

<i>Just so you know,</i>
<i>I'll be eating through most of this.</i>

Yeah. This one.

FARINA: (CHEWING) <i>Ah, man,</i>

<i>that's good sausage.</i> (BURPS)

<i>Oops. Excuse me.</i>

<i>Anyways, this is </i>At the Moulin Rouge
<i>by Toulouse-Lautrec.</i>

<i>Uh, it's from the 1890s.</i>

<i>Now, he was a midge,</i>
<i>but he painted like a normal.</i>

Now, here is a naked chick
made completely out of marble.

<i>I got to wonder,</i>
<i>I'm sure you do, too,</i>

<i>how this thing didn't crack</i>
<i>when they were carving out</i>

<i>her downstairs business.</i>

(LOUDLY) He did a great job

MAN OVER TV:
<i>We now return to Janeane Garofalo</i>

<i>and Mark Ruffalo in </i>Garofaruffalo.

Turn it off, Chris.

I don't even want to know what that is.

Your father has returned.

-Dad!
-Oh, Peter!

How were all your business trips?

Oh, exemplary, Chris.

I don't understand what
either of those words mean.

One of them was "Chris."

Peter, you seem... Different.

That's right, Lois.
I live the life of the mind now.

My brain is awash
with theorems and profundity

and abstractions that I can
pontificate upon at length.

Brian's a woof-cat!

Peter, you sound so refined.

Are you intelligent now?

Affirmative. That means "yes."

-Does that please you?
-It does, Peter.

Well, it should.

After all, knowledge
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

Shall we away for relations?

I'm not sure what you're saying,
but let's hump!

PETER: (PANTING) Affirmative, affirmative,

affirmative... Oh, my God, affirmative!

LOIS: Wow, Peter, that was great!

PETER: It was. Sorry I "arrived" early.

LOIS: That's okay.

PETER: And sorry about the bedspread.

That was about a week's worth of arrive.

Mom, Dad, the TV's broken!

Actually, Chris,
I got rid of our television.

This is our new bookshelf,
and I think you'll find

it has more channels
than any TV we've ever owned.

I want to watch <i>The Walking Dead!</i>

Then I shall read to you from
Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein.</i>

I want to watch <i>New Girl.</i>

Perhaps you'd like to hear
about Jane Eyre,

who felt quite the new girl
at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.

How about <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

Instead, I shall read to you from...

<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

Oh, finally, another reader in the family.

You know, these are some of
my favorite books and authors.

Oh? What are you reading right now?

-Oh, boy.
-Well, I'm...

I'm sort of between books right now.

Yeah? What was the last thing you read?

He's got you on the ropes now.

I-I'm actually rereading a lot of stuff.

-Yeah? Like what?
-Just tap out.

Uh... The classics, you know?

Going back to the, uh... Basics, really.

(CHUCKLES) Words on the printed page.

Thank you, Steve Guttenberg, right?

What is this, oak?

Oh, I don't even think it's oak!

Peter, I can't get over the way
you've transformed yourself.

How'd you do it?

Well, Lois, some of it came from books,

some came from museums,

and, honestly,
a lot of it just came from travel.

Hey, excuse me,
I need to rent a car.

Preferably one where
the radio is stuck on NPR.

Here you go.

(SOFTLY) Hello. It's me. I am returning.

How was the car?

Coastal and superior.

I never knew whisper-talking was so smart.

And how will you be paying
for your rental, sir?

I will pay you with stories
of my abusive father

set to dissonant flute.

(PLAYING GENTLE MUSIC)

I was seven when he first came home drunk.

A child should sleep on his bed,
not under it.

Hey, what are you listening to?

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm learning Sanskrit.

You know, an ancient tongue

can be as titillating as a young one.

Peter, what gives? Ever since you had

all those business trips,
you've been acting weird.

Pity a man in familiar places
who yet feels like a stranger.

You... You're the dick
who wrote that in the bathroom!

Indeed. Being smart
and cultured is so lonely.

Now I know why Oscar Wilde
turned to alcoholism

and bone inhalation.

Gentlemen, as they say in Sanskrit,

<i>shubha prabhatam.</i>

(LAUGHS) You know what's weird?

Shubha Prabhatam is my porn name.

What?

Yeah, first pet and street you grew up on.

-You had a pet named Shubha?
-Oh, yeah.

Old Shubha was a tough pooch.

He was feared by everyone up
and down Prabhatam Drive.

You have a very weird past.

All right,
if this is to be a smart family,

we will have to learn not to giggle

at smart things
that sound dirty but are not.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

-Hi, Lois.
-No, I wasn't!

Oh, Brian, thank God it's just you.

You know how Peter
thinks TV rots the mind.

Oh, as long as you're here,
can you run some vocabulary with me?

I need to know how to use
these words in sentences

by the time Peter gets home.

Oh, that should be easy.
Just give me the word,

and I'll put it in a sentence for you.

"Anodyne."

Uh, a friend asked me
what "anodyne" means.

Oh, who am I kidding?

I'm never gonna learn any of these words.

(GROANS) I can't take this anymore, Brian,

and the kids can't either.

Peter's become a nightmare.

Wait, I thought this was
what you always wanted,

for Peter not to be an idiot.

Oh, at least that Peter was fun

and didn't make me feel so stupid.

I miss the old Peter.

Well, we got to do something,

'cause this new Peter
just sounds all wrong.

Like a pilot without a calming voice.

We have to get out of here!

(ALL SCREAMING)

Wait a minute.

If visiting San Francisco
and New York made Peter smart,

maybe if we send him to the dumbest city

in the whole country,
it'll bring back the old Peter.

Huh. It's worth a try.

Aloha!

(LAUGHING)

(GRUNTING AND LAUGHING)

-Is Peter home?
-He's pulling in now.

I sure hope Tucson helped.

Heads up, guys.
I farted on the doorstep,

but it's hot on my trail.

Oh, Brian, that's a good sign.

How was your trip? Oh, amazing.

I saw a wet T-shirt contest
using chocolate milk.

It was at the Tucson Philharmonic.

What else did you do?

Eh, mostly just picked my desert boogers.

Oh, Peter, you're back! Thank God!

We all owe that trash city
a debt of gratitude.

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

Tonight, the conclusion
of our three-part report

on bestiality at the aquarium.

But first, our top story.

A local boy dies after playing video games

for 51 hours straight.

He was playing <i>Halo,</i>
now he has a halo.

Just kidding. He was gay.

Look at that. Big deal.

Stayed awake for 51 hours.
That's nothing.

Yeah, I've flown
back-to-back Australia trips

-that were longer than that.
-I never sleep.

Something's been beeping
in our bedroom for three years.

Bonnie won't look for it,
and I can't find it.

Hey, I got a fun idea.
Let's bet on it.

One hundred bucks says
I can stay awake

-longer than both of you.
-Yeah! Let's do this! You in, Peter?

Oh, hell yeah, I'm in!

You guys don't know nothing
about staying up late.

I used to pull all-nighters
when I worked for that lesbian

carpet-cleaning company.

Lesbians have regular carpets,
too, you pervs.

DEEP FEMALE VOICE:
When you're done with that,

can you help me plug
the hole in this dike?

I'm kind of a Jack-of-all-trades.

WOMAN: Hey, help me fix this gash.

Somebody's been having
scissor fights on this thing.

All right, let's get
some ground rules down.

No closing your eyes
and pretending you're thinking.

-Peter. Peter!
-I was thinking!

Hi, boys.

I baked a fresh batch of cookies
for your slumber party.

-Hey!
-It's not a slumber party, Lois!

Yeah, get out of here!
Just leave the cookies and go.

Okay. You boys have fun.

We will. Just go! Geez.

Ah, I'm already bored.
What should we do?

Hey, let's prank-call Cleveland.

-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, great idea.
-Yeah!

(PHONE RINGING)

Brown house.

(BAD ACCENT) Uh, Cleveland? It's Loretta.

What? But... But you're dead.

No... No, I... I faked my death

to get the IRS off my back.

Oh, my God.

Does that mean I have to give back
the insurance money?

(LAUGHING)

Who's there with you, Loretta?

-(LAUGHS)
-It's us, you idiot!

She's still dead.

Oh, you guys are more meaner

It's been 62 hours.

Joe, you're about to drop.

And, Peter, you've been
hallucinating all night.

Yeah, whatever, Quagmire.
I got to go to the bathroom.

Where's your toilet?

Right here, Peter.

Better cover the seat.
Oh, JK, I'm not fancy.

Ahhh, leave me alone.

Pull him off me.

Oh!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, my God, Joe,
when did you start running?

And jumping? And sky-dancing?

He ain't sky-dancing,
he fell asleep.

(SNORING)

That means it's just you and me.

Yeah, and tiny Sharon Stone from <i>Casino.</i>

You son of a bitch.

I will go to the FBI.
I will go to the police.

Quagmire, help.

I-I don't... I don't see her.

I-I-I didn't...
I didn't see the movie.

Peter, wake up.

I need to know if I can delete
your <i>iCarlys</i> from the DVR.

What? Aw, damn it.

Wait, I didn't fall asleep first, did I?

Oh, wha...
Wait, what-what-what happened?

W-Wait, wait... Were you asleep?

Did I win? I won.

Guys, we were
all so tired.

There's no way to prove
which one of you fell asleep first.

Oh, yes, there is, Joe.

I got cameras
in every room of this house.

There's a naked lady squatting
over a cake in your kitchen.

-She'll wait. She-she knows to wait.
-(CLICKS)

Well, it looks like Peter won.

And it looks like I went
48 hours without an e-mail,

text message or voice mail.

All right, I won 200 bucks.

And there's a little bit of blood
in my ear.

-Well, a bet's a bet.
-Yeah, congratulations, Peter.

What are you gonna do
with your winnings?

Joe, never ask me about money.
It's rude.

We're gonna go out to eat.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

This is a great place, Peter.

You can tell by the laminated
high school football schedule on the wall.

I'm gonna go see which lobster
I think deserves to die.

Hey, Chris.

Oh, hi, Pam.

I thought you gave a great
book report at school today.

Well, thanks. All the credit
goes to Slash's biography.

What a maniac.

Well, all I know is

you looked cute while you gave it.

Hey, Chris. I didn't know
you knew my daughter.

Sure, I do.
We're in the same gossip group

in the cafeteria at lunch.

<i>Pick a little, talk a little</i>
<i>Pick a little, talk a little</i>

<i>Cheep, cheep, cheep</i>
<i>Talk a lot, pick a little more.</i>

Come on, Pam, we got to go
before they see the tip.

MAN: 40%?

I would've left more,
but he messed up our order.

I'm sorry, I got to go.

I like bumping into you outside of school.

You should move into our house.

(LAUGHS) You're funny, Chris.

Hey, uh, maybe we could
hang out again sometime.

You know, if you want.

I'd like that.

(SINGSONGY) Ooh!

See you at school, Chris.

Hey, Chris. These...

On her nipples. (LAUGHS)

Kill that one.

So, there's a penguin
on the front and it says,

"I hear you're 40."

And when you're 40,
your eyes start to go.

And then y-you open the card.

And then "happy birthday" is all blurry,

because whoever opens the card
is 40 and you want to

give them the impression that
their eyes are starting to go.

Hey, guys, there's someone
I want you to meet.

Pam, this is my family.

Family, this is my girlfriend, Pam.

You know, Chris,
Usher categorizes his girls

into two groups, bitches he's with
and bitches he's gonna get with.

So is this one you got
or one you gon' get?

Wait. Jerome's daughter
is your girlfriend?

Chris, can I speak to you
for a moment privately?

I voted for Obama once.

Dad, if this is about Pam...

Yes, it is about Pam.

And I have something to say.

Chris, she's... She's not fat.

What?

I-I figured the day
you came home with a girl,

we'd have to back her
through the garage.

-A little further, little further.
-(FOOTSTEPS THUMPING)

Little further...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

Okay, all right.
Now, do you prefer

"Fatty" or "Miss Boom-Bi-Latty?"

So, you don't mind that Pam is black?

Chris, it's 1998.

-Actually, Dad...
-Peter Griffin does not see color.

Now, let's go see
if your mom's done listing

all the black people
she's ever seen on television.

Flip Wilson, John Amos,
Diahann Carroll,

that monster that plays tennis.

So, I saw Chris is dating
Jerome's daughter.

Looks like they've had
some pretty hot dates.

Don't, uh... Don't look at my kids

when they're off doing
their private lives.

Hey, there's my new
brother-in-law brother, now.

Griffin, you and me have to talk.

What's up, blood?

Nobody's dating nobody.
You understand?

Oh, don't worry, Jerome.

I already gave Chris the sex talk.

It's... Awesome.

Peter, you don't understand.

I don't want Pam dating a white boy.

What? Jerome.

You're a racist.

Black people can't be racist.

We can be way sexist, but we ain't racist.

Sure, black people can be racist.

They gave Michelle Pfeiffer
such a hard time.

She didn't pick that school,
they sent her there.

Coolio had her back.

Look, I think if you
got to know us better,

you wouldn't have any problem
with your daughter dating one of us.

QUAGMIRE: I'll date her.

Look, why don't you and Pam
come over tomorrow night,

and you'll see that white people
are even better than black people.

-Peter.
-Y-Y-You know what I mean.

They-they're equal.
Separate but equal.

-Peter.
-Just equal.

All right, we'll come to dinner.

But I want you to know
I'm very skeptical

about this whole thing.

Oh, that's okay. Hey, listen,

I was skeptical about
traveling to Mexico.

-(FLIES BUZZING)
-I took one step outside the resort.

Thanks for having us to dinner,
Mrs. Griffin.

Oh, my pleasure, Pam.

Yes. I, for one,
say this is long overdue.

It's about time people of color
broke bread at this table.

Broke bread? W-What?

Who are you,
St. Francis of Assisi all of a sudden?

Jerome, you have done
a wonderful job raising Pam

to be a lovely young woman.

You say that like you're surprised.

I-I beg your pardon?

Sounds like you're saying
a single black man

can't raise a child on his own.

Yes, Lois, what are you saying?

You know, before I speak,
I like to ask myself,

"Would Dr. King approve
of what I'm about to say?"

Most of the time,
I find that he would.

Dad, I think Mrs. Griffin
was just giving you a compliment.

Yeah, I was just trying to say

we all appreciate having you in our home.

Oh, so suddenly we're all friends?

Wait, w-we've always been friends.

-If we're friends, what's my last name?
-Cool J?

-Where am I from?
-The south part of a large city?

Where'd I go to college?

Does it air commercials
during daytime judge programs?

Peter, you only got two of
those three things right.

Look, I know what this is about.

You're being all nice
just so your son can get

into my daughter's pants.

Dad, stop it.

White guys don't want
a relationship with black women,

they just want a notch on their belt.

You're a novelty to these people.

"These people"?

This is the moment in the meal
when I stand up!

W-Wait a minute, "a novelty"?

We used to date before I met Peter.

S-So what are white women to black men?

A very pleasant page in our memory books.

Aw.

Oh, yeah, that's right.
You banged my wife.

She did? Huh.
No wonder I had so much room in there.

Her womb was like one of those places

where they reconstruct crashed airplanes.

Look, Jerome, I-I know
you think we're all terrible,

but white people have done a lot
of good things for the world.

Oh, yeah? Like what?

Well, I'll tell you! Listen up.

hate white people even more.

What about eight more verses?

Let's go, Pam. We're leaving.

But, Dad, Chris treats me really well.

He gave me this diamond necklace.

That's my diamond necklace!

Cool it. I'm trying to get laid.

Look, this ain't happening, Pam.

Straight up.
You ain't swervin' with him,

you ain't gonna shump-a-jump,
you're not hollerin' at him,

you ain't his shorty or his boo.

Oh, my God, Lois,

You're a fool.

I don't think I can live without her.

Hey, here's someone your type.

(FALSETTO) Whoo-wee, Chris! You're cute!

-Stewie, that's Log Cabin.
-Uh, h-he gets the joke.

I'm sorry, Chris.
Jerome just doesn't think

his daughter should date a white guy.

Black racism is the biggest problem
facing this country today.

You know, I should go over there
and fight for Pam.

Absolutely you should.

You should always fight
for what you believe in.

Give me liberty or give me death.

(GUN FIRES)

Oh, that was easy.

I know, right?

Ryan wanted to give him liberty.

You do the paperwork, Ryan.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now the HBO</i>
<i>original series,</i> Boys.

Hey, sorry I slept
with that girl you liked.

Eh, it's cool.

Did you walk around naked
after you had sex?

What? No. No one wants to see that.

Isn't this time in our lives
so interesting?

No.

Griffin! Where the hell
is my daughter?

She left me a note saying
she ran off with Chris.

Oh, my God, Chris?

That dirtbag hangs
around my daughter, too!

I don't have time for your nonsense.
I got to find my daughter.

Look, let me help you!
I'm great at finding stuff.

Last night, I found Lois's G-spot.

-LOIS: No, he didn't!
-I didn't know she was home.

I was able to please her
in other ways, though.

-LOIS: No!
-Okay, let's just go.

My dad's such a jerk.

-I'm glad we ran away.
-Yeah.

So, what do people do in motels?

They get naked.

Okay, but all I know about sex
is from Internet porn,

so I'm very excited to try buffering.

(CHUCKLES) Then I'll leave you alone

to get undressed and under the covers,

and I'll be right back.

Hey, I'm trying to sleep and urinate here.

Do you mind using the other bed?

Sorry.

I was the cousin in <i>Vacation.</i>

Yeah, I know who you are.

(DOOR OPENS)

How do I look?

Oh, God. Are we at that part
of the relationship?

You look fine!

Pam, this may come as a surprise to you,

but I am not an experienced lover.

Don't worry. It's my first time, too.

Wow, I guess everybody has a first time.

Even Maverick from <i>Top Gun.</i>

Thank you, pretty lady!

SO, ALL THOSE OTHER BLACK
DRIVERS THAT YOU'RE NODDING AT,

do you know them?

(SIREN WAILING)

(POLICE RADIO CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Ah, man.

Look, relax.
We'll just tell him the truth.

We're cruising around town

looking for a sexually active
14-year-old boy.

You have any idea how fast you were going?

-I was going the speed limit, Officer.
-He was.

Are you here against your will, sir?

If you're asking if I'd rather
be at the zoo, then yes.

Maybe you step out of the car
and we see if you've been drinking.

(SIGHS)

I'm too fat to be in the car by myself.

The police pull me over
for made-up violations all the time.

You don't know what it's like
to be treated like a criminal.

-What's it like?
-Bad.

Whoa.

I've never broken a law in my life, Peter.

I'm a 42-year-old man,

I own a business, I pay my taxes,

and yet I got to deal with this crap

every time I step outside my house.

Makes me so damn angry,
I don't know what to do with myself.

Well, you should be like me.

Whenever I get angry,
I go do some <i>Footloose</i> dancing.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>You can never, never, never</i>
<i>ever, never, never</i>

<i>Never, ever hide your heart</i>

<i>Don't ever, ever</i>

<i>Ever, ever try</i>

I'm also thinking about ice creams.

<i>Don't give...</i>

Peter, you seem like a nice guy.

I don't mind having you in my bar, man,

but it's different when
it's your baby girl.

I guess. I just have boys.

Forgive me for being a protective father,

but white people have exploited
and mistreated blacks

for centuries, and I'm not gonna
let that happen to Pam.

Wow, we've driven 55 miles
with the gas light on.

(MOANING SOFTLY)

Hold it right there!

Dad! Jerome!

How did you find us?

We didn't. You just told us.

-You okay, honey?
-Dad, I'm fine.

Don't worry. Nothing happened.

I tucked it between my legs
as a joke and then it got stuck.

Look, I'm sorry, Chris,
but we got to respect Jerome's wishes.

Now that I understand
what he's been through,

I realize he's a good man who has reason

to be a little suspicious of Whitey.

Thank you for understanding, Peter.

Jerome is right.
White is white, black is black,

got to keep the races completely separate.

That wasn't exactly my point.

Chris, from now on,
I don't want you

talking to any black people.

How the hell am I supposed
to get through airport security?

We'll figure it out.

It's the least we can do for Jerome.

Isn't that right, Jerome?

Is that the lesson
you want me to learn, Dad?

No, baby.

You know, Peter, maybe I did overreact.

Just 'cause I've experienced
some hard times

doesn't mean this generation
can't teach us a thing or two.

(SIGHS) All right,

if these kids want to date,

then I guess that's okay with me.

It takes a man with a crazy big hog
to admit when he's wrong.

Thanks, Peter.

(BELCHES LOUDLY)

Hey, Jerome,
you want to help me kill Randy Quaid?

Who?

Welcome, all, to James Woods High's'
annual college fair,

where each year, our seniors
gather to decide

where they will go in the fall to get HPV.

Wow, Meg, so many choices.

Yeah. There's a state college

with an incredibly offensive
Native American mascot.

I'm Drunky!

The Dakota University mascot!

Look how drunk I am!

This is important for sports!

(GASPS) Oh, look,
you can go to Oral Roberts.

PETER: Oh, and there's Anal Roberts.

Oh, boy, that is a tough,
tough place to get into, Lois.

That is tough, but once you're in there,
you'd be surprised how much you like it.

Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
So glad you could make it.

You know, Meg has attracted interest
from several colleges.

Meg going to college.

I always thought she was
gonna be one of those ladies

who wears a jean jacket
and hangs out at the bar

in a chain restaurant.

Hey. You know you can get
a slice of pineapple

on your burger here.

Hey, Jimmy, another water.

I call Miller Lite "water."

Jimmy knows me, he knows that.

Come on, hockey team!

This one's on me.

Merry Christmas, Meg.

You really think Meg
is college material,

Principal Shepherd?

Yeah, she's a solid B student

and that's quite an accomplishment,

considering none of her teachers
are willing to sleep with her.

Sophomore year,
she was molested by the janitor.

-Does that help?
-(LAUGHS) Mr. Griffin,

I believe they're called "custodians."

Anyway, I was able to get Meg
an interview this weekend

at Green Mountain College in Vermont.

Green Mountain College?

Oh, my God! That's my first choice!

Can one of you guys take me up there?

Meg, please excuse your mother and I
for a moment.

We need to work out our schedules.

(PETER AND LOIS PUNCHING AND GRUNTING)

I'd be happy to take you, Meg.

I'm trying to read.

Oh, shut up, Brian. We were here first.

Yeah, Brian, go read in your own room!

I don't have my own room.

Yes, you do.
You have that wicker basket

in the laundry room

with the frayed bath mat in it.

God, I can't get any peace and quiet

Big ol' hoot-owl come down,
scoop you up, take your eye out.

All right. Well, can you at least

clean this stuff up when you're done?

Otherwise it's gonna start to smell.

Oh, you don't like smell, huh?

Well, sniff on this!

(YELLS)

all up on you, now!

-Ah! What is that smell?
-(BARKING)

Oh, my God!
Brian got sprayed by a skunk!

No! Not against the wall.

You're gonna scare off the cockroaches.

Oh, that's not good.

They were 70% of the structure
of this house.

Peter, please tell me this is
covered by our insurance.

Sorry, Lois,

it doesn't cover acts of "dog."

(PLAYS RIMSHOT)

Hey, guys, I-I think the tomato juice

is really working. Don't you?

No. You smell like
my six-foot-tall German girlfriend.

Christopher, are you ready
to go to the Guttenschvartzen?

Hell, <i>da!</i>

She can swim across the pool
in two strokes.

I don't know what else to do.

I do.

Until the smell wears off,
you're staying outside!

Outside? Lois, I'm an inside dog!

-I'm an inside dog!
-I'm sorry, Brian,

but you stink.

(CHUCKLES) I'll take smelling good

over walking good any day.

BONNIE: You don't smell good, Joe.

I'm sorry, I thought I was alone.

(SHIVERING)

Morning, Brian.

Ew! You still really stink.

Yeah, you smell like the meatball sub
I left under the couch.

<i>Damn it, I just gave away my hiding place</i>
<i>for meatball subs!</i>

I-I'll tell you where there definitely
aren't any meatball subs,

the side pocket of my golf bag.

<i>Geez, Peter, shut up!</i>

Did you sleep okay out here, Brian?

No! I was so cold. And you have no idea

how many terrifying things
there are out here in the dark.

My nephew, Scrappy Brian,
didn't even make it through the night.

(RUSTLING)

Hey, Uncle Brian,
let's go check out that noise.

I don't know, Scrappy Brian.

It might be better just to stay put.

Aw, I'm not afraid! Let me at 'em!

Let me at 'em!

(SCREECHES)

Damn it! I told my sister
this wasn't a good weekend.

Hey, Bri. How's it going out there?

Oh, boy, I need this cold air.

They got the heat
cranked up so high in here,

Lois is walking around without a shirt.

Oh, come on, Stewie.

Hey, throw me a jacket or something, huh?

Nope. You'll stink it up.

Also, since you've been out there,

I've stopped sneezing,
so this might be permanent.

Well, at least throw me down
some food or something.

Well, I'm afraid I finished my dinner.

All I have is a steak,
but that belongs to Rupert.

Can I have it?

I don't know,
that's a question for Rupert.

You'll have to ask him.

Uh... Hey, Rupe.

"Rupe"? Oh, no. No, no.

No, this is already over.

Come on, Stewie, I'm starving.

Good Lord, Brian, get a hold of yourself.

You're in a suburban yard.

What kind of dog can't live outside?

God, he's right.

I'm a disgrace to my species.

Like that gumball machine traffic cop.

(HORNS HONKING AND ALARMS BLARING)

Oh, my God,
O'Connor's a disaster out there.

It's not his fault.
He was a great gumball machine.

They just shouldn't have promoted him.

Oh, I think we're getting close here.

Meg, what are you doing?

Just letting the wind wave my hand.

Sometimes I like
to pretend that I'm flying.

-Plus, it tickles.
-That's stupid.

(LAUGHING) Hey-hey-hey...

The wind wants my hand to go back,

but I'm not letting it.

I'm stronger than air.

Oh, my God, Dad, you lost your hand!

That's all right. I can regenerate.

(EVIL VOICE) My name is Retep,

Fear me! Ahhh!

Ahhh! I feel so alive!

(EXHALES) I feel like a dude
who just touched his first vagina.

Hey. Pound it.

Cool baby.

Well, I called and confirmed
my interview for tomorrow morning.

I ordered you nothing.

What else is new?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, <i>Night Moves!</i>

At least there's one cool person
in this dump.

-I wonder who played this.
-I did.

You played <i>Night Moves?</i>

How would you even know what that song is?

From you. Dad,
I've been hearing that song

in the backseat of your car
since I was a little kid.

Huh. I never knew you were listening.

Never even knew you were there.

Wait, were you that little
fat boy with the glasses?

Yes, Dad. I know a lot about you.

-You do?
-I know you're afraid of guacamole.

It's the devil's vomit.

In the last election,
you voted for Mighty Mouse.

Time to put the might-mouse
in the White House, Meg.

-And I know you love Augustus Gloop.
-(GIGGLES)

-And you hate Mike Teavee.
-Oh, don't even say his name.

And you know a lot about me, right?

(SIGHS) Dad, sometimes I wonder
why you even had a family.

I don't know, it's just,
I was dating your mother,

I don't like the way condoms feel,
next thing you know,

I got a mortgage, a kid,
and a crappy job at a toy factory.

I thought you liked working
at the toy factory.

Hell no. I always wanted
to be a podiatrist.

Thanks to you, Dr. Griffin,
my bunion is healed

and I can walk without pain.

This isn't a joke.
I once had legitimate aspirations.

You never got to pursue your dream.
No wonder you hate me.

I don't hate you, Meg.

You're my kid.

-Who had the chicken parm?
-Oh, that's my second entree.

But you know what?
You have it, Meg.

Thanks, Dad.

Boy, after all this food,

we're gonna have a couple of "night moves"

back at the motel later, huh, Dad?

Oh, absolutely.

Well, here we are.

Oh, my God, Meg, there's a keg party!

Let's go. If we meet any chicks,
you're my daughter.

-Yes!
-Yeah! College!

Oh, God, I got to take a whiz.

Yeah, I got to whiz, too.

(GIGGLES) Sword fight!

Gonna get ya!

You got a funny little wiener,
but you're a nice guy, Meg.

-This is great, Dad.
-I know!

I'm having even more fun than when I...

I mean, than when
<i>we</i> went Fiona Apple-picking.

Dad, they're all bruised and filthy.

Yeah, these might be
throwin'-at-buses apples,

not eatin' apples. See, Meg?

'cause we're friends now.

(WIND BLOWING)

Hey, Brian. (SNIFFS)

Hey, you don't even smell
like skunk anymore.

Why are you still out here?

There's nothing inside for me anymore.

I've moved on. (HAWKS AND SPITS)

There was a boo-ger in that spit,
wasn't there?

Stewie, leave me alone.

This is where I belong,

out here in the wild.

You're standing on the driveway.

-Come on.
-Hey, hey! Let go of me!

I can't believe it.
You've become a wild animal.

Meg, how was your interview?

Ah, we didn't go.

I slept right through it.

-What?
-Yeah, it was awesome.

We stayed up all night partying.

By the way,
if a girl named Rachel calls,

it's a wrong number,
but do tell me that she called.

Where's your wedding ring?

Yeah, so we missed the interview,
so that's a shame.

Meg, how could you miss your interview?

That school was your first choice.

-(PHONE RINGS INSIDE HOUSE)
-I'll get it!

It doesn't matter, Mom.

Dad and I had a great time.

We went to a party!

We bonded for the first time in our lives.

It was just Joe.

Meg, how could you blow your chance
to go to your first-choice college?

I can't believe
you would be so irresponsible.

Hey, Meg, you want to huck
some water balloons at nerds?

Sure!

What the hell?

-(GIGGLES)
-(MIMICS GIGGLE POORLY)

We'll work on the laugh,
but you'll get there.

Huh, look down there.

That looks like me with a green shirt.

He's murdering a lady.

(RETEP LAUGHS SINISTERLY)

Dinner's getting cold.

I wonder where your father and Meg are.

They left for the movies five hours ago.

God, look at Lois picking food
from her teeth with her nail.

Someone should tell her she's a pig.

Mom, you're a pig!

No, you're not supposed
to actually do it!

We were just talking here!

Oh, now she's crying.
That's not what I wanted.

Stop crying, you bitch!

(GROANS) I got to get Brian
back in the house.

It's just not the same without him here.

It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger
without an accent.

It might be a tumor.

(AMERICAN ACCENT) It's not a tumor.

Where are you two going now?

We're going two places,
none of yo and beeswax.

Clean slam! Come on, Meg!

Meg, I'm glad you're having
a good time with your father,

but don't let him distract you
from your priorities.

Remember, you still have
a chance to get into college.

Mom, we're just having fun.

I've never had a good time
with Dad before.

I'm just saying, it's not easy

dealing with your father's craziness.

Believe me, this is no job

for the family's designated <i>schmendrick.</i>

Trust me, Mom.
I know what I'm doing.

That's what your father said

before he took that walking tour
of Providence.

This is where a homeless man
ate the finger

of another homeless man.

This is where some teenagers
beat a gay guy to death.

This building used to be Irish.
Now it's Cambodian.

And this is where fake tour guides
throw rocks

and steal tourists' wallets.

Oh, yeah, I read about this part on Yelp.

PETER: (QUIETLY) Meg.

Meg.

Come on.

(OSTRICH SQUAWKING)

Come on, it'll be fun.

(GIGGLES) Isn't this great, Meg?

(PANTING)

Sorry I forgot to get you an ostrich.

All right, Meg, you and me

are gonna get something pierced together.

I'll get my ear done. How about you?

Um, I guess my ears would be okay.

Oh, come on, Meg, you're my daughter.

Nothing but the best for you.

You're getting the works!

Here, I want everything you got.

Only the best for my daughter Meg.

Ah, look at that.

You look like one of them
beautiful, troubled

Scandinavian youths
I've seen on the porn sites.

-You like it?
-(MUFFLED) Mmm-hmm.

Awesome. Come on, let's go next door

and get your mom
a funny refrigerator magnet.

I got a piercing, too.

Hey, Lois, guess who made
15 baskets in a row

at the county fair.

Some kid we beat up.
Oh, what a great day!

-Had enough yet?
-Yes!

I don't know how you do it.
Everything he does is exhausting.

Even something as simple
as going to the bank.

Meg, you've probably wondered
from time to time

how on earth I pay for all my shenanigans.

Well, I'm gonna show you.

This is a robbery!
Everybody get on the (BLEEP) ground!

If this bitch moves, shoot him in the eye!

Dad, I don't want to do this!

You have to!
Next week, we're buying a zebra!

-Dad!
-There's no time to argue!

We got 150 seconds

before the police respond
to the silent alarm!

Now check those bags for dye packs!

(CRYING)

Who's the manager here?

-I-I am.
-(WAILING)

What are you doing?

You said if he moves, shoot him!

He's the only one
with the combination to the safe!

It's blown! It's blown!
This whole operation is blown!

I'll get the car. Kill everyone else.

You've got to help me, Mom.

What do you want me to do?

Please, take him back.

I suppose I could, Meg.

But a part of growing up
is learning how to handle

a tough situation on your own,
like getting into college

or breaking up with your father.

I guess, but it's not gonna be easy.

Well, life's not always easy, Meg.

Just ask an ugly Boy Scout.

Scoutmaster Davenport, you want
to share a tent with me tonight?

Oh, Billy, I like you as a friend.

Brian, you got to get in here, man.

I've been taking a break
from Lois's breast milk,

and her boobs are enormous.

They're like Jiffy Pop
just before the foil breaks.

You should come check 'em out
before they get infected.

Yeah, nice try, Stewie,
but I'm still not coming inside.

But, Brian, I need you inside.

I'm going crazy in here without you.

Please, I need my friend back.

Look, Stewie,
I've learned something out here.

You see, living in the wild,
I-I've realized

that all the pain I've ever had in my life

has-has come from me always
trying to be something I'm not.

I mean, I'm not a writer,
I'm not an artist,

I'm not an intellectual.

What I am is a dog.

And as a dog, my place is outside.

I'm sorry, Stewie,

but nothing will ever make me
come back inside.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

Stewie, get the hell in here!

(CHUCKLES)

That dog sure changed his mind quick.

Oh, Meg, there you are!

Hey, let's put on fake eyelashes

and flirt with people on the bus.

Dad, I'm sorry, but I can't go with you.

Mmm, are you sure?

I called Green Mountain College.

They let me reschedule my interview,

so I'm gonna drive back up there.

It's time for me
to get serious about my life

and take some responsibility.

I don't like this Meg.

I like the fun Meg!

I thought we were friends.

Dad, I don't need you to be my friend.

I need you to be my father.

Well, that is too much to ask, Meg.

It's hard being a father.

This is why that woman in Texas
drowned all her kids.

I hate the passage of time!

(SOBBING) My little girl's growing up!

(CRYING)

Yes, she is, Dad.

Yes, she is.

Hey guys, can I share
something with you?

-Sure.
-Yeah. Go ahead.

Well, you know how I don't ever
brag about my sexual exploits.

That would be an accurate statement, yes.

Well, last night,
Bonnie and I got really kinky.

She painted my toenails.
(GIGGLES)

-Wha...
-You serious?

Check it out.

-What the hell is that?
-Nail polish.

No. The foot.

It's a child's foot, Joe.

Wha... I-I don't... you-you were
crippled when you were an adult.

-How the hell did...
-Yeah.

A few months back, I got really drunk

and was playing around
with an elastic band.

I wrapped it around my thigh
and forgot about it

for a week or two and uh, yeah,
so, that's my left foot now.

(SIGHS)
I mean, it still works the same.

Oh, yeah, sure.

Still a foot, I guess.

-Oh, hey, Cleveland.
-Hi.

Wait, don't you have a show to do?

(LAUGHS) Oh... That's right.

All right. I knew this was coming.

Everybody give me your best shot.

Oh, my God. Where do I even begin?

You know, it's not a good sign
that this is the first time

a lot of people are realizing
you had a show.

Your logo was stupid.

It looked like a big, purple penis

and your ratings blew.

We did about the same as <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

That's your bar!

Oh, shame on you!

This is good. This is constructive.

The talking bear was so bad,

Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him
after season two.

It's hard to make
a talking bear funny.

(LAUGHING) It worked out
okay in movie form.

What was supposed to be
the show's audience?

Who did you make it for?
Like, some black guy

who's never met another black guy?

-Anything else?
-Yeah.

Here's four seasons worth of
DVDs of what we've been up to.

You know, just so you're
back up the speed.

And I'll warn you ahead of time:
these have jokes in them.

I...

Okay, but I still

I... I wouldn't know.

because they make
you sound good.

You know, Cleveland,
it must be weird

for you guys to move and
not 'cause of a hurricane.

Oh, Lois, I'm so glad to see

Peter and Cleveland
back together again.

Yeah, me too.

Now Peter will have something
to do besides flushing the toilet

And we need a faster toilet.

'Sup, man?

Yeah, yeah, "sup."

Keep walkin', you <i>Boondocks</i> rip-off.

Home, sweet... Huh?

This house is a disastrous area!

I can't move my family in here.

You're right.

Well, we'll all have to do our part.

I'll take little cocoa butter here.

(LAUGHS)

What the hell happened?

Well, a lot of people
rented your house.

Uh, Ryan Reynolds,

Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd...

For a while, it was an orphanage
where the children sang desolate songs.

<i>We're too old to ever be adopted</i>

<i>No one wants a nine-year-old.</i>

PETER: Shut up, you bastards!

I really appreciate y'all
helpin' me fix up my house.

Yeah, no problem, Cleveland.

Hey, where do you want me to put
all these giraffe figurines?

Just spread 'em out.

Don't make any one
room too giraffey.

Cleveland, where should
I hang the mirror?

-Right about here?
-Maybe a little higher.

Oh, like, uh, up here?

I think maybe higher.

You don't want it too high, now.

Let's get you a different job, Joe.

Are you sure?

'Cause I already hung
all these paintings.

This place is shaping up real nice.

Hey, Cleveland, what's that?

Oh, this is my bead door.

It looks stupid.

Why don't you walk through it?

How do you feel?

Awesome!

Like a suitcase comin' out of the airport.

Yeah, or like a bug

walkin' through Stevie Wonder's hair.

Turns out this old house is
lacking in storage space,

so I gotta make some tough decisions.

You gonna keep these neckties?

Yeah, throw 'em in my car.

They're just to keep my trunk closed

what if I'm ever haulin' garbage.

I ain't no lawyer.

I use whatever for my purposes.

Could be a box spring.

Could be a old radio.

Could be a more recent radio...

Wait, now I'm confused.

So... so some of this stuff isn't trash?

Like this old computer monitor?

Nah, that's a sittin' chair,
what for children.

How about this telephone cord?

That's a pet leash.

If the good Lord decideth
we should have one.

I'm gonna go ahead and ditch

these promotional McDonald's cups
from the 80's.

Nah, that's all we drink from.

That's the Riddler right there.

He would make inquiries
to set your mind a-jumble.

How do you live in a
house with all this junk?

I'd rather stay in a
house with small kids.

So you can sleep on the couch.

Uh, please take
the potty seat off the toilet,

don't try to pee through it.

There's juice boxes in the fridge

and if you get hungry,
there's plenty of Goldfish in the couch.

Um, feel free to watch
TV with the sound off.

And the kids will be down here

first thing in the morning
to antagonize the dogs.

Oh, and everyone here has pinkeye.

"...and that was the moment
I stopped being Dwayne Johnson

Together, you and I
make one biracial wrestler.

-No.
-That's all right. I'll use this.

-Folding chair!
-Ow!

DONNA: What was that?

(GASPS)

That was my great-grandma's vase!

On the drive up from Virginia,

she kept that vase 'tween her legs.

W-What are you doing?

Ow! It hurts!

It hurts!

I can't believe Japanese men

pay good money for this.

Mom! Mrs. Brown spanked me!

What?

And you still haven't
pulled up your pants?

Chris, what happened?

I was playing with Rallo
and I broke a vase

and then she gave me a spanking!

Uh, I believe the term
is "whuppin'," Chris.

God, look at the size
of that handprint.

It's like Doctor J.

Peter, this is serious!

A woman hit our child!

What is wrong with her?

Whoa, can I get some white bread
on that judgmental sandwich?

Brian, why are you
bringing race into this?

Lois, I've spent my life trying
to keep race out of things.

That's why whenever I walk into Lids,
every guy fist-bumps me.

Oh, you're full of crap, Brian.

I'm just saying, Lois, some of us go
through life without seeing color.

That's because you're
color blind, Brian.

You're right. I am color blind.

Here...

and here.

Hey, remember when you
swallowed that rib-eye bone

and you couldn't poop it out?

And then you pushed real hard and
the poo came through the rib eye hole?

Peter, we gotta go over there and
talk to Donna.

All right, but you need
to cool down first, Lois.

Find a way to channel your anger.

What I do is throw
a shot put into a crowd

and make it look like an accident.

(GRUNTS)

I forgot to make it look like an accident.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

That woman is gonna be sorry

she laid her hands on our son.

Hello.

Hi, j-just so you know,
this is sort of Lois's thing.

I-I'm not really upset about it.
So... go ahead, dear.

Donna, what gives you
the right to spank my child?

It always smells like
the same meal over here.

I hit him for a reason.
He broke my vase.

And maybe I wouldn't have
to discipline your child

if you did it yourself!

Oh, please!

The only thing kids
learn from spanking

is adults don't have the
patience to teach them.

-Bull honkey.
-What?

I don't spank,
and my children are very well-behaved.

Oh, yeah?

Your baby's on the roof right now.

Stewie!

You get down from there this instant!

Munch me, bitch!

Right now, Stewie, or you're in time-out!

How many gray pubes you pluck today,
you old bag?

Your time-outs are a joke.
You're a terrible parent.

I'm a terrible parent?
You're a child abuser!

You know what?

From now on,
I don't want our families

having anything to do
with each other!

Well, Cleveland, looks like
these two little alley cats

have scrapped it out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

That includes you, Peter.

I don't want you ever
talking to Cleveland again.

And Cleveland, I forbid you
from ever talking to Peter again!

Hey, Lois, look!

I'm smoking!

You can't control dick!

I'm a roof baby now!

So we're making plans
for Susie's first birthday party.

Oh, that's good bar talk.

Hey, y'all.

Oh, oh, uh, sorry,
Peter, I'll...

I'll get outta here.

No, no, no, no,
I'll go. I'll go. It's okay.

What's goin' on?

You guys touch pee-pees or something?

I wish.

No, our wives got in a big fight

and banned us from
seeing each other.

So what if they're in a fight?

What does that have to do with you?

Well, I gotta live with Donna.

Uh-oh. There she is.

-Oh, no!
-Peter, quick!

Change pigments!

That was close.

Peter, we can't risk
seeing each other.

But, Cleveland, you and I are
pals, and I just got you back.

Well, there might be one solution.

We just got to hang out where
there's no chance we'll be seen.

You know, keep it a secret.

Then that's what we'll do.

'Cause I can't lose you again, Cleveland.

I'm closer to you than
I am to my own right hand.

Oh, my God, you like scrambled eggs, too?

Here, go ahead, have some.

Whoa, that's a big bite there.

Slow down, buddy.

(MAKES CHOKING SOUNDS)

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! He's choking!

Thanks for coming.

Thank you... Thank you...
Thanks for coming.

Why you thought
it was appropriate

to show up here, Cheryl,
I have no idea.

Are you sure this is
the best solution, Peter?

I just figured a plane
is a safe place

where you and I can hang out
and not be seen by our wives.

Oh, that makes sense.
So, what have you been up to?

Yup, sorry, Cleveland, I'm gonna
have to cut you off there.

Whenever I ride on a plane,

I have to put on my
noise-cancelling head phones.

Leaves me alone
with nothing but my thoughts.

Ah, dang it!

Do you have any idea how
fast you were going, sir?

Peter?

Hey, Cleveland,
this is just so we can talk

without getting spotted
by Lois and Donna.

I need you to step out of the car, sir.

Peter, there's got to be a better way...

-He's got a knife!
-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

Sorry, Cleveland,
it's got to be authentic.

-Ow! Ow!
-Stay down! Stay down!

Cleveland, try to grab my gun.

Oh, trying to grab my gun, are you?

Ow! Ow!

Hey, rookie, save some for me.

Wow, the whole gang's back together.

Shut up!

We don't need you in this town!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

(WHISPERING)
We don't need you in this town.

Oh, oh, oh, hi, Lois.

-You were with Cleveland, weren't you?
-No!

Then what were you doing?

I'm, uh...

I'm having an affair.

-That's ridiculous.
-It's not ridiculous.

It's Cybill Shepherd.

She's attainable for a guy like me now.

Peter, enough lies.

I know you were with Cleveland.

Until further notice,
you can sleep downstairs.

Aw, man.

I wonder how it's going
for Cleveland.

'cause she caught me

How about you?

Mom's making me sleep
in the basement.

Sleeping lower in the house is
a big punishment for her.

Well, this isn't working.

I can't keep sneaking around

trying to hang out with Cleveland.

Maybe you could figure out a way to get

Mom and Mrs. Brown to be friends.

Yeah, you know, I bet I can.

I mean, I'm the guy who figured
out how much eye contact

a band should make during a guitar solo.

Yeah, we're in sync,
and showing others

how much we love the song.

Okay, okay, it's time
to turn away now, Vince.

Come on, we got a lot of song left!

Turn away! Look at something else!

I'm glad you didn't listen.

Chris is right.

I got to do something.

All right, Cleveland, nothing
bonds women together like

having to take care of invalid
husbands in the hospital.

-What?
-Don't die!

(CLEVELAND SCREAMS)

(CRYING) Oh, Cleveland,

I'm gonna hate those Griffins forever.

Only my side had airbags.

Peter, what are we doing here?

Well, women will
always band together

to stop an offensive art
exhibit from coming to town.

So I've arranged for all
my photos of baby wieners

to be put on display.

Oh, Peter, I'm gonna have
to call the police on this.

What? Why?

It's to get our wives back together!

Peter, these are hundreds
of naked babies

in suggestive situations!

And they're time-stamped
as far back as 1998,

which is way before we had this idea!

(CRYING) I need help!

All right, Cleveland, one thing
that always bonds women

is healing an abused animal.

So I got us an injured bald eagle.

Somebody put cigarettes out all over him.

Peter, that's a symbol of our country.

This particular eagle is a dick.

Everything out of its mouth is a taunt.

Peter, you're being ridiculous.

And you need to release
that eagle out into the...

(SQUAWKS)

What'd that eagle say?

(SQUAWKS)

Lock the door.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

Peter, let's just give Susie her gift,

eat our cake and leave.

I don't want to be here
with that Brown family.

That sounds even more racist than it is.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

The Great Quagini!

Hey-ey, everybody!
There's the birthday girl!

Oh, oh, what's that
behind your ear?

Oh, it's a condom!

Quagmire, please stop touching
my baby with a condom.

And for my next trick, I'm gonna split
my beautiful assistant in half.

And not the way you think.
(LAUGHS)

Won't be needing this.

Okay, time for the three-legged race.

Pair up, everyone.

All right, Peter, let's do it.

You're my three-legged race partner.

No, Lois, I'm not gonna be your partner.

What?

I'm gonna be partners with Cleveland.

Peter, I told you...

And I'm telling you,
Cleveland and I have won

every three-legged race
in Quahog except that time

those two one-legged guys formed
the perfect running person.

Cleveland, what do you think you're doing?

Peter's right.

We're friends and that's that.

This whole fight is ridiculous.

Now, let's go win a race with no prize.

(CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING, APPLAUDING)

On your mark...

get set... go!

Did you see that? My dog had a gun.

How are we doing?

Are we beating anyone?

I waited too long to pick a partner.

(PETER GROANING)

Oh, my God! Peter, are you okay?

I'm down! I'm down, Cleveland!

Go on without me! Save yourself!

No, I won't leave you.

We started this race together,
we're gonna finish it together.

I'm gonna carry you, Peter!

(GRUNTING)

Oh, my God, Peter.

I-I can't pick you up.
How much do you weigh?

I don't know.

My car can't go up hills, though.

Well, then there's only one solution.

Hug and roll!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Boy, those fools sure do love each other.

Yeah, I... I guess they do.

You know, Donna, they've
known each other

a lot longer than we have.

That's true.

And if we're gonna be neighbors,

we're gonna have to learn to
set aside our differences.

Friends?

Friends.

<i>We now return to Jeremy Piven</i>

<i>as </i>The Incredible Hulk.

<i>You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.</i>

<i>I don't like you now.</i>

Brian, I need the TV.

Why is Rupert wearing a top hat?

Because, Brian, tonight we sup on
the finest feast of the television season.

It is the season finale
of <i>The Cadwalliders of Essex.</i>

-The what?
<i>-The Cadwalliders</i><i>of Essex.</i>

It's groundbreaking.

It's a British show about a wealthy family
dealing with slight change.

Oh, I thought that got cancelled.

No, that was <i>The Caduggans</i>
<i>of Aubrey Muse.</i>

Is that the one where even
the children have muttonchops?

No, that's <i>The Whittakers</i>
<i>of Edgerton Crescent.</i>

All these shows sound the same.

Who's in this one?

Penelope Westworth-Harrington.

Who's that?

Penelope Westworth-Harrington?
Oh, come on!

From <i>The Roysters of Pumbridge on Thames?</i>

Her uncle was steward
to the Queen's Privy!

(SIGHS)

She got plowed on a pile
of hay in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

Oh, yeah. Yeah. She's hot.

Ugh, you're an idiot.

Like a guy who cheats
on his right hand with his left hand.

I want to stay, but I just got called
back into the office.

What do you want from me?

I'm sorry, all right?

Just get off my back!

I'm out of here.

God, it took me forever to get awa...

(GUNSHOT)

Oh, my God! No!

What have you done?!

Wait! Stop!

No, please! I'm begging you!

(GUNSHOT)

(SOBBING)

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER TV)

Oh, it's starting!

I'm gonna live-tweet the show

and ruin it for everyone
in other time zones.

I would like to learn
to bathe myself.

Everything I've ever heard is vexing.

Oh! Oh!

This is the fastest-moving
episode I've ever seen!

Wouldn't it be marvelous

to be a part of a family like that?

Ah-ha, I found that chick in the hay.

PETER AND CHRIS (CHANTING):
Unga bunga, unga bunga,

unga bunga.

What is that? What's happening?

Unga bunga, unga bunga, unga bunga.

-Peter, what are you doing?
-Playing Unga Bunga.

-It's the championship.
-Go away!

This is why Zillow estimates
our house at $4.00.

What the hell is Unga Bunga?

Two guys run at each other

with mattresses, and, um...

th-that's kind of it.

Stop explaining it to the dog!

Let's do this!

(YELLING WILDLY)

Stop it! I'm trying to watch my program!

Whoa, Chris, look! Mom's naked!

Where?

You creep.

(GASPS) No!

Peter, what's going on in...

-Unga Bunga!
-(CRASHING)

You... you imbeciles!

You ruined my night!

I ask for one thing in this house!

Stewie, just watch your show upstairs.

I don't want to watch it
upstairs on the small TV!

I want to watch it
downstairs on the big TV!

(SNIFFLING)

I want to watch my show!

(CRYING, SCREAMING)

Oh, no, Stewie's having a tantrum.

Come here, sweetie.

Ow!

Screw you, you little turd!

(CRYING)

What's all that noise?

Aw, do you want a hug
from your big sister?

Ow!

You've earned yourself
a time-out, young man.

Now, you stay in here
until you can behave.

I hate you!
You always ruin everything!

God, it's a family of idiots!

I wish... I wish I was never born!

Not tonight, Rupert.

I'm much too upset.

Knock, knock.

Stewie?

Hey, I just wanted to check
on how you're doing, buddy.

You put on quite a show last night.

I am done with this family.

They don't deserve me.
They're all just...

Oh, you dick, you just came in
to charge your phone.

Sorry, Peter's using
all the outlets.

Toast house.

Whatever. I'm gonna be
out of this place soon anyway.

What, are you running away from home?

Better.

What the hell?

You rebuilt your time machine?

I thought you swore off time travel,

'cause you couldn't stop
yourself from altering the past.

Look, Brian, I need this machine
to alter the past for the better.

What do you mean?
I loathe this family.

Being born into it was clearly
some sort of cosmic mistake,

so I'm going back in time
to prevent that mistake.

I'm going to break up Lois
and the fat man

before they can conceive me.

Stewie, it's one TV show.

You're overreacting.

It's not just the TV show, Brian.

I'm tired of living with morons.

Remember when I tried to open
that lemonade stand with Chris?

All right, that'll be ten cents.

Chris, pour the man his lemonade.

CHRIS: I can't!

The lemonade tricked me
and got away!

Lemons are God's children!

And the fat man won't even let me

celebrate a proper birthday.

Happy birthday, Stewie!

And here's your
equal-attention cake, Peter.

-Yay!
-Oh, come on!

Yay! Double wishes!

One...

Two.

And Meg's the biggest pig of all.

MEG: Great.

The string broke again.

Hey, there, tiny hands.

Look, Stewie, I know
you're angry about last night,

but you're talking about
erasing your existence.

That's crazy.

<i>(BARRACUDA</i> RINGTONE PLAYS)

Whose ringtone is "Barracuda"?

Oh, God, that's Frumpy Ann.

Frumpy Ann does everything.

Look, I-I got to get this call,
but don't do anything stupid.

Yo, girl, how you livin'?

Ugh.

All right, Rupert, prepare to time travel.

Oh, and by the way,
thanks for asking me

if I wanted something
from Subway, too.

Where am I?

This looks like my room,
but something's off.

Oh, that's right, this isn't my room yet.

Wonder what they're using it for.

Oh, my God, he had
a public access show?

Live from the shores
of Rhode Island,

it's the fatty who drives you batty!

Peter Griffin!

(APPLAUSE)

Hey, hey, hey, douche bags!

We got a great show
for you tonight.

Karen Washington from
the Rhode Island Zoo

and some rejected toys
you're not gonna believe.

So stick around, or...

STUDIO AUDIENCE:
I'll come to your house and murder you!

She is camel toe-ing
the hell out of that leotard.

All right, Rupert, time to
break up Lois and the fat man

before they can conceive me
by pressing butts together.

Well, you don't know, either!

Hey, Lois, I drawed you a picture.

It's me and you on the space moon,

'cause I would love you anywhere.

Oh, Peter. I'd love you anywhere, too.

Wow, Peter and Lois were really in love
before I was born.

And this is me getting you from behind,

'cause in space no one
can hear you scream.

(LAUGHS) Oh, Peter!

Breaking them up may prove to be
more difficult than I thought.

Though I've faced
bigger challenges before.

Like when I had to ride
that bike in <i>The Muppet Movie.</i>

(FOLKSY MUSIC PLAYS)

That's right.

Stewie Long Legs just blew your mind.

All right, Rupert,
now to break up my parents.

The number one thing
couples fight about is money.

So I've maxed out Lois's credit card
on vibrating marital aids.

Peter, there's an open box
in the kitchen

addressed to me
with nothing inside.

(VIBRATING) Uh, yeah, when I
opened it up, it was empty.

Well, that's very strange,

because it looked large
enough to hold many items.

-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-(VIBRATING) It's the mailman!

-I'll get it!
-No! Me! I'll get it!

(VIBRATING)
Huh. Maybe I had more in common

with this family than I thought.

Oh, my God, Peter!

What happened to your hair?

I don't know. I...

I'm bald!

You did this!

What the hell's the matter with you?

I didn't do it, but...
but you look really cool.

I do?

Yeah, you look like you
could be a celebrity.

Hey, can I get your autograph?

Oh, of course, here you go.

They think I'm Bruce Willis.

That was the monster from <i>Goonies!</i>

None of my attempts
to break them up

has worked thus far,
so I had to up our game.

Lois, what the hell did you do?

I just got a note from Goodwill
thanking me for donating all my porn.

What?
I'm sick and tired of you blaming me

for things I didn't do!

And I've got a bone
to pick with you!

I don't appreciate how you spray-painted
"vile woman" on the bedroom wall.

That wasn't me!

Must've been one of the kids!

That's ridiculous, Peter!

Chris can't write,

and we don't allow Meg upstairs!

Well, you know something,
I'm starting to think

whoever wrote that is right!

Well, maybe I don't want
to live with someone

who doesn't respect me!

Well, then maybe I should just leave!

And where are you gonna go?

You got nothing else
and nobody else!

And now for the closer.

(HONKS)

I might go west.

My God, I've done it, Rupert!

They've broken up!

(GASPS) Look!

It's working.

I'm fading away!

Well, Rupert, this means
you and I will never have met.

So I've got to tell you one thing:

you know that song I wrote you
for Valentine's Day?

It's an Eric Carmen song.

I completely ripped it off.

Ah. Ah, now I feel better.

(STEWIE GROANS)

STEWIE: Wha...

What the devil?

What's going on? Where am I?

DOCTOR: It's a boy!

STEWIE: I'm in a hospital.

My soul must have
found another carrier.

I've been reborn!

(BRITISH ACCENT)
Welcome to the world, baby chap.

(GASPS) I'm British?

All right!

Ooh, I wonder if I'll have one of those

that licks its own snot all day.

Ew, that's gross.

(COCKNEY ACCENT)
Piss off, you little wanker.

I'm not gonna be the dog
to some poof baby.

Well, lad, welcome to your home.

Well, this is more like it.

This is your valet, your gardener,

your cook, your gamekeeper,
your butler, your housekeeper,

your parlor maid, your housemaid,

your scullery maid,
your shoe de-graveler

and one superfluous employee

who I am not in a gay
relationship with.

Sir, we have a meeting
in the broom shed.

Quite right.

I will now hand you
over to your mother.

This will be our last physical contact
until I give you a firm handshake

on your 18th birthday.

My God, this is everything
I've ever wanted.

And let's be honest, if I had
stayed with the Griffins,

I would have ended up like
Rick Springfield today.

<i>I wish that I had Jesse's job.</i>

(SIGHS)

Sir, it's 6:00 p.m.

and you're still in your 5:45 tuxedo.

Nigel, yesterday I saw you smile.

Is that something I need
to bring up with my father?

I was just imagining
my own death, sir.

You're a good man, Nigel.

May I pull on your nose hair?

Of course, sir.

(LAUGHING)

My heavens, my father
is the Commander

of the Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire,

Dean of Physics at Oxford,

and he was pre-approved for
a Capital One No-Hassle Card.

Oh, okay, so he's just
framing everything.

Stewart, these are
your brothers, Jaden and Aidan.

Jaden was first form
in his sixth levels

and he's chief scrum-flanker
on his varsity boogling team,

which, as far as we know,
makes us terribly proud.

Finally, siblings who are doing stuff.

I'm really happy to meet you guys.

You were an accident.

You're only here because
Father is a heavy sleeper

with a frequent morning stem.

Okay. Aidan's the ball-breaker,
huh, Jaden?

Father, is "it" going
to live here for a while?

Oh, Aidan is the nice one.

Well, if it's verbal jousting
skills you're looking for,

I'm not afraid to take a little
walk on the Oscar Wilde side.

You are a poopy head.

And you... shut up.

Stewart, I think your mouth is better

at taking things in
than spewing them out.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Wow, these guys are a little
sharper than my old family.

I still remember
our Duck Duck Goose disaster.

Duck.

Duck. Duck.

Duck.

Duck. Duck.

Duck.

Duck. Duck.

Duck... Duck.

Sorry I couldn't squeeze
no more juice outta me nippers.

Oh, that's all right.

I can't be mad at someone who
lost seven sons in the war.

All right, my little lord,
it's time for bed.

Why isn't Mommy tucking me in?

Oh, hush, love, you're born now.

That's the end of all
this "Mommy" nonsense.

(HOWLING)

What the hell?

I don't even get a stuffed animal to hug?

The only thing in this crib

is a 19th-century dueling pistol.

(SCREAMS) It's loaded?

BRITISH NOBLEMAN: Who dares to
shoot the bow tie off my cat?

We duel at dawn!

I'm just a baby!

So am I!

Good Lord, what have I done?

I don't like it here at all!

I miss my family!

My dumb family!

Dear God.

I wanted to be free
of the family of morons

I was born into, but now I'm the moron!

Sir, I heard whimpering.

Shall I fetch your crying tuxedo?

No! I don't want any more tuxedos!

And I don't want a cold mother

or an Oxford physics professor father.

(GASPS)

Wait a minute! That's it!

The Oxford physics lab will have
everything I need to build a time machine.

Then I can go back to my old life!

Ah, ah! Stone floor, too cold.

I'll go in the morning.

Let's see, I need plutonium
for the time machine.

But how do I get past those guards?

Oh, wait, that's right.
I'm in England.

I can just walk past them
holding a cup of tea.

-Morning.
-Morning.

-Morning.
-Morning.

-Morning.
-Morning.

-Morning.
-Morning.

Did you see something
suspicious about that baby?

Well, I did at first,

but then he's got the tea
vouching for him, doesn't he?

Almost there.

Just a few more adjustments.

-BRITISH FATHER: Stewart!
-(GASPS)

What are you doing?

All right, Rupert, I left the fat man's
entire porn collection

on the curb for Goodwill to pick up.

(SCREAMS)

-(GASPS) Who the devil are you?
-I'm British Stewie.

I don't hear anything different.

I sound the same,

but I spell some words very differently.

Let me write the word "color"
on a piece of paper for you.

(GASPS)

Dear God! You are British!

Listen to me.

You successfully prevented
your own birth,

and instead you were born
into an alternate family.

But you must believe me,
the Griffins are your true destiny.

No, they're not. They're morons.

But they're your morons,
and they care about you.

Besides, you shine
among these dullards.

Like Bob Weir in The Grateful Dead.

That joke's for one of our crew guys,
Matty.

He loves The Dead and he's,
uh... he's not doing so well.

We love ya, Captain Trips.
Hang in, bro.

Well, I do like being
better than everyone else.

LOIS: Peter, I had nothing to do
with donating your stupid porn!

If what you're telling me is true,

we can't let them separate.

If Peter leaves, I'll be unborn!

Well, she's not gonna stop him.

She's furious. (GASPS)

You're right! And if I know her,
she'll be heading to the fridge

for her angry afternoon Chardonnay.

I've got an idea!

Okay, there it is.

Noon.

Oh, no! He's leaving!

I'm... I'm fading away!

Peter, wait!

What? You want to yell
at me some more?

No, I want to tell you I'm sorry.

I... I don't want you to leave.

Why should I stay if
you don't even trust me?

I do trust you, Peter.

I don't know what's
gotten into us lately.

The important thing is,
we're meant to be together.

I love you, Peter.

Aw, I love you, too, Lois.

I'm glad we're staying together.

Honestly, I-I don't know
what I would do on my own.

Like, I literally have no
idea where food comes from.

I-Is it that guy?

Is he the food man?

No, Peter, it's not him.

They're making up!

It's working!

That means soon you will not exist.

Then I guess this is good-bye, Stewie.

I'll miss you.

You've taught me so much.

And you've been a good friend.

And you as well.

Ah! Damn it!

Help me, Stewie! Lift it off!

Eh, that looks really heavy.

It is! And it's incredibly painful!

Please, help!

You know, you'll be fading away
any moment, you know?

It'd be a lot of effort
ultimately for nothing.

I'm choking on my own blood! (GURGLES)

Call someone! Please!

Well, again, it was great knowing you.

Ah! You bastard!

You'll burn in hell...

Ugh, finally.

That was an ordeal.

I... I did it!

I'm back.

Aw, damn it.

I left my ChapStick in the past.

ChapStick!

With smooth lips, I will finally be able

to be a mayor who kisses babies
with confidence!

Hey, cracked lips!

You'll see!

You'll all see!

Ooh, scrambled eggs! How delightful.

Thank you, Lois.

Well, you're certainly in a better mood

since last night's tantrum.

You know, Brian, I've realized
this is where I belong.

For better or worse, I'm a Griffin.

(DOOR CRASHES)

Coward! I have found you!

Ah!

Well, it took three years,

but I am finally through all that porn.

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to the</i> All in the Family

<i>and</i> Modern Family
<i>crossover episode.</i>

Hello, Mr. Bunker.
We brought some hummus.

Oh, yeah,
I knew them two was hummus

the minute they
walked in the door.

Yay! A crossover always
brings out the best in each show!

It certainly doesn't
smack of desperation.

The priorities are always creative,

and not driven by marketing or...

Okay, that's enough.

-Oh, my God!
-What is it, Peter?

Look at this. Dennis the Menace
is just shoveling snow.

He's being helpful.

Might as well just call it Dennis now.
He's not a menace.

Not every strip is
gonna be hilarious.

You know something?
I could do better than these idiots.

I should just go down to the paper
and sell them my own.

Well, Peter,
you might be underestimating

the difficulty of
writing a comic strip.

As someone who occasionally
dates the creative muse,

I can vouch for the unforgiving face
of a blank sheet of paper.

In fact, I think it was
William Faulkner who said...

I'm back. I'm published.
Check it out.

I call my comic
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

because it points out things that make you
shake your head and say,

"For Pete's sake."

This one's for tomorrow.

These are good, Peter.

I like how you
retell tired old gags

with a detached, ironic approach.

Yeah, plus,
it's all brand-new jokes

that I'm really,
really serious about.

Here's your beer, Peter.

Thanks, Jerome.
What do I owe you?

No, you already paid me, in laughs.
(LAUGHS)

I do a lot of island ones.

Peter, you should do one where
a baseball player can't steal second,

'cause he's on probation.

For drug crimes.

Political.

Yeah, you put an island in there,
you're in business.

Hey, how about one where you draw a sock,
and it says "Sock it to me,"

or-or maybe draw Lois taking
a hot-tub dump,

and she just
says whatever?

Peter, your comic in this morning's paper
is really offensive.

(GIGGLING)

That's not funny, Peter.

Ah, you're just
not getting it, Lois.

See, his wife
washed dishes for him.

Oh, for Pete's sake.

A-ha! There you go.

Peter, you should
see this.

Your dishwasher cartoon has really
outraged the online community.

What?

Gosh, it's not like
the Internet to go crazy

about something
small and stupid.

Peter, you have
to apologize.

What, because of
a joke?

Not just a joke, Peter.
A joke that angered some bloggers.

(SIGHS) Well, I guess this ain't
the first time I got in trouble

for something I
said about a woman.

Oh, good. We can steal.

And welcome back
to <i>The Flow.</i>

We're talking
to Peter Griffin,

the artist behind
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

which has caused outrage
with a misogynistic comic.

Here's a video
of some outrage.

(CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)

And if that's not bad enough,
this morning's cartoon is even worse.

Let's put that up.

(AUDIENCE BOOING)

(BOOING CONTINUES)

Mr. Griffin, do you really think this
is an appropriate cartoon

to run on Gloria
Steinem's half-birthday?

You sound angry.
Did one of your friends get engaged?

You have no idea how offensive you are
to women, do you?

What? I love women.

I bet I can name more
porn stars than you.

But don't tell my wife
how many porn stars I know.

I'll get in
a lot of trouble.

I know all
of them, though.

There are people who just started
an hour ago, and I know them.

(CROWD SHOUTING ANGRILY)

Your cartoon is sexist!

Down with misogyny!

It wasn't even funny,
and I have a great sense of humor.

Man, they seem really upset.

I was just trying
to make people laugh.

Dad, I'm worried
they're gonna hurt us.

No, no, they're angry, Chris,
but they ain't gonna get violent.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Oh, cool!
That brick I ordered.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Wait a minute. I didn't order this brick.
You may be right, Chris.

Peter, this is
getting out of hand.

I don't feel safe
in my own home.

Maybe we should get out of Quahog
for a while.

You know, she's right.

We should get out of town
till this all blows over.

Okay, we'll go,
but just give me a minute.

I just want to turn in
my last <i>For Pete's Sake.</i>

PETER: <i>I'm like Michael Jordan,</i>

<i>going out on top amid</i>
<i>a flurry of gambling rumors.</i>

Peter, where are we?

I don't know.
I just woke up, too.

I tied the steering wheel
to my belt.

I figure we've been on the road
about 20% of the time.

Dad, how long until
we can go back home?

Um, I don't know. How long do
women hold grudges?

Not very long, I'm guessing.

Oh, Peter, we've been driving all night.
Pull over to that gas station.

We can use the bathroom
and stretch our legs.

You got it, babe.

Did you call me "babe"?

I did.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, Peter.

Ew, Mom!

You'll never have this, Meg.

All right,
back in the car, kids.

For this leg of the trip,
I was thinking of

driving with my shirt off
like New Mexico trash.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Oh, my God! Our car!

Someone's stealing it.

Oh, crap!

Although, I got to say,
you never get to see

somebody else
driving your car.

It's kind of cool.
Kind of weird.

We're stuck here, Peter!
And we don't even know where we are.

Well, there's a sign.

(THE SIMPSONS THEME PLAYING)

Huh, guess we're in a town
called Springfield.

Springfield, eh?
What state?

I can't imagine
we're allowed to say.

Well, this Springfield place seems nice.
We should visit here again.

I don't know, Lois.
This seems like a one-shot deal.

Guys, we ain't here
for fun, all right?

We're here to find the police,
report our stolen car.

Oh, and don't
drink the water.

Everybody around here
looks like they have hepatitis.

Dad, I'm starving.
Can we get some food?

Lois, whip out your boob,
give the boy his lunch.

Listen to the man.

Yeah, Lois,
listen to the man.

How about we just go
into that store there?

(BELL DINGS)

Uh, excuse me?

Hello. Welcome
to the Kwik-E-Mart.

(APPLAUSE)

Oh, I am so sorry.
Let me unplug that.

Oh, such a nuisance!

Hello, funny-sounding Cleveland.

What's the specialty
of the house?

To you, I recommend
the donut.

(MAGICAL CHIMING)

Ooh!

Yum!

Have you guys seriously
never heard of donuts?

These are made
fresh every day.

And then, several days later,
we receive them

and make them
available for purchase.

Hey, are these...
Are these free?

'Cause I forgot to mention,
all our money is in our stolen car.

Thank you.
Come again.

Sir, we can pay you back
for the donuts when we find our car.

Do you think that I am moved
by your sob story?

I come from a country
where the words

for "sewage" and
"beverage" are the same.

HOMER SIMPSON'S VOICE:
I'll pay for their donuts.

Thank you so much, sir.

For what?
I didn't say anything.

Oh.

HOMER SIMPSON'S VOICE:
It was me.

How come this convenience store
has so many shadowy parts?

Apu, a dozen donuts
for our albino visitors.

Wow! For real?

No man should be so poor
he cannot pay for a donut.

I was once you.
I couldn't afford donuts.

-Tell them what I did, Apu.
-He stole the donuts.

I stole the donuts.

So, here you go.
12...

Ten...
Eight donuts.

That's very nice
of you, Mister...

Simpson. Homer Simpson.

We're the Griffins.
Peter, Lois, Stewie,

and then, uh, you know,
the others.

Brian, I guess.

Well, enjoy
your six donuts.

Mmm. Yummy. Donut.

That's pretty good,
but try it like this.

Mmm. Donut.

Mmm. Donut.

I think you and I are gonna
get along just okay.

Oh, thank you so much for putting us up
until we find our car.

And thank you for not being
a band of hippie murderers.

And now this again.

You bring home
two bands of hippie murderers,

and suddenly,
that's all you're about.

Well, what do you say
we have some lunch?

Where's Bart?

Well, he's
at camp all week.

I'm sorry you
won't get to meet him.

Got kicked out of camp.

I superglued my counselor's
butt cheeks together.

That's terrible.

But how did you even
get access to his butt cheeks?

I'm not the only one
who got kicked out of camp.

This is Bart.

Honey, your hands are filthy.
Go wash up for lunch.

Eat my shorts!

"Eat my shorts."
I love that!

Is that a popular expression,
like "What the deuce"?

Probably more popular.

Probably...
Probably way more popular.

Well, here's my room.

Hey, you want to
see my weapons closet?

You have
a weapons closet, too?

TODD: Ouch!
Jesus heard my mean thought!

A slingshot!
It's so simple and pure.

He doesn't need
lasers or time machines,

just gum balls and marbles
and balls of string.

He's like something
out of Mark Twain!

Whose real name
was Samuel Clemens.

How does that further this conversation?

Hey, you want to
make a prank phone call?

Ooh, prank phone call!

(DIALING)

(RINGING)

Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a friend,
last name Keebum,

first name Lee.

Hang on, I'll check.

Hey, guys, do I got
a Lee Keebum?

Come on, look at the stools,
is there a Lee Keebum?

Somebody check the rear.
I know I got a Lee Keebum.

Then you probably
shouldn't be handling food.

(LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God, that's amazing!
That's the coolest thing ever!

-Hey, I want to try.
-Okay.

(DIALING)

(RINGING)

MOE: Moe's Tavern.

Hello, Moe?
Your sister's being raped.

Is that...
Is that one?

So, this is my room.
Please excuse the mess.

Hmm. There, that's better.

Look at all these trophies!
There must be, like, 20 of them!

Twenty-three. But I'm sure you have
a lot of trophies of your own.

No. I'm not good
at anything.

Oh, Meg, I'm sure
you're good at something.

We just have to
find out what it is.

After all, Nelson Mandela
said it's our obligation to shine.

You mean like my
oily face and back?

No. Maybe don't sit
on my bedspread, please.

But I mean the light within you
that makes you an individual.

Meg, you need to
know that you matter.

Really? No one's ever told me
I mattered before.

That's why you have to say it.
So say it.

I matter.

Louder!

I matter!

PETER: Shut up, Meg!
You don't matter!

Hey, couldn't help but notice
there's no seat for me.

Oh, I was under the impression
that you were a dog.

You're right to have
that reaction, Marge.

Why, I just figured, at home I sit
with the family, so I assumed that...

Have you ever
drunk out of a toilet?

I don't see what that has to do
with the discussion.

Dogs eat in the kitchen.

Yeah, dogs eat
in the kitchen.

Wow, you work at
a nuclear power plant?

-What's that?
-I don't know.

Pretty impressive.
I just work at a brewery.

Oh, my God, you get to work with beer?
Wow! What's beer really like?

Eh, he's got a big head.
(GIGGLES)

Hey, you know... Aw, damn it,
I don't have a comic strip anymore.

So, still no word from the police
on your stolen car?

(SCOFFS) The cops here are a joke.

I bet you and me
can find your car on our own.

-You think so?
-Yeah.

'Cause Homer Simpson
and Peter Griffin are a great team!

A greater team than...

Than...

Uh-huh, keep going.
Than... Something else.

Something else?
I don't know what this is.

(SIGHS) Okay, I'll do it.

Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are
an even greater team than the Air Force!

(AIRPLANE ENGINE WHIRRING)

Hold steady.
I got him in my sights.

(MACHINE GUN FIRING)

-Whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

Yeah, we did it.

What's he doing here?

We got to carry him,
'cause he can't fly on his own.

We let that other guy try,
and look what happened.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Wow, they've made
a lot of changes to Quahog!

-Chris, we're in a different town.
-Oh...

Is that why there
was blood in my stool?

No. That sounds
like a separate issue.

God, I can't believe I got stuck
taking their stupid dog for a walk.

Stupid? Well, I don't know,
I think he's kind of fun.

What, are you kidding?
He doesn't do anything.

You know,
it's not his fault, though.

He doesn't know any better.
He's been on a leash his whole life.

Hey, you know what?
Come here, Santa's Stupid Name.

You're a grown dog,
start acting like one.

Come here, boy.

Hey, stop that dog!

Sorry. We're on
a smoke break.

(INHALING AND EXHALING LOUDLY)

Nothing beats
smoking and standing.

Although smoking and sitting
does have its moments.

You always have
to argue with me.

(BARKING)

Hey, there's a dog
in the dining area!

How'd that happen?
Get back in there.

(ALL BARKING)

Which one is
Santa's Little Helper?

I don't know.
You're the one who sniffed his butt.

Yeah, for, like, a second!

(ALL BARKING)

Damn it, he's gone.

We're screwed.

Welcome to Krusty Burger.
May I take your order?

Your voice sounds stupid.

(WHEELS CREAKING SLOWLY)

Oh, my God, that was great!

I mean, unless you think it sucked,
in which case it sucked.

-It was all right, dude.
-Yeah, dude. (CHUCKLES)

So, you know,
um, I'm only wearing

this diaper as a dare,
you know.

It's not,
like, an everyday thing.

Hey, loser, I copied off your
spelling test and got a D!

(GRUNTS)

Ha, ha!

I say, how long has that boy been
treating you like that?

Uh... About 24 years.

(GRUNTS AND SHOUTS)

Just who
I was looking for!

(GRUNTING)

(GROANS)

Cowabunga.

All right, Peter,

if we're gonna find your car,
we got to think like a car.

So let's fill up
at that gas station.

(GULPING)

I feel sick.

Keep drinking.
I prepaid 40 bucks!

Homer, maybe
we're doing this wrong.

Oh, crap!

<i>Haben Sie</i> Homer <i>und</i> Peter
<i>mit</i> Chevron pump?

Okay, I got a great idea
how we're gonna find my stolen car.

We'll throw a car wash
free for stolen cars!

And then when we find it,
we'll actually charge the guy!

(HORNS HONKING)

Well, none of these is my car,
but we promised these scumbags a show.

Yeah.

Didn't find the car, Lois,

Yeah, Quagmire who?

That's an actual question.
I don't know who Quagmire is.

you got in this town?

I'm old, so I'm the victim!

Well, Homer,
thanks for helping me get my car back.

And to show my appreciation,
I got a little something for you.

Here you go. Pawtucket Patriot Ale.

The best Quahog has to offer.

Always keep an emergency six-pack
in my trunk.

Oh, that's cool,
bringing outside beer into my bar.

Down the hatch!

That's pretty good, right?

-No.
-Huh?

It's not good.

This beer tastes exactly like Duff.
It's just a lousy rip-off.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's not a rip-off of Duff.

It may have been inspired by Duff,
but I...

I like to think it goes
in a different direction.

No, this is just the same as Duff,
but, like, worse.

Hey, come on, now, this is
my favorite beer you're talking about.

Hell, I work for the company.
It's my livelihood.

Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood
is based on fraud. Look at this.

Huh?

(GASPS) It is Duff.

Your beer is in big trouble!

You can't just slap a new label

on something and call it your own!

Well, maybe Duff should be in trouble for,

you know, not being that great.

(GASPS)

Duff is an icon!

Yeah, but some folks prefer Pawtucket Pat.

I mean, don't get me wrong,
I used to love Duff when I was younger,

but I haven't even had
it in, like, 13 years.

Be that as it may,
I represent the Duff Brewery,

and you, sir, as a representative
of Pawtucket Patriot Ale,

are being sued for intellectual theft
and patent infringement.

A-ha! Intellectual theft!

What do you have
to say about that, Griffin?

D'oh!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

The Pawtucket Patriot Brewery being sued?

It's the largest employer
in Quahog, Peter.

A lot of people's jobs are riding on this.

Yeah, I got a job for you
riding on something.

-Peter!
-Sorry!

Sorry, Lois, I'm tired

'cause we usually only
do these things for half an hour.

-Simpson.
-Griffin.

Nice day, isn't it?

A nice day for stabbing
a friend in the back.

Yeah, and a nice day
for bringing thieves to justice.

We're getting a lot of compliments.

Yeah, we're doing something right.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Your Honor, citizens of Springfield
and visitors from Quahog,

my client, the Duff Brewery,

is the victim
of flagrant intellectual theft.

I'm whispering in court to look smart.

But it's not just the main Duff recipe
that's been plagiarized.

Several other Duff variations,

packages and design elements
have been similarly infringed,

resulting again and again
in pale imitations,

cheap copies, clumsy counterfeits
and weak substitutions.

-You like sex?
-Eh.

I don't think we're very similar.

You know why they got us
sitting next to each other.

'Cause we're the two
funniest guys in our towns?

Damn right.

I'm a Jewish clown.

Me, too.

Are you a mayor?

Yes, I am.

Are you a "cool" mayor?

I, uh... I like to think so.

You lived in Springfield?

Yeah, I worked at the Kwik-E-Mart,
researching a role.

These guys are gonna lose.

JUDGE FLINTSTONE: I've heard
all I need to hear to make a decision.

If you ask me,
neither of these beers is wholly original.

They're both pale imitations
of my favorite beer, Bud Rock.

(PETER LAUGHS)

But rendering a verdict
is something I'm paid to

yabba-dabba-do!

And I find in favor of Duff.

-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

Oh, no!

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

Uh, hey. I'm in the wrong Springfield.

So, what's going to happen now?

Well, the Pawtucket Brewery
will be shut down,

so I guess we got to go back to Quahog
and find Peter a new job.

Mmm, that's too bad.

Yeah.

Anyways, it was still nice
to meet you and your family,

even though you kind of screwed us over.

Good to have you.

And, hey,
next time you stay with a family,

maybe you can wear a bra some of the time.

listen, there's something difficult

What about him?

He's, um...

so I'll always remember you.

(GROANS)

Meg, I want you to have this.

Your saxophone?

Yes, Meg.

When you played the saxophone,
I could feel your soul coming out.

So I want you to take this and shine.

Lisa, no one has ever done
anything this nice for me.

You're amazing,
and I will never be like you.

I'm not pretty, I'm not smart,
I'm not talented.

I have the same shoe size
as Charles Barkley.

My prom date was a scarecrow I stole,
and he left with someone else.

The inside of my hat smells so bad

I'm not allowed in most restaurants...

Hey, hey!

Shut up, Meg.

No luggage. Car's full. Let's go.

Well, nice knowing you, Stewie.

Same here, Bart.

Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I got you a little present.

Whoa! Is that Nelson?
Stewie, what the deuce?

Yes, I... Oh!

Oh, that's nice. You got that from me.

'Cause, you know, I was starting to worry
this was a one-way thing.

You kidnapped him?

I kidnapped all your enemies.

Nelson, Jimbo, Principal Skinner,
Sideshow Bob, Apu.

I know Apu's not your enemy,
but I just wanted to say,

"I took Apu." (CHUCKLES)

(LAUGHS)

That is funny!
But the rest of this? It's messed up, man.

I know! Isn't it awesome?

So, how do you want to keep in touch?
Facebook? Twitter?

Late-night phone calls lying on
our tummies with our feet up in the air?

Stewie, I don't think
we can be friends. You freak me out.

Bart, if we don't keep in touch,
I'll kill myself.

That's what I'm talking about.

Later, dude!

-(GRUNTS)

Aw.

Hey, Griffin. Sorry about your job.

I was just sticking up for Duff.

I love Duff. And Duff loves me.

Duff can keep a secret.
Duff never says no.

Duff is more experimental
than any partner I've ever had.

Anyway, the point is, I'm sorry.

You know, when I first met you, I thought,

"Hey, I love this guy!
This is the funniest guy I've ever met.

"I'm gonna quote this guy
to all my friends.

"I love his town, I love his family."

But now, I think I speak
for all of us when I say,

I am over the Simpsons!

You're parked behind me at your place.

Hey, listen, I...

I'm sorry we fought.

I just wanted to make you laugh and cry.

You see, I'm a <i>Family Guy.</i>

I understand.

I'm a <i>The Simpsons.</i>

Look, even if we don't work
as best pals, I respect you.

You, too. Let's just agree to stay

a half hour away from each other.

With a pile of garbage between us.

Worst chicken fight ever.

It sure is nice to be back in Quahog.

Oh, and thank God all the commotion
about Dad's comic blew over.

Oh, my God, I had a comic?
That's hilarious!

Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore,

but you are a local hero
for defending our beer,

and apparently,
that's more important than hating women.

So here you go, a Pawtucket Patriot Ale.

What? I don't understand.

Ain't the brewery out of business?
We lost a court case.

Yes, we lost,
but how are they gonna enforce it?

What, are they gonna come here?

I think we know that's never gonna happen.

Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bart
didn't want to be your friend.

What? No!

What are you talking about? He was lame.

If you ask me, he kind
of sounded like a girl.

Really? Kind of seemed
like you idolized him.

And I can understand losing a friend
and feeling rejected.

Course you can! You're a loser.

But not me. I'm a lone wolf.

Speaking of which,
I'm gonna go howl at the moon.

"Hey, glad you guys could make it!"

He's obviously cleaning

Huh, what's all this?

JOE: Honey, it doesn't seem like

the Griffins are leaving anytime too soon!

Oh. Hey, Peter.

Hey, Joe. What are all these pictures?

Oh, nothing.
They're just some stupid scribbles

I've been working on
for a children's book.

Well, I don't think that's stupid.
I think that's awesome.

I mean, my one note on these

would be to hide a bunch
of dongs in the backgrounds,

but, otherwise, I think they're great.

Wow. Well, that really
means a lot to me, Peter.

I've been working on this book
for nine years,

but I've been too afraid
to show it to anybody.

Come on, Joe. You can't be afraid.

What if Bono had been afraid
to wear sunglasses?

Then nobody would know about Africa.
What's it about?

Well, it's called <i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

It's about a handicapped squirrel

who has to learn
to overcome his disabilities

so he can survive in the wild.

As you can imagine,
it's very personal to me.

Wait... Were you once a squirrel?

No, Peter. I'm handicapped.

Well, you know, you ought
to do something with this.

Really? You think so?

Hey, trust me, Joe.
I know talent when I see it.

I mean, I discovered Mr. Peanut.

Ordinary legume.

-Oh, man. There she is.
-Wha... Who?

She comes in here

-Well, why don't you go talk to her?
-Way ahead of ya.

Wh... Where are you going?

(PANTING) And 1,000. Whew. (LAUGHS)

Peter, I just heard the best news.

Wow, word gets around fast.

Nice, right?

No. Peter, I took your advice
and sent my book to a publisher.

They're gonna publish
<i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

-And it's all thanks to you!
-Joe, that's amazing!

So, there's gonna be a real live book
out there with your name on it?

Well, actually, I'm writing it
under a pen name, David Chicago.

Well, how come you didn't
just write it under Joe...

S... Steenburj...
You know, your real name?

I wanted to avoid catching crap
down at the police station.

They don't like anything artistic.

Oh. Hi, Brian.

Hey. You, uh... You didn't forget
about our date, did you?

Of course not. I was just thinking,
since it's so nice out,

we could go out for a run and then eat.

Oh. Yeah. No, no.
You know, I would totally do that.

I just... I've already run,

I know this would've been

Uh, anyway, this is <i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

"There once was a handicapped squirrel
who could not climb trees to get food."

Okay, next page.

"The squirrel, the same squirrel
from the first page,

"hoped that the other animals
would share their food with him.

"'Please,' said the Hopeful Squirrel.

"'If you could all spare just one nut,

"I, too, could survive the winter.'"

Sorry about that.

Mommy, I don't like the wheel man.

"But none of the other animals

"would share with the Hopeful Squirrel."

-'Cause it sucks!
-Quagmire?

Ah, crap, this is Joe's dream.

Joe, what are you doing?
The squirrel doesn't even sound hopeful.

It's got to be like... (CHEERFULLY)
"If you could spare just one nut,

"I, too, could survive the winter!"

-Oh, I like that voice.
-He's funny.

That's the man who passed out
at the liquor store.

Joe, quick, give me the book.

"And so, the squirrel decided
to climb for his own nuts.

"'I don't need legs
when I've got a positive attitude

"and arm strength.'

"'I'm sorry that we mistreated you,'
said Buddy the Badger.

"'Could you find it in your heart
to share your nuts with us?'

"'Of course I'll share with you all,'
said the squirrel.

"'For if I could not forgive,
then I would be truly handicapped.'"

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Wow, that was great. Who are you?

Just a grown man with a pet hermit crab.

Listen, Joe, how would you feel
about your friend

-getting more involved?
-What do you mean?

Well, you would write the books,
and your friend, Peter,

would be the public face
of <i>The Hopeful Squirrel.</i>

He would be David Chicago.

Well, I... I don't know.

Joe, this happens all the time.

You wouldn't believe who really writes
all those Stephen King books.

Scary stuff, scary stuff,
scary stuff. Ding!

Scary stuff, scary stuff,
scary stuff. Ding!

Scary stuff, scary stuff,
scary stuff. Lunch!

Look, Peter can get this book
into the hands of every kid in America.

That's what you wanted, isn't it?

All right. Well, whatever you think
is best for the book.

Great. So it's all agreed.

Can't wait to work with you, Peter.

What... What just happened?

Oh, the bookstore closed
and is now a Target.

But don't worry, our industry's fine.

Excuse me, Mr. Chicago?

Could you please
sign my copy of your book?

-Sure, I...
-Easy there, Joe.

Hot Rod asked for Mr. Chicago.

"Give me all your money. I have a gun"?

Oh, wait, I think I messed something up.

"Never give up on your dreams"?

Listen, Peter, if you're gonna act
as David Chicago,

I need to know that
you're gonna take this seriously

and honor the message of the book.

Joe, I got it. Trust me.

book author David Chicago.

-Welcome.
-Thank you.

Wow, all your words
are right there for you?

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Quite...
Quite the imagination on this one.

So, tell me, how did you decide
to write about a handicapped squirrel?

You know, I'd see these crippled kids

limping down the sidewalk
on my way to work,

and I would just laugh and laugh,

and I thought, "Hey! Put that in a book!"

(LAUGHING)

He's making people laugh
at handicapped people.

What's he doing out there?

I'll tell you what he's doing,
he's selling books. They love him.

Now, I understand we have
some questions from the audience.

Yes, I have a question.
Is the Hopeful Squirrel a boy or a girl?

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I'm a boy.

But in the book,
I'm drawn smooth down there,

so it's not a bad question.

Okay, that's all our time.

We invite you to stay tuned
through the credits

so you can see where I buy my clothes.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

-So, what's going on here?
-Just having dinner.

That's Dad's chair. He's gonna be mad.

Wow, Brian, you sure have been
doing a lot of jogging lately.

(CHUCKLING) It's called "running," Lois.

-Why don't you have some food?
-Oh, you mean fuel?

Ah, no. No offense, Lois, but that stuff

is nothing but chemicals
and empty calories.

Okay. I'll mush some up
and put it on the floor

next to the trash, if you get hungry.

I think you bought girl running shoes.

You know, in case any of you want to,
uh, come cheer us on,

Chloe and I are doing
the Quahog Marathon in a couple weeks.

A marathon? But what if
that sexy boy has another bomb?

Yeah, are you sure
you can finish a marathon?

I'm not worried, Meg.
I'm just gonna give it all I've got,

like Scotty engineering the <i>Enterprise.</i>

(ALARM BLARING)

Scotty, we need more speed!

SCOTTY OVER COMMS:
<i>I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!</i>

<i>She can't take any more!</i>

reroute auxiliary power to the helm.

<i>Uh, Scotty to the bridge. Uh...</i>

<i>Captain, this is, uh...</i>
<i>This is a little embarrassing,</i>

<i>but, uh, you know,</i><i>I've never noticed, uh,</i>

<i>the little lever</i>
<i>I've been pushing, it's...</i>

<i>It's only about two-thirds</i><i>of the way up.</i>

<i>I actually can give her more.</i>

That's great, Scotty.

Mr. Spock, give us readings on...

<i>Uh, Captain, Scotty again.</i>
<i>You're not gonna believe this.</i>

<i>Uh, there is another lever here, too.</i>

<i>The ship can literally</i>
<i>go</i><i>three times as fast.</i>

<i>I...</i> (LAUGHS) <i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>I feel like such a capital-J</i>
<i>jerk right now.</i>

It's okay, Scotty. Lieutenant Uhura,
open all channels for...

<i>Captain, I've got to,</i><i>uh, interrupt again.</i>

<i>I've just been thinking about</i>
<i>this "giving her all she's got" thing.</i>

<i>I mean, I've been completely</i>
<i>wrong for years now.</i><i>I feel terrible.</i>

<i>I mean, think of how many</i>
<i>crises we've been in</i>

<i>where the issue</i><i>was how fast we could go.</i>

<i>I mean... I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

-Scotty, it's okay.
<i>-No, it's not!</i><i>Eric's dead!</i>

<i>At the funeral, I literally said</i>
<i>the words to his wife,</i>

<i>"I was giving her all she's got."</i>

Scotty, it's fine. Sulu, lock phasers...

<i>Captain, I just got to jump in here.</i>

<i>We don't have enough dilithium crystals</i>
<i>to run the phasers.</i>

<i>I've lost all credibility, haven't I?</i>

Peter, I think we need to talk.

You totally screwed up my book.

You're getting kids to laugh
at handicapped people,

when I'm trying to inspire them.

I'm afraid you're off the project.

What? You can't kick me
off the project. I'm David Chicago.

I'm the one who wrote the book.

Joe, come on. Let's not kid ourselves.
All right? Everybody knows my face now.

And besides, I'm the only one
of the two of us

who can do a squirrel voice.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Well, I don't know if that's quite true.

Joe, Joe, stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.

Sorry, Joe, but the publisher loves me.

The public loves me.
I'm not going anywhere.

(NORMAL VOICE) Screw you, Peter!
You know what? You've ruined this for me.

I want nothing to do with the book,
and I want nothing to do with you!

Aw, one of his shoes fell off
during the anger.

-(TOILET FLUSHES)

Peter, Bonnie told me
that Joe's very upset.

Did you really take
his book away from him?

Did you just poop and then get into bed
without underwear on?

That book really meant a lot to Joe.
I think you should talk to him.

Hey, that book would've been
nothing without me.

And besides, he's the one who quit.

Now the publisher wants another book
and it's all on me.

I just hate to see you two in a fight.

And on the same week when my sister and I

are having such a big fight, too.

-Good night, Lois.
-(LAMP CLICKS)

All right, guys. Ideas, ideas.

We got a Hopeful Squirrel book to write.

-All right, now, who's got something?
-I got... I got something.

What if the squirrel has lasers

that he shoots out of his eyes.

Quagmire's on the board.

And how 'bout he got a frog friend
that's got some sort of catchphrase?

Like, if he's seeing something kooky,
he could be like,

"Damn, that's cray-cray
in a good way, right there!"

Wow. God just speaks right through you,
doesn't he, Cleveland?

I believe he does.

-Okay, what else, what else?
-If there's a bison...

Is that a statement or a question?

It is what it is.
Ain't nothing gotta be nothing, huh?

BRIAN: Hey, Stewie! Can you come
in the bathroom for a second?

(SIGHS)

What is it, Bri... Oh, my God!

Hey, could you close the gate?
Couple of calves got loose. Ha! Pow!

Brian, you're all sinewy.

Your whole body looks like
Paul McCartney's neck.

-Thanks.
-That's not a compliment.

You look terrible.
What does your girlfriend think of this?

I dumped her.
She couldn't keep up with me.

Hey, grab me some more
Band-Aids, will you?

I got, like, eight more nipples
to cover up before my run.

You know, whatever you're doing,
it isn't healthy, Brian.

Oh, I'm not healthy?

Stewie, my heart rate
is down to four beats a minute.

Besides, I got to keep training.
The marathon's in two days.

Brian, I... I'm worried
you're losing yourself in all this.

Do you remember that phase
when you thought you were a pointer dog?

Was someone wearing my new high heels?

You dick.

I'm sorry, Peter, you're fired.

I'm sorry Joe's dream
didn't work out for you, Peter.

(SIGHS) What was I thinking?

Joe's the one with all the talent.

Me trying to write a book is like
CeeLo trying to find a pair of pants.

Yeah, I need to find something
a cartoon apple would wear.

Hey, you made it!

So, you ready to watch me kick some ass?

Brian, I think you've taken
all of this too far.

You know, there is such a thing
as too much exercise.

Stewie, I know you're worried, all right?

And no offense, but I'm not taking advice

Brian, why does everything
you touch turn to garbage?

-Peter.
-Look, Joe, I messed up. All right?

I just got so wrapped up
in all the attention.

The attention you deserved.

I know how much
this meant to you, and I...

I should've just stayed out of it.

Listen, I'm... I'm sorry I mistreated you.

Okay? You deserve better.

Peter, wait.

If I could not forgive
then I would be truly handicapped.

-What?
-It's from the book, Peter.

What book?

-I forgive you, Peter.
-You do?

Yeah. The truth is, without you,

I never would have had the confidence

to get my book published
in the first place.

And that's all I ever wanted.

-Friends?
-<i>Frasier.</i>

-So, Bri, how's that ankle itch?
-Well, what do you mean?

I'm just saying, you probably have
an itchy ankle under that cast.

It starts as a tickle
and then you can't quite reach it?

-Not gonna work, Stewie.
-Yes, you're right.

Best not to think about it.

Even though it might be a little bug
digging away down there,

just nagging and itching and...

Ah, ah, crap, I did it to myself!
Ew, what is that?

Well, Peter,
I'm glad you made up with Joe.

Yeah, me, too.

It just goes to show you, Lois,
books is bad news.

Well, except for the books
they sell at Urban Outfitters.

I've always talked about
wanting to help in these situations,

but I never follow through.

Well, this time, I'm really gonna do it.
I'm gonna start a blood drive.

Good for you, Lois.
You'll be a local hero, like Paul Revere.

The British will be here soon.

We shall stand our ground
and fight them to the death!

Yes! Yes!

Although, I mean, one of us
should probably warn everyone.

You know, that the
British are coming.

I mean, not me.
I mean, I want to fight.

I mean... Oh, shoot.
I've got the horse.

I mean, but if anyone
else wants to go...

No one? All right. I'll make sure everyone

Wow, Lois, you really got a great turnout
for the blood drive.

Oh, yeah. The whole thing's
going off without a hitch.

Well, except for that mosquito
who keeps trying to sneak in.

Hi. I'm the new nurse.

Get out of here!
This blood's not for you!

Aw...

Oh, look, an empty tire
with some water in it.

All right,
I'm happy again.

I'm gonna go ahead and thank you for
donating blood today.

Donating? I thought we were getting paid!
(GRUNTING)

Peter, everyone else here has donated
except you.

That's not true. That guy over
there didn't donate.

-That's still you, Peter.
-Oh.

Well, if I got to donate,
he's got to donate, too.

You, get in here!

You should be asleep by now.

I can't sleep, Brian.
Where's the woman?

I need her to read
me a bedtime story.

Oh, she's busy
with the blood drive.

Maybe I can help. How about I
read you this book?

It's called
<i>Apathetic George.</i>

"George used to be
a curious monkey,

"but after a month in captivity,
all he did was wait for food.

"The zoo people
wanted him to mate,

"but he lost
interest in that, too.

"Twenty years and millions of dollars in
zoo revenue later, he died."

-Okay, I've had enough.
-All right. You know what?

I know something that will help you sleep.
Wait here.

Well, I hope so, because I've
tried everything.

Counting sheep,
thinking sleepy thoughts.

I even hired
the Sandman.

Sand and sand and sand and sand and sand
and sand and good night!

Okay, I'll give you a tiny bit of this.
It should help you sleep.

-What is it?
-It's cough syrup.

It's not really for kids,
but a capful is pretty harmless.

(GULPING) Mmm!

Oh, so this is what Lil Wayne
keeps almost dying from.

Oh, this is so relaxing.
I could get used to this.

Like the way I got used to
wearing European diapers.

Don't mind me.

I'm just grabbing
a little cheese and vino.

If anybody needs me,
I'll be poolside

next to my weirdly hot girlfriend
with dark teeth.

Well, Lois, I'm done giving blood.
Just ask this guy.

(MIMICKING DRACULA)
Is true, Lois. I sucked him dry.

He gave a blood
donation as well.

Peter, knock it off.

Just give some blood, get your cookie,
and be done with it.

-Cookie?
-Yes, Peter.

There are cookies
for everyone who donates.

Well, I already ate
two wedding cakes,

but I guess I could
go for a cookie.

All right, I'll do it.

Oh, Peter, you're
doing a good thing.

Thanks, Lois, but
you got to promise

you'll warn me before they stick
that needle in me.

Actually, we
just finished.

Wow, that wasn't so bad.

See, Peter? And now
you can have a cookie.

Oh, awesome!

Mmm. Mmm.

Oh, my God, these are delicious.
Lois, you made these?

Yeah, I found one of my grandmother's
old recipes,

so I thought I'd make a special batch
for the blood drive.

Well, I'm glad you did.
These cookies are amazing.

They're even tastier
than Connie Britton's hair.

(LICKING)

Mmm!

God, your hair
is delicious.

I've been looking all
over the table for you.

You know, I've got to
tell you, this stuff

you gave me was a
lifesaver last night.

I was out like a light.

And, you know, normally, I'm up five
or six times to scream and defecate.

But you know what?
I slept straight through.

Stewie, I told you, there's alcohol
in that. It's not for kids.

You're not for kids.
(LAUGHS)

-Stewie, you're drunk.
-Oh... (SLURRING)

Brian's all serious.

"Oh, I don't... I don't drink in
the morning

"because I've got
to land a plane."

(LAUGHING)

All right, come on, I've got to
drive you to daycare.

Okay, okay, it's all right.
Calm down, calm down. Oh. Uh-oh.

Oh, I think I've... I think I've put my
shoes on the wrong feet.

Is it 9:15 already?
Lois, we got to go!

You know, I've got all the papers
for the loan officer,

but I got to admit,
I'm a little nervous.

Don't worry, we're gonna get
this loan, no problem.

And if you get nervous,
just do what I always do,

picture your
audience naked.

-Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
-Ahhh!

Get that enormous
thing out of my face!

I'll be your
loan officer,

so why don't you have a seat and tell me
about your business?

Our business is cookies.
Now let me ask you a question.

-You ever heard of money?
-Yes.

Good, good. We're on the same page.

Now, sir, let me ask
you something else.

Can you name one successful company
that isn't cookie-based?

Microsoft.

Peter, I'll handle this.

Uh, my husband and I would like to
open a cookie store.

We've done all the research, and I'm
very confident we can turn a profit.

I've brought some samples
if you'd like to try one.

She said "one."
Take one.

Mmm.

Well, these are delicious.
Let me just run this by my supervisor.

Yes!

Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
this bank would like

to help you
start your business.

Really? Oh, that's fantastic!

And if you have any other questions,
you can call me at any time.

(RINGING)

-Hello?
-PETER: <i>How far away are the stars?</i>

Brian! Brian!

Hold... Hold on one second. I'll be right
with you, Mr. Duckford.

-Brian!
-What?

Let's order... (SLURRING) I was just
thinking, let's order a kebab.

-A what?
-A kebab.

But I want it in this order, vegetable,
meat, meat, vegetable, meat.

And, um, Mr. Duckford would like some
quackers. (LAUGHING)

Can I leave now?

No, no, Bri...
No, you can't.

Brian, I need your help.

I've made a series
of small poops in my bath,

and I need you to scoop them out
with this fishnet.

Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

You have to.
You're my butler.

I'm not your butler.

I know, but wouldn't it be
great if you were?

I'd be so happy.

In fact, the only thing
that would make me happier

(STAMMERING) would be if this tub
was filled with yaw-gurt.

Can you get me
some yaw-gurt?

Is the yaw-gurt
shop still open?

Is there some place
to dial up yaw-gurt?

Stop saying that.

What's the best
skin yaw-gurt?

Who can prepare me
a nice yaw-gurt treatment?

If you say it like that one more time,
I'm gonna drown you.

Yaw-gurt. Ah.

See? You're not...
You're not gonna do anything.

Hey, hey, Brian,
am I a good little guy?

This space will
be perfect, Peter.

Yeah, it sure will, Lois. Now all we got
to do is name the store.

Oh! Oh, I got it.
"Peter's Wife's Cookies."

(GASPS) I love it.
And I love you.

-Really?
-Yes.

You know, we did so-so building a family,
but this business,

I think we can really
knock it out of the park.

Oh, we sure can, Lois.
We're gonna be a great team.

Like Moses and his buddy who liked to
collect seashells.

Yay!

Oh, I can't believe it, Peter.
Our first day of business.

All right.
Well, we have got work to do,

so let's roll up our sleeves
and get right to it.

There's a lot to do,

so we can't be afraid to just roll up
our sleeves and get the job done.

We can't be
hands-off managers.

We got to roll up our
sleeves and just dig in.

Peter, your arms
are turning purple.

Purple with success.
That's the color of money.

You got to do the work of two men
and pay yourself for one.

Just roll up those
sleeves and address

the task at hand,
whatever it may be,

not shying away
from the dirty work,

but just rolling up our sleeves
and having at it.

Success is not given.
It is taken.

It's time to get in
the game and get dirty.

(STRAINED) All right,
I'm going to lunch.

Yes, I'd like
a chocolate chip cookie.

-Elmer!
-What, Mom?

You promised I could get a cookie if I
finished all my surgery.

-Did you?
-Yeah.

-All of it?
-Um...

Get back there.

I'm gonna do it. What does it
matter when I do it?

-Lois, Lois, lock the door.
-Why?

It's that lady who
comes in, tries a sample,

and then whispers
about how bad she is.

(CHEERFULLY) Hey.

Oh, my God, you have chocolate
macadamia nut.

Oh, could I just
try a little sample?

(WHISPERS)
Oh, I'm so bad.

Uh, sure.

You gonna buy
a cookie this time?

Oh, I better just stick with the sample.
I'm so bad.

But at least I know I'm bad,
so that makes me a little less bad.

(WHISPERS) Or worse.

(GRUNTS)

That was the right
thing to do, Peter.

Oh, boy, it's been
really slow.

I mean, if it doesn't
pick up soon,

we're not gonna stay
in business very long.

Don't you worry, Lois, you keep baking,
I'll drum up some business.

We just got to
think outside the box,

like the makers of
Dreyer's ice cream.

Guys, I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

When people go to
the supermarket,

they need something to look at before they
choose Haagen-Dazs.

Hey, dude, can you
pass me a speck of Spazz?

Sorry, brah, all out.

You want a
cube of Froosh?

Nah, I'm not
into Froosh.

I got a tear
of Laser Dragon.

Can I handle it?

I don't know.
Can you?

(ANNOUNCER READING)

(SIGHS) I don't know
what to do, you guys.

The cookie shop is tanking.
If it fails, we're screwed.

My God, what does it take to get people
to buy a damn cookie?

Peter, let me tell
you something.

I spend $600 a month on scented candles
at the farmer's market

just because there's a hot
chick selling them.

So what are you saying?

You just bragging
about candles?

That's a weird
thing to brag about.

No, I'm saying
sex sells.

Trust me, you get a few hotties in that
cookie shop of yours,

I bet your sales
will go up.

Giggity.

That was an unearned
giggity, Quagmire.

I said "up." No?

-No.
-No.

Well, I'll try anything, Quagmire, 'cause
I actually like running that cookie shop.

It's way better than that job I had
telemarketing to buttholes.

-MAN 1: <i>Hello?</i>
-Sorry, wrong number.

-MAN 2: <i>Hello?</i>
-Sorry, wrong number.

(FARTING)

And how are you today, sir?

Oh, my God. Customers.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

What the hell?

Peter, what did you do?

I saved our business.

And don't worry,
I only hired women

whose names are
cookie-related.

Lois, meet Cookie, Sugar, Spice, Cinnamon,
Brown Sugar and Butter.

Oh, hey, Butter.

Some guys like Butter.

Peter, you turned our store
into a strip club.

And I don't like
what this place has become.

You mean hugely profitable?

We made all that today?

Well, it was twice as much,
but I had to bail out Cinnamon's kid.

Thanks, Mr. Peter.
This guy's the best.

Well, I guess business
is better than ever.

That's the spirit, Lois.

Just you watch, we'll be a bigger success
than Richard Branson.

Hey, where's the business guy
in this boardroom?

It couldn't be that tan, long-haired guy

with the white linen pants, could it?

It is!

And now, to my amphibious sky
submarine.

I have way too much money!

(THUMPING)

Come on, get... Get down there,
you old bag.

There we go.

Stewie, what are you doing?

Being awesome.

Whoa, wait, wait.
You're in no condition to drive.

I'm fine to drive.
I'm so fine. You...

I can do all the tests.
See? I can touch my nose.

I can touch my
(SING-SONG) head,

shoulders, knees and toes,
knees and toes.

-Stop it.
-No, you stop it.

You stop it, Brian. You're interfering
with my professional business.

Where's the radio?

(BOTH GRUNT)

(GASPS)

Oh, my God, are you okay?

No. I don't feel so good.

We should probably
exchange numbers.

Okay. I'm a 10, you're a four.
(CACKLING)

(RACY MUSIC PLAYING)

(MEN CHEERING)

This one's our new chocolate,
white chocolate,

and for every dozen we sell,
we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.

Yeah, nobody's
listening to you.

They're all watching Sugar write frosting
swears on her jugs. (CHUCKLES)

She just wrote
"vagina" on her boobs.

That doesn't even
make any sense.

She's doing what?

I told her 10
minutes ago to put

another batch of
oatmeal in the oven.

Oh, that dough
is gone, Lois.

I warmed it up and put it behind
those waist-high holes in the wall.

Is it spaghetti?
A bowl of grapes? (SQUISHING)

Ooh, this is the best
haunted house ever.

Peter, this is disgusting.

I know we made a few changes,

but this store should still be
about selling cookies.

Well, you're never gonna sell any
looking like that.

There. Now you're
ready to sell cookies.

You know what?
That's it. I'm done.

I don't know why I ever let you
talk me into this...

Whatever this is now.

It's a strip club that gives away
free cookies.

Argh!

Oh, crap.

I should've known
something was up

when I saw all
those cars out front.

Stewie, why don't you come and have a seat
with all your friends here?

We have something
to say to you.

I'll go first.

"Stewie, I remember
the day you were born.

"I thought to myself,

"'Here's a kid who's got a white, empty
canvas stretched out in front of him.'"

Oh, please. What... Who...
What is this?

What is this,
the circle of perfect people?

Who are you to judge me?

(STUTTERING) Mr. Giraffe,
who lets little boys grind on his rump.

Mr. Octopus, who lets little boys
grind on his rump.

Every one of you
has your own problems.

Yeah, but you're the only one who almost
killed a kid yesterday.

(STAMMERING) Yeah, well,
that's because that kid...

That's because
that kid... (SOBBING)

I know.

Oh, Brian. Who am I?

I don't have a cough, and my sinuses are
remarkably wide open.

But I have a problem.

Good. Admitting it
is the first step.

But don't worry.
I'll get you through it.

Thank you, Brian.

You're welcome, Stewie.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to Chris's room.

We're doing a masturbation
intervention.

I got a bunch of his friends
sitting in a circle in there.

Oh, dear God.

Oh, hey.

Lois, before you say anything, there's
something important I want to tell you.

After you left,
I ate cookie dough

off the stomach
of a 20-year-old,

and then I vomited and all the girls
laughed at me,

and then it came out that they all think
I'm fat and old.

Is that it?

I guess what I'm trying to say is,

I was wrong to choose sexiness
over my wife.

Peter, what are you doing?
What... What was that?

Oh, back at the store, I tucked my boner
into the waistband of my pants,

and now it's sitting weird.

That's your apology?

Well, that and this.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS)

Oh, Peter, did...
Did you bake this?

Yeah. I love you, Lois.

I really liked having a store with you,
and I'm sorry I messed it up.

I was only trying to help.

I know, Peter.

So you want to
split this with me?

Uh, I wouldn't.

Butter helped me with it,
and she has chlamydia fingers.

Well, it was fun
having our own store.

But from now on, my cookies are only
for these customers.

(LAUGHS) Oh, Mom.

So, Mom, what are you gonna
do with the shop?

Well, I talked to the bank,
and they agreed to take it back.

-(RACY MUSIC PLAYING)
-Me love Cookie.

What? Oh, I love that movie.

Oh, man, that's gonna leave
a big hole in their lineup.

What's gonna fill the <i>Glory</i> hole?

ANNOUNCER: In place of <i>Glory,</i>
we will be

showing <i>Shaft,</i>
starring Richard Roundtree.

What? You can't just shove
<i>Shaft</i> in the <i>Glory</i> hole.

Yeah, I know.

It'd be better to put in that movie
about the two girls who meet Nixon.

What's that movie called? <i>Dick?</i>

<i>Dick</i> would slide right
into that <i>Glory</i> hole.

No, no, <i>Dick's</i> too

you got <i>Pecker</i> and <i>Dick</i> in the <i>Glory</i> hole,

Oh, hey, that's my old rope toy.

I was wondering
where that was.

Ew, what would you want
that for? It's gross.

No, it's not. It's awesome.

I can suck on it for the flavor.

I can thrash it around,
pretend it's a snake.

Sometimes I just bite it like this.

(GROWLING) Rope!

That's stupid.

I want it.

Well, you can't have it, it's mine.

-Oh, yeah? Not for long it ain't.
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

Come on, Brian, I need this rope

in case I open

Hey, Chris. Where's your father?

He's still trying to get
that rope away from Brian.

Oh, he's got to
give up that obsession.

I don't like what it's doing to him.

(IMITATING GOLLUM)
Precious. Wants precious rope.

Peter, enough with the rope.

Also wants ice cream.

No, Peter,
it's too close to dinnertime.

Get ice cream anyway.

You didn't go to

Well, I got a better rope.

That's not a chewing rope.

I know. It's a tying rope!

Oh!

Oh, man! I'm real sorry
about your mouth, Brian.

Damn it, Peter.
What were you thinking?

This has to be the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

No, Brian.
The stupidest thing I ever did

was turn the bubbles
off in a hot tub.

Yeah! Party!

Ew, bath with friends.

Now, remember, Brian's probably
very self-conscious about how he looks,

so let's try to be supportive.

Brian! Dinner!

(LISPING) So, everybody, how was your
day? What's for dinner? I'm starving.

My God, you look like
one of those animals.

You know, the one that...
Which one does the... (TRUMPETS) Sound?

That... Oh, crap,
you know which one I mean.

Oh, who am I kidding?

You got to take me to the dentist
to get my mouth fixed.

Brian, we can try to make you feel
a little less repulsive.

(CHUCKLING)

But we're not spending human money
on a deformed animal.

What? Then what am
I supposed to do?

I don't know. But here,
you can have this back.

It's boring. It doesn't do anything.

You know what? Go to hell, Peter!

Wow, this is
the craziest meal I've had

since I had lunch
at Tommy Sullivan's house.

Very good macaroni and cheese,
Mrs. Sullivan.

Thank you, Chris.

-That was just awful, Chris.
-Terrible.

He is not ready for flashbacks.

No, he is not.

Hey, listen, thanks for not laying into me
like everybody else.

I don't care enough about you
to lay into you.

But now that you mention it,
your face looks like a used condom.

Yeah, I know.

(SOBBING)

Oh, come on, Brian.
Don't do that.

Don't cry. Be a man.

I'm not crying!

Look, listen, just...
Here, just take this.

-What is this?
-That's my dentist.

He'll bill me.
I've got an account.

You've got an account
with a dentist?

He sells me nitrous at wholesale,
I bang his wife.

Those both sound
like things for you.

Look, you want
his number or not?

I won't forget this, Glenn Quagmire.

Don't ever say my
name like that, okay?

And don't tell
anybody about this.

Now get the hell out of the bar,
you pathetic son of a bitch.

Hey, language.

but to me, it's worth the comfort,

because, let's face it,
the world is an abrasive place.

I have maybe hours to live,
and you're wasting them.

BRIAN: (NORMAL VOICE)
Hey. I'm, uh...

I'm back from
getting my new teeth.

Well, come on in, Brian.
Let's see 'em.

BRIAN: All right, here it goes.

Oh, my God!
Look at your teeth!

Hey, maybe you could
help us build the dam.

If you think you got the chops for it.

Well, think about it.
It's something to chew on.

(LAUGHING)

We use him just the right amount.

So, be honest, huh?
You guys hate 'em.

No, Brian, are you kidding?
They're spectacular!

-You look like a movie star.
-Really?

Yeah, you're like an even more
handsome Adam Carolla.

God, I can't believe
you guys really like 'em.

Yeah, Brian, you are gonna get
so much sweet tail!

Oo-cha, oo-cha,
oo-cha, oo-cha!

Brian, you have found your look.

That is the best cosmetic surgery
in this family

since Lois got her boob job.

I don't know what happened.
I told the doctor C-cups.

I told him something else.

I think he did a dam good job.

Okay, now we've
used him too much.

it's a great neighborhood.

Lot of families, good parks.

Six fire hydrants,
but they are unavailable.

They are previously claimed.

They belong to some badass.

Okay, but do you think
this house will hold its value?

I don't see why not.
It's got a nice porch.

And the yard's got plenty of room
for little ones.

Although that's really up to
the two of you.

(ALL LAUGH)

Hey, so sorry I'm late.
Let me show you the house.

No need to.
Your partner already sold us on it.

Sorry, I... I didn't realize they thought
I was a real estate agent.

You are a real estate agent.
You just don't know it yet.

What do you mean?

Look at that smile.
You're a born salesman.

-You should come work for me.
-Huh.

Never thought I'd be in real estate.
You think I can handle it?

Every other divorced mom
at my kid's school is a realtor.

I think you can handle it.

Bonnie, I still don't get
why you want to see this house.

The foundation is totally out of whack.

I mean, the whole house is slanting down
to that cliff over there.

Uh-huh. Can you open the sliding door?

I'll take it.

JASON: So, tell me again,
where's the lake?

-Right there.
-And where's the summer camp?

Right over there.

I'll take it.

Now, I am obligated
to disclose

that the previous owners
were murdered in this house.

(CHUCKLES) Whoa, buddy!
Quit drilling, you already struck oil.

I just don't know if this is
the right time to buy.

Yeah, you're probably right.

Maybe we should wait
till you graduate college.

Thank you, but I'm

Brian, five sales this week.
You're killing it.

Yeah. And last night,
I closed another big deal.

-Kim in marketing.
-(CHUCKLES)

What are the specs?

She's a two-breast,
one-ass fixer-upper.

The entire property
was covered in a thick brush.

(ALL LAUGH)

Everyone in the office besides us
is garbage.

Wow, Brian, you're doing great here.
You're really on fire.

Thanks. I guess I should stop, drop
and roll.

(CHUCKLING) Whoa.

That's enough.

The only thing is,
anyone can sell a nice house,

but a real star is someone
who can sell a dump.

I can sell anything.

Well, we got this crap condo
down by the marina.

We haven't been able to unload it
in two years.

You find some sucker to buy it,
and I'll make you partner.

All right, sounds good.

It's a plan.

Hey, did I tell you
about Kim in marketing?

You mean my wife Kim?

I'm gonna go sell that condo.

God, there's got to be
a sucker to buy this condo.

Guys, this is on me.

I just hit 20 years in the air,
and I got a big bonus.

It's sad when planes 'splode.

What? Yeah, I guess.

Anyway, I am flush.

For the first time in my life,
I got money to burn.

Looks like I found my sucker.

(DINGING)
(APPLAUSE)

Whoa. What?

I didn't know you worked out
at this gym, too.

Hey, Brian. Hang on,
I'm just finishing a set.

Come on, come on, two more.
Come on, come on, you gotta want it.

Nice job.
Let's get you a rubdown.

I'm glad I bumped into you

because I've been meaning
to give you something.

What's this?

That is the money
you loaned me.

Oh, that's pretty cool. Thanks.

You're welcome.

I just wish I could do
something more for you. Hmm.

I could make you rich.
No, no, no, that's just money.

I'll think of something else.

What're you talking about, Brian?

No, no, no.
I've said too much.

The one thing they're pretty firm about
at the office

is you don't take the inside deals
and give them to your friends.

What... What kind of inside deal
are you talking about?

All I can say is,

underpriced waterfront property

that's guaranteed to appreciate in value.

That's all I can say.

Oh, wait, are you bothered
by sorority noise, though?

Uh, I don't know, Brian. I don't know
if I'm a real estate investor.

Well, you might surprise yourself.

I mean, I didn't think I'd ever be
friends with Ice-T.

What are you thinking about?

Thinking about putting
black guy hair in a ponytail,

'cause the times change,
but I don't.

All right, guys, here it is.
Prescott Towers.

The ceiling is a pool. The ceiling is
a pool. Quagmire, you gotta get this.

I don't know about buying a place
without seeing it first.

Of course not.
I wouldn't expect you to.

But as your friend, I wanted
to let you know early,

because there's another buyer
who's about to snap it up.

I think he's a pilot for Delta?

Delta? It's not Lew Sheridan, is it?

Well, I'm not
really permitted to say.

-Do you like Lew Sheridan?
-I hate Lew Sheridan.

-It's Lew Sheridan.
-That son of a bitch!

Say what you want,
but he's got an eye for real estate.

Let me just give him a call and let him
know he's gonna get the place.

Wait, wait, wait!

Okay. I'll take it.

All right. You won't be sorry.

Yeah, that condo looks awesome.

You're making
a smart move, Quagmire.

Like I did when I wanted to get out
of that boring meeting.

Third quarter projections indicate
our sales will be down 40%.

Why don't we go through
the profit-loss statement

line by line from
the past six quarters,

which will offer us a good cost
analysis comparison...

-(PETER GRUNTING)
-...that I think we'll be able to utilize

as we move forward
into the next fiscal year.

Hey, guys, I gotta leave. I got a
nosebleed, and, uh, I don't work here.

All right,
Quagmire, now when you

introduce us to
the ladies by the pool,

I'm a millionaire,
Joe's a war hero,

and Cleveland is Magic Johnson.

I own a lot of theaters. I hope you don't
know much else about me.

Is this the right address?

This doesn't look like the building
from Brian's presentation.

Come on, Quagmire.
Never judge a book by its cover.

Or a movie.

No.

Eh, it's probably nothing,

but there's a stain on the rug
in the shape of a little kid.

I don't know if
you want this now,

but I bought you a mini cactus.

What the hell?
This is a dump.

Well, maybe it's still
got a nice ocean view.

The harbor is poisoned.

Damn it. Brian screwed me.

That's why I've never made
any major investments with my dog.

What am I gonna do?
I sank my entire bonus into this place.

Let me see your contract, Quagmire.
There's gotta be a way out of this.

I'm gonna kill him,
that's what I'm gonna do.

Club Amigos. That's what
we're gonna call this place.

Here it is.
You've got 72 hours

after closing to
rescind the purchase.

State law.

Thank God. I gotta go tell
Brian the deal's off.

Oh, there's a head in the freezer.
Ooh, and sherbet!

We're looking for Brian Griffin.

I'm still within 72 hours,
and I wanna get out of my contract.

You'd have to speak
to Mr. Griffin about that.

But I'm sorry,
he's not in the office.

Where the hell is he?

Slow down, Quagmire.

This sounds like a discussion to have
over a cone-shaped cup of water.

Ah.

You can drink from these

and then put 'em on your head
to be a clown from an Italian opera.

I'll let him know you stopped by.

(SIGHS) Fine. Glenn Quagmire.
Have him call me the minute he gets in.

They're gone.

Well, for the next 72 hours, I'm gonna be
harder to find than a nice cat.

You need me to clean out your litter box?

Mittens!

Okay, Rupert,
we're going to play a game.

I'm gonna be Buffalo Bill, and you're
gonna be a great, big fat person.

-Close the lid.
-Brian? What are you doing?

I'm hiding from Quagmire
for a few more hours.

After that, he won't be able
to pull out of that deal.

Well, if anybody knows how to pull out,
it's Quagmire.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC ENDS)

I have a lot of fun up here in my room.

QUAGMIRE: Welcome home.

Ahhh! Hey, hey, there, buddy.

There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

That's why you've been hiding from me
in this motel?

Now let me out of this deal
and give me my money back.

Look, if you're not happy
with your current property,

we could roll your money over
into something in Sinkhole Estates.

Those places are going very fast, though.
Who's a pilot you hate?

You are such a scumbag.

You know, when you were poor,
you were always a douche,

but at least you came by it honestly.

But now, screwing over the people
who helped you?

I don't know how
you sleep at night.

(SIGHS)

My God.

You're right.

I'm a jerk.

I'm a selfish and pretentious jerk.

And you're the only guy in town
who's ever called me out on my crap.

You know,
I used to hate you for it,

but now I think you're the only person
who was trying to be my friend.

No, I think you're
misunderstanding me.

No, I'm serious.

Even though I know
you never liked me,

you still helped me
when I really needed it.

That says a lot
about your character.

I'm ashamed of myself because I am
none of the things you are.

You're honest and direct

-and compassionate...
-(BEEPING)

And that is 72 hours.
Enjoy your crap-hole, dumbass!

You son of a bitch!

Wow, so I guess that's it
for you and real estate, huh, Brian?

(LISPING) Yeah, it was a lot tougher
than I thought.

Oh, yeah, it's real hard
being a real estate agent.

I mean, you got to be able
to count bathrooms.

I once beat a real estate agent
in a game of chess.

Me. A well-known buffoon.

Face it, you failed
at people's safety net job.

Oh, come on, guys. Give me a break, huh?
I've had a rough day.

You've had a rough day? You guys
wouldn't believe the day I've had.

First of all, I didn't have any clean
underwear this morning,

so I had to wear a bathing suit.

Then I missed the bus,
of course.

Then it looked like
it was gonna start to rain.

Luckily, it didn't.

And like that wasn't enough,
then we had a pop quiz in history.

-(PETER GRUNTING)
-Oh, European history.

American history was last year. Then...

LOIS: Peter, get in here!

You want to tell me what the hell happened
to our Thanksgiving turkey?

Oh, that, uh...

Well, last night, Brian and I got drunk
and ate the turkey.

But before you get mad,
we also ate the salad.

Damn it, how could
you guys do that?

Boy, I must have been really drunk.
I don't remember any of that.

No problem. Instagram
remembers for you.

Peter, we've got
a houseful of people coming

and they're
expecting a turkey.

Well, if they're
expecting a turkey,

I'll just put on
<i>Evan Almighty</i> for them.

(GLEEFULLY) Zap!

You and Brian better get another
turkey right now!

And don't bother
coming back until you do!

Don't worry, Lois.
We will.

Yeah, we'll be back
with a turkey

faster than you can
say "Jack Robinson."

Jack Rob...

Jack Row...

(SLURRING)

She had a stroke
that killed

the part of her brain that

We got plenty of time.

All right, Brian,
first order of business,

we have to decide
who gets to ride

in the cart and
who has to push it.

Well, I'm smaller, so...

The decision has
been made.

Ooh, now
I want that one.

Aw, crap, looks like they're
completely sold out.

Yeah, sorry. We just sold our
last turkey to that guy.

You are the turkey I have chosen
to pardon. Fly free, turkey!

(SCREAMS)

Oh, fudgsicles!

Hey, you don't sell
turkeys here, do you?

We've been to every grocery store in town
with no luck.

No, the only thing
we really sell here

are these little
packets of weird vitamins

that vaguely suggest they help you
in the bedroom.

"Performance
and stamina, for men."

I know what
that means.

(PLAYING <i>Stars</i>
<i>and Stripes Forever)</i>

Peter, enough.
Come to bed.

Uh-uh, Lois. The packet says
I gotta play till I'm raw.

Can't believe
every turkey

within a 60-mile radius
of Quahog is sold out.

I know.

And now we're
so far from home,

none of your
stations even work.

No. And why are you saying

It's weird. That is weird, you're right.

Well, they'd better
get here soon.

I can't host this Thanksgiving dinner
on my own.

Hear that?
This thing's all on you.

What? What are
you talking about?

Well, the fat man's never going to
get back in time,

and with him gone, that makes you
the man of the house.

I sentence you
to death!

Chris, Chris, slow down.
I'm just saying, without Peter here,

you're going to have to be
the host of Thanksgiving.

You have to do everything
the fat man normally would.

You mean, like,
fall asleep on the toilet

and have a big red ring
on my bum for a week?

No, no, no. Greeting guests as they
arrive. Facilitating small talk.

And, of course, giving
the Thanksgiving toast.

Boy, yesterday I'm microwaving a cat,
today I'm giving a speech.

Things move fast
around here.

Hi, do you have
any turkeys?

Sure do. You're looking at one.
(LAUGHS)

I'm sorry.

You have to know me
to know I'm just joking.

Sir, the day we've had,
we could use a good chuckle like that.

You folks are in luck.
Looks like we have one turkey left.

Oh, thank God.

You're telling me.

If we didn't come
back with a turkey,

Lois would be madder than that time she
got a Capp smear.

All right, we're just going to take
a quick Capp smear.

Don't you mean
Pap smear?

No, at this hospital

we obtain
the sample using

beloved British comic strip
roustabout Andy Capp.

'Ello, luv.
Let's have a smear.

I'm not letting you do that.
You can't even see.

That's all right, bird.
I goes by smell.

Brian, look,
an eight-foot basket.

Let me just dunk the turkey once.
I know I can jam it.

(GRUNTS)

That's not
a regulation rim.

Okay, you know what?
I'm in charge of the turkey.

You're driving.

-This thing on?
-Yes.

It's not making
any noise.

It's a hybrid.
Trust me, it's on.

No, it's not. See?

(WHIRRING)

Peter, what the hell?
You chose a turkey over me? I almost died!

I swear to God, I thought dogs could
breathe underwater.

Great. The water
completely killed my phone.

Oh, horrors.

You have to spend time
with me without looking at your phone.

Here, give me yours.

I threw mine at a duck.

Excuse me, can you help us?
We're trying to get back to Quahog.

If you want, I can take you
as far as the bus station.

You can?
Oh, thank you so much!

Oh, that is the nicest thing
anyone's done for me

since my kids gave me
that Father's Day gift.

Oh, look, a tie.
Perfect.

It's from all of us!

All right, Chris,
acting as host

will demand a higher
level of conversation.

I suggest as your opener,
"Lois, everything is delicious."

Then that's
what I will say.

Unless Slender Man
commands me to say something else.

Ugh, this is gonna be a bigger disaster
than Y2-Gay.

CROWD (CHEERING):
Three! Two! One!

Oh, thank God we got on this bus.
I really had to poop.

Wait, where is there
a bathroom on this bus?

I didn't say there was a bathroom,
I just said I had to poop.

MAN: Oh, my God!
This is gross even for a bus!

(GRUNTING)

I don't know what they were so mad about.
I did it in a Rite Aid bag.

Damn it, Peter!
That was our only way home!

Well, that's where you're wrong, Brian.
Free bus bike!

Oh, crap, this is
a girl's bike.

All right, we'll ride it, but pray to God
nobody from school sees us.

-Nice bike, butt-munch!

Unless we hitchhike.

Hitchhike?

You know how
dangerous that is?

Besides, we're in
the middle of nowhere.

There aren't even
any cars around.

There's one.

Hey! Hey, stop!
Give us a ride!

It's just me and my upright dog.
We're obviously not weirdos!

See, Brian? Told you.
We're going to be home in no time.

-Hi there, folks. Hand over the turkey.
-What?

I can't go back to my
wife without a turkey!

Oh, yeah? Bet that
thing's not even loaded.

(GUN FIRES)

help in the kitchen.

Sometimes I pluck them
because I deserve pain.

Cut! No. Stop.

I'm sorry! I panicked!

It's all right. It's okay.
Don't worry, Chris.

You can't always get things right
on the first try.

Just look at Snoopy's

(LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING)

Hey, you having
a good time tonight?

(AGGRESSIVE GRUNTING)

Oh, yeah.

Can't believe
we got robbed.

Yeah, but can we
just talk for a second

about how brave I was
when we walked past that cemetery?

Peter, do you not see that we are
completely screwed here?

And it's all
thanks to you!

You drove my car into a lake,
you almost let me drown,

you got us thrown off a bus,
you broke our bike,

and now you've gotten our turkey stolen
and Thanksgiving is ruined

and we don't have
any transportation

and we're still
miles from home!

You're starting to get black gums
like an older dog.

You know what? You know what?
Maybe it's my fault.

I forgot, I'm talking to a complete idiot.
You are so stupid!

Oh, yeah?

Well, if I'm so stupid,
then how did I

manage to frame you
for eating the turkey?

-What?
-Yeah!

Didn't you notice you were passed out
in all those photos?

You didn't eat any of it.

I just posed you like that because
I didn't want to take all the blame.

You son of a bitch!
How could you do that to me?

You're a dog, Brian.

I can throw you
off a bridge,

and as long as I don't
hit a person on a boat, it's okay.

Screw this. I am done!

This isn't even my problem,
it's your problem.

You know what, Peter?
You've got no turkey,

and now you've got
no friend. Goodbye!

Brian, wait!

<i>Now let's watch</i>
<i>a whole bunch of ads</i>

Nice Thanksgiving. I don't know why
I ever listen to that jerk.

What?

Home is this way,
we're both just walking home.

-Leave me alone!
-No way.

We're a team, Brian,
whether you like it or not.

Just like almond butter and no sugar added
fruit preserves.

Who's hungry?

-We are!
-We are!

NARRATOR: Hey, kids, would you like
a terrible, healthy sandwich?

-No.
-No.

NARRATOR: Too bad, because
your recently-divorced mom

has a crush on her trainer,

and he eats like this,
so now you have to, too.

Almond butter and no sugar added
fruit preserves,

just like PB and J, but with more of
your mom railing this guy.

I named myself Kaya!

We stopped
being a team

when you framed me for eating that
turkey with you.

Brian, maybe you should be
a little less mad at me

and a little more
mad at the guys

growing mustaches
for this month.

Hey, don't mock
Movember.

Last year, I raised $8 and got on
a BuzzFeed listicle.

No! You use real words!

Internet stuff
is not real words.

Hey, look!

There's our answer.

We break into the zoo, steal a turkey,
bring it home, we're heroes.

Peter, stop it!
You're gonna get yourself hurt.

Sorry, can't hear you.
Too busy saving our family's Thanksgiving.

(SIGHS) Damn it.

This is idiotic. You're never gonna
find a turkey in there.

Oh, I'll find one.

I mean,
you're looking at the guy

who found
the Fountain of Youth.

It's very far away
from here!

Hey, Lois,
thanks for letting Kevin

bring his
girlfriend this year.

And I hope it's not awkward
that she's a little person

and they viciously
fight all the time.

Why do we have to
spend every holiday with your family?

Shut up! I'm a full-size person!
I make the decisions!

Don't you worry.

This'll quickly turn into
rough, front-yard, makeup sex.

All this fighting is
making me so damn hot.

Oh, my God. It looks like he's
chalking a pool cue.

Hey, scoot over.
As the oldest guy here,

it's my duty to take an open-mouth nap
in the middle of the room.

(SNORING)

(GRUNTS, GROANS)

(SNORING)

God, look at my mom.

Dinner should've been served
half an hour ago.

She's clearly
stalling for time.

Okay, everybody.
Dinner's gonna be ready very soon.

(GRUNTING)
Uh, what? Good.

But before we get started,
I thought we could all take turns

telling a long story about how things
aren't the way they used to be.

Daddy, would you
care to start?

You bet I would.
Too much candy!

Too much candy?
What do you mean, too much candy?

There's too much candy!

There used to be
four candies.

Bulls-eyes, Yahoos,
Sweet Yarn and cigarettes.

Now I go into a store,
I don't know whether I'm coming or going!

Is there anything else?

Why don't ballplayers
wear giant woolen shirts anymore?

What's wrong with wool?
It was a perfect fabric.

You go to the ballpark,
get your bag of Bulls-eyes

and watch Hack Wilson
round the bases in a big wool shirt.

I once saw Hack hit
a ball out of the infield.

I still remember the thud of the bat
and the whoosh of the wool.

(SIGHS) I wish
things were still heavy.

The rails are off
this thing.

All right, Chris,
this is where you,

as host,
need to step in and...

Chris? Chris?

What the hell?
Are you drunk?

I couldn't handle
the pressure, Stewie.

We Irish,
we have a deep sadness.

Come on, get up!
They need you down there.

(SLURRING)
<i>Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral</i>

so my wife can cook you wrong?

Ah, damn it!

Peter,
this is never gonna work.

All right, just leave the turkey alone.
The poor thing is... (SCREAMS)

Knock it off! Ow!

Damn it,
I'm gonna kill you, you dick!

Brian, it's getting away!

Where'd he go?

(CHIMPS SCREECHING)

-He's not in here.
-Over there!

(MACHINE WHIRRING)

(GRUNTING)

-Oh, crap.
-(LIONS GROWLING)

Hey, it's Thanksgiving.

Shouldn't you be in Detroit losing

(GROWLING)

PETER: Brian, up here!

(ROARING, GROWLING)

Oh, my God. Thank you, Peter.
Thank you so much!

Hey, you're welcome, buddy.

You... You saved
my life.

Of course I did.
You're my best friend.

Hey, listen, I'm... I'm sorry I messed
everything up today.

(SIGHS) It's okay.

I guess I've been kind of a jerk, too.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

Ah, I deserved it.

I mean, for God's sake,
I sank your car in a lake.

And I broke this
guy's neck just now.

Yeesh. But, hey, we cut the legs off him
and dye him brown,

we got ourselves a turkey,
right?

No. We've come this far.
Let's do it right.

Hey, you got a tiny head and a big body.
What if I switched that?

(GRUNTS)

Gotcha!

All right, we did it!

We got ourselves a turkey.

Yeah, but
what time is it?

I mean, dinner has to
have started by now.

We're never gonna
make it home on foot.

Maybe we don't have to.

We're now arriving
in Quahog.

Up on the right are the people
with the awesome trampoline,

but they don't let
me on it no more,

'cause I bounced
a kid onto the house.

There were no squeezable condiments.
Ketchup came in a can.

And, Daddy, what about the pants
that kids today are wearing?

Are they
properly sized?

Are we gonna eat soon?

I have an interesting factoid
about what makes you sleepy afterwards.

Yeah, the hell with this.
I'm starving.

Okay, I guess
we should eat.

Well, obviously
Peter's not here,

so it's fallen to me
to take up the mantle.

Now, I wasn't
planning on doing this today,

but when I look around
at all of these open,

loving faces of
friends and family,

I'm comfortable
enough to finally say

that I am a proud,
unashamed, active...

Lois, we're home
and Thanksgiving is saved!

Kidding!

Oh, my God, where the hell
have you been?

And what are you
doing with a live turkey?

A live turkey who
loves rollerblading.

Our dog drew that.

Peter, we can't eat
a live turkey.

Look, Lois, I still got time
to make this right, and I'm gonna.

Hand me a nine iron
and show me to the backyard.

Well, buddy,
I guess this is it.

(GRUNTING)

Wow. I read
that look wrong.

Ah, geez, I'm sorry.

I wish you didn't
have to die,

but a bunch of white people
put on sweaters.

-I couldn't do it.
-What?

I'm sorry, Lois.

I know you wanted
the perfect Thanksgiving,

and I know I screwed that all up for you,
but when you think about it,

isn't this holiday about
being with people you love?

I mean, does it
really matter what we eat?

What matters is we're all together.
Family and friends.

And one new friend.

Oh, Peter,
that's beautiful.

Lois, can the turkey
please join us for dinner?

Not as the meal,
but as our guest?

Of course he can.

Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone.

(GUN FIRES)

ALL: <i>He's a family guy!</i>

Oh, I love shopping
at Christmas time.

Ugh, mall food courts
are so depressing.

You can always tell which fathers are
disappointed in their sons

because they eat lunch
with their coats still on.

How's that food, dum-dum?

Too bad eating ain't math, 'cause then

I'd have something to be proud of.

I want to go live with Mom.

I know. So do I.

Welcome to Tommy Bahama.

Yeah, you got anything
for a poor, fat person

who wants to look like a rich, fat person?

Of course.

Now, I'll mostly be hitting on waitresses

who are too young and thin
to ever be interested in me.

Hitting on them in a kindly, genial way?

No, in a threatening, creepy,
I'm-joking-but-I'm-not-really-joking way.

You have anything for that?

Sir, what you're describing is precisely
Mr. Bahama's vision.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Tommy Bahama,</i>
<i>five million uncles can't be wrong.</i>

Hey, sorry to bother you,
but would you like to work here?

-Me?
-Yeah, you'd be perfect.

All right, now let me
just take off these security tags for you.

It's a living.

So random.

That's a comment on us.

Hey, check that out.

Oh, wow. This is awesome!

You know Jeff Garlin
has one of these in his house.

Ah, I love this chair.

Dog in a Jets jersey, get in here.

God, I have the best basement.

Peter, this chair costs $3,000.

That's not so much, Lois.

It's only infinity times
what you bring home every week.

Peter, look over there.

Is that... Is that Jesus?

Whoa, yeah, wow.

It's been a while since we've seen him.

Hey, Jesus.

-Oh, hey, guys.
-Hey, buddy.

What are you doing in Quahog?

Actually, I never left.

Really? Why didn't you call us?

Well, I felt kind of bad
about how we left things.

I wasn't sure you'd want to hear from me.

Oh, that's silly.

We could never stay mad at you.

Yeah, I've never been one to hold grudges.

I even forgave the man
who murdered my son.

And although I will never get over

the pain of what you did to my son,

I forgive you, because I believe

you are sick and in need of help.

Mr. Griffin,
this is the Office of City Planning.

You requested a variance
to build a hot tub off your garage.

Oh, yeah.

-Did I get it?
-No.

I will kill your son!

Your son is dead!

I'm so glad there's no hard feelings.

Listen, Peter, we should catch up.

Why don't you come over to my place
for a beer or something?

Aw, that sounds great.

Hey, you want me to pick anything up

on the way over or no, you're good?

Oh, uh...

I guess we could
maybe just order something.

Yeah, I don't have any cash,
but we'll figure it out.

Hey, Peter. Come on in.
<i>Mi casa...</i> Uh...

-I don't know Spanish.
-Huh.

I think half the world
would be surprised to know that.

Hey, nice place here.

This is not too... Too...

It's not... It's not too... Not too good.

Yeah, I know it's nothing fancy,

but, you know,
I'm not really into material possessions.

Geez, this place is depressing.

Hey, how come you aren't with your family
during Christmas, anyway?

I can't deal with my family
during the holidays.

And besides, my dad
always spends Christmas at his time-share

in Coral Gables with his girlfriend.

Great, here comes that couple with
the adult disabled kid.

Hey, can we join you?

I'm Ken, this is Pam
and this right here is Scott.

We really want to thank you, God,
for testing us.

It's been such a blessing.

Can't wait to see what
that "bigger plan" is.

Well, I can't tell you that.

But the good news is,
this little guy's gonna make it to 74.

Oh, look, Jesus,
you shouldn't be alone during Christmas.

And if I remember correctly,
isn't your birthday sometime soon, too?

Ah, whatever, I'm fine.

I'll probably just reheat some ramen
and watch <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

No way.

I'm not gonna let my pal Jesus
spend his birthday like that.

Hey, you know what?

I am throwing you
the best birthday party ever.

Are you sure about that?

Yeah, I'm great at throwing parties.

I was in charge of planning Woodstock.

All right, guys, here's what I'm thinking,

a whole festival of muddy boobs.

Well, don't you want to have music?

Oh, yeah.

That's a good way
to get those muddy boobs moving.

All right, you guys,
Jesus' birthday party is gonna be epic.

Hey, since it's also Christmas,

maybe we could make it,
like, a Christmas theme.

What about Secret Santa?

That's always fun.

Okay, but $5 limit.

Why don't we just say no gifts?

Come on, guys, we don't
have to make such a big thing about it.

It's not like I'm a woman
who's about to turn 30.

You guys, I don't care what
we do for my birthday,

as long as it lasts the whole week

and is very expensive
and inconvenient for all my friends.

Oh, and I'm gonna dress like a slut

and be rude to everyone for no reason.

But, Maya...

I don't care that your dad's dying,

we're all going to Montreal for the week.

Wait, hold on.

If we're planning a party, we haven't even

talked about the most important thing.

A hydration plan for people who overheat?

It could be as simple as an ice bath.

No, no, I'm talking about women.

Oh, yeah, we definitely
need some women there.

Jesus, what kind of girls do you like?

Women? Uh...

All types, I guess.

"All types"?

Come on, Jesus.

Even Martin Lawrence,
when he used to dress up like Sheneneh?

CLEVELAND (LAUGHS) Sheneneh.

No, you know what I mean.

Like, uh, hot ladies.

Horny ones who sex on you.

-What?
-Yeah, you know.

They come back to your house
and sit on your butt.

Wait a minute.

Jesus, have you ever been with a woman?

Are you...

Are you a virgin?

(SIGHS) Yeah, I am.

How the hell does that happen?

Well, in high school,
my best friend was this hot prostitute,

and I just kind of got
into the friend zone.

She's all like, "Oh, there's all these
guys having sex with me for money."

And I'm all like,
"Oh, you deserve better."

And then I died.

Well, sex is overrated.

Stay out of this, Joe.

All right, look, forget the party.

We got a more important mission now.

Your 2,000-year-long cold streak
is about to come to an end.

What do you mean?

I'm saying, Jesus,
we are gonna help you lose your virginity.

(SQUEALS)

God, I love sex.

All right, me and the guys are off

to help Jesus lose his virginity.

Just put it in the oven
for half an hour at 350.

-What?
-I don't know.

That's what you always say
when you leave the house.

Oh, Peter, just be careful.

Losing your virginity is a big deal.

I'm sure Jesus doesn't want
some gross quickie.

No, no, no, it's gonna
be nothing like that.

Just some random slut
to maul in a bar

back where the payphones used to be.

Peter, that's what I'm talking about.

You're making this whole thing crude.

It's his first time.

You need to be more sensitive.

Don't worry, Lois.
I swear, I'll be sensitive and gentle.

Like the Tasmanian Devil
tucking in his kids.

(TALKING GIBBERISH)

All right, Jesus, these speed date nights

are the best way
to meet a lot of chicks fast.

Now go get 'em.

So, where do you live?

Everywhere, all places.

Hopefully, inside you.

(BUZZER SOUNDS)

This is kind of embarrassing,
but are you okay with someone who smokes?

Oh, yeah.

Are you okay with someone who
wanders the desert,

-lecturing people on how to act?
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

So, are you having a good Friday?

Oh, is that supposed to be funny?

-Shut your mouth, bitch.
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

-How's the wine?
-It's terrific.

-That's my blood, you know.
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

Where are you from?

-Israel.
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)

All right, Jesus, nowadays, everything

is done on the Internet, all right?

So, we gotta get you on Facebook.

Uh, let me just close a couple
of these windows. There we go.

Sorry, I was up late last night.
(CHUCKLES)

Had the house to myself.

Sorry. Sorry.

Lot of POV stuff.

Yeah, I like to pretend it's mine
down there what's doing all the slapping.

Peter, how old is that girl?

Excuse me, won't you?

Argh! Lot of scumbags out today.

Well, no luck getting Jesus laid yet.

I don't get it. Jewish guys
are supposed to be swimming in tail.

Peter, Jesus is never gonna find a woman
going about it your way.

I think it's time I had
a little talk with him

so he knows what a woman really wants.

All right, knock yourself out.

Don't look, don't look, don't look.

Jesus, I asked you to lunch because
I think you've been getting bad advice

about finding a special someone.

Well, Peter's been doing his best,

but lately he seems more focused

on marketing his erotic Advent calendar.

All right, kids, let's see what's
under Christmas...

Ugh! Another puckered anus.

Look, Jesus, just forget
whatever Peter's been telling you.

You just have to be yourself
and let a sweet girl see that side of you.

Well, you're easy to talk to.

I just get all tongue-tied
with other girls.

Plus, being myself isn't that impressive.

What do you mean?

You're sensitive, you died for our sins

and ascended into heaven,
and you got nice skin.

Don't be afraid to be honest with a girl
and show her who you are.

Wow, thanks, Lois.

That's the second-best advice
anyone's ever given me.

I don't know, man.

Jesus "Hitler" Christ sounds weird.

-So just go with "H"?
-Yeah.

All right, guys,
let's not get discouraged, okay?

We just gotta be more creative
about getting Jesus laid.

I just tell folks to go down to
the Happy Handy Smile Massage

and get it over with.

I sometimes go down there,
and when they tell me I'm done, I leave.

Hey, guys.

-Uh, Peter, can I talk to you for a sec?
-Sure.

Peter, listen.

I've found the woman
who I'd like to lose my virginity to.

It's someone who understands me

and someone I feel very close to.

Oh, wow. Jesus, that's great.

Hey, is it Carrie Underwood?

Somebody told me you guys went out once.

Yeah, we did.

But it was a disaster.

-Jesus, take the wheel.
-What?

I want to kill these (BLEEP) cops.

(SIREN WAILING)

Actually, Peter,
I want my first time to be with... Lois.

Lois, my partner at the law firm?

No, Peter. It's your Lois.

Lois Griffin.

What?

I am outraged.

But probably not as outraged
as the 10 million Christians watching.

Please write to this address, quickly.

Maybe we can both stop
these Hollywood Jew writers

from wrecking my marriage
and your religion.

-You want to lose your virginity to Lois?
-No way.

Look, Peter, I know it's a lot to ask.

But if it wasn't okay,
I wouldn't suggest it.

Well, you make a good point.

But this is my wife you're talking about.

Please, Peter?

I just know Lois would make
my first experience

as special and memorable
as it should be.

Plus, I can make it worth your while.

After all, I'm Jesus.

I could give you anything you want.

Anything?

Like... Like anything in the universe?

Absolutely.

Brookstone massage chair.

-Really? Are, are you sure?
-Yep.

Never been more sure
of anything in my life.

Well, except one thing.

Good evening, sir.

Would you like to hear our specials?

No! Pizza!

Let me get this straight.

You want me to have sex
with another man?

Oh, not just any man, Lois.

This is Jesus we're talking about.

He's a savior.

He could even save our marriage.

Why? What's wrong with our marriage?

"What's wrong with our marriage?"

You're sitting around,
talking about sleeping with other guys.

Peter, this was your idea.

Lois, let's not play the blame game.

Clearly, there's been a lot of cheating
on both sides,

but the point is
where do we go from here?

Huh, I don't know.

Sleeping with Jesus just feels wrong.

Doesn't the Bible say
not to covet thy neighbor's wife?

Oh, come on, Lois, the Bible's just
a bunch of general guidelines.

None of the Commandments
are written in stone.

You're really okay with this?

Of course.

Look, there really is no downside to this.

It's one of those things that seems bad,
but really is good.

Like that fracking company
we let drill in the backyard.

Well, I guess it is kind of an honor

that out of all the people in the world,
Jesus chose me.

I mean, he could've had anyone.

Elizabeth Perkins, Patricia Richardson,
Katey Sagal.

Yeah.

I mean, maybe not them,
but somebody else.

And the son of God's first time
should be special.

Even divine.

Maybe I'd actually
be doing a good thing.

You sure about this, Peter?

You bet.

As sure as I was when
I created Lady Gaga.

All right, listen, fella,
your game is confusion.

Zip, zam, zoop!

Nobody gets a straight look at nothing.

Boy, this must be killing you.

You're an atheist,
and the one guy you don't believe in

is getting to bang
the woman of your dreams.

You know what?
I don't have to sit here and take this.

I'm out of here.

Can... Can you let me outside?

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, Peter.

Well, hello, young man.

Don't you look nice?

She's almost ready.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>There she goes</i>

<i>There she goes again</i>

<i>Pulsing through my veins</i>

<i>And I just can't contain...</i>

I'm sorry, I was just coming down
the stairs at the same time.

Wow, Mom.

You look beautiful.

Well, we know he's circumcised,

so she won't have to deal
with that nonsense.

Oh, and don't worry
about not hitting bottom.

I've only grazed it once
and that was with a running start.

Hey, Jerome,
give me another Pawtucket Pat.

I'll take it over here on my
Brookstone massage chair.

That's a nice chair, Peter.

Hey, do you think
if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie,

he'd give me back the use of my legs?

Joe, I don't speak for Jesus.

I just get him trim.

Now to take this thing out for a spin.

(SIGHS)

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

Ah, time for a relaxing,
sponsored daydream.

Oh, Jesus.

Jesus.

Jesus.

(SCREAMS)

God, I love massage chairs.

Are you in one, too?

Yes, but it's horrible.

It was bought for me by Jesus,
but now he's doing my wife.

Oh. I'm just trying mine out in the store.

Guys.

I think I might've made a terrible mistake

with this whole Lois and Jesus thing.

I don't blame you, Peter.

I always thought
it was sort of a strange choice

to let Jesus have
relations with your wife.

I'm sorry, did you say
Jesus is sleeping with your wife?

Great, now everybody knows
my wife is taking Jesus' virginity.

Listen, pal, Jesus ain't no virgin.

He did the same thing to me
last Christmas.

He what?

Yeah, Jesus did the same thing to my wife
Christmas before last

and my buddy's wife the year before that.

What the hell?

But he's so lonely.

Nah, he just acts lonely
and lies about being a virgin

so he can get with guys' wives.

Did he show you that
sad little apartment?

He doesn't really live there.

He just uses it
to store art he bought on cruises.

Oh, my God, what have I done?

Peter, maybe there's still time.

Maybe you can stop 'em.

-Where are they?
-They're at the Barrington Hotel.

Let's go, guys.

I just ordered nachos,
but good luck, Peter.

Now for a slippy, no-boots run through
the snow to my car.

(GASPING)

(SCREAMS) Aw, crap!
I just pulled a thousand muscles.

(GRUNTING)

(CRIES OUT)

(GRUNTING)

Ow! That was a loud crack.

Ah, yeah, that was all bone.

Oh! Aw! Son of a whore.

Oh, this is bad. This is real bad.

I'm not gonna go to the doctor, though.

-(IGNITION SPUTTERS)
-Damn it.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Get out! I need this car.

-What are you, a cop?
-No.

Jesus is about to have sex with my wife.

Oh, then here, take it.

Get out, I need this car.

So do I.

Jesus Christ is about to have sex
with my wife.

Lenny Kravitz is about to have sex
with my daughter.

Oh! Oh, my God.

Here, take the car, take the car.

Get out of here. What are you doing?

Go, go, go.

Hey, kid, I need that toboggan.

Jesus Christ is gonna have sex
with my wife.

Um, okay.

And I need your little hat.

And those Spider-Man mittens,
I'll need those, too.

And what's in your pockets?

A rabbit's foot, a penknife,
a bottle cap, a compass...

All of it, all of it.

(CAR HORN BLARES)

Aw, crap, I'm out of hill.

You there! Boy.

What does that sign say?

(IN COCKNEY ACCENT)
I ain't much for book readin', sir.

But I seen our Lord and Savior
bring a lady in there

for a Christmas rogering, I did.

You're a good boy. Here's a goose.

(GOOSE HONKS)

What room is Jesus in?

What room is Lenny Kravitz in?

Aw, you were coming here, too?
We could've carpooled.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

Lois! Lois!

You son of a bitch.

What have you done to my marriage?

Peter?

Lois, don't do this.

I think I had, like, a Christmas miracle.

I realized I don't want other people
humping my wife for a chair.

It's okay, Peter.

Nothing happened.

It didn't?

No, I couldn't sleep with him.

Not that I wasn't tempted.

He put actual strawberries
in a glass of champagne,

which was about the classiest,
sexiest thing I'd ever seen.

-But...
-I couldn't go through with it.

Our marriage is too important to me.

I love you, Lois.

I don't know what I was thinking.

But you.

You're a liar, Jesus.

Bravo, Peter, Lois.

Seems like you folks
learned the lesson I intended.

What lesson?

Oh, you know, uh, that, uh, this
holiest of days is about appreciating

our loved ones and, uh,
resisting temptation.

Oh, so it was a test.

Like when your father told Abraham
to sacrifice Isaac?

Yes, that.

That's exactly right.

Uh, well, I can see my work here is done.

Well taught, Jesus.

Well taught.

Yeah, I guess. Who cares?

I'm not even real. Merry Christmas.

Well, Lois, I'm sure glad
you didn't have sex with the Messiah.

Me too, Peter.

Now let's open your presents, kids.

Oh, Rupert, you're such a sneak.

I wonder what it is.

Oh.

A Joni Mitchell CD.

"To continue your emotional education."

That's great. (CHUCKLES)

That's really great.

Could you excuse me
for just one moment?

(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

<i>I've looked at clouds</i>

I'm gonna let that teddy bear

Hi, Chris, how was school?

Wait, what's that note
pinned to your backpack?

Bet it's from a girl in the lunchroom
who wants a taste of corn dog.

Was that a sex joke?

It's...

I don't know, shut up.

Oh, dear, it's from Principal Shepherd.

Peter, he wants to see us
first thing tomorrow.

Oh, Chris is in trouble.

Sounds like he needs
a little fatherly wisdom.

Better get my pipe. (INHALES)

Peter, I think that's
the wrong kind of pipe.

I'm sorry, Mom.

I haven't been doing too great
in school lately.

Well, that's very disappointing.

I guess your father and I
will have to talk to the principal

and figure out how to handle this.

Ah, I wouldn't worry, Lois.

I never did very well in school, either.

I even failed homeroom.

Peter Griffin?

There.

Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

Chris seems to be struggling
in his classes.

And often when
kids have trouble in school,

it's because something
is going on at home.

I haven't been attracted to Lois
for a year and a half.

Principal Shepherd,
exactly how poorly is Chris doing?

Well, right now,
he has a D-minus average.

His only hope is his
history final tomorrow.

If he fails that, I'm afraid he'll have to
repeat ninth grade.

This seems more like a phone call.

Oh, my God.

I always knew Chris
wasn't a great student,

but I had no idea
the situation was so dire.

Don't worry,
I'll make sure Chris passes history.

You can count on me.

The same way NASA counted on me
during the Apollo 13 crisis.

All right, I'm gonna need three coffins,
mahogany with brass handles,

three new daddies
for the dead astronauts' kids

and a black suit for me.

Sir, I think I know a way we can
get them back.

-Is it hard?
-It might be.

Yeah, we've kind of already decided
we're going in this direction.

All right, Chris, you got a lot

riding on this history exam tomorrow.

I know.

Sam Cooke didn't know
much about history,

and he got shot in a hotel wearing nothing
but a sports coat and a shoe.

Yeah, that's hilarious,
Chris, but we gotta buckle down.

Now, I'm gonna help you study
by nailing your door shut.

That way, you'll have no choice
but to hit the books.

(HAMMERING)

-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
-Oh, crap, I left my phone in there.

-(DOOR HANDLE JIGGLING)
-Damn it, it's nailed shut.

-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
-Dad, it looks like

some girl sent you
a picture of her privates.

PETER: Oh, crap.
Lois, I don't have the phone!

Stop sending pictures!

LOIS: I already sent four more!

(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

Chris, put down the phone!
Don't look at those!

Wait a minute, that's both her hands.

Who the hell is taking the pictures?

(GRUNTS) All right, give me that phone
and get back to work.

And before you judge your mother,
you did most of that damage.

(SIGHING)

Hey, Chris. Just wanted to see how
the studying's going.

You guys, I've been at this all night,
and I haven't learned a thing.

There's no way I'm gonna pass
Mr. Harpington's history test.

Oh, come on, Chris.
I'm sure that's just the nerves talking.

Here, I'll quiz you.

Who said, "We have nothing to fear
but fear itself"?

-Scooby-Doo?
-No.

-Shaggy?
-It's nobody on <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

Wow, Chris, you, uh...
You really don't know history.

I know. And if I fail ninth grade,
I won't amount to anything.

I'll end up being one of those bus drivers

that parents don't completely trust.

You have a beautiful child, Mrs. Roberts.

God, poor Chris.

He's studying as hard as he can,
but it doesn't seem to matter.

Well, we gotta do something.

If he doesn't pass this test,
he's gonna have to... Hey.

He's gonna have to repeat ninth grade.

Well, there's not
much we can do about it.

Some people just aren't
able to learn from books.

Well, maybe he doesn't have to.

What do you mean?

Maybe there's a way
to actually show Chris history,

with my time machine.

You know,
that's really nice of you, Stewie.

Well, he's my brother.
We've got to stick together.

Like that two-headed girl on TLC.

Okay, who wants to taste it,
and who wants to smell it?

All right, we'll just
tell Chris he's dreaming,

because I don't want him to know
about my time machine.

-Why not?
-Eh, it's like having a pickup truck.

Once people know you got one,
there go your weekends.

-Chris? Can you hear me?
-Huh?

You're dreaming.

I'm dreaming?

Yay, no consequences!

(SCREAMING)

So lifelike!

(SIGHS) All right, let's go back
six minutes and try this again.

Chris, you're dreaming,
with consequences.

-What?
-That's right.

We're gonna take you
on a special dream trip

to help you pass your history test.

You are?

Don't look at me like that.
Babe, I told you, it's a business trip.

All right, I've got the return pad

and the time machine
is powering up right now.

We should be leaving any moment.

This thing is awesome.
Stewie, can you believe Brian built this?

-Wait, what?
-Oh.

(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
Hey, come on, guys.

"Who built what" is not a question
on the history final, right?

Good point, Brian.
That's why victory is always Brian's.

You dick!

How much of my stuff
have you taken credit for?

-(BEEPS)
-(MACHINE POWERING UP)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Hey, everybody?
Just so you know, I'm straight.

<i>(YANKEE DOODLE</i> PLAYING)

All right, Chris,
I reviewed your textbook,

and I've programed
a tour of the various historical events

that you'll need to know for your exam.

So, pay close attention.

First stop, Washington, D.C.
The year is 1803.

Ah, the future.

Now, the man at the podium
is Thomas Jefferson.

And this is a very important moment.

He's trying to convince Congress

to approve the Louisiana Purchase.

Come on, guys.

We're getting Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Nebraska, Kansas,

Wyoming, North Dakota,
South Dakota and Louisiana.

What are the chances
all those states suck?

(CONGRESS MURMURING)

This is Paris, 1920.

This bar is where famous American writers,
like Ernest Hemingway,

would go for a drink.

Oh, my God, there he is.

Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway,
can I have a beer with you?

Sure. I love life
and all the people in it.

Thanks.

And, hey, as a fellow writer, I would
love to talk to you about the craft.

I mean, God, if only we could get
rid of these damn arms

and attach the pen directly
to the heart, right?

(GUNSHOT)

You guys, I got his pen!

Now, Chris, this is Brazil
before the invention of the soccer ball.

Australia before the shark-tooth necklace.

And Italy before pasta.

-Ay!
-Oh!

Vowel sound.

They were always a ridiculous people.

Hey, <i>Family Guy,</i>

you're lucky I got
a manicotti in the oven,

Or I'd bash your face into a bolognese.

That's two kinds of food.
That's how angry I am.

-(GUNSHOTS)
-(SCREAMS)

(MISSILES WHISTLING)

Oh, my God. Where are we?

Omaha Beach, 1944. This is D-Day.

What's that over there?

Oh, that's Double D-Day.

Be careful. It could be a booby trap.

(CHUCKLING) Oh, Otto.

Here we are. Christmas night, 1776.

The father of our nation,
George Washington,

is about to boldly cross the Delaware.

What's on his arms?

Those are water wings.
He was terrified of the water.

Easy.

All right, Chris, it's 1798,
and we're in the home of Jane Austen.

Jane Austen?

I don't think she's on
my history test, Stewie.

Oh, I know. We're just here to release
pent-up time travel farts.

-Awesome.
-Yeah!

(ALL FARTING)

(SNIFFING)

Oh, yeah. Give me some of that.

Mmm. The insides of men,
this is what fuels me.

-(SNIFFING AND GRUNTING)
-(CHRIS FARTING)

Okay, time for some recent history.
This is the 1990s.

-This is the entire 1990s?
-Yes.

(DOG WHIMPERING)

Wait a minute. Pre-Soviet Russia?
This wasn't on the manifest.

Yeah, this is kind of a personal thing.

How's this for positive reinforcement?

(PAVLOV GROANING)

(PANTING)

(SPITS)

All right, where to next?

I wanna kill more scientists!

All right, Chris,
that was the British Parliament, 1912.

Next, we...

I say, that looks like
a young Charlie Chaplin.

(COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Sir, please take this money and use it
to pursue your dreams.

(THANKING IN GERMAN)

Stewie, I think that was a young Hitler.
You just gave money to Hitler.

Yeah, but before all the crazy stuff.

All right, Chris, let's discuss
what you've learned so far.

Now, what is your biggest takeaway
from our travels?

That you can't take a good nap
with keys in your pocket.

For God's sake, Chris.

You clearly have not paid attention
to anything we've shown you!

You're absolutely hopeless!

Did you ever consider the reason

you're having trouble passing ninth grade

is that you're incapable of anything else?

That this is the absolute zenith
of your ability?

Zenith means top.

No, it means TV.

Ha! Now I'm catching fire.

Damn it, Chris, your problem
isn't book learning,

it's that you're a moron!

This whole trip
has been a complete waste of time.

Screw you, Stewie. You're a jerk.

And I'm gonna win
that bowling tournament,

with or without you!

(WAILING)

What is he... What?

He doesn't even know
what we're preparing him for.

Chris? Chris, come back.

Well, we've looked all over London.
He's nowhere.

I don't know what the hell
we're going to do.

CHRIS: Hey, Stewie.

If I'm such a moron,
then how did I get on a fancy boat?

(HORN BELLOWS)

See you later, douche bags!

Oh, crap. Chris is on the <i>Titanic?</i>

Oh, no, it's okay, Brian.

We'll just go back in time
to before Chris ran off.

Oh, and I took your fancy smoke detector.

(GASPS) My God, he's got the return pad.

Brian, we've gotta get on that ship.

PURSER ON PA: <i>Attention, passengers.</i>

<i>The karaoke contest will begin</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

Okay, now we've really
gotta get on that ship.

Brian, we have to get on that ship.

It's our only hope to save Chris.

There. Jump onto that mooring rope.

We can use it to pull ourselves up.

(STEWIE GRUNTS)

Oh, thank God,
I wasn't sure we were gonna make it.

I wasn't worried.
I've faced bigger challenges.

Like trying to dress Jonah Hill
for the Oscars.

Okay, okay, perfect.
Tell him to stay exactly that weight.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Yes?

Oh, damn it!

Oh, my God, Brian.
This ship, it's... It's unbelievable.

It's even more magnificent
than I imagined.

That, Brian. That.
That's what I was telling you about.

That's brocade.

Come on, Stewie, we gotta find Chris

and the return pad before it's too late.

All right, let's split up.

I'll go search in first class,
you go down to steerage

and wade through the gross Irish
and Italians.

That's two.

Ugh. God knows what I'm gonna
find in steerage.

Bunch of drunk, fat, pie-faced,
Irish fools.

-(CELTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

have any of you seen

And I'm the baby.

-(ELEGANT MUSIC PLAYING)
-Chris?

What the hell?

Stewie, what are you doing?

Uh, dining at the captain's table.

Everyone at this table was
the first person to refrigerate something.

I refrigerated shoes.
Because everybody likes a cool toe.

Also, I gave the string quartet

the sheet music for
<i>Highway to</i><i>the Danger Zone.</i>

You have the sheet music for
<i>Highway to the Danger Zone?</i>

Uh, yeah. What do you think
I keep in this backpack?

It's all PowerBars and sheet music.

Stewie, you're supposed
to be looking for Chris.

I did. He wasn't in the Turkish bath,

the veranda cafe
or the Bloody Handkerchief Ball.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(COUGHING)

Oh, dear.

Relax, Brian, I think
I see Chris right now.

Really? Where?

I'm gonna go ahead and bet he's the guy

with the whole chicken stuck on his head.

(MUFFLED MUMBLING)

Hey, you're not Chris.

Pardon me, that's my hat.

(MUFFLED MUMBLING)

I know this thing's gonna sink,
but I'm having a good time.

-(CHRIS LAUGHING)
-Stewie, look.

Chris, there you are.

Well, well, well.

If it isn't Booger Breath
and the Mushroom Tip.

Uh, which one of us is which?

Chris, we have gotta get off this boat.

The <i>Titanic</i> was one of the biggest
disasters in history.

Well, if you're so worried,
why don't you alert the crew

and save everyone?

Because, Chris, we can't alter the past.
That's the first rule of...

Of, uh, dreaming.

Besides, saving this ship would mean
talking to, like, 80 people,

and I'm just not
in that kind of mood right now.

Look, Chris, just give us that thing
you took so we can all get home.

(THUDDING)

(ALL SCREAMING)

Quick, Chris, Stewie, get on!

To home.

Or, I'll just put in the coordinates.

(ALL WHIMPERING)

(CRACKLING)

Damn. The return pad.
It's been destroyed!

What? The whole thing's
been waterlogged.

I'll need to dry it out
and completely rewire it.

This would make a great movie.

And the parts I need to fix the return pad
certainly aren't on this ship.

We have to somehow get to dry land.

"Dry land"? Stewie,
almost everyone on the <i>Titanic</i> died.

-All right, calm down, Brian.
-No.

There's so much I haven't done.

I've never even successfully made love
to a woman in the shower.

Oh, my back!

WOMAN: Should I put my foot
in the soap dish?

BRIAN: Yeah, try that,
and maybe stand on your tippy-toes.

Aah! How does water make it dry?

(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)

This isn't gonna work.

Brian, this is our only hope.

The majority of people
who got on those lifeboats

were women of noble birth.

Now, I've given us all backstories.

I am Lady Antonia Tyler Carrington,
the Duchess of Lancashire,

the heir to the Earl of Portsmouth,

and the cousin of the Countess of Wessex.

Okay, great. And who are we?

I don't know,
you're just two sluts with me.

Hey, there's a lifeboat.

Uh, yeah, but it's got one of those
funny Southwest lifeboat attendants.

Hey, here's a reminder,

as you exit the boat,
don't forget to give us your extra snacks,

because as you know, we work for peanuts.

(LAUGHING)

That's refreshing.
Most of those guys are all serious.

There, that one. It's our last chance.

(STRING QUARTET PLAYING

Hey, they learned it.
What a bunch of pros.

(PASSENGERS CLAMORING)

(FEMININE BRITISH ACCENT)
Hello there, sir.

We are three noblewomen in distress.

Sorry, boat's full.

Um, what if one of us were to turn

this big ship into a "tug" boat?

(CHUCKLES) Wink, wink.

Wouldn't help you.

You're the fourth person to offer that,
and I'm kind of spent.

I don't believe this.

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Dear God, we're stuck here.

We're going to drown on the <i>Titanic.</i>

Oh, no, we're not.

Hey. I said you can't come on here.

Get out of my way, you son of a bitch.

No!

Oh, no! I can't swim
without my striped one-piece.

Everyone move over.
We're getting on this boat.

Please, take my baby!

Yeah, I'm sorry, if I take your baby,

I'm gonna have to take everyone's baby.

Can you believe that woman? Putting me
on the spot in front of everyone.

(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)

To home!

You see what you started?

Wow, Chris. You just saved our lives.
Thank you.

Oh, it was nothing, Brian.

Listen, Chris, I, um...
I think I owe you an apology.

I'm not someone
who often makes mistakes,

but, well, I was wrong earlier,
when I called you a moron.

No, you were right.

You're the smart one in the family,
and I'm the dumb one.

Oh, you're being too hard on yourself.

Look, you may not be
book smart or history smart,

but you're
throw-people-off-the-boat smart.

And, frankly, I'm starting to think
that's the best kind to be.

Thanks, Stewie.

Well, looks like
one ship was saved today.

A relation-ship.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Oh, thank God, we're back.

Wow, what an adventure.

Thanks, Dream Brian.
Thanks, Dream Stewie.

Brian, Stewie,
I just had the most amazing dream.

I was on a famous boat
called the <i>Gigantic.</i>

Yeah, he's gonna fail that test tomorrow.

Well, we gave it our best shot, Stewie.

It was still a nice thing
you did for your brother.

I suppose.

I just hope that Chris
killing one extra man on the <i>Titanic</i>

didn't alter anything in the present.

There he is. "Nigel Harpington."

Wait, "Harpington"?

Isn't that the name of Chris'
history teacher?

Yes, I think you're right.
That must be his ancestor.

Which means that
Chris' history teacher was never born.

Hey, everybody, I'm Teacher Doug,
and I don't believe in tests.

Yay!

Don't worry, Meg's holding our stuff.

Meg, don't drink that soda!

I'm serious, you guys.

I haven't been doing well
on these practice tests,

and I need to improve my score
to get into a good college.

You're in high school, sweetie.

You should be much more concerned

about your weight
than your SAT scores.

Don't listen to her, Meg.

Academics are extremely important.

Are the SATs essential? Vital? Crucial?

"D." All of the above.

I'll get the scissors

You could be a doctor, an architect.

Hell, you could even coach

The SATs are this weekend,
and there's

no way I'm gonna get a good score.

You know, Meg, maybe you should

get someone super
smart to take it for you.

Have someone take it for me?

But that's cheating.

No one cares
about cheating anymore, Meg.

Not since "Slick Willie" Clinton

lowered the nation's moral standards.

to take the SAT for you

You guys are my only friends,
and everyone in my family's a moron.

-What?

I said how about your dog? He's smart.

I was just thinking about you.

You know how I've always loved
your novel <i>Faster Than the Speed of Love?</i>

Okay, what's this?

She's peanut-buttering you up
for something.

No, I didn't even
know you'd read my novel.

Yeah, I'm a huge fan of <i>FATSPOL.</i>

I can't believe Amazon
is dumping it for 99 cents.

What? My book is on Amazon?

Oh, yeah, Brian, there's something
for everyone on Amazon.

In fact, you're so smart,

I thought you'd be the perfect person
to maybe take the SAT for me.

What? But that would be wrong.

Well, I suppose you
may look at it that way.

But a wise book once said,

"With the heart at stake, right and wrong
is a stake through the heart."

That one's on the cover.

Wow. Ensnared by my own verbal trap.

Well played, me, through you.

I'll take that test for you.

and I want to do it fast.

Ideas?

We should meet
the rebels head-on in Virginia.

Yes, and use our ships
to block their supply chains.

We could also use our troop advantage
to out-flank them in the west.

Uh, what did that baby just say?

All right, cell phones away,
eyes on your own paper,

and before we start,
who's giving me a ride home?

Not you, a girl.

For luck, Meg.

(FARTS)

We're all rooting for ya.

MAN: <i>What?</i>

Mail's here.

I got my SAT scores.

So, how'd we do?

"We" scored 1,000.

Nice. 1,000 on the nose. Boop!

You are welcome.

Brian, that's 1,000
out of a possible 2,400!

That's the worst score in my class!

-What?
-Damn it,

why did I ever think you were smart?

That's... That's not possible.

(LAUGHS) Brian's stupid.

I must alert the townsfolk.

Ya! Fly, Artemis, fly.

Hark, townsfolk.

Brian...

He... Oh, damn, what was it?

Brian...

Brian goes to college?

No.

Brian gets another book published?

Yeah, yeah, maybe that's it.

Tell all that Brian's getting
another book published!

Oh, thank God.

I thought it was gonna be
a Meg episode all throughout.

I got the lowest score in Meg's class?

How could this happen?

Face it, Brian.
This proves that you're stupid.

Proves it empirically.

That means it's verified.

I know!

I just weirdly woke
up in the laundry room.

Not now, Peter.

Geez, what's wrong with you?

Brian took the SAT for Meg,
and it turns out he's an idiot.

That's not true.

Methinks the Hoff protest a month.

Do you even know
what you're trying to say?

Hey, look, don't feel bad, Brian,
it's fun being stupid.

You don't got to worry about nothing,

you don't got to read books,
and you never die.

Peter, that... That's not correct.

How would you know, stupid?

(LAUGHING)

Thanks a lot, SAT.

Man, this is the worst day of my life.

-Empirically.
-Ah, careful.

Brian, being a dumb guy's not so awful.

I'll show you.

Come on, you're spending the day with me.

Here, you want a beer?

Peter, it's 11:00 a.m.

If the clock ain't digital,
you don't know that.

Well, actually, I could use a drink.

There you go, you look stupider already.

-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

Who cares?

Now, come on, we're gonna
party like it's the Roaring Twenties.

What, do you think

By the way,
a huge part of being an idiot

Yeah, that's right,

You think you're better than me?

Well, what should we do today?

Hey, yo, Stew.

My boy, Peter, and I are watching

this Sandler movie, <i>That's My Boy.</i>

You gotta come check it out, man.
It's amazeballs.

This is just the DVD menu.

(LAUGHS) No way.

Man, I am buzzin' hardcore
off of that chaw, man.

Brian, what the deuce?

(LAUGHS) Deuce, like poo.

Yes, yes, deuce like poo.
But what the devil has happened to you?

I woke up, kemosabe?

No, I mean it.

How could one bad test score
transform you into a complete moron?

Brian, I'm concerned
something is very wrong with you.

Nah, man, I've never
felt better, Beef Stew.

-Bazinga!
-(LAUGHS)

Like what the gay scientist says.

Hey, Brian, say something else from TV.

What you talkin' 'bout, Phyllis? (GROANS)

-(STEWIE GASPS)
-Oh, gross, he's getting his nose period.

Oh, my God,
we've got to get him to a hospital.

Don't worry, Brian. I'll save you.

I'm good in a crisis.

After all, I used to
work the suicide hotline.

MAN: (ON PHONE)<i> I... I just can't take it.</i>

Doesn't it make more sense to kill her?

Brian, the good news is
we've stopped the bleeding.

And we've removed the Matchbox car

that was lodged in your rectum.

I did that right after you passed out.

(LAUGHS)

Classic P-Dog.

But, Dr. Hartman,
why did he lose consciousness?

Well, keeping in mind the recent

behavioral changes you've described,

I did a CAT scan...

On a dog. (GIGGLES)

We laughed about that, too.

However, I'm sorry to inform you
that Brian has a brain tumor.

(ALL GASP)

Oh, my God.

There's only one thing to do,
shrink down to microscopic size,

enter Brian's brain,
and destroy the tumor from within.

I was raped by a bug.

Brain tumor.

How is that possible?

As a father in
a hospital getting bad news,

I am gonna sadly slide down the wall
and take my hat off.

I forgot the hat.

So, Doc, how much Jamba Juice
do I have to drink to cure this? Um...

I've also heard that,
like, crystals exist?

Dr. Hartman, do you think the brain tumor

might explain why Brian's been
acting so odd lately?

Hmm. Well, I haven't heard
of brains being linked to behavior,

but I suppose anything is possible.

Mom, is Dad gonna die?

No, Chris, Brian is the one
with the brain tumor.

Dr. Hartman, what's the prognosis?

Well, it says here
Brian's tumor is for office use only.

Ugh!

Benign, it says benign.

Oh, Brian, that's wonderful news.

You're going to be okay.

Winning.

(LAUGHS) Remember
somebody said that?

Well, since Brian's tumor
poses no immediate threat,

we can schedule surgery to remove it,

and he'll be back to
his old self in no time.

Well, I say we get that tumor out of him

right away before he gets any dumber.

No way, I'm never going
back to my old self.

I rock like this.

I'm legit, I'm uber, I'm awesome-sauce.

Either take the tumor out of him

or put one in me. I can't stand this!

So, if Brian doesn't have the surgery,
will he be all right?

I don't know, is Dax Shepard all right?

Eh, seems kind of gratuitous.

My point is, Brian could have the surgery
and be smart again,

or he could skip the surgery
and stay dumb like this.

Well, Brian, if you're happy this way...

Hells to the yeah, I am.

Hey, I was told there would be
a lollipop at the end of this?

Good, he doesn't know about the stickers.

I'll take two.

Brian, you're not
thinking clearly, all right?

You've got to agree to this surgery.

Because right now, you're as useless

as Black Widow is to the Avengers.

So, what's your superpower?

Kicking.

Oh, right, 'cause none of us can kick.

Hey, which one of you guys can kick?

Hulk, stop being nice.

Sorry.

(SINGING OPERA)

Hey, this isn't the Kenny Chesney concert.

No, I'm afraid that was a white lie
to get you here, Brian.

This is the opera.

I'm hoping that re-exposing you
to high culture

will remind you
of the joys of a refined mind.

Cool. I'm sitting on my foot
to hold in a dump.

Please don't embarrass me here.

Pepperoni pie, extra cheese. G32.

Oh, cool, My friend Pete is here.

Pete Za.

(LAUGHING)
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

That's gonna be me in, like, a minute.

Over here, bro.

Oh, I moved my foot.

Hey, this isn't the Kenny Chesney concert.

(SIGHS) No, Brian, this is called yoga.

Lots of smart people do it
instead of going to church.

And after we get done with this,

you're going to talk a lot
about being present and grounded.

You're going to be
impossible to be around.

Let's get started.

BRIAN: Whoa! Schwing!
Schwing! Schwing! Schwing! Schwing!

That was from <i>Wayne's World.</i>

That's the sound of Wayne's boner.

Okay, before you say anything, no,

this is not the Kenny Chesney concert.

We're here to have a nice civilized dinner

and to show you that you don't have to eat
all your meals in your car.

Now, we're going to start by hearing
the waiter give us the specials.

Good evening, our first special
is an almond-crusted salmon...

Hey, cram it, skinny.
Give me free food or I'm gonna tell people

on Yelp there was a pube in my salad.

Free food, right away.

Okay, all right.

I forgot that Yelp
is a weapon for dumb people.

You taught me something today, Bri.

That I can throw a frog 100 feet?

Ugh, I can't change you back.

This whole endeavor was doomed to fail.

Like an Asian guy going to a salon.

Hi, I want to have my anus breached.

He's gone, Rupert.

It appears I've lost
Brian to the dumb side.

So now I need you to be Brian.

Here's your collar, and here's a laptop.

Write something bad.

"It was the last day of summer and
the first day of the rest of her life."

Wow! You did that with your face.

Hey, what's this?

Gaylord practice?

That's the eighth time
you've asked me that today.

Listen, Brian,
I've been trying to change you.

But I realize that if you're happy,

I need to accept the you
that you want to be.

No matter how painful that is.

What are you doing?

My friend Terry told me you can get high
from licking paint.

-Who's Terry?
-He's friends with Gus.

Who's Gus?

Uh, Gus is Terry's friend.

You kind of had to be there.

For what? No story has been told.

Okay, well, I'm gonna go put on my python
and walk to the park.

Brian, wait. I'm...

I'm trying to say that I accept
your choice to forego surgery.

I release you
into the thick mire of stupidity.

Hey, Brian, I started the car
in the garage and it's all foggy in there.

Want to go pretend we're in London?

(LAUGHS) Totally.
Shrimp on the barbie, huh?

(LAUGHING) Yes.

Good Lord, if I don't do something,
his stupidity will kill him.

And then I'd lose Brian forever.

Like that dog
the Russians shot into space.

(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)
He made it. Your dog is in orbit.

Is wonderful.

How do we get him back now?

Oh...

About that.

We do not.

Oh, my poor dog.

He will die up there.

Joke on them.

I find happy dog planet.

In 50 years, we all go back to Earth
and bite everybody.

But now we dance.

(UPBEAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

I've got to convince him to get

that tumor removed before it's too late.

Now, remember, it's England,
so take long deep breaths.

Wait a second.

I've been approaching this
far too intelligently.

He's an idiot,
so this won't be hard at all.

Hey, Brian, you want to go see Dr. Hartman

and get that procedure
where you get two wieners?

Whoa! Hell yeah!

That way, when I watch <i>Black Swan,</i>

I can aim one at Natalie Portman
and aim the other at...

Yes, yes, yes, we all know
who the other one was.

Let's go.

Well, good news, Griffins.
Brian is gonna be just fine.

I was able to remove his tumor.

And if anyone wants to keep it,
it's here in this Tupperware.

This is half of a chicken cutlet.

Oh, boy. What did I have for lunch?

Oh, Brian, I'm so glad you're all right.

Thanks.

But this is all kind of surreal.

I mean, being in this hospital bed,

I feel like the main character
of <i>As I Lay Dying</i> as he or she lay dying.

Oh, that's just the amount of superficial

quasi-knowledge the old Brian had.

I missed you, buddy.

Welcome back.

Thanks, Stewie.

You never gave up on me.

You knew that wasn't really me.

Yeah, well, it's no big...

I mean, I was having fun,
making new friends,

getting laid all the time, sleeping like
a rock, but you made the call.

You unilaterally decided I was better off

a bitter alcoholic failure
who can only hang out with a baby.

Hey. We have fun.

Hey, Lois, guess what?

I had them do that two-wiener
operation on me.

You what?

(IN FALSETTO) Double trouble.

And so, you've got your heart.

more metaphorically.

Oh, no.

You said you wanted a heart

Listen, you probably
get asked this all the time,

but have you ever modeled?

I've never even been in a picture before.

Well, I don't just shoot school events.

My real passion is discovering talent
like yours.

Really? You think I could model?

Sure. You've got a great look.

Here's my number.
Give me a call if you're interested.

Wow, me being a model.

I mean, I guess crazier things
have happened.

All right, see you later.

Where are you off to?

Actually, I met a photographer
at Stewie's school yesterday,

and he wants me to model for him.

Lois, please send these back
to the factory.

I believe they're defective.

Oh, my God, Peter,
did you just rip your own ears off?

It was the easiest way
to let her know the news was ridiculous.

You know, it would be
nice if you guys believed in me just once.

You're being terrible parents.

Even worse than John Edwards.

Kids, we need to talk.

Your mama has cancer.

And it's made me incredibly horny.

Take care.

You know, Brian, I gave some thought

to what you said the other day,

and I realized you're right.

Moving to the purple room
is not an achievement.

Stewie, what are you doing here?

I asked Peter to read my manuscript,

and he said he had to take you
to dialysis.

Anyway, you got me thinking.

I've spent my entire life
in that ivory tower,

learning from pop-up books
and animal sound machines,

instead of actually
experiencing the world.

That's why I got this.

I'm gonna take a year off,

hit the open road
and live life to the fullest.

You're a baby. How'd you afford a car?

Don't worry, I got a great price on it.

All right, I have $50 for the first person

with a paper clip and rouge
in their purse.

Ooh, ooh! Monty, Monty!

Paper clip and rouge!
Paper clip and rouge!

Why do you have rouge?

I don't know, it's been
in the purse for ages.

Why do you have a purse?

For the paper clips and rouge, you idiot!

What are you gonna buy with that $50?

Purses and rouge!

Sorry to use your bathroom so much.

I'm just really nervous.

You have nothing to be nervous about.

This is gonna be fun.

Okay, well, here goes.

All right, Meg, while we take these,

we can either play <i>Freeze Frame</i>

or <i>She Works Hard for the Money.</i>

Which would you prefer?

Can we play both?

-Sure.
-(BOTH SONGS PLAYING SIMULTANEOUSLY)

(MUSIC STOPS)

Well, that was a stupid idea.

But you, you were phenomenal.

You really think so?

Here, have a look.

I think these turned out great.

Wait, Ben, are they all of my feet?

Well, Meg, the thing is...

My name's Evan, by the way.

A lot of people will pay good money
for pictures of sexy feet.

Foot-fetish porn sites
are a huge business.

But when you asked me to model,

I thought you meant real modeling.

This is real modeling.
And you could be our next big star.

Really? I don't know.

Come on, it could be great.

You'll meet lots of famous people.

Like Charles Barkley.

Hi, Meg. You have nice feetses.

I want to put 'em both in my mouth

and then make a slapping sound
on my bald head with 'em.

-Meg, why are you home so early?

Yeah, I thought you were doing
your modeling thing.

I was. But what... What's happening here?

Well, not that it's
any of your business, Meg,

but this is why we've been married
as long as we have.

We do things together.

You think 20 years just happens?

No, it does not.

Now, tell us fast about your nonsense,

so I can plow your mother
on the staircase.

Yeah, what kind of photoshoot was it?

Did they take a picture of you eating

a whole pizza pie next
to an astonished chef?

(LAUGHING)

Actually, Evan thinks I'm a natural

and that I'm gonna be a huge success.

He thinks I could be a famous model.

You, famous?

Oh, come on, Meg.

Your only chance at fame
would've been as the dog on <i>Frasier.</i>

Well, of course I respect my father.
He's a vet.

Woof! Not that kind of vet.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So, where exactly are we going anyway?

Brian, I think the road has a way

of telling you where you're going.

There. Rhode Island Folk Festival.

The road has spoken.

Huh, that actually sounds kind of fun.

See, Brian?
This trip's already off to a great start.

Certainly better than that retreat
we went on

with the Quahog Baptist Choir.

Why don't we show our visitors
how we sing what we see, y'all?

Oh, good, Meg, you're here.

Grab a pair of dirty socks
and meet me by the tub of dead mice.

Actually, Evan,

I've been thinking about this,

and I'm not sure being a foot-fetish model
is for me.

What? You can't quit.

You're an overnight sensation.

I am?

You got 35,000 views in one night.

And none of them got past
the fourth picture.

What does that mean? Oh...

They love you. And look at these comments.

"Who is this?" "She's beautiful."

A bunch of anti-Muslim stuff.

"Great feet."

You're a hit, Meg.

Wow. That's... That's amazing.

It's not often that anyone says

anything nice about any part of me.

But still, (STAMMERS)
I don't know. It's porn.

I never thought I'd do porn.

I understand your apprehension, Meg.

That's why I'm going to confuse you
by calling it erotica.

And besides, think about all your fans.

I guess when you put it that way,

I wouldn't want to let down
Drizzlefoot321.

(SIGHS)

You really think I can do it, Evan?

Of course you can.

Sometimes people just need
a little encouragement to succeed,

like Jason Biggs got from his grandfather.

Jason, I want you to promise me one thing.

Always be forgettable.

(MONITOR FLATLINES)

I will, Grandpa.

Hey, that's just a regular,
unattractive guy who's not famous.

We did it, Grandpa.

(CROWD CHEERING)

What are you doing?

It's 18 and older, Brian.

If I want to get in,
I need to look the part.

I've also been working on my banter.

Like, in case somebody bumps into me.

"Oh, no worries, bro."

Stewie, there's a lot of sex and drugs
at these things.

-You sure you're ready for this?
-Of course I am.

I'm tired of living my life
in a tiny little box,

like some sort of claustrophobic turtle.

(SCREAMING)

He scare inside, he scare outside.

Uh-huh.

Okay, Brian, the key to these things is

to find a good position
to sit on the ground.

Yeah, cool, I got that blanket
from your trunk.

Oh, yeah, the old scratchy trunk blanket.

Bring it, use it once, then put it back

in the trunk for the rest of your life.

Ah, yeah.

Okay, this is already hurting my hip.

We could probably just stand.

No, no, we got the blanket.

All right, let's try sideways
on the elbow.

Ow, no, that hurts. Scratchy blanket.

Okay, all right, let's try sitting
on my knees.

Okay, that's good.

Nope. Uh...

Lean back on the palms
until they get weird creases.

No.

All the way back? Nope.

Flat-back, craning to look up?

Terrible. (GRUNTS)

Balls of feet butt-hover
like a Chinese guy? Nope.

All right, standing it is.

-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(CHEERING)

I got to tell you, Bri,
I am a big fan of sundresses.

Oh, yeah.
Every woman looks good in a sundress.

Yeah, just waiting for a big gust of wind,
right? Huh?

Good gust of wind?

See a couple fannies? Huh?

Give a little bare-hand slap,
a little cup?

Yep, that's what we're here for.

-Okay, Stewie.
-Yeah.

Just give it a little test tap,
see where she's at.

Then you're pushing all up on that fanny.

-Whoa, Stewie.
-Yeah. Yeah, "whoa."

Who's this Stewie, huh?

Yeah. I'll tell you who this Stewie is.

This is day-drinking Stewie.
On the patrol for fannies.

Fanny! Yeah! Fanny!

What are you looking at?

All right, finished a chapter.

Time to reward myself
with a slow, relaxing yank.

Let's see. What will it be today?

Time to spin the Wheel of Porn.

All right, foot fetish it is.

Wait a minute.

(GASPS) Oh, my God.

Mom. Dad. Meg is doing foot porn.

What? Oh, my God.

Peter, our little girl
is doing pornography.

We got to stop her.

What the hell?

There's an animated version
of you and me doing it.

Who put that on there?

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

-Brian.
-Stewie.

-Hey, how's it going, man?
-Uh, I don't know.

Four different bands said we've been
a great crowd, so you tell me.

Yeah, I've had a pretty good day, too.

People keep passing out and barfing,

-and that barf is, like, free to take.
-Awesome.

Plus, I met the most amazing girl.

Well, I'll tell you this, she's got to be

the second most amazing girl here,

because I've met the most amazing girl.

BOTH: Oh, here she comes now.

Hey, Stewie. Hey, Brian.

Oh, crap.

Wait, how can a music festival chick
like two guys?

As soon as Meg walks through that door,

I am giving her a piece of my mind.

Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

Wait, you've been upstairs the whole time?

I figured all that
clomping around up there

was Junior Gorg from <i>Fraggle Rock.</i>

Is that what you really thought?

I did. I really did.

Meg, we know you've been doing foot porn,

and that is going to stop right now.

Please. Don't try to act
like you guys care.

Oh, thank God.

Peter!

Meg, we do care.

And we're just trying to protect you.

Are you kidding?

All you've done is make fun of anybody

possibly thinking I could be a model.

Well, guess what, there are people

out there who think I'm beautiful.

-(HORN HONKING)
-That's my ride.

I'm going to a big party
they're throwing in my honor.

Meg, don't you dare walk out that door,
or you're grounded.

Oh, my God!

I can't believe our daughter's
a porn star!

Well, porn actress.

Let's not go crazy
on the Christmas letter, okay, Lois?

Peter, we got to do something.

Our daughter just left
for some sleazy foot-porn party.

I feel like we're getting invited
to less stuff nowadays.

We got to find out where that party is
and get Meg out of there.

You're right.

God, what happened?
It seems like just yesterday she was born.

Mr. Griffin, would you like
to cut the cord?

Sure.

(SQUELCHING)

Okay, that wasn't the cord,
and now you've got a girl.

WOMAN<i>: </i>(SINGING) <i>Oh. Josephine</i>

Okay, Brian, so we like the same girl.

There's no reason
we can't be gentlemen about this.

Absolutely. Our friendship
is more important than any one girl.

-Hey, guys. I got us all some food.
-Oh, great.

Just mash Brian's pill in there

and smear it on the grass,
he's good to go.

Oh, no, he's kidding.
I'm perfectly capable of taking a pill.

(GAGGING)

(COUGHING)

Yep, down the hatch. Now, Stewie,

would you like your food served to you
as an airplane or a magic bus?

(CHUCKLES)

You two are so cool and funny.

(LAUGHING) Brian especially.

Did you happen to read his tweet
about jumbo shrimp?

(CHUCKLES) Just a little heads-up,

Stewie still screams, "What's happening?"
when he gets an erection.

Oh, this is nice,
spending this time together.

Brian, why don't you show Cassandra
your Boost Mobile phone?

Stewie has AIDS.

Guys, guys, there's no reason to fight.

I don't have AIDS, by the way.

In fact, I was thinking maybe
we could all have a three-way.

A...

A three-way?

-I'm in.
-Yeah, totally.

Really? Cool. Let's go.

I'm serious, man. I'm doing this.

I am, too. Bring it on.

Don't doubt me, Brian. I never back down.

Like Boppo, the inflatable punching clown.

Ah, you're in big trouble, Boppo.

We told you to take a dive
in the third round,

and you just kept popping back up.

Let him have it, boys.

(GRUNTING)

He's pretty tough, boss.

I'll handle this.

Whoa! Boppo. Take it easy there, pal.

(STUTTERING) We was just playin' with ya.

Yeah, we didn't mean no harm.

(SIREN WAILING)

IRISH OFFICER (ON MEGAPHONE): <i>Boppo,</i>

<i>we've got the place completely surrounded.</i>

<i>We all know how it's going to end.</i>

<i>Come out with your hands up, lad.</i>

-(MAN SINGING DISTANTLY)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

All right, let's lay
some ground rules here.

You take her left side,
I'll take her right.

What?

Wait, how about top and bottom,
or front and back?

How about I take head, shoulders,

knees and toes, knees and toes?

Okay, you can have those.

You just gave away the store, mister.

You guys ready?

(SNORTS)

'Cause I am.

(SCREAMS) What's happening?

(GASPS)

(STAMMERING) Is this foreplay?

She's dead.

I think she had a drug overdose.

Well, just 'cause she's out
doesn't mean the party's over.

Yes, it does. We gotta get out of here.

What? We can't just leave her.
She had nobody. No family, no friends.

Really? How do you know all that?

"All that"?

You said you were in love with her.

Did you not talk to her at all?

No, I talked to her.

I know she liked

tents and cocaine.

Oh, oh, and how she loved
bleeding from her nose.

You're a monster.

You're even worse than Dr. Finkelstein.

Igor, did you get the body?

Yes, master.

You know what to do.

It's a five!

A five!

Oh, hey, guys. What's going on?

Quagmire, we need your help finding Meg.

I would love if you guys
would just call first.

She's run off
to some foot-fetish porn party.

We figured you might know where it is.

You know, 'cause of your boners and stuff.

Foot-fetish party, huh? Well, come on in.

Let me just fire up the Internet here.
Gonna go to Ask Beeves.

Sorry, Joe's Wi-Fi is really slow today.

Ugh, I know, it's the worst.

We also use his cable TV.

I like Joe.

Here we go.

Oh, it's a busy night.
There's a black-tie event.

That's all black and Thai chicks.

Okay, this must be Meg's thing.

It says there's a shoe-kake party tonight.

"Shoe-kake"? What's that?

It's 50 guys, one foot.

Oh, my.

(UPBEAT FOLK SONG PLAYING)

(CROWD CHEERING)

All right, come on, Stewie.
Let's get this over with.

Well, slow down, Brian.

Everyone deserves a proper burial.

Why do you think we've been saving
that VCR box in the basement?

Oh, fine.

Um, Cassandra,
I'm sorry your life was so screwed up

that you almost had a three-way
with a dog and a baby,

but your life was not without meaning.

I left the comfort of the classroom

to experience a world beyond books,

and thanks to you, I did.

Also, I loaned you $40
for that Lumineers T-shirt,

and you said you'd pay me back,
so I'm gonna take your bra.

-Wow. Lot of people OD at these things.
-Yeah.

Let's go trade this bra
for a couple of Gatorades.

(ALL MOANING)

All right, you guys, before we begin,

let's sing the Japanese national anthem.

Everybody stop what you're doing!

Yeah, or else we'll... (LAUGHS)

That one's wearing goggles.

Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?

I'll tell you what we're doing here.

We're protecting our little girl
from a lot of guys

who I oddly recognize from Best Buy.

Listen, Meg, your mom and I are sorry
for always putting you down.

That's right.

You shouldn't have to do porn
to feel appreciated.

Really?

Of course, Meg.

We love you, sweetheart.

And you deserve better than this.

Thanks, you guys.

Can we please go home?

Yeah, let's get out of here.

Not so fast.

I promised these men a foot.

What did you say is going on,
on the other side of this curtain?

Don't worry about it.
Just keep watching <i>Tower Heist.</i>

This crew pulling off a robbery?

Good luck.

Well, Brian, thanks for going
on that little adventure with me,

but I think I've learned quite enough
from the real world for now.

I guess you're ready
for the purple room after all, huh?

Yes. In fact, today was my first day.

I saw that teacher at the concert
with her boob out.

She was, um, popular.

Mom, Dad, thanks for keeping me

from doing something I'd always regret.

Of course, sweetie.

We love you, and we would never

let anything bad happen to you.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Peter, we got a problem.

Somehow my foot got pregnant
watching <i>Tower Heist.</i>

-(LAUGHS)
-What? What's so funny?

I don't know.
Dog eating pancakes. It's funny.

Mom, I need a check
for the school field trip.

Geez, Meg,
didn't I just take you on a field trip?

Okay, here's the field! Goodbye forever!

(TIRES SQUEALING)

PETER: Ahh! Meg, I'm injured!

Please, help me! I smell gas!

Meg, I'm still alive,
but I'm badly burned!

Come save my life
and nurse me back to health!

Oh, God,
why do bad things happen to good people?

Here, sweetie, I'll write you a check.

No, no, I got it, Lois.
Let me just lick my thumb,

'cause that's what people do
before they write a check.

Okay, now let me
tilt my glasses down and ask the date.

What's the date today?

Dad, why don't your checks
have any writing on them?

Why don't your shelves
have any trophies on 'em?

I've obviously caught you at a bad time.

Lois, why don't my checks
have any writing on them?

-Well, Peter...
-What?

That's just a wide pad
of Post-its I gave you.

What?

So that million dollar check
you gave me yesterday is no good?

I quit my job, man!

I will not see you Monday!

What the hell, Lois?
Why don't I have a real checkbook?

Peter, where do checks come from?

Uh, when a mommy and daddy
love each other?

That's why.

Lois, I want my own checkbook,
and I want it now!

Ooh, I like when Dad talks tough.
He sounds like <i>Dirty Harry.</i>

You got to ask yourself one question.

"Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?

Oh, Mr. Harry, you're really
not gonna like what I have to say.

Hi. What can I do for you?

Yes, I was wondering, where is the room

where I can roll around nude
with my money?

-I'm sorry?
-No, I'm sorry. I thought this was a bank.

I'll handle this.

My husband wants
to open a checking account.

Okay, well, first, I'll need to see
a photo ID and a birth certificate.

Of course. I keep
all my important papers in my bosom.

Okay, "Justin Peter Griffin."

It's actually just Peter Griffin.

So, this is not your birth certificate?

Oh, my God! Your first name is Justin?

It is?

Wow, I never noticed that.

"Justin Griffin." Huh,
I like the sound of that.

I'm a Justin!
This is awesome! This changes everything!

Peter, it doesn't change a thing.
You're still the exact same person.

I beg to differ.

I need 'em later for park soccer.

Peter, why the hell do you look like that?

Uh, my name isn't Peter.
My name is Justin.

I'm living a Justin lifestyle,
and so is my family.

You want to go to a concert? Huh?

-Want to go to a loud concert?
-No.

Since I'm your cool father Justin,
we should bond with skin-to-skin contact.

How about Justin takes his shirt off,

and we can get some photos
of you on Justin's belly?

Your heartbeat is weird.
It is not consistent at all.

Okay, let's go for a ride in my open Jeep.

I took the doors off,
so it's extra terrifying.

Geez, this "Justin" phase
of Dad's is kind of weird.

Eh, not as weird as his karaoke phase.

Peter, did you throw up in the sink?

I was the one who threw up in the sink.

Dad, what are you doing in here?

Oh, hey, Chris.
I just figured now that I'm Justin,

I should start a sweet news wall
for stuff I think is totally sweet.

Big puffy clouds are very sweet.

Big hamburgers. Small hamburgers, too.

Sliders, I think they're called. Ranch.

Here's just a picture of a vest.

Pretty sweet.

Palm trees are very sweet,
'cause, like, the beach.

This is my room, Dad.

The band Guster
is the sweetest band of all time.

It was tough,
'cause I had to move all my O.A.R. stuff

to fit the Guster stuff.

Peter, get out of Chris' room.

Oh, hey, Mama.
Hey, you seen my copy of <i>Into the Wild?</i>

I like to have it
on my person at all times,

in case I need a quick "inspo sesh."

Oh, did I tell you
I'm gonna be doing a lot of abbreve's?

Peter, you sound like an idiot.

And did you put
a skateboard in the washing machine?

It's gonna cost
several hundred dollars to repair.

How we do, Lois. All we do.

You ever get in the pocket of a wave?

Peter, you know I haven't. And I know
for a fact that you haven't, either.

In the pocket. Some gnarlies out there.

Some "gnar-gnars." Was in one today.

It's like the rest
of the world just shuts off,

and all that matters is you and Lady Blue.

And you know what she said to me?

"You're great."

Keep it cool, Lois. K-E-W-L.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

So, you want to go upstairs?

Sure.

Great. Go.

Hey, Justin, I wanted
to introduce you to Keira.

She's the one who brought
four loose Sierra Nevadas.

Keira! You totally
rock for bringing those.

Peter, what the hell is going on?

Oh, dude, is that your mom?

No, I'm not his mom, you little bastard.,

That "little bastard"
knows how to smoke pot out of an apple.

All right, everyone out of here.

I've had enough of this "Justin" nonsense.

Tomorrow, we're going to City Hall to
legally change your name back to "Peter."

All right, fine.

But I got to say,
being Justin was quite an adventure.

Like when I found
where the wild things were.

(GUNSHOTS)

(ALL GROANING)

I owe you, Max. You led me right to 'em.

All right, now help me
grind their horns into boner pills.

Keira, that was an amazing night.

Sorry I can't drive you to work.
I gotta go sit in my den until you leave.

Oh, that's okay.
I'll just take the school bus.

Wait... What?

(STUTTERS) You drive a school bus?

No, silly, I take the bus.
I'm in high school.

What the hell? You said you were 23!

Yeah, and you said you loved me.

Well, I guess you got me there.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey, Quagmire, sorry to bother you,
but we're following up on a tip.

Did you have sex with this underage girl?

I don't want to go to jail,
but I really want to take credit.

Quagmire, I'm afraid
you're under arrest for statutory rape.

(SIGHS) All right,
but let me just send the pictures

I took of her last night
to all my friends.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

Oh, yeah! Boom!

You're disgusting. Take him away.

We've got all
the awesome evidence we need.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

"Hello, my name is Glenn Quagmire.

"I am a neighbor of yours
on Spooner Street.

"I am here to inform you
that I am a sex offender."

It seems as though
you could have had some of that memorized.

Glenn, what the hell's going on?

It turns out that girl I took home
from Peter's party last night

is in high school.

Oh, my God!

Does this mean you're gonna
move to Europe to make movies?

How in the world
did you not know she was underage?

Well, in retrospect,
she did ask a lot of questions

about <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

Should have sent her my way.
I love that book.

Oh, Gregory Peck. Whew!

Anyway, now I gotta
go in front of a judge.

Really? Number one or number two?

Our judicial system is so broken.

-No, Peter, Glenn has to go to court.
-That's right.

And there's not even
a defense for statutory rape.

Once the girl proves her age,
that's it, you're guilty.

You know what I tried today? A fig.

I have a hearing tomorrow morning.
I may have to go to jail.

My only hope for leniency
is to bring in character witnesses

and show the court
I'm not the monster they say I am.

Well, Peter would be happy to support you.

Yeah, you betcha, Quagmire.
I'm very persuasive.

That's why I was so good
at selling low-cost car insurance.

<i>White-trash rates from an army guy</i>

<i>Here is a penguin, don't know why</i>

ANNOUNCER: <i>The General Car Insurance.</i>
<i>It'll worry whoever you hit.</i>

I can't believe
Quagmire and that girl had sex.

Which is hugging someone
really hard with your legs.

-Nope.
-You'll tell me if I get it right?

-Yeah, I'll tell you if you get it.
-Okay, I'm gonna get it.

Now, Mr. Griffin, I understand you're here
to speak on Mr. Quagmire's behalf.

That's right, Your Honor.

And as we know,
according to <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

if the girl has had her blood,
she is good to go.

Has the girl had her blood?
Answer the question.

Mr. Griffin, she was underage.

Yes, however,
Mr. Quagmire was born on February 29th.

Ergo, he's only 12.

Ergo, the girl raped him.

<i>Argo,</i> Ben Affleck.

Mr. Griffin, do you have any evidence
that is not based on film or television?

I don't know. Why don't you ask
all these letters to Santa Claus?

Something's going on.
We haven't gotten mail in a week.

I. I haven't gotten mail
in a week. Nobody writes you.

Officer Swanson,
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

Now, please tell us what
Mr. Quagmire said he did with the girl.

(SIGHING) He, uh, said
he gave her a Frosty Jim.

And can you please explain
to the courtroom what a Frosty Jim is.

-Uh...
-Sir, you're under oath.

Well, it's when you urinate in a condom,

and tie it off, freeze it, and then
the woman, um, pretends it's a man.

-Thank you.
-He's a good guy!

Mr. Brown, can you please
state your occupation for the court?

Oh, come on, man,
you didn't ask anyone else to do that!

Why am I on trial? He's the one
that mushed himself on a child!

When are we gonna see this chick?

Okay, enough! No more help!

I'm taking this Bible.

You want to know
what kind of person Glenn Quagmire is?

You want to know what made me
the person I am? Then put me on the stand.

Lois, can I play
<i>Angry Birds</i> on your phone?

Okay, but only with the sound off.

Fine. I'll just do it with my mouth.

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

(OINKING)

Please, go ahead, Mr. Quagmire.

Look, I know everyone's
sitting out there judging me today,

but before you do, please know
I had it pretty rough growing up.

My dad was a military man,
so he wasn't around much.

And my mom, well, let's just say
she was a little promiscuous.

In fact, I think my problems started
the day I was born.

(CRYING)

It's a boy, Mrs. Quagmire.

Oh, that's wonderful!

-How do you feel?
-Horny. Really horny.

Could you put him back
so I can push him out again?

I was born nine times that day.
And things never got easier.

The only way I learned my ABCs

was by learning the names
of all the guys my mom slept with.

<i>Art, Bob, Chet, Don, Ed, Frank, Gus</i>

<i>Hal, Irv, John, Ken,</i>
<i>Lew-Matt-Ned-Ox-Pat</i>

<i>Quint, Ron, Sam,</i>
<i>Tom, Ulf, Vic</i>

<i>Walter, Xavier, Yaz and Zeke</i>

<i>Those are just some of the guys</i>

<i>There are lots of other guys</i>

It was awful.

I didn't even get to go
to my high school prom, but my mom did.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, is Crystal ready?

Oh, hi, Ronnie. Hey, listen,
have my mom home by midnight, okay?

How about I plow her in the limo
and have her home in 20 minutes?

Oh, come on, Ronnie, she bought the dress.

So, you see, Your Honor, thanks to my mom,

I never had a chance
to be like everyone else.

My misguided carnal instincts

are the result of being raised
by a sexual deviant.

All I'm asking is that you give me
the break that my childhood never did.

Dairy Queen closes in 10 minutes.

Mr. Quagmire, your story is a sad one,
but that doesn't excuse your actions.

I have no choice
but to sentence you to 20 years in prison.

(ALL GASP)

WOMAN: Oh, no, you don't!

-Mom?
-MEN: Crystal?

Ha! She's enjoyed many men.

Mom, what are you doing here?

Do you know I'm carrying three handguns,
and the metal detectors picked up nothing?

Your Honor, as the defendant's mother,
I ask that you show mercy on him.

Well, as the victim's mother,
I ask that you go to hell!

CHRIS: Where is your daughter?
Show her to us!

Your Honor,
I have renounced my sinful past,

and have been washed
in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

You what?

I have seen the righteous path
of our Savior,

and ask that you not sentence
my son to jail,

but instead release him to my custody,

so that I,
with God's guidance, can rehabilitate him.

Wow, Quagmire's mom is a Jesus freak.

I haven't been this surprised since
we went to that restaurant on my birthday.

All right, guys,
let's pay the check and get out of here.

ALL: <i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

You guys!

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

<i>Happy birthday, dear Peter</i>

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

Aren't you gonna
blow out your candles, Peter?

Mom, I think something's wrong with Dad.

Peter? Peter?

Oh, my God! Help! Someone call 911!

It's okay, ma'am. This happens here
at Bennigan's all the time.

How long does this last?

Hard to say. It's best to just move on.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Quagmire,
but my sentence stands. Twenty years.

Mr. Quagmire, I'll give you 24 hours
to get your affairs in order.

Oh, my God.

Ah, don't think of it as 20 years.

Think of it
as two 10-year-olds, you sick freak.

God, 20 years.

I know this is a hard time for you,
but you need to seek forgiveness.

You need to kneel before Jesus.

Oh, he's gonna be kneeling
in front of a lot of guys,

but I doubt he'll catch their names.

It's usually somebody
pushing your skull in the dark.

There are really no introductions.

Remember, He is inside you all the time.

Oh, now she's just setting me up. Right?

How dare you come in here
and tell me to seek forgiveness!

-Where do you get off?
-Pretty much everywhere, I hear.

Fat man's right, they're making this easy.

You've never apologized once
for the way you raised me!

You're the one who made me what I am!

Oh, come on, Quagmire, you're a grown man,
responsible for his own choices.

Seems kind of cowardly
to blame someone else for your problems.

Brian abandoned his own son, by the way.

Why are you, of all people,
defending a religious nut?

-Aren't you an atheist?
-(CHUCKLING) Yeah, it's crazy.

You can think about that
while you're in jail.

Glenn, we're not going to get anywhere
questioning God's wisdom.

He has a plan for everything.

Oh, now I get it.
That's why you found God.

So you can absolve yourself
of any responsibility

and answer everything
with empty platitudes.

Face it, you're a worse parent
than Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

I'm concerned about
Pax, Maddox and Shiloh.

They're having trouble adapting.

They've been raised with 11 languages,
and really don't speak any.

I hear you, Doctor. So, you're saying
we should give them all fauxhawks?

No. I think they need intensive therapy.

Let me see if I understand you.

Even shorter on the sides?

Don't you see? This is your chance
to open your heart and let God in.

I know this jail sentence seems long,
but salvation can last all eternity.

You know what else lasts an eternity?
This conversation.

And maybe through
our shared relationship with the Lord,

we can begin to build a bond
as mother and son.

"Mother and son"?

Mothers love their children!
They nurture them and protect them!

You've never done a thing for me!

I'd rather rot in jail
than sit here and listen to all your crap!

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

(SIGHS) Glenn's right.
I was never there for him.

I've got to find some way to fix this.

Did you hear about your ex-husband yet?
He had a, uh, procedure.

You know, some families
take their baby to the zoo.

That's also a fun activity.

I'm really gonna miss all you guys.

And I'll think of you
whenever I choke on a link sausage.

Take care, buddy.

Oh, yeah! Fresh air! Freedom!

Peter, while I'm away,

I want you to hold onto my antique,
gold Rolex watch.

Oh, cool, a throwing watch!

No, no, Peter, it...
And I cannot stress this enough,

it is not a throwing watch.

Oh, I hear you, Quagmire.

It didn't come back
like you said it would.

(SIGHS) And, Joe, you sure
you don't mind taking care of my cat?

Oh, no, all taken care of.
Brought her to the pound this morning.

-She went peacefully.
-What?

No! I meant take care of her,
like, look after her!

Well, that seems like
a note for this morning.

You know, maybe I won't miss you people
as much as I thought.

Do you have anything for me, Glenn?

What? No! What?
I just found out my cat died!

Hmm. I can't help but think this selfish
attitude is part of what got you here.

Goodbye, Glenn. Be strong.

We'll keep you in our thoughts.

Oh, you better get rid of that
before you get in there.

All right.

Goodbye, everybody.

And don't worry about me.
I'll see you real soon.

Hey, you guys take good care
of my child-rapist friend!

(BRAKES SCREECH)

Mr. Quagmire, wait!

Judge? What are you doing here?

I wanted to tell you
the good news in person.

Your sentence has been commuted.

You will not be serving
prison time after all.

You got a good body, man.
Why do you hide it under that robe?

"Commuted"? I don't understand.

Hello, Glenn.

Mom?

What's going on here?

By the way, Your Honor, your fly is down.

Well, let's just say
some new DNA evidence was produced.

And an impressive amount, I'd say.

PETER: Guy takes care of himself.

Anyway, you're free to go.

You... You're kidding!

Mom, did you...

Yep. Twice.

But I thought you were Christian now.

Helping my son
is the most Christian thing I could do.

You were right, Glenn.
I was a terrible mother.

I wasn't there for you
when I should've been.

But I'd love a second chance.

I'd like that. I'd like that very much.

Aw, Quagmire got away with it
and learned nothing.

That's great.

I hope you make it. You're real good.

No way, not as good as you.
I hope you make it.

What are you gonna do with all your money?

Oh, probably just save it.

Yeah, that's real smart.
Well, back to my book.

Peter, I was at the park with Stewie,
and someone stole his tricycle.

And during, like, the one second

I was looking down at my phone
and not at him.

Stupid thief. It's got a vanity plate
that won't even apply to him.

Hey. You like your reggae watered down
and acceptable at a wedding? Hop on.

Ugh, can't believe somebody
stole Stewie's trike.

I only had nine payments
left on that thing.

How much do you make?

Don't worry, Lois,
I'm gonna find that tricycle.

I'll just have four
to five beers to stop the shaking,

and then I'll go outside.

Huh, never seen that kid
around the neighborhood.

Maybe he's got something to do with it.

Hey, kid.

You know anything about a tricycle
that just got stolen from the park?

No, sir, I've been sitting here
for the last three hours selling lemonade.

-Would you like an ice-cold glass?
-Why, sure.

-(GRUNTS)
-You couldn't have been here

for three hours on this,
the hottest day of the year,

or the ice cubes in your pitcher
would have melted.

Ow...

You have the right
to remain silent. Anything you say...

Peter, Peter! We can't arrest him.
If anything, they can arrest you.

Hey, here's the tricycle.

You were right, Peter. This kid's a thief.

We did it!

Wow, look at us.
Hey, you know, we make a great team, guys.

Like Huey Lewis and the Jews.

<i>We don't need money...</i>

Sorry, the band's breaking up.

Here you go, Stewie.

Don't bother sniffing the seat.
It don't smell like nothing.

Oh, yeah, my trike.
I'm kind of over that thing.

Now I'm way into wooden beads
you move along wires.

Whoa.

Oh, yeah.

Boy, when you find a baby's tricycle,

it feels like
there's nothing you can't do.

Man, I wish we could quit our jobs
and solve children's crimes full-time.

I heard you guys are good
at solving cases.

I'll give you 50 cents
to find my lucky baseball card.

-Guys, we're in business.
-ALL: (CHEERING) All right!

Wait a minute, I didn't notice
you have a pierced ear. We can't help you.

You go home and tell your mother

she's supposed to be a parent,
not a friend.

All right, guys,
this will be the headquarters

for our new detective agency.

This milk crate will be my chair,

this overturned rain barrel
will be my desk,

and this DNA evidence centrifuge
and fingerprint scanner

will be my coat rack.

Piece of junk.

I guess all our detective agency
needs now is a name.

Well, we're detectives
solving children's crimes.

There's only one name that makes sense.

-"Dicks for Kids"?
-"Dicks for Kids."

But wait, we want people
to know we're grown-ups.

Okay, "Big Dicks for Kids."

But we don't want to sound too old.

They're gonna think
we're a bunch of old, bald geezers.

"Big Hairy Dicks for Kids."

How are we gonna let
them know we're "veiny"?

So, you say this gumball
machine took your dime

and didn't give you a gumball?

-That's right.
-Well, I'll take care of that.

Hand over the dime, buddy.

Come on, hand it over.

Don't make this hard on yourself.
Wait a minute.

This gumball machine
takes quarters, not dimes.

-(SIREN WAILING)
-Holy crap, it's a setup.

Time to make a quick getaway.

(SIREN CONTINUES WAILING)

-You were set up, too, huh?
-Yeah.

You realize that kid is plowing
both our wives right now.

So, what do we got today, boys?

Well, it seems like
we got a bit of a crime spree.

Just this morning, we've had
multiple reports of stolen items.

Couple marbles,
ball of yarn, two Wiffle ball bats.

"Someday, a rain will come
and wash all this scum off the streets."

Guys, I think
I got a lead on all these thefts.

One of the kids
had a nanny cam hidden in his room.

<i>Come on, let's do it</i>
<i>on your son's tiny bed.</i>

<i>Hurry, he gets home at 3:00.</i>

Okay, it's later than this.
Yeah, fast-forward ahead.

Forward. Forward. Keep forwarding.

Is that woman gonna be okay?

Yeah, yeah, she's fine.
We're having brunch after this.

God, I look huge in that bed, don't I?

You think other guys hang out

and watch their friend's
naked gyrating butt?

It's been so long,
I don't know what other friends do.

Forwarding, forwarding, forwarding...
And there we go. Our thief.

(GASPS)

Chris Gaines was Garth Brooks.
I just figured that out.

Oh, my God, Chris stole all that stuff.

No way, he wouldn't do that.

Peter, Chris is on the tape.
We gotta search his bedroom.

Fine, go ahead. But I'm telling you,
it's gonna be a bigger waste of time

than writing
tough-guy dialogue for a Jet Li movie.

(GRUNTING)

(GRUNTING, BONE CRACKING)

This is your last warning.
Give me back my wife.

What? Excuse me?

Give me back my wife,
or you're in a lot of trouble.

I'll kick all your faces. You got me?

You're kind of undoing everything
you just did when you kicked my ass.

I know, but I have to say for audience.

Chris still has an Aaron Hernandez
poster up? That's not cool.

See, there's nothing here.

Just a weird life-sized lady doll
made out of all the stuff that got stolen.

Don't hurt Heather.
Don't hurt my girlfriend.

-What the hell?
-Chris made a sex doll?

Your kid's got a walk-in closet?
Two of mine gotta sleep in the car.

Chris is still in his room
with that disgusting homemade sex doll.

He actually thinks it's his girlfriend.

I know, it's weird.

It's even weirder
than that secret level in <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

(BEEPING)

(BEEPING RHYTHMICALLY)

(DISTORTED BEEPING)

(VIDEO GAME MUSIC PLAYS)

Maybe it's our fault

Chris has such a screwed-up idea
about what a relationship is.

I mean, let's be honest, we're not exactly
the model of a healthy marriage.

Oh, boy, is this 'cause of the time
I pushed off of you after sex

and bruised your boob?

No, I mean, when was the last time
you bought me flowers,

or we had a date night?

We do stuff.

Just last week, I let you watch me
complain after eating too many hot wings.

(GROANS)

Why did you let me do this, Lois? Why?

Okay, Peter,
I gotta take the kids to school now.

Hey, Chris, your mother
wanted me to talk to you. Um...

She doesn't think it's healthy

for you to be spending all your time
with a homemade sex doll.

Sex doll? I wish.

Heather hasn't even
let me get to second base.

Hang on. What's second base?

Is that touching one of the cabbages?

Yeah.

But I'm such a loser,
she'll never let me do that.

Come on, Chris, don't sell yourself short.

You are every bit as good
as that bag of garbage.

-You really think so?
-Sure, I do.

And look, if you really
want to learn how to bang that thing,

there's no better teacher
than your old dad.

After all, I'm the guy
who taught old Asian people

how to get on the subway.

(SCREAM APPROACHING)

Out of the way! Nobody else matters!

All right, you made it.

Now twirl that long hair
sticking out of your face mole.

And cough.
Cough like you never coughed before.

(COUGHING)

Okay, Chris, now,
women really dig those firemen calendars.

So, we're gonna go inside and get some
sexy shots of you doing fireman stuff.

<i>Well, I'm hot-blooded</i>

<i>Check it and see</i>

<i>Come on, baby</i>
<i>Do you do more than dance?</i>

<i>I'm hot-blooded, I'm hot-blooded</i>

<i>You don't have to read my mind</i>

Look, Heather.

The truth is, I don't care if we never
take it to the next level, physically.

I just really like spending time with you.

Oh! Wow.

I'm gonna have to write
to somebody about this.

"Dear <i>Penthouse,</i> I used
to think these letters were fake

"until my taped-together
soccer-ball-headed girlfriend

"fell in my lap."

Hey, do we still have a magazine?

Good morning, everybody.

I think Heather will be eating breakfast
standing up this morning,

if you know what I mean.

Peter, I thought
you were gonna take care of this.

You were supposed
to make Chris get rid of that doll.

I did take care of it. He slept with it,

and now he'll slowly
grow to hate it over the next 20 years.

This is all your fault.
You never listen to anything I say.

Look, you told me
to talk to him. I talked to him.

And now you're nagging me about it?

God, you're more annoying
than a creative voicemail message.

Oh, Lois, thank God!

Listen, I can't decide what
I want for breakfast tomorrow.

Can you make me a sample tray?

You know what, Peter?
I'm not talking to you right now.

You screwed up bad with Chris.

And you still haven't apologized
for the way you treated me earlier.

Oh, come on, Lois. I'll make it up to you.
Maybe sooner than you know.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh, Peter! They're beautiful!
You're such a sweetheart.

Read the card.

"To Heather, from Chris"?

Oh, I thought it might
have a funny riddle on it.

Oh, good, the flowers came!

We're just cocooning today
because Heather said she's never seen TV.

So, we're starting
with Season 6 of <i>Becker.</i>

I'm just gonna be easing her in.

Lois, before you say anything,
I also got you a gift.

It's a Katherine Heigl mask
for you to wear while we have sex.

She's perfect,
because she's only sort of hot,

so there won't be this
crazy disconnect of her face on your body,

which would totally take me out of it.

Also, it's designed
so you can wear it on your butt.

Heather, I made your favorite cookies.
And now I want to hear all about your day.

Hey, Lois, I heard
Katherine Heigl likes to French kiss.

Oh, my God!

Chris treats that pile of junk
better than Peter treats me!

What's the matter, Lois?
Need to get in the mood?

How about a little help from Kenny G?

(ROMANTIC SAXOPHONE MUSIC PLAYING)

I wonder if Cleveland's
gonna want his sax back.

Oh, hi, Chris. Where have you been?

Heather and I went for a tandem bike ride,
and then had lunch at a gastropube.

Nope.

Huh. Sounds like fun.

What have you guys been up to?

Your father got a DVD
of black people fighting in the street.

It's not just in the street.
Some of them are in private residences.

Oh, well, tomorrow,

Heather and I are
going to the park to picnic and fly kites.

And on Saturday,
she's hosting her book club,

so I have to drop by, say something funny,
and then stay upstairs.

Wow, your plans sound
very sweet and romantic, Chris.

And how a man should treat his woman.

Oh, Lois, your breath
smells like eggs. Talk that way.

Chris, when you go
on your picnic tomorrow,

can your father and I come with you?

Let me just ask Heather.

I know, but I think we better.

Apparently,
the cancer's already in his bones.

-What?
-We'd love to. Sounds great!

What are you doing? You can't let him
keep thinking that doll is real.

I know, but I just want Peter to see

what a thoughtful man
looks like for one afternoon.

Maybe he'll learn something.

Are you sure about this?
It seems pretty extreme.

Well, I gotta try something.
Peter and I used to be so close,

but now we're like apples and oranges.

People say we're different,
but we're really not that different.

Yeah, we both work in marketing.

We've both lost children.

We both own cars,
but we like to take the bus.

And we both cheat at <i>Words With Friends.</i>

Oh, nice try! I certainly do not!

And we're both gonna
have a moderate time at the party tonight.

And we're not gonna
count each other's drinks.

We won't have to,
because we won't be drinking.

Wow, it sure is fun
going on a picnic, isn't it, Peter?

Yeah. Will you hold this beer bottle
while I try to kick the top off it?

Ow! Damn it!

You moved it.

<i>Raindrops are falling on my head</i>

<i>And just like the guy whose feet</i>
<i>are too big for his bed</i>

Close your eyes, Heather.
I've got a surprise for you.

None of your business how much it was.

He bought her a scarf.
And it actually goes well with her colors.

Peter, don't you see what's going on here?

Your son's relationship with that doll
is better than our own marriage!

Peter?

Hey, can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?

(SIGHS)

(HINGES CREAKING)

(SCREAMS)

My morning scream.

(SIGHS)

(SCREAMS)

Heather's gone!

Mom! Heather's disappeared!
Have you seen her?

No, I haven't, sweetheart.

But you know what?

Sometimes relationships run their course
and come to a natural end.

This could be a sign
that it's time to move on.

Aw, and I just helped him
pick out that scarf.

I miss her so much.

I know, honey.

But if you give it a little time,
I'm sure you'll get over her.

Just like you got over
your Hamster Dance Tourette Syndrome.

Excuse me, Mom, could you please pass...

<i>Dee dah dee dee doh doh</i>
<i>Dee dah dee deh doh</i>

<i>Doo doo doo doo doodle-loo doo doo</i>

<i>Dee dah diddly doh</i>

His brain ain't right, but it's fun.

(SOBBING)

Hey, Chris.

I see you're sad,
and also sitting on the remote.

Why did Heather leave me?

I don't know,
but sometimes, when life's got you down,

you gotta stand up for a second.

Like, just for a second.

I've never felt this sad!

Aw, looks like somebody could use a hug.

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

There we go.

Oh, no, I hit input!

Oh, no! Oh, God!
We may have to throw away the television.

(BLUBBERING) What should I do, Dad?

I don't know.

Hey, where's that girlfriend of yours?
She seems cool.

(SOBS)

This day has Häagen-Dazs
written all over it.

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

Boy, he's really upset.

Ugh. I can't deal with anything
until I've had my after-nap coffee.

I don't think guys should have
two hands on a coffee mug ever.

What?

Mmm. Oh, yummy.

Don't do that, either.
Just don't do anything.

(SIGHS)

Hey, Chris.

I see you turned your hat around
so you can really get in there.

Oh, what do you care?
What does anybody care?

Why don't you come with me?
I've got something to show you.

If it's the shot from <i>Psycho</i>
where you can see Anne Heche's bunghole,

I've already seen it.

No, Chris, it's something else. Come on.

Heather? Oh, my God!

I'm sorry, Chris.

You... You did this?

I did. I took your doll,

because it's not a natural or healthy
thing for a boy your age to have.

It looks like you stabbed her.
Like, 50 times.

I was kind of jealous of it,
so I guess I went a little crazy.

Also, her lipstick is all smeared.

I was having a lot of strange feelings!

Look, Chris, I'm sorry.

You can have Heather back,
but I just want you to know,

if you ever treat a real woman
the way you treat that doll,

you're gonna make her very happy.

Really?

Absolutely, and I know
she'll make you very happy, too.

You know...

I don't think I need Heather anymore.

-You don't?
-No.

I'm glad to hear that, Chris.

Seems like maybe you're growing up.

Maybe.

I guess there's just one thing left to do.

What's that?

Give me that knife.
I've gotta cut out the baby.

Oh, my God!

It's made of Skittles.

You want to eat the baby
together on the way home?

Yeah, I'd like that, Chris.

You know, Lois,
I've been thinking about what you said,

and I did learn a little something
from watching Chris and Heather.

-You did?
-Yeah.

From now on, I am gonna be
treating you like garbage.

Oh, Peter. Thank you.

I love you, Lois.

CHRIS: Mom? Dad?
I want you to meet my new girlfriend!

This is Mistress Vita.
We met on Craigslist.

No talking unless I say!

Hi, Peter.

How'd she know your name?

Peter, are you just trying to take a knee
until the end of the show?

Peter, that's not gonna work.
You can't just...

TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>Top Chef: Looney Tunes Edition.</i>

Okay, Chef Fudd, I was a little
disappointed in you this week.

Your dish was just a live rabbit
who thought he was taking a bath.

But I used carrots and celery.

Yes. I saw he was scrubbing his back
with a long celery stalk.

Chef Sylvester,
on the other hand,

I'm happy to say your sufferin' succotash
was absolutely delicious.

(LISPS) Thanks.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello? Oh, hi, Bonnie.

No, I'm not doing anything.
Just sitting here with the baby.

Screw you, too.
Oh, hey, Bri.

Hey, you want to go out and get some
gluten-free pizza?

I'm gluten-free now.

But, you know, I'm not gonna be
annoying about it.

Too late.

Oh, we should be
gluten-free together!

Let's go to Whole Foods and buy a bunch
of stuff from that weird aisle

nobody else goes down.

I can't. I got plans. I'll see you later.

Oh, sure.
Maybe another time.

(GROANS) I didn't seem
too desperate, right? Don't answer.

It's just that Brian's
been so distant lately,

and we used to be
inseparable,

like Jack and Jill.

Well, so then Jack takes these
two pails of water and trips,

and totally falls down the hill.

(LAUGHING)

Yeah.
Hey, I got a funny story.

Jill had a tooth fall out,
and she swallowed it,

and then we had to root through her feces
to find it. And we did.

And then we took it
to the dentist,

and he put it
back in her mouth.

So I guess we're
both klutzes, huh?

Why don't you spin another tale,
crap-tooth? No?

My turn again?
Okay. Jill's barren.

Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.

Some sad news this morning as
38 schoolchildren drowned when their...

(YAWNING LOUDLY)

Excuse me.

When their school bus hit
a patch of ice and drove off a...

(YAWNING)

What is wrong with me today?
(CHUCKLES)

And drove off a local bridge.

And now the viral video of the week,
with over seven million views.

For those of you who loved
<i>Screaming Sheep,</i>

we've got <i>Opera Penguin.</i>

(SINGING OFF-KEY IN TENOR VOICE)

TOM: Is that it?
Is he gonna do it again? No?

Okay, so just
normal penguin stuff now.

Okay, cut back to me.

You can't?
The button broke off?

All right, well, a U.S. convoy was
ambushed in Kabul this morning,

so now we're going to have
a moment of silence in remembrance...

(SINGING OFF-KEY)

TOM: He does do it again.

That could be my
favorite thing I ever seen.

What is a penguin?
Is it some kind of bug?

What? You serious?

So it is a bug?

Hey, you know,
that's what we ought to do.

-We ought to make a viral video.
-All right!

-Let's do it!
-Awesome!

Oh, wait, I don't know if
you're gonna be in it, Joe.

I thought, while we filmed, we'd just keep
all of our stuff on your lap.

(THUNKING)

What the hell are you doing?

I saw a scary boy doing this,
and I thought I'd try it.

All right, have fun. I'm late.

Late?

But I thought
you and I could hang out

and maybe watch
Lois shush Peter

while they watch <i>Nashville.</i>

Maybe another time, Stewie.

There he goes again.
He's being so standoffish.

I don't understand.

Oh, we used to be that happy.
Wait a minute.

Joe and Bonnie never used to spend time
together until they had Susie.

Having a baby seems to have
made them closer.

Babies save relationships!

(GIGGLING)

Oh, look at you.
You're flying!

Okay, thanks, Bonnie.
Next I want to ride a bike.

That's it, Rupert!

That's how Brian and I are going to
improve our relationship.

We're going to have a baby!

I say, this is my best idea
since I robbed a Joseph A. Bank.

Three suits for 99 bucks?
Take me to jail!

All right. I want tonight to be perfect.
I'm gonna lay it all out for Brian

why we should
have a baby together.

I don't know.
I haven't even thought about that.

Why are you so obsessed
with circumcision?

Oh, hey, look. You made
a little dinner party.

-Hi, Rupert.
-He won't be joining us.

Get up!

Please, sit.

You, uh, okay?

I'm terrific. And that is
so sweet of you to ask.

You really are a natural caregiver,
aren't you?

Mmm, mmm.

Do you mind not texting?

Sorry, sorry. Just finishing right now.
Almost done.

There. All finished, right...
Now.

There.

Thanks. So, I wanted
to talk to you about...

Are you just gonna
leave it on the table?

I won't look at it.

-(PHONE BUZZES)
-Great. So, I wanted to...

-You're looking at it.
-Sorry. Work.

-It's not work.
-It'll just take a second.

I normally
wouldn't do this,

but I was already kind of
in the middle of something,

and I just need
to quickly respond,

and there,
I am finished.

(CHUCKLES) Ah, yeah.

Okay, just a few more words...
And...

Done. Sorry.

-Okay, so...
-(PHONE BUZZES)

Nah, nah,
I'm not gonna get it.

Then maybe we can
take it off the table.

All right, just keep going.

(SIGHS)

I was thinking, we should talk
about having a...

(PHONE BUZZES)

This isn't fun for me,
watching you text.

No, no, this is great.
Mmm, mmm. Yum.

But I gotta go. I have a date.

This is serious, Rupert.
I'm losing him.

If we're going to
fix this relationship,

we need a baby
and we need it now.

I'm just going to take
a little bit of his DNA,

and soon we'll be proud parents,
like Ron Livingston's parents.

You know,
our son's a famous actor.

Really?
What's his name?

(SIGHS) Um...

He's, uh...

He was, like, the main guy
in <i>Office Space.</i>

Yeah. What else?
Uh, he has dark hair.

I don't know,
was he in <i>Black Hawk Down?</i>

He was in, like, at least five
<i>Sex in the Cities.</i>

(GROANS) What is his name?
What is his name?

Is your son Ron Livingston?

-Yes!
-Oh, God! Thank God!

Ron Livingston! Thank you!
That has been bugging me all day.

Okay, let's see.

Now, what are the ingredients
to a viral Internet video?

-Cats.
-Yes, cats. Good.

Uh, people reacting
to watching gross stuff.

Oh, yeah. 'Cause they're like,
"Ugh, that's gross!"

-Can I get a soda?
-What?

No. This is, like, the worst time
to ask for a soda.

Unbelievable.

You know what, we should
just go out and start filming.

'Cause I think we're really gonna
surprise everyone.

Like Buster Keaton did
in his first talking picture.

(RASPY VOICED) Here we go. I'm moving
through the scene and I slam the door.

Oh, no! I slammed it too hard,
and the house is gonna squash me!

(CRASHES)

Oh, it turned out
that window was there.

Pause for laugh
and amazement.

(BUZZING)

All right, Rupert,
the fertilization device is complete.

This will impregnate me
with the child

that will bring Brian
and me back together!

First, I add Brian's
hair and saliva,

and some
preschool applications,

because we are
already way behind.

There. Now I just have to
get into the machine,

and then the machine does
whatever it has to do to me

in order to successfully
impregnate me.

We do not judge the machine.
We do not judge Stewie.

(GROANS) Good-bye, body.

You're gonna
watch me get pregnant.

I want to look at you
when it happens.

Yeah, you watch me, bitch.

(WHIRRING)

(CLANKING)

(WHIRRING)

(BURBLING, WHOOSHING)

(ZAPPING)

Good morning, Brian.

(SNIFFING)

What is that?
I smell pee.

Yes, you do, Brian.

Oh, my God, that thing's positive!

Is Lois pregnant again?

No.

Meg is pregnant?

You're getting warmer.

(CLEARS THROAT)

What... What have you done?

I think you mean,
what have we done?

What?

Brian, we're pregnant!

Oh, my God!

(CRYING) And in 18 years,
he's going to move away!

You're pregnant
with our baby?

How could this
even happen?

Simple. I took your DNA
and inserted it into my temporary uterus

through my
fertilization device.

Oh, my God,
you're serious!

People are gonna think I had sex with
a male baby and then got him pregnant!

Oh, thank you for finding a way
to make it sound horrible.

We can't have
a baby, Stewie!

Is this about money?

Because I have a bit saved.
We could even use my old crib.

-You use your old crib!
-Oh, right.

Stewie, you have to get rid of it.

"Get rid of it"?
You know, why don't you just say it?

Say the word, Brian.
I want to hear you say it.

Abortion! Abortion!

You need to get a big fat abortion
right this second!

You can't even say it.

I think I'm gonna throw up.

Oh, save the cheap theatrics. This isn't
one of your crappy short stories.

This is real life, mister, so man up!

You are getting
an abortion, Stewie.

I will not! Our child
is growing inside me!

Stop talking like that!
And how do you even know it's mine?

How dare you!
So I'm just some slut?

Well, this slut is
having your baby!

Why would you
even do this?

I thought you'd be happy.

I mean, you have
all these amazing qualities,

and I'm kind of good-looking.
I mean, I'm no model, but...

Well, certainly not a runway model.

I'd be more catalog, probably.

You know what?
Why not a runway model? Why not?

Why am I always apologizing
for how good-looking I am?

I'm sick of it.
I can model in Paris.

We could take
the baby with us.

We could be that kind of family.
What do you think?

(THUMPING)
(GRUNTS)

-Is it dead?
-You hit me!

What kind of monster
hits a pregnant toddler!

If you ever lay a finger on me again,
I'll burn you in your bed.

Could you
do that now, please?

All right, Peter,
get the camera ready.

I got a viral Internet video that's gonna
go straight to the top of the charts.

Hi, I'm Joe Swanson, and this is
<i>30 Impressions In 30 Seconds.</i>

(MONOTONE VOICE)
"Show me the money." "Oh, behave."

"Good morning, Vietnam."

"Wait until they get a load of me,"
said the Joker.

Some of these
I'm paraphrasing.

Hey, I need you to take me to the doctor
for my prenatal vitamins.

I'm not taking you anywhere.
Geez, how far along are you?

I'm not really sure.
Two days, six months.

There's a certain amount
of guesswork involved in this.

And while I'm pregnant, I'm going
to need you to change the cat litter.

We don't have a cat.

(GROANS) Please
don't fight me on this.

Oh, my back is killing me.

And I've also been experiencing
a little...

Morning sickness.

It's for the baby.
It's for the baby.

You look ridiculous
like that.

Not too ridiculous for you
to put a baby in me.

Okay, Raylene,
I'm Dr. Hartman.

Now, before we begin,
I want you to know

the record is just past my watch.

(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Well, it takes
two people to break a record.

You look a little young.
How old are you?

Uh, thirteen?

Fourteen?

Fifteen. But he didn't force himself
on me. I wanted it, too.

Well, that's the important thing.

That's odd.

Your vagina seems to have
a penis and two testicles.

Oh, right. I, uh, sneezed real hard
and all that came out.

Ah, that explains it.

Could you do that thing
where you take some fluid

and tell me if it's going to be
an imbecile or a cretin?

Oh, not to worry, there are places where
those people can be warehoused.

But from strictly eyeballing you,
I'd say everything looks fine.

Oh, that's wonderful.

Now, Brian, did you have
any questions for the doctor?

Yeah. Are there a lot of stairs
in this building?

God, we need so much stuff.

Look at how tiny all these clothes are.
It's so adorable.

I mean, what kind of feet
can fit into these shoes?

Your feet!

That's getting old, you know.

You better get
on board with this.

Oh, how far along are you?

Eight months.

You look amazing.
Let me ask you, are you leaking?

Because I've been leaking.

How old are you?

Well, how old are you?

You look like you're 40,

which means whatever you've got in there
is 100% brain-damaged.

All right.
You have a good day.

I hated that lady.

I like these. These are good.
Very classy.

This feels
incredibly wrong.

We're going to want these, Brian,
believe me.

You can't see my nipples, can you?
They're getting really large,

and I'm not sure if
I'm completely covering them.

Eh, you know what?
We'll see what we see.

Let's get a few candids.

Dad, can I get one of
your head on the belly?

Oh, "Dad." I just got emotional.

<i>Having my baby</i>

<i>I'm a woman in love</i>

Okay, now people
really love that viral video

of a monkey forcing that sex act
on a frog at the zoo.

So maybe we can find another frog
for something like that.

-You mean like that frog?
-Who?

That frog in the miniskirt,
putting a quarter in the jukebox.

<i>-Bad name</i>

<i>You give love</i>

I'm concerned that frog
is in more trouble than she realizes.

I'm having such
a craving for burgers.

It's like my body is
just craving red meat.

And mint chip ice cream.
But only mint chip.

Any other ice cream
makes me want to puke.

Isn't that weird?

Yes, Stewie, that's the one
weird thing in all this.

What are you looking at?
Go push your buttons.

My husband
will kick your ass.

Stop saying
I'm your husband.

(MOANS)

Brian, I need you to
take me to the hospital.

Why?

My water just broke.

-Oh, my God!
-It's okay. Don't panic.

Call the doula.
Brian, you've got to call the doula!

Doula? I don't even
know what that is!

It's a divorced woman who knows about
lady parts and cheers you on.

Let's go!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(MOANING) You're gonna have to
drive a little faster!

I'm already going
over the speed limit.

Too late! Pull over!
It's starting to come out!

-Of where?
-I'm not sure exactly.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Brian, I'm going to
need you to deliver the baby.

Uh, uh, okay, can you wait a second
while I put a towel down?

I don't want anything
to get on the seats.

Oh, no, of course.

Our first priority should be
to keep the vinyl clean.

Oh, God. Oh, God, it's coming!

Can you see the head?

I don't know
where to look!

Well, maybe you should
look at the part of me

where there's a baby coming out!

(MOANING)

How did Murphy Brown
make this look so easy?

Careful,
don't get anything on the...

(SPLATS)

Seats.

STEWIE: Oh, God,
I think another one's coming!

BRIAN: I don't see it!

STEWIE: I think it's coming out
of my mouth! (MOANING)

There's more! And they're coming
out of everywhere!

Ah, kill me!
This hurts too much!

BRIAN: Holy (BLEEP)!
What is happening?

STEWIE: I don't know!
Brian, save the placenta.

BRIAN: Do you even
have a placenta?

STEWIE: Well, whatever comes out, save it.
I want to eat it.

BRIAN: Oh, God!
They're crawling all over me!

STEWIE:
How many are there now?

BRIAN: Four, five, six, seven.

<i>Mazel tov!</i>

(BARKING, SQUEAKING)

(COOING)

(COOING)

I just put Jack and Rose
down for their nap.

And I'm trying to keep
the more attractive ones in this area.

This is a nightmare.

Oh, I caught two of them
trying to eat each other,

so that's something
we need to watch out for.

Look, Bri, that one looks
just like you.

Huh. Well, you know what?
I guess he does.

You know,
I was actually thinking,

this could be a chance
for you to finally make things right.

What? What do you mean?

Well, you do have a son
that you were never there for.

This is your opportunity
to do things differently.

Wow. Maybe you're right.

I suppose I could give it a try.

There you go.
Oh, Dick really likes you.

-I like Dick.
-(CHUCKLES) You like dick!

His name's not Dick,
you idiot. It's Finn.

All right, let's check our YouTube channel
and see how we're doing.

Boy, they just went right after Cleveland,
didn't they?

Geez, that word looks even harsher
when it's in all caps.

Wow, people really seem to hate
everything we put on here.

That sucks.

And I worked really hard on taking
a picture of myself every day for a year

and then setting the photos
to an emotional song.

Look.

<i>Hey there, Delilah</i>
<i>What's it like in New York City</i>

Yeah, so we're, uh, thinking about
selling the house.

(BARKING)

Hey, stop squirming in there.

This one's bones
all feel loose.

And I think that one
is blind.

We'll have to get him
little sunglasses.

Great, because dog-head-human-ears
over here

doesn't react to anything I say.

Hey! Hey, you! (CLAPS)

Okay, this one is deaf.

We are going to be spending
a fortune on schools.

-How are we gonna pay for that?
-Well, you tell me.

You're the one who insisted
I be a stay-at-home mom.

I don't even have a job.

Well, you better get one.

And not writing. A real job.

Why are you being such a jerk?

I don't know. I'm sorry. I just...

(CRYING) I just feel like once I get them
on a schedule,

everything will be fine.

I can't believe we couldn't come up
with a viral video.

We should've just gotten Jimmy Fallon
to do any lame thing.

(NEWS THEME PLAYS)

Coming up, a white waiter at
a Chinese restaurant?

We'll get you the facts
on this bizarre story.

But first,
this week's viral video,

<i>Fat Kid Hustles</i>
<i>Through Crosswalk.</i>

Here it is.

Here's little Chubbo pulling up the rear.

Oh, he's got to get moving now.

That's right, don't let your
chocolate levels get too low.

I can't believe Chris gets four million
hits just crossing the street.

I guess we were trying too hard.

Hey, I went by your house the other day.
Is your baby pregnant?

I don't know.
Lois is in charge of the kids.

(THUMPING)

Stewie, this is awful.

I don't know why anyone
would want to be a parent,

especially to four children.

Four? I thought
we were down to five.

Yeah, the deaf one
didn't hear Joe's lawnmower.

Oh, that's really upsetting.

I can't take this anymore, Stewie.

I'm sorry.
I gotta get out of here.

What? Where are you going?

Stop doing that!

I need a break, all right?
I just gotta get away for a couple weeks.

A couple weeks?

You're not leaving me alone
with these things.

The whole point of this was for us
to spend more time together.

What are you talking about?
The whole point of what?

Well, you've been so distant lately.

I thought if we had a baby
it would bring us closer together.

What?

I was only distant because
you've been so moody lately.

I thought you needed more space.

I always want to hang out with you.

Well, I was only moody
because you were so distant!

I always want to
hang out with you, too!

Oh, my God.

So, we didn't have
to do any of this.

I guess not.

-How attached to them are you?
-Not at all.

Yeah, me either.

This is for the best.

Yeah, I mean,
I'm sure they'll be adopted.

Oh, God, yeah.

I'm still keeping all the gifts
from the baby shower.

You had a baby shower?

Oh! (CHUCKLES)

Now, this makes it real!
(CHUCKLES)

Oh, my goodness.

That's enough cake
for you, Mary Beth.

(READING)

Oh, man, I bet that's where
Crocodile Dundee eats every night.

Everything in Australia is so fancy.

Yeah, Australia's a beautiful place.

The best thing about going there
is you get to fly over the Pacific Ocean.

The greatest ocean of all time.

(SCOFFS) Tell me you're joking.

Everyone knows that, pound for pound,
the Atlantic is the best ocean.

"Pound for pound"?
What are you talking about?

You can't weigh the ocean.

Yeah, scientists can.
They're doing it all the time.

Pick up a book. You're an idiot.

I'm an idiot?

All anybody remembers about your argument
is that you're in a wheelchair!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Guys, guys, let's stop escalating
and take the stairs for a minute.

What? What are you talking about?

I'm saying you both
are making good points.

But sometimes two rights can make a wrong.

I just... I just like the Pacific Ocean!

It's a good ocean. And so is the Atlantic.

Isn't this a beautiful planet
you two friends live on?

(SIGHS) I guess Cleveland's right.
I'm sorry I got so hotheaded.

I'm sorry, too.
Here, let me turn your foot back around.

It kind of got twisted up
in our scuffle there.

Wow, Cleveland.

You calmed them down

just by talking with your mouth
and your pretty lips.

It's nothing. Just a little something

I learned volunteering
as a youth counselor down at my church.

Pretty much just boils down
to four or five catchphrases.

-Like what?
-Well, there's the "stop escalating" one.

There's "What do you think it means?"

"Pray on it, stay on it."

One's just kind of like a noise.

Hmm, mm?

That's amazing.

Hey, you're way too good
to be doing that for free.

Maybe you should open up an office.

You know, finally start chipping away at
some of that horrendous debt you've got.

Yeah, Peter's right.

I mean, it's not like you've found a job
since you moved back here anyway.

You know, that's a not-half-bad idea.

And if I charge my first patient $117,000,
I'm right back in it.

Thanks for spotting my potential, Peter.

Hey, no problem, buddy.
I'm pretty perceptive.

That's how I can always tell

which guys in the Wrangler Jeans
commercials beat their wives.

All of 'em.

Go around the block again,
she's still out front.

We've gone around six times.
Let's just talk to her.

Eh, you're right.
Rip it off quick like a Band-Aid.

Hey, Meg, you know
Mr. Quagmire, right? Bye!

Hey, what's going on here?

Oh, I'm selling my old Beanie Babies
to make money for the prom.

That seems optimistic.

But, look, if you want to make real money,

I could try to get you
a job at the airport.

They always need new TSA screeners.

Really? Wow, that'd be great!

Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.
And thanks for taking the time.

Most people aren't
usually that nice to me.

Ugh, gross.

Mayor West,
after working with you for some time now,

I believe you are affecting
your weird behaviors.

You are doing deliberately odd things

to mask dark,
maybe even criminal, activities.

You are 100% aware of what you're doing.

I think you're a dangerous sociopath.

Cleveland, let me tell you something.

You're absolutely (BEEP) right.

Well, time to put on my spaghetti hat!

I just never feel happy.

I strive for these things, and I get them,

but at the end of the day,
I still don't feel fulfilled.

Hmm, this is a problem
that requires more tweed.

Is it possible
you're not letting yourself be happy?

Like you don't feel like you're worth it?

No, that's not it.

Hmm.

Maybe your accomplishments don't feel real

because your brother
isn't here to see them.

Maybe. That doesn't
feel quite right, either.

Hmm.

You don't want to outshine your father.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Phew. I was damn near out of tweed.

Okay, now, see?
She didn't say "Good morning" to me,

so I put an orange dot
on her boarding pass,

which means
they're going to search her anus.

I noticed you also circled
a bunch of things on her ticket.

Why did you do that?

Because otherwise,
the line moves too quickly.

You see, the whole thing
we're going for here at the TSA

is a sort of bored fascism.

Huh, I think I can handle that.

I did not tell you to approach!

Great job!

The worst thing a passenger can do

is approach your podium
before you tell them to.

As bad as those 19 hijackers were,

the people we see here every day
are much worse.

Boy, Larry, there's a lot to remember.

I hope I don't screw something up.

Trust me, you have nothing to worry about.

-You're basically unfireable.
-What do you mean?

Come on, Meg. Look around.
You're the hottest person who works here.

Oh, wow. Now that you mention it,
everybody does look kind of dumpy.

That's not entirely their fault.

They're all told to wear
a pair of their dads' pants.

Oh, speaking of which, tomorrow,
bring in a pair of your dad's pants.

Peter, you promised me
you would do the dishes.

Well, I was doing the dishes for a while,

but they were inexperienced,
so I ended up having to rub one out.

Where in the hell
did you get the idea that

that's what I meant by "doing the dishes"?

From dirty Amelia Bedelia.

Almost done vacuuming the rug!

Damn it, Peter, you're making me crazy!

Hey, you know what?
Sounds like you need some counseling.

Maybe you should go talk to Cleveland.

Cleveland? Why would I talk to Cleveland?

He's a therapist now,
and he's really great

at helping people with their problems.

Oh, I see.

You want me to tell your best friend
my complaints about you

so he can back you up.

STEWIE: The new maid is peeing on me!

And she didn't even say
anything clever about it!

Look, you're the one
who said you were going crazy.

Just talk to him.
He's all about helping people get well.

Just like Doc Martens.

So, how are you feeling today?

Terrible. I've got blurry vision,
I feel cold and clammy,

and the nurse told me
there's blood in my stool.

-Have you tried wearing a lesbian shoe?
-What?

Put this man down
for a pair of lesbian shoes.

Huh, high fever, weight loss
and extreme respiratory difficulty.

Let's have this man intubated
and fit with a pair of lesbian shoes.

Hi. Are you the next crazy person?

Um, I guess so.

I've been pretty depressed
since my wife died.

I'm sorry, I'm trying to read
the <i>Costco Connection</i> here.

There they are!

All right, since you're a patient,

we're gonna talk about you
like you're not here.

You get all of her squawking out, Doc?

Oh, I think we got to
the root of the problem. Didn't we, Lois?

Absolutely.

All right. Let's dope her up good.
Turn that mouth off.

No, Peter, the problem is you.

What?

What the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to be my friend.

Dr. Brown, I just killed nine people!

Uh, I mean, I have ducks on my feet.

Old, crazy, harmless Mayor. Quack, quack!

How can Cleveland say I'm the problem?

All I do is sit in the bathroom
and play on my phone.

Swipe. Wipe. Swipe. Wipe.
Wipe. Swipe. Uh-oh.

That's a perfect example.
You put no effort into this marriage.

Cleveland helped me see
that our entire relationship has been

you doing whatever you want
and me cleaning up the mess.

By the way, your Svengali is out there
spraying birds with a hose.

Ha, ha. Now you're wet!

Peter, I've had enough.

Cleveland and I think
we need to make some changes.

Oh, come on. Are you serious?

Yeah. You're gonna start
helping around the house,

and we're gonna start
doing things together.

We do stuff together.

Just last night, I made you keep track
of all the words I know.

"Shoehorn."

"Engine."

"Football."

-Did I say "shoehorn"?
-Yes.

Okay. "Shoehorns."

(SIGHS)

Peter, please. I've got an early
doctor's appointment tomorrow.

Ooh, "Early." "Doctor."
Put those on there, too.

Uh, should I also put down "appointment"?

No, I don't know what that means.
Oh, "Means."

Wow, look at the new girl. She's so hot.

Yeah, her breasts and her stomach
are different parts of her body.

I think she looks weird.
How come she's not shaped like a potato?

That's part of the interview
and everything.

Whoa, sorry, ma'am,
we can't let you through security

because you're the bomb.

Scott, you're not supposed to
make jokes like that!

Well, I am carrying
more than three ounces of liquid.

Oh, that's so Muhammad Hota.

You're playing a dangerous game, Scott!

All right, Peter. Cleveland says
you should help with the chores.

So today, we're gonna do laundry together.

Okay. How does this work?

Well, you put the wet clothes
in the dryer,

you close the door and you wait.

Oh, it just went to 39 minutes!

So you just stand here
and watch the whole time?

(SHUSHING) Ah, the green shirt
went by again.

If it goes around 30 times
in five minutes,

you get to have a Diet Coke!

All right, according to Cleveland,

it's also healthy for couples
to have shared activities.

So, since you like golf,
I thought we could play a round.

So, what do I do? Just aim for the pond?

No, you're not supposed
to hit it into the water.

But you hit it into the water.

I know I hit it into the water.

Why do they even have water
if you're not supposed to hit it there?

Because it's fun! We're having fun!

(YELLS)

Look, it went further than your ball!

Hey, are you doing anything on Friday?

No, I don't think so. Why?

Well, I'm doing security
at the roller rink

if you want to come watch me.

Sure!

Great, I'll pick you up at 4:30.

Sounds good. All right.
Well, I'm up at the podium.

Time to make marks on pieces of paper
no one will ever see again.

I thought we had plans on Friday.

Marla, I think we should
just be ugly friends.

Damn it, Cleveland has
completely ruined my life.

He's got Lois making me
help around the house

and spend more time with her.

My own wife!

I know what you mean, Peter.

He said I've got to be
more open and receptive

to what Bonnie wants to do in the bedroom.

Thank God I can't
feel anything back there.

You know what? Screw Cleveland.

He's gonna tell my wife stuff,
I'm gonna tell his wife a few things.

What are you talking about?

Well, remember how Cleveland banged
that stripper at his bachelor party?

Oh, yeah. And we were all
throwing bread at them?

Yeah. Maybe I could tell Donna about that.

Or, remember when Cleveland
wore briefs under his boxers

and we found out
and he told us not to say anything?

Maybe we tell her that.

Uh, I think Peter's is better.

Okay, but we'll keep mine ready.

Could be the nail in the coffin.

Hey, fellas.

Cleveland, it ain't cool
what you've been telling Lois.

All right? You're completely
messing things up for me.

And you've got to tell her you were wrong
and put things back the way they were.

I'm sorry it's hard for you, Peter,

but personal growth isn't always easy.

Look, if you don't change
what you're saying,

we're gonna tell Donna you slept with
that stripper at your bachelor party.

(SCREAMS)

What are you doing?

I'm gonna play <i>Locomotive Breath</i>
by Jethro Tull while he runs.

Why the hell would you do
something stupid like that?

Careful, Peter,
or you're gonna lose two friends today.

<i>But you know that guy</i>
<i>hasn't blinked</i><i>this entire game?</i>

<i>Just a dead-eyed idiot</i>
<i>out on a Thursday afternoon.</i>

ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Yup.</i>
<i>And the longer I watch him,</i>

<i>the more I wonder</i>
<i>if</i><i>he's there by himself.</i>

ANNOUNCER 1: <i>I think</i>
<i>you're</i><i>on to something there.</i>

<i>That seat next to him</i>
<i>has been empty for hours.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Right you are, Gary.</i>

<i>I'm gonna see if I can hit him</i>
<i>with my apple.</i>

<i>Ah, kind of short-armed it.</i>

Oh, I'll get to the bottom of this.
Take care, Donna.

Cleveland didn't show up
to my therapy session earlier,

and Donna says
she hasn't seen him for two days.

Interesting. Interesting.

She also weirdly told me
that she squatted 250 today.

I'm not even sure if that's good.

It's scary good.

Well, I am off to
try and get out of this conversation.

Peter, what did you do?

He was slightly inconveniencing
me and Joe,

so we threatened to destroy his family.

-What?
-I know, right? It's pretty galling.

No, I'm not taking your side, Peter.

Whatever the hell you did,
you go find him and bring him back.

All right, I'll go find him.
God, I'm sorry.

You're making me feel lower
than a squid at the bottom of the ocean.

(BURBLING)

Wow. It really inks in here.

(BEEPS)

(BEEPING)

What is that?

There you are. Listen up, Meg.

This TSA isn't sweaty enough
for the two of us.

What? What does that even mean?

It means, stay away from Larry.
I'm his girlfriend.

You are? Oh, my God,
I thought you were a boy.

Oh, that's it!

I will cut you, bitch!

Ow, that hurt a little bit!

(GROANS AND SCREAMS)

(GRUNTING)

(GRUNTING)

(GASPING)

(GRUNTING)

(SCREAMS)

(GASPING)

This ain't over. Larry is mine.

What the hell? That was crazy!

Like, crazier than putting
cops on Segways.

Help, Officer!
There's a lady being raped in that alley!

Okay, hold on,
let me do a small dippy-bob turn.

I couldn't be sure,
but I think the man has a knife!

Are there any steps leading to that alley
or is it just a series of gentle ramps?

Okay, guys,
Lois wants me to find Cleveland.

And since he eats, like,
nine candy bars a day,

if we wait here at the convenience store,
he's bound to show up.

Hey, can you buy us some beer?

Uh, I don't know,
I don't think it'd be right.

(GROANS) I knew you weren't cool.

Well, now, now, hold on a minute.

See? This is pretty cool, huh?

Yeah, I guess. But what we could
really use is some weed.

I think that might be over the line.

See? I told you this guy wasn't cool.

Well, now, now, hold on a minute.

Mr. Griffin, did you or did you not

distribute alcohol and marijuana
to minors?

No, Your Honor, I did not.

Told you this defendant wasn't cool.

Well, now, now, now, hold on a minute.

Still no sign of Cleveland?

Yeah. I was thinking maybe our best bet
is to just drive around town

and see if we can spot him.

Okay, well, he's not
at the mini golf course.

Okay, he's still not
at the mini golf course.

Oh, wow. Look at that windmill.

-Peter, do you want to go mini-golfing?
-Yes.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Well, he wasn't by the snow cones.

I love today!

-Hi, Meg.
-Larry, what are you doing here?

I thought we were gonna meet
at the Tumi store

and see who buys luggage at the airport.

Meg, I've got some disturbing news.

Some gray security tubs have gone missing.

Oh, my God! The ones we have a zillion of,

but are somehow never there
when people need them?

That's right. And I'm going to have to
check your locker.

(CRASHING)

I don't need to tell you
how serious this is.

Wait, Larry! I was framed!
I bet it was Marla!

I'm sorry, Meg, you're fired.

I'm going to need
your small, ridiculous tie.

You're firing me?

I have a duty to this country.

And with people like you stealing tubs,

how are we ever going to catch Abu Nazir?

That's not even a real person.

That's the terrorist from <i>Homeland.</i>
And they caught him.

Goodbye, Meg.

Goodbye, Larry.

Meg?

I'll miss the way
you reminded people about their belts.

We've looked everywhere.
Where the hell could he be?

Guys, I think we need to
embrace the possibility

that Cleveland never existed.

Damn it, if only there was some kind
of clue as to where he might be.

That's right, Cleveland had a deli!

We should check there!

Cleveland!

Cleveland!

PETER: Sweet! Egg salad!

Peter, this place has been
closed for six years.

So what? Egg salad don't go bad.

(GROANING)

Son of a whore! Give me some milk!

Okay, that helped.

Geez, this place is a dump.

CLEVELAND: Yeah, it is, isn't it?

It's a symbol of all my failures.

-Cleveland!
-You're okay!

(GROANS)

I'm so glad we found you!

Hey, listen, I'm sorry
we threatened to blab

about your bachelor party stripper stuff.

I'd never do that.

'Cause that'd mean
I'd have to talk to Donna,

and that's just like... (GROANS)

And I'm sorry I caused
such problems in your marriage.

Truth is, I was faking it as a therapist.

(SIGHS) I've been back almost a year
and I still got nothing going on.

Hey, cheer up, Cleveland.
I mean, Joe doesn't have a job, either.

What are you talking about? I'm a cop.

Oh, wait, that's real?

I thought that was, like,
a Make-A-Wish thing.

All right, come on, buddy.
Let's get out of here.

And, you know, even though therapy
might not be your thing,

you've got a job,
as my fourth-best friend.

-After the dog?
-After the dog.

Peter, thanks for going to find Cleveland
and bringing him home safely.

Hey, that's what friends are for.

What about you, Meg?
What'd you do this week?

What, so you can make fun of me?

No, Meg. I'm your father,

and I'm interested
in what my daughter did this week.

You promise
you're not gonna make fun of me?

Of course, Meg. I care about my family.

But I feel like you're drawing this out,

so when you do make fun of me,
it'll hurt more.

What? Well, that hurts, Meg.

You know, you can be very hurtful.

I'm asking you, please,
and you don't have to tell me,

I want to know, because I'm interested,
what you did this week.

It enhances my life to know
how yours is going.

You promise?

Okay, well, now you owe me an apology.

I'm sorry.
I'm not used to you wanting to know.

Of course,
I'd love to tell you what happened.

Then by all means.

It's just upsetting
when you thumb your nose at the family.

But I love you, and I'm looking forward
to hearing what you have to say.

Please. I'd like to hear.

Oh, okay.
Well, this is actually kind of funny.

Say, you fellas know
if Jerome serves dessert here?

I got a real hankering for pudding.

That's so weird. I was just thinking
about pudding on the way over here.

Okay, well, you two are clearly in love,

but I could also go for some pudding.

Why we all got pudding on the brain?

It's got to be that new billboard
advertising pudding on the highway.

We all drove past it on the way here.

Well, that's no surprise.

Everyone in my house can get very excited

by a good ad campaign.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Lois! Lois, it's back!

I heard, Peter! I heard!

Kids, kids, it's happening!

This is what we practiced for!

-(BARKING)

I love you, Dad!

I love you, too, sweetheart!
None of the past matters!

Oh, yeah, I seen that pudding billboard.

It's the one that says
"CBS Outdoor Advertising" on it.

Yeah, but right above that is,
like, a big guy eating pudding.

I don't remember none of that.

I just remember "CBS Outdoor Advertising"
on the bottom

and three pigeons sitting on top.

You're bad at looking at billboards.

Hey, we should go check it out right now.

Ordinarily I'd say no,
but that adult kickball league

is coming in for drinks,

so let's get out of here.

Guys, check it out.

I've got flip-up shades
on my flip-up shades.

Dude, you are the worst.

Hey, we're all the worst.

That's real pudding in there.

What? No, it isn't.

They wouldn't put real pudding
on a billboard, Peter.

Do you have any idea how crippled
you sound right now?

Peter, it's not real pudding.

God, sometimes I just want
to shake some sense into you.

Big talk for a guy who looks like a dad
at a Dave Matthews' concert.

Everybody hates how you dress. Right, Joe?

Sorry, I stay out of fashion debates.

I've been burned one too many times.

Hey, guys, notice anything different?

Yeah, Minetti's got a hot new look.

The whole thing, it just works.

Minetti.

Look, there's only one way to settle this.

I am climbing that billboard
to prove it's real pudding.

-Moisturizer?
-Sure.

Okay.

We getting on into the chappy season.

Peter, be careful up there!

Is this being careful enough, Joe?

Okay. All right.

(SCREAMS)

Peter, are you okay?

All right, there's no pudding,
but there is a kid up here.

QUAGMIRE: Don't hold him like that.

Oh, my God!
Peter, that's the lost Nicholson kid!

He's been missing for a week!

Oh, yeah.

They arrested a custodian 'cause of you.

Peter, stay put.

I'll call this in, and we'll get a crew
out here to help you both down.

(SIGHS) All right,
but can you hurry it up?

I got band practice later.

<i>No, no, bones are too big.</i>

Peter, you seem off today.

Are you thinking about
killing infants again?

No.

<i>Now you got to kill them, too.</i>

Mikey, you're safe!
Thank you so much for finding my boy.

Thank you for finding her boy.
I'm the stepfather.

Peter Griffin,
in recognition of your heroism

in helping to rescue
little Mikey Nicholson,

I'd like to present you
with this key to the city.

Now, don't forget to water the plants
every other day

and change the cat's litter.

I'll see you in two weeks. No parties.

Thank you, Mayor West.

You know, some of you out there
are calling me a hero.

Others are calling me a hoagie.

Those of you from Connecticut
are calling me a grinder.

I guess what I'm trying to say is,

I'm not just pieces of meat
between pieces of bread.

I am a man who unintentionally saves kids.

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

Wow. Twenty years on the force,
and no one's ever clapped for me.

Except for that one sarcastic gay guy.

(CLAPS)

Great observation.

I know you mean the opposite
of what you're saying.

Fact is, when I saved that boy,
I wasn't thinking.

I don't think. I just do.

I wanted to see if a billboard
had real pudding in it,

so I climbed up there and came out a hero.

It's just like Gandhi always said,

"Eat as much as you want and do whatever,

"and don't be afraid to hit each other."

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Way to go, Dad.

Peter, that thing you said about
not thinking and just doing stuff,

did you mean that?

Sure I did, Joe. I never stop to think.

That's why I've had ringworm 11 times.
I will roll in anything.

You know what? You're right.

And it's time I do the same thing.

(DIALING)

Hey, Chief. It's Swanson. I quit.

Joe Swanson.

I don't know if Ray Swanson's quitting.
You'd have to ask him.

Okay, you just called me Ray again.

I just want to confirm
that you understand that this is Joe.

No, not, "See you tomorrow."

Joe, what are you doing?
You can't quit your job.

Well, that's the other thing, Bonnie.
You and I are done, too.

-What?
-I'm leaving you.

Whoo! New Joe!

Wow, I can't remember
the last time Joe shot his gun.

I know. That bullet's been rolling
around in his junk drawer for years.

Hey, Ma, guess where I am?

Yeah, can you hear it?
Flying through the air.

I don't know what he shot at.

I guess I'll just have
to find out when I land. (CHUCKLES)

No, don't put Terry on.
You can just tell him.

Hey. Hi, Terry.

-Oh, God.
-What?

"What?" You know what.

I think it looks good.

You are just trying anything, aren't you?

Just searching for an identity, man.

And you think this is gonna be it, huh?

Oh, God, whatever.

Peter, I'm worried about Joe.
You know, not only did he quit his job,

he's moved out
and gotten his own apartment.

Oh, I feel terrible
for Bonnie and the kids.

Ah, they'll be fine. They'll bounce back.

Just like Humpty Dumpty did
after his fall.

My God, it's a miracle!

You were able to put me
back together again.

Yeah, it was actually
a pretty simple procedure.

Maybe next time go straight
to a medical professional

and skip the horses
and illiterate servants.

Well, that is the last time I drink
and masturbate on top of a high wall.

Wait, wait, Quagmire, hold up.
I got a great knock.

(KNOCKING <i>SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT)</i>

Oh, I got to remember that.

Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?

Hey, buddy. How you doing?

You okay?

Everything okay?

I'm talking like this because
I'm being very careful not to upset you,

and for some reason,
this is the voice people use to do that.

I'm great. Come on in.
Check out the new pad.

Whoa! You got an air hockey table?

Yep. Wanted it, got it.
That's the new Joe.

And check this out.

It's the gun that no-leg sprinter used
to kill his girlfriend.

Oh, my God!

Eh, anyone who's kind of fast
gets a free pass from me.

What kind of person
would want to buy that?

I'll tell you who.

The kind of guy who's always got
butterscotch candies for his friends.

Okay, now that's pretty cool.

I got to be honest, Joe,

we came over here
because we were worried about you,

but these candies tell me
you're doing great.

I've never been better.
I was living my life all wrong.

But not anymore.
No more thinking, just living.

Well, it seems like
you made the right choice, Joe.

I mean, I ain't seen anyone this happy

since the invention
of the penny-farthing bicycle.

Eureka! Watch it go.

Higher than you,
faster than you, better than you.

Everyone just stop inventing stuff now,

'cause no one will ever top this.

Oh, no! Keep rakes away.

I expressly said
no rakes allowed on the street

when I am riding my futuristic machine.

(GROANS)

(CHILDREN GRUNTING)

Children, this is progress!
How can you turn a blind eye to progress?

(GROANING)

I expressly said no rakes.

'Sup, ladies?

Oh, we're not ladies, you.

Hey, what's with the suitcase?

I got a surprise.

What would you guys think of a road trip?

-Yeah!
-All right, I'm in!

Awesome, road trip!
I love being super pumped for 15 minutes

and then bored out of my mind
for eight hours.

Where we going?

Well, I was thinking Niagara Falls.

Niagara Falls? Ain't that just for lovers?

Nah, it's for everybody.

It's great to just stand there and let
Mother Nature spray it all over your face.

Donna's big fat aunt is in town,
so I can definitely go.

Man, I am filling these Gatorade bottles
as fast as I'm drinking them.

Oh, sweet! Cows! Let's tip them over.

What? You want to tip over some cows?

Hell, yeah!

This is gonna be so boss. I can't wait.

This is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

All right, cow.
This is what you get for standing.

(GRUNTS)

That was awesome.

PETER: <i>I want to kiss that cow,</i>
<i>but I don't want</i><i>it to be my idea.</i>

Hey, Peter, you should kiss that cow.

PETER: <i>All right, Peter,</i>
<i>that was fortuitous.</i><i>But play it cool.</i>

Oh, Cleveland, I couldn't.

Okay. Quagmire, you should kiss that cow.

Sure, why not?

(SCREAMS IN HIS HEAD)

JOE: Okay, they're sleeping.

We're gonna have to party in the bathroom.

Be careful around the really fat one.
He's kind of like my boss.

QUAGMIRE: What? Who's there?

Joe, what the hell are you doing?

I went to a high school kegger party.

Made a few new friends.
This is Chrysalis, Ichabod and Cancer.

Oh, I see three young men
who could use the tickle monster.

Uh, that's a bad read, Pete.

Joe, it's 3:00 in the morning.
We're trying to get some sleep.

You guys are lame.

We're gonna go smoke
something called "croak."

God, what the hell has gotten into Joe?

I don't know, Quagmire.
Maybe you could ask the tickle monster!

-(LAUGHS) Stop it!
-Here he comes!

No! Get away! He's gonna get ya! Look out!

Great, now I'm fully up.

Here we are, guys, Niagara Falls.

We showed them. We showed them all!

Showed who?
What the hell's he talking about?

I don't know. I stopped listening to him
back at the drive-thru

when he leaned out the window
and ordered a "fur burger."

That's not funny. That's just nasty.

Plus, there's people waiting behind you!

Wow. You know, when you see it up close,
it really is incredible.

Yeah. Holy crap, it's beautiful.

In the future,
I believe there will be water wars.

You know, Lois always dreamed about
coming here, and now I know why.

She was even saving money for it.

You made it, Lois. You made it.

Didn't I tell you guys?

It's the most magnificent place
in the world.

And the greatest place to end it all.

Goodbye, fellas.

(ALL GASPING)

Oh, my God! Joe killed himself!

It's so weird that he argued
over the price of breakfast this morning.

(SOBS) It makes no sense!

-JOE: Damn it!
-Joe?

(GASPS) Joe, you're alive!

Are you hurt?

I'm not sure.

Well, hang in there, Joe,
we'll get some help.

No! Just let me die!

Oh, no, can't do that, Joe.
We're friends. We look out for each other.

I mean, you supported me that day
I accidentally wore Lois's jeans.

Peter, you know you're wearing...

I know. I think there was a mix-up.

Oh, thank you, Jazzercise.

Don't worry, Joe. They're coming for you.

MAN: Yay! My backpack!

Hang in there, Joe.

After they get that lady's hat,
you're next.

WOMAN: Thank you. It's windy up here.

(TRUCK BEEPING)

Joe, what the hell is wrong with you?

Why would you try to kill yourself?

Why do you think? I'm worthless.

But you've been so happy
these last few days.

I've been manic.
Do you think Andy Dick is happy?

I couldn't imagine, no.

Look, when I saw Peter become a hero,

I guess it reminded me
of all the things I can't do.

I'm a cop who can't save anyone.

I'm a husband in a legless marriage.

My whole life is a joke.

But somehow, as soon as I decided
to kill myself, I actually felt free.

Almost giddy. I can finally kiss
this worthless life goodbye.

Let me get this straight.

The whole point of bringing us
to Niagara Falls

was just to kill yourself?

I'm sorry I tricked you guys into coming.

I just wanted to spend my last week
with my best pals.

Well, not for nothing, but you could have
taken us all to Disney World,

and shot yourself in the room.

Come on, Joe,
there's plenty of reasons to live.

Like, like, you're handsome.

You have a handsome face.

Well, he's got a good chin.
I don't know about handsome.

Yeah, he's not handsome,
but I will say this, he keeps a good lawn.

Yeah, some might say the second-best lawn
in the neighborhood.

Hey, wait, where's Joe?

Joe, wait!

(TRUCK BEEPING)

I stink at this.

Anywhere is fine.

Guys, this is unnecessary.
Give me my chair back.

No, we can't trust you
not to kill yourself.

Yeah, then you'd be the 10th friend
who's killed himself in front of me.

Is that true?

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

those two girls and... Yeah, yeah, 10.

Look, you guys, what we really need
to do is bring him back to Quahog,

where we can get him some help.

That's a good idea.
We should just go home.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

It's too bad we already
bought those tickets

for the Whirlpool Aero Car.

That's $16 we're not getting back.

Yeah, what a waste of money.

It is only a 10-minute ride, you know.

Okay, we'll do the Whirlpool Aero Car,

and then take Joe back to Quahog.

What about the White Water Walk?

Okay, okay, Whirlpool Aero Car,
then White Water Walk,

then we bring Joe back.

Well, you can't do Niagara Falls
without riding the Maid of the Mist.

-Yeah, let's do everything.
-Great!

And, guys, remember,
the pool towels go home with us.

They got no way of accounting for those.

Well, this has just been
one heck of a fun day.

Yeah. Yeah, you know,
seeing the natural beauty of this place

is actually making me feel much better.

Hey, you mind opening that door?
Get a little breeze in here?

Sure.

(GRUNTING)

Peter, no!

I don't regret it. The breeze is nice.

(SCREAMING)

Oh, crap, I'm losing my grip!

You buy your jeans at Walmart?

No, somebody who lost theirs
at the church did.

You wear lost-and-found jeans?

I waited the mandatory week.

Hang on, guys!

(ALL SCREAMING)

(ALL GASPING)

Don't worry, I'm coming!

What's that thing he's on?

It's a chair with wheels!

He's an absolute dream.

(GRUNTS)

Guys, keep swallowing water.
We'll drink our way out of this.

Guys, grab on to my legs!

-(GRUNTING)
-Got it!

Ew. You know, this is actually
the first time I've ever touched Joe.

Don't worry, I gotcha.

Thank God, Joe. I thought I was dead!

I even pictured my own funeral.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Joe, that was amazing. You saved us.

Yeah, I guess I did.

You know, I spent the whole time
trying to kill myself,

but it took seeing you guys almost die

to realize that life
really is worth living.

See, Joe, you're a hero, too.

And we wouldn't trade you
for any friend in the world.

Well, that was kind of a weird trip,
but I'm glad we went.

Yeah, I love Niagara Falls.

I was the only Black man ever to go there.

One of them thought I was a bear.

-Hey, guys.
-Wow, Joe, you got your job back?

-Sure did.
-How'd you pull that off?

Ah, they always need more cops.

Turns out, not many people want to
probably get shot for $24,000 a year.

And what about Bonnie?
How you getting her back?

Well, I got a plan for that.

I hired some guys to come to the house
on Tuesday and assault her,

and I'll come in and save her,

and she'll be so grateful,
she'll have to take me back.

Joe, today's Tuesday.

Well, poop.

His bum looks like that guy
with 100 cigarettes in his mouth.

Hey, Chris,
I noticed you were sitting alone.

You mind if I join you?

Sure. We both have hats. Makes sense.

Oh, thanks. Hey, can you check my back
for "kick me" signs?

Oh, yeah, you got a couple. (CHUCKLES)

This one says you're a "dirty kick."

That doesn't say "kick," but thanks,
I'll keep that one for my lawsuit.

Boys, I got a new home gym.

Why are you telling us that?

Just letting people know.

Don't want anyone to get freaked out
by the transformation.

I got to say, it feels kind of weird
having someone join me for lunch.

Well, it's only natural, Chris.
You and I are social exiles.

We're the Khaleesi and Jorah Mormont
of this school.

Sure, I'll agree to keep
the conversation going.

Well, time to break out
my terrible Jewish bag lunch.

Let's see. Smoked whitefish,
herring in cream sauce,

smoked sable,
that's a different kind of whitefish.

And for dessert,
the only bad cookie in the world.

Hey, what's it like
buying food from school?

It's good. I know everyone back there,
so they let me drink the corn water.

Boy, it's so great
having someone I can talk to.

I feel the same way, Chris.

I think you and I could
get along very nicely.

Yeah. We'll be a better team
than the Warsaw Globetrotters.

All right, Brian, it's time for you
to take one of these pills from the vet.

Oh, yeah, right.
Can we do what we normally do,

where you roll it up in a piece of cheese
like you're fooling me?

Yeah, I guess, but then you're gonna
have cheese in your ass.

Wait, what?

Yeah, the doctor said I got to give you
these pills the butt way.

No, no, no. That is not happening.

No, no, no. I do not go the butt way.

Look, I know it sounds a little rough,
but why don't we start

with a gentle massage of the area
and see how you feel?

Peter, get away from my ass!

(GRUNTING)

Brian! No!

Huh. Guess I'm just gonna
have to take him by surprise.

Shouldn't be too hard.
After all, I used to be a pete-in-the-box.

<i>(POP GOES THE WEASEL</i> PLAYING)

All right, if I'm gonna

I should probably watch
that old episode of <i>Lassie</i>

where Timmy has to give her a suppository.

(BARKING)

What's that, Lassie? You feel sick?
What's wrong, girl?

(BARKING)

A supposi-what?

What am I supposed to do with it?

(BARKING)

Gosh. I...

Well, if you're in that much pain,
I guess.

Okay.

(BARKING)

You were lying? You weren't feeling sick?

I don't understand.
Why did you want me to do this?

(BARKING)

What? He was in on it?
It was just a prank? You guys are gross.

Kids, everybody, family meeting!

There's too much passing gas
in this house.

So from now on,
anytime you got to cut one,

you pull your pants down
and you do it through this fart hole.

Are you insane?

Lois, it's okay, it's all a trick.

As soon as Brian does it,
I'm gonna be on the other side,

and I'll stick the suppository in.

No. Absolutely not.
I am not living like this.

You think Morgan Fairchild
has a fart hole in her house?

Morgan, the coq au vin is divine.

But so rich. Will you excuse me?

Where do our Hollywood farts go?

I've heard they're filtered
into Tom Sizemore's house.

(FARTING)

(SNIFFS)

(SIGHS) Ah, Morgan.

Hey, no, no, Brian.
No, no. You win. You win.

I quit. It's your liver.
You do whatever you want.

Well, thank you. Yes, it is my liver,
and I don't want to take that pill.

Fine. We're both in agreement.
So let's just both watch TV.

-And nothing else.
-Sounds good to me.

I'm glad you think it sounds good.

(SIGHS)

It's nice to watch TV when you have
nothing else to do, isn't it?

Yeah.

-Get over here, you idiot!
-Peter! What the hell?

-I'm still in charge of you! I'm a human!
-Stop it! Get away from me!

This is for your benefit,
so just go limp and take it!

You touch my ass,
I swear to God I'll kill you!

(GRUNTING, SCREAMS)

-(GROWLS)

You're damn right I did!

-(GROWLS)

Wow, where did that come from?
God, that was so intense.

I feel more powerful

Ooh, sorry, ma'am,
we don't valet motorcycles.

Heh. Don't need to.

Lois, can you pour my juice?
I can't lift my arm.

I still can't believe Brian bit you.
It just doesn't seem like him.

Oh, yeah, 'cause you know him so well.
Shut your face.

Oh, uh...

I don't think so.

You guys do karate?
You're both (BLEEP) losers.

(GASPING) Uh, morning, sir.

So, Peter, I assume if you're watching TV,
that means you already did all my chores?

I sure did, sure did.

I scared off the mailman,
threatened Quagmire's cat,

and I even took your bath for you.

Now, I'm just gonna reach for the shampoo.

No jumping out.

STEWIE: (SCREAMS) He's got Rupert!
Hey, drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

All right, I need you to buy
a birthday present for my friend Jeff.

He likes the Packers and surfing.

Enough is enough, Peter.
The dog's not in charge of this house.

First thing tomorrow,
I'm taking Brian to obedience school

so we can get him back under control.

You know, sending him to school
wouldn't be the worst idea.

He might even enjoy it.
I know I had a blast in college.

Man, I love college.
So many chicks, so many parties.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah, totally.

I'm supposed to meet the RA
for coffee later in the common room,

but until then, I'm just gonna walk around
with my shower caddy

and see what people wrote
on their whiteboards.

Uh, before I touch anything,
is this a nut-free counter?

I don't know. My dad's might have been
on there this morning.

Oh, hey, Meg. I saw you stomp
that pigeon today with your bare foot.

Pretty powerful stuff.

Thanks. I don't like losing
any part of my lunch.

Look, I'd love to stay and talk, Neil,
but I have homework,

and there was no toilet paper
in the girls' bathroom.

Well, while you freshen up,
maybe I could help you get a head start

on that homework.

You'd do that? Wow, that'd be great!

Wait, Neil, I thought you and I were
gonna go find unlocked cars

and pretend we're driving them.

Sorry, Chris. Booty calls.

What was that all about?
Well, I guess I have to do it by myself.

Boy, this light is taking forever!

Please, get out.

I never drive this car.
My wife died in it.

Listen up, maggots!
You're in my house now!

Robert Smigel's hand up your backside.

Well, let me tell you something,
comedy dog.

You're here for me to poop on!

All right, first of all,
it seems like you have

a lot of opinions
about a lot of comedians.

Move along. Got to keep the hallway clear.

This isn't because of my divorce.

Good for him.

the handwriting,

to go to a movie sometime?

You know what? I'd like that. It's a date.

Okay, well, I'll, uh, see you later.

Home Ec just got out.
I'm gonna go lick all their bowls.

Hey, Neil.

Oh, hey, Chris.

You sure are spending a lot of time
with my sister lately.

You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd think that fish are ghosts.

And I'd also think
you're putting the moves on Meg.

(SIGHS) Listen, Chris, you're my friend,
so I have to confess.

My sitting with you at lunch

was part of a carefully laid-out plan
to get close to your sister.

-What?
-Look, I know it sounds terrible.

But still,
we've had some good times together.

We even got Sean Penn
to dress up as my dad.

Go away!
I never want to talk to you again!

God, I should have known it.

I feel more betrayed than when I thought
that lawyer was gonna propose.

So you did commit the murder?

Uh-huh.

And you admit it here
in front of everyone?

Uh-huh.

No further questions, Your Honor.

Wait. No further questions?

Who's this puss?

Oh, no, no, no, I'm not a cat.

I'm a dog. I'm your pet.

And I'm just happy to be here.

Brian, what did they
do to you at that school?

You're so submissive.

Yes, looks like someone's gone at him
with a whip.

That is a perfectly valid way
of saying that. Bravo, Master.

Master?

And a surprisingly
quick erection for Stewie.

There you go. You look very dapper, sir.

Thanks, Brian. God, I love the new you.

That obedience school
really schooled you in obedience.

That's why it's called that!

Permission to take fast,
tiny bites of my own tail, sir?

Granted.

You're wearing a bow tie?
What's the occasion?

No occasion, Lois.
I just want to piss a couple of guys off.

What the hell are you doing?

You think you're better than us?

No way you tied that on your own.

That'd be peeing in the house, and that's,
that's bad dog stuff. (STAMMERS)

That's not good dog stuff!

Forgive me for speaking out of turn, sir,

to change me.

It was your turn, wasn't it?
First, I went, and you went?

We best get you to bed, sir.

Oh, come on, Brian.

It's still early. Let's go throw potatoes

Hey, Lois, you noticed ever since
Brian came back from obedience school

that things have been weird?

What do you mean?

Well, he just lets me order him around,

and he never wants
to do fun stuff together like before.

I mean, the thing
I always loved about Brian

was that he wasn't just a pet.
He was a friend. And I miss that friend.

I think we just have to accept that
this is how he is now.

Don't forget, he bit you, Peter.
I mean, what if he bit Stewie?

STEWIE: How about you bite me, bitch?

Wait a minute. You're right! He bit me!

I know what I got to do.

STEWIE: I'm sorry. Was that too harsh?
It sounded more playful in my head.

Don't you see, Brian?

That's the appropriate response
if anyone gets near your anus.

Look, we were wrong to try to change you.
I just want the old you back.

You do? But I was a bad dog.

I know, but that's what
I liked about you, you know?

You were fun,
we got into trouble together, we got...

Uh-oh, uh-oh.
I just rubbed my eye with this finger.

Am I gonna be okay?

Am I gonna be okay?
Wait, how do you get pink eye?

Oh, God, this has got to be it.

That's what I want!

didn't invent those?

No.

Not really. But they invented comedy.

They didn't invent anything.

They just drink and smoke and laugh.

Ha! And we're off.

Well, what can I say about
the man of the hour, Peter Griffin?

Oh, boy, here it comes.

Well, first off,
Peter's always been special.

In high school, he didn't play sports,
but he did wear a helmet.

(CHUCKLES)

All right, that's kind of funny.
Tough, but fair.

You know, Peter, I love your chin,
but I got to ask.

What's it like going through life
with a scrotum so close to your mouth?

You know what, hold on.
I'll just ask your teenage daughter.

That... That's inappropriate.

You know, Peter's
challenging the stereotype

of Irish guys being fat, drunk and stupid
by throwing "a little gay" in there, too.

ALL: Ooh!

Oh, nice, homophobia.

But I got to say,
the worst part of being Peter's friend

is knowing that eventually you're gonna
have to be the fat-ass's pallbearer.

Lift with the legs, right, fellas?

(STUTTERS) People think I'm fat?

But seriously, everyone,
let's have a big round of applause

for the real hero tonight, Peter's chair.

How you holding up, buddy?

Two chair jokes in the same monologue.
Sloppy.

Peter's got a small penis,
but hey, nothing grows in the shade.

"This just in..."

Is what Peter had to say to his wife
on their wedding night

so she knew it was actually happening.

Peter's so ugly,

he couldn't get raped in our holding cell
down at the station.

For those of you who don't know,

we have a real serious problem

you can't hold down a job,

I asked Peter what he got on his SATs.

He said, "Mayonnaise."

Peter's so fat and stupid,
Lamar Odom tried to bang him.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Well, ladies and gentlemen,
now that we've had our fun,

it's time to give our man of the hour
a chance to have his say.

Please put your hands together
for Peter Griffin!

(APPLAUSE)

Okay, yeah, I got something to say.

Screw all you guys!

I hope you all eat turds and die!

None of you bastards
are my friends no more!

(CRYING)

Brian was the worst one.

Family, I have an announcement to make.

Peter, we're eating.

Just tell us what color it was
and be done with it.

On account of my buddies
all being nasty sons of bitches,

I've decided I'm gonna find new friends.

Oh, come on, you're overreacting.
The roast was your idea.

You asked them to make fun of you.

Yeah, but I thought
they'd stick to material

about how I'm too handsome
to work at a brewery,

or how I have tiny little baby sneezes.

(IMITATES BABY SNEEZE)

I'm sure it was all meant in good fun.

Yeah, it was supposed to be fun,
but it was humiliating.

I felt like a premature volcano.

I just think you're a really cool island
and I'd like to get to know...

Oh, God! Oh, I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry, you're just so pretty.

Please, don't tell the other islands.

I've been thinking.

Maybe I got to find friends
who can't make fun of my appearance

'cause they're weird-looking themselves.

Like those two bearded dwarves
walking across the street there.

Hey, will you bearded dwarves
be friends with me?

We, sir, are Italian children. Good day.

Thanks for hanging out with me.

I never thought of my kids' principal
as being a friend.

Well, pal is right there
in the name, Peter.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Hey, it's cool
you got the keys to the school,

and we can hang out
when no one else is here.

What should we do?

Oh, I got a few ideas.

(SLURPING)

Wow, I've never drank
so much milk in my life.

Yeah, it's pretty cool.

What other ideas you got?

How about this second fridge of milk?

Uh, how much milk do you drink?

I just drink milk until somebody stops me.

I don't know.

Maybe I'm just not meant to find
a new group of friends.

Well, Peter, you're always welcome
to hang out with me.

Yeah, but I'm talking
about the kind of friend

that doesn't bark at horses
when I'm watching a movie.

Fine, fine, you want to get trampled
in your living room? Be my guest.

It's just...

I don't know,
I don't seem to fit in anywhere.

(SIGHS) All right,
I'm gonna go get some more coffee

and maybe a gross microwaved sandwich.

Excuse me. Can I please
have another no-foam latte?

Uh, yeah, sure.
But, you know, I don't work here.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You look just like one of the baristas.

He doesn't look that much like me.

BARISTA: I think she meant me.

Oh. Oh, yeah. I could see that.

Hey, we should make out.

You got it, mister.

(CHUCKLES) Double-foam, am I right?

(LAUGHS) You're funny.

Yeah. Oh, my God, you're so twisted.

I'm Jamie, and this is Becca and Karen.
You want to join us?

Sure.

Great. We were just debating

if Jamie should hook up with this guy
she met a few nights ago.

Okay, I want the deets, like, yesterday.

What the hell? Did I just say that?

You sure did. You're a natural at this.

What is "this"?

It's what we do!

(WHOOPING)

Wow, you know, I know I just met you guys.

But I've kind of been looking
for a new group of friends.

Do you maybe have room for one more?

Are you good at talking
about how busy you are?

Because that's a lot of what this is.

Ugh, yeah, but don't talk to me about
anything until I've had my morning coffee,

'cause it's like I can't even deal.

Well, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

we'd love to have you
in our group of girlfriends.

Oh, my God, that's awesome!

Hey, can I be the one who laugh-screams
really loud at restaurants?

As long as you're picking up the check.

(LAUGH-SCREAMS)

Oh, we're gonna ruin
so many people's evenings!

Oh, boy, I'm blending right in
with you gals.

Like a panda bear
on a bed full of pillows.

I'm hiding from the zoo.
They want me to have a baby.

I don't want to have a baby!

Hey, isn't it funny that you guys
came over for a dinner party,

and all we're doing is standing
in the kitchen, drinking wine?

All our toothbrushes were in
that one woman's glass this morning.

Ah, girls, it is so nice
to be part of a group again.

And I'm having the best time.

Especially yesterday
when we all got mammograms.

If I have cancer,
we're all going to Brazil.

So what's for dinner?
You said we were having Italian?

Yeah, and then I realized
I'm not good at making fettuccine alfredo,

but I am good at making reservations.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Do you get it? Oh, God, I'm so bad.

Stewie, it's time for your bath.

Oh, what's going on in here?

Oh, hey, Lois. Hey, these are
my new friends, Jamie, Karen and Becca.

Karen's the one with the mommy blog,

so if you think you know her
from somewhere, that's where.

Oh, nice to meet you all.

Would you like to join us for dinner?

Oh, no, I don't want to get in the way.

Besides,
I got to get this little man in the tub.

Great. Now they're all
picturing my wiener.

Oh, thank God. For a second,
I thought she was gonna come with us.

What?

Seriously, Peter,
how do you live with her?

I know, that voice. Ugh!

And what is that hair color?
Creamy French Dressing?

(LAUGHING)

JAMIE: Oh, I love it. I love it.

(CHUCKLES WEAKLY)
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, if you think that's funny

she once had a miscarriage
outside a Petco.

I still have the security
camera footage somewhere.

(LAUGHING)

Peter, I'm your conscience,
Jiminy Cricket.

Ahhh! Bug!

Andrea, you set a place for Jiminy again.

Oh. So I did.

Why? Why did he have to go around
telling strangers what to do?

Wasn't being a pediatric oncologist
enough for him?

(SOBBING)

He hit on me at your wedding.

Ah, let's see, what else? What else?
What else? Oh, I got one. I got one.

Lois tried to give CPR to a kid
at a wedding once,

and when she knelt down, she accidentally
high-heeled her own stink hole.

Peter, your wife is such a pig.

Oh, I don't know about that, Jamie.

Pigs eat slop, Lois only cooks it.

(LAUGHING)

What the hell?
Peter, can I speak with you for a second?

Oh, hang on, guys,
I got to talk to my dog.

What the hell are you doing?
I'm just gabbing with the girls.

You know our cycles have lined up?
Mine's from wiping too hard.

You're saying horrible things about Lois.

Oh, yeah, it cracks up the ladies.

Yesterday, Karen laughed so hard
she popped a button on her jeans.

And then she cried.

Peter, Lois is your wife.
You should be defending her,

not talking trash
and gossiping behind her back

like some kind of Midwestern teenager.

(IN MIDWESTERN ACCENT)
Did you gals hear about Ally Gallagher?

She let Allan Ackerman smack her
in the back with his tally whacker

-behind the snack shack.
-What?

Nobody here in Maryland
understands a single word you're saying.

You should move back to Minnesota.

I can't go back. I Snapchatted
Matt Gackerack a Kodak of my ass crack.

Hey, Lois? I did something bad
I need to tell you about.

Peter, I know.

You used some of my magazines
for your fake ransom notes. It's okay.

No, no, no, no, that's not it.

But did you put the ice cream
where the guy said?

Because he will hurt your family.

Look, the thing is,
me and my new girlfriends,

we've kind of been talking trash about you
and laughing behind your back.

Peter, of course your new friends have
been talking crap about me.

That's what women do.

What? So you're not mad?

Well, I'm not thrilled, but I understand
what it's like to be friends with women.

I'm sure they talk trash
about you behind your back.

They most certainly do not!

I guarantee you

that as soon as you leave the room,
they tear you to shreds.

That's not true.
If it was, I would've figured it out.

Just like I figured out
who was stealing my lunch at work.

Next time there's a sandwich
in the fridge with somebody's name on it,

don't eat it, scumbag!

Please, you don't understand!

Oh, I understand.

That lunch didn't have your name on it,
but this bullet does.

My name is Peter, too!

Ugh, have you guys seen
the new Jessica Biel movie?

I don't get what men see in her.

Um, her dumper?

I just think she's really plain-looking.
She kind of annoys me.

You know who's really beautiful?
Joan Allen.

-Yes!
-Uh, stunning.

Yeah, uh, I think, um,
I'm maybe gonna go use the restroom

and let you guys talk about
whatever you're gonna talk about.

Huh, I guess Peter
made it to the bathroom,

'cause I can't feel him walking anymore.

I know. "Fee-fi-fo-fum!" Right?

(LAUGHING)

And what about those drugstore glasses?

These aren't drugstore glasses,

they came from a doctor Halloween costume.

(SIGHS)

Lois was right.
They are making fun of me behind my back.

They're like a nasty wolf pack.

Hey, man, just a heads-up
instead of howling at the moon tonight,

we're all gonna yell "cock-a-doodle-doo!"

Really? That seems weird.

I'm just trying to make sure
you don't look silly.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!

(LAUGHING)

-What an idiot!
-He actually believed me!

That's what a rooster says, not a wolf!

(GROWLS)

Hi, Daddy! How was howling at the moon?

Shut up! Why aren't you asleep?
Why isn't he asleep?

Leave him alone!
Have you been drinking again, Phil?

That's none of your business!
I never wanted a cub!

Get out! Get out now
and don't ever come back!

Hey, buddy, want to get high?

Oh, my God. Phil?

Hey... Robert.

Wow. Uh...

Hey, listen, man...

Cock-a-doodle-doo!

(LAUGHING)

(SOBBING)

<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo </i>is a passion project
I'd been mulling over for years,

and when <i>Family Guy</i>
gave me the opportunity to shoot it,

I knew there was only one actor
who could portray Phil, the Wolf.

Glenn Quagmire.

Peter gave me a beer that tasted funny,
and when I woke up,

I was wearing lipstick and a wolf suit.

Lois, you were right.
Those women were talking about me.

Oh, dear. What did they say?

I don't even remember,
there was such a long cutaway,

but I know it was really mean.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Peter.

So what do I do now?

Confront them face-to-face
and explain why I'm angry?

Of course not.

Being friends with women
is way more complex than that.

You need to be more underhanded
and vicious.

You and I will get revenge
on those bitches, lady-style.

Really? We'll do it together?

Yeah, it'll be fun. Like when we watched
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> together.

Now, which Cylon is that?

Ah, I don't know. I think it's Number Six.

Wait, is that the same Number Six
that had sex with Dr. Baltar?

I've been watching this the same exact
amount of time you have, Lois.

I don't know anything you don't.

Oh, what does that green button
on the far panel do?

How in God's name would I know that?
I don't know!

It's green,
so it probably makes something go.

PETER ON PHONE: <i>Hello?</i>

Peter, where are you?
I thought we were gonna go after Becca.

<i>Way ahead of you, Lois.</i>
<i>I just cut her brakes.</i>

What? Don't you think
that's a little dangerous?

<i>Hey, you're the one who said</i>
<i>we should try to ruin her marriage.</i>

<i>She bangs up her car,</i>
<i>her husband's gonna be furious.</i>

-(HORNS HONKING)
-What was that?

<i>Oh, I just ran a red light.</i>
<i>My car won't slow down for some reason.</i>

<i>Anyway, this is gonna be awesome.</i>
<i>Geez, I'm going, like, 95.</i>

Peter, are you sure
you didn't cut your brakes?

<i>That's ridiculous.</i>
<i>Why would I cut my own...</i>

<i>-Kids, get out of the way! I can't stop!</i>
-(TIRES SQUEALING)

-(HORNS HONKING)
-(KIDS SCREAMING)

All right, Peter, next is Jamie.

Now, what's the most important thing
in her life?

Oh, that's easy.
Her daughter Emily is a competitive diver.

The whole family's dream is that she
gets a spot on the US Olympic Team.

Okay, so get a lead pipe
and bust this girl's kneecaps.

No, no, no, Lois.
That's not how we're gonna do this.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(SINGING) <i>Out on the streets,</i>
<i>that's where we'll meet</i>

<i>You make the night,</i>
<i>I always cross the line</i>

<i>Tightened our belts, abused ourselves</i>

<i>Get in our way,</i>
<i>we'll</i><i>put you on your shelf</i>

(INAUDIBLE)

<i>Round and round</i>

<i>With love we'll find a way</i>
<i>just give it time</i>

<i>Round and round</i>

<i>What comes around goes around</i>

<i>I'll tell you why</i>

<i>Yeah</i>

(APPLAUSE)

(CRYING)

That's how we're gonna do this.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(LAUGHS)

Okay, next is Karen.

Now, she's been planning
her daughter's wedding for a year.

If it doesn't go perfectly,
she'll be crushed.

Already on it, Lois.
I bribed one of the busboys.

He has a little surprise planned for her.

-(MAN 1 SCREAMS)
-MAN 2: Oh, my God!

Somebody stabbed the groom!

(ALL SCREAMING)

(SOBBING)

Oh, no, it's not a perfect day.

Well, we got those bitches good,
huh, Peter?

Yeah, thanks, Lois. And you were right.

Being friends with women is way too
complicated and way too intense for me.

Now let me just pay the busboy
and we can get out of here.

Ahhh!
I knew he didn't understand the plan!

-Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey, Peter.

Look, I'm real sorry
I got so worked up at my roast.

And if you're willing, I'd like
to be friends with you guys again.

Because men might punch you in the gut
and call you a fat idiot,

but at least they do it to your face
and own it.

You were mad at us?

Yeah, we ain't spoke in a week.

I thought you were out of town.

People come, people go.
I didn't give no mind.

So we're friends again?

We were never not friends, you idiot.

I love you guys. Guys are the best.

Not women.

Hey, guys. I got something for you,

an invitation for each of you to Quagfest.

-Quagfest?
-What's that?

"You and a guest are cordially invited

"to witness Glenn Quagmire's
1,000th sexual conquest at Quagfest,

"a three-day festival
celebrating the three 'F's,

"food, fun, and..." Oh, my.

Yeah, they almost
wouldn't print that at Kinko's.

Damn, 1,000 women?

Well, 1,000 sexual conquests.

No further questions.

-Sounds like fun, Glenn!
-Yeah, I'm closing down the whole street.

It's gonna be like a block party

but with way more weirdos
grinding up against your wives.

That sounds awesome!

There hasn't been
that kind of excitement on our street

since we had that big dumpster
in our front yard.

Can someone take out the garbage?

I will!

(FOOTSTEPS RUNNING UPSTAIRS)

PETER: Yeah!
Yeah! Smash! Boom!

Someone stop him.

Last time,
he threw out a whole bedroom.

STEWIE: I'm still in here!

Oh, big dumpster.

That reminds me,
Ice-T's wife is also coming to Quagfest.

TOM: And in local news,

Hollywood comes to Quahog, almost,

as three hours from here
in Waterbury, Connecticut,

Liam Neeson has begun
shooting his latest film.

His new project
is reportedly an historical epic,

in which Mr. Neeson stars
as a vengeance-crazed Albert Einstein.

Channel Five News
has this exclusive first look

that I taped off my VCR from
<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

All right,
I'll give you the formula.

My foot equals
your balls squared.

(GROANS)

(SCOFFS) Liam Neeson.
What a fraud.

Come on, Peter.
Not this again.

What? He's a fake tough guy.
I could totally kick his ass.

Knock it off. We've had to hear
this same speech a million times.

Yeah, every time you get
a couple of beers in you,

we have to hear all about
how you can beat up Liam Neeson.

-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

What about that time
we snuck beers into the opera?

(SINGING OPERA)

(PETER GULPS)

(PETER GULPS)

I could totally beat up Liam Neeson.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

Hey, you know this old woman
who lived in a shoe,

she had so many children,
she didn't know what to do?

I got something she could do.

Get your tubes tied, you kook!

Hey, how you doing on that chocolate milk?
You need a little freshen-up?

There's my little sweetie.

Are you ready to go home, Stewie?

Lois, I'm glad you're here.

I noticed that you're one of the moms

who hasn't yet signed up
to be a classroom volunteer.

Oh. I just assumed after that incident

in the parking lot
with that bitch in the Lexus,

you wouldn't want me to.

But, yeah, I'd be happy
to help out in the class.

What? I don't want you here.
This is my turf.

I don't bother you when
you're sitting on the washing machine,

screaming Aaron Eckhart's name.

Great! We'd love to have
you start tomorrow, if you're free.

Sure, let me just
check my schedule.

-(PHONE BEEPS)
-Hmm.

I guess I could just
get the mail at night.

(CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Wow. Quagfest is a bigger deal
than I thought.

Oh, look, here's a simulation of
what it's like to have sex with Quagmire.

Hi.

Bye!

(BAND PLAYING MARCH)

All right, kids,
now pay attention, all right?

These are all of Quagmire's women
organized by country.

There's Brazil.

There's Italy.

And there's Thailand. Wow.

Wow. They're young. We should go.

I'd like to thank you all
for coming to Quagfest.

Now, no celebration of my 1,000th
would be complete

without first meeting number one.

Here she is, all the way
from Weathersfield Elementary School,

Miss Eleanor!

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Do I still get a piece of candy after?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Nice lady.

All right, we've met number one.
Now let's meet number 1,000!

Ladies and gentlemen,
my 1,000th sexual conquest is

this largemouth bass!

Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

I'm weird.

I thought I was here to watch normal
intercourse on a residential street.

Children, we're leaving!

This'll be so fun
volunteering in your class, Stewie.

Eat my button, you whore.

Lois, I'm so glad you're here.

I gotta run out to the parking lot.

I'm buying cigarettes
from some guy on Craigslist.

Go ahead. I'll handle the kids.

(CRYING)

Oh, Landon, what's the matter?

Did you spill juice on yourself,
sweetheart?

"Sweetheart"?
Slow your roll there, Cougar Town.

Well, let's get you cleaned up.

And you know what?

For today, you can be
my little helper.

What the hell?

If anyone should be her helper,
it should be me.

She's my mother.
We're supposed to be a team.

Like the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

Well, Tonto,
the bad guys are going to jail.

Looks like this little town is safe again.

Yes, <i>Kemosabe.</i>

So, what do you say?
Want to grab a drink, maybe dinner?

Sorry. Me no like
to hang with work people.

(HORSE NEIGHS)

Well, I gotta hand it to you, Quagmire.

That Quagfest was some party.

Yeah, except I got molested
in the House of Mirrors

by either one man
or 100 identical men.

Could've used a heads-up on that one.

Yeah, I'll tell you
who might want a heads-up.

Liam Neeson.

For God's sake!

'Cause someday,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

Damn it, Peter, I'm sick of this!

-I've had it!
-Me, too.

I mean, we just had
a great day of fun

and rides and finger-sniffing,

and all you can talk about is fighting
some guy you've never even met!

Yeah, he's lucky we've never met.

I'd knock his teeth down his throat

and out his stupid
Irish fudge knot.

You know what?
You're full of it.

If you were ever face-to-face
with Liam Neeson, you'd crap your pants.

No, I wouldn't.

Well, fine. Let's prove it.

Put up or shut up. Right now.

What? What are you talking about?

Well, we know where Liam Neeson is.

That's right!
He's shooting a movie in Connecticut!

We could be there in three hours.

All right, great.
Liam Neeson has three more hours to live.

Let's do this.

-All right!
-Yeah!

I've never been to Connecticut!

Hang on, fellas.

I actually have
been to Connecticut one time.

To meet Loretta
at a McDonald's parking lot

to pick up my son, Cleveland Jr.

I cried in my sedan,
in front of my boy.

It was sad.

That's why I fibbed on it.

I'm sorry. Can we do a happy yell again
to get the taste out of my mouth?

-All right!
-Yeah!

I've been to Connecticut!

All right, Peter, Liam Neeson must be
on the other side of that barrier.

We just gotta get you on that set,
so you can kick his ass.

We're so close.
I can almost taste his ass.

-Can I help you?
-Hello, sir.

We're here to see Liam Neeson,

the guy who wears
the same long jacket in all his movies.

Sorry, this is a closed set.

Peter, you're never gonna get
close enough to Liam Neeson

to throw a punch at the guy.

That's why I gotta lure him out here
to come to me.

Remember, Liam Neeson's Irish.

That's why I'm dressing up
as the one woman no Irishman can resist.

Mrs. Potato Head.

(IN HIGH VOICE) Ooh!
Mrs. Potato Head here!

Any Irish actors around
who might be interested in me?

You're damn right, darlin'.

Colin Farrell?
What are you doing here?

Shoo! Shoo! Get away!

(LAUGHS) You're a feisty potato.

The back is all mashed potatoes now.

Okay, guys, there's no better way
to draw out an Irishman

than setting up a confession booth.

LIAM: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

It has been one day
since my last confession.

Go on, my son.

I killed 200 wolves.

After the movie, I got the taste for it.

Did you kill them quickly?

No. Wolves must be tortured.

The best way to kill wolves
is to kill their leader,

wear his skin,
kiss some of the wolves, then kill them.

I also steal small items from 7-Eleven.

SweeTARTS, Jolly Ranchers, and the like.

Sometimes a lighter.

I don't even smoke.

Sometimes I roll up
those tattoo magazines,

stuff 'em up my sleeve.

If I get caught,
I just tell the man I forgot.

Then, of course,
it's back to murdering wolves.

All right.

That'll be three Hail Marys.

LIAM: Tough but fair.

Thank you, Father.

Hey, not so fast!

Excuse me, sir.
We were sent here by the production.

Are you the guy
who's been looking for Liam Neeson?

-I am.
-Do you mind if we ask what for?

Yeah, I was hoping
to inflict violence upon him.

All right, you're coming with us.

Don't worry, Peter!

We'll raise your bail money
as soon as we can!

Excuse me, sir.
My phone's not working.

Do you mind if I follow you home
and use yours?

All right, kids,
Miss Tammy's in her car

yelling at her boyfriend
on the phone again,

so it looks like I'm doing lunch.

Okay, Landon,
time to sabotage you

with the most dangerous thing
in the world for a toddler,

a whole, uncut grape.

God, look how fat kids are getting.

Landon, no! Uh-uh.
You could choke on that!

Did your mommy forget
to slice your grapes for you?

Here, let me help.

There's nothing to cut these with.

That's it, Landon!

If you're gonna seduce my mother,
then I shall seduce yours.

I'll be as irresistible to her
as wood is to a woodchuck.

Mom, Dad, I've done a lot of thinking,

and I've decided I don't want
to go into the family business.

I want to be a doctor.

Hmm. Let's try that on for size.

How much disease
could a woodchuck doctor cure

if a woodchuck doctor could cure disease?

Is that sounding right to you?

No.

-Hey, Jimmy?
-Yeah, Dad?

Next time, if you have an idea,

run it through the test
before you embarrass yourself.

(CELL DOOR BUZZES)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Wake up, Griffin.
Your bail's been posted.

What time is it?

I did.

Oh. Sorry. I thought
you were gonna ask something else.

Liam Neeson? You posted my bail?

That's right.

I hear you've been all over town
saying you could kick my arse.

Well, there's no time like the present.

Go ahead, take your best shot.

No, no, no, Mr. Neeson, you heard wrong.

There's nobody who respects you
more than I do.

May I offer you
the most sincere, honest apology? I...

Ya-ha! Ow! Argh!

Damn it!
My hands are stinging from the vibrations!

My turn.

(SCREAMS)

NARRATOR:
<i>Will Liam Neeson punch Peter?</i>

<i>Will Stewie stop being jealous</i>

<i>Stay tuned for</i>
<i>the thrilling conclusion of this story,</i>

<i>and the just-regular conclusion</i>
<i>of the other story.</i>

Oh, please don't hurt me!

I was just trying to seem tough
in front of my friends!

Well, you're in trouble now, lad.

I've been a world-famous tough guy
since I was 55.

Please, please, I'll do anything!

Anything you want, just don't kill me!

What could you possibly do for me?

I'll shine your shoes,
or scrub your toilets!

Or coil your penis!

The Internet tells me that's
something you might have a need for.

Hmm.

Well, that could save me
some time in the morning.

Well, whatever it takes
for you to not beat me up.

All right, it's a deal.
You can help me with some chores.

But one slip-up,

and you'll be deader than the first man

to die in the Battle of the Boyne.

(ALL YELLING)

(CHOKING)

Normally when we do those,
there's, like, a joke.

I'm not your clown.

All right, Landon,

let's see how you like it
when someone moves in on your territory.

Let's just say your mom's about to see
a diaper rash-y scrotum.

Wow! I didn't know
Landon had a younger sister.

Oh, hi. Aren't you a cutie.

Oh, my God,
this is gonna happen.

Okay, go run along
with your teacher.

Time for me to go.

Wait, wait, don't leave!

Ow! My knee!

(SOBBING)

Oh, sweetie,
did you get a boo-boo?

Here, let me kiss it
and make it better.

Mwah!

Okay, that's more like it.

I certainly hope no one sees
Landon's mom bobbing for Stew.

Yeah, get in there.

Damn it, she's not watching.
You keep going, though.

Don't forget about
the underneath part of my knee.

Okay, Peter,
I've got a list of chores here.

Um, first, I've been summoned
to be a potential juror,

but I don't want to go,

so I need you to report in my name.

Prospective juror number 17,
the defendant is a Kraken.

Would you have any problem
convicting a Kraken?

I would try to be fair,

but I am on record, you know,
very famously,

as having released a Kraken.

Your Honor, we'd like to thank
and excuse juror number 17.

Hey, man, thanks.

Yeah, good luck, man.

Okay, I have another
important job for you.

I want you to take over my Twitter feed
and tweet back to my fans.

(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

-(HITS ENTER)
-(TWITTER ALERT SOUNDS)

See? Like that.

You get the gist
of what my Twitter is about.

Peter, I was at
an outdoor mall today,

and there was a kiosk
selling little remote control cars.

One of them
drove right up to me. (CHUCKLES)

It was very funny and enjoyable,

so what I need you to do
is to go to a local gym

and ask men to pee in your hands.

I... I don't see the connection there.

Do I need to repeat myself?

The car came right up to me.

It did spins and had flashing lights.

I enjoyed it.

Go to the gym,
kneel down in the shower,

and ask strange men to pee
in your cupped hands.

(SIGHS)

Hey, man, did Liam Neeson send you?

(LAUGHS)

Yeah, he loves them little cars.

All right, guys, how are we doing
on Peter's bail money?

I got my whole family praying on it.

Well, that's very helpful.
How about you, Joe?

Bonnie won't let me spend
any more money on Peter

because he's not very nice to me.

Hey, guys.

What the hell?
You're out of jail! How'd you get out?

With my smooth talk... My...

I used... I... My...
Word... My... I words... I used words.

Well, glad you're back.

So, you ready to admit
you're never gonna kick Liam Neeson's ass?

It just so happens, Joe,
that I already did.

You what?

If you beat up Liam Neeson,
how come it wasn't in the papers?

You know, he's a big star.
He had the whole thing covered up.

Everybody knows
Irish Catholics control the media.

(PHONE VIBRATING)

Oh! Oh... Oh...

Chris was shot at school.

If it's not one thing, it's another.

You know what?
I've thought about it.

Do what you want with Landon.

Just don't do it
in front of me, all right?

Hi, Landon.
How are you today, cutie?

(YELLS)

What did I just tell you?

I hate this! I hate you!
I hate everything!

(SOBBING)

Oh, Stewie, you're upset.

Are... Are you jealous?

Yes! You've destroyed us!

Were you at least safe?

Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

You'll always be my favorite little boy.

I will?

And besides,
my week as a helper mommy is done now,

so when you come home today,
you'll have me all to yourself.

Oh. Okay.

(SNIFFS)

Hey, you hear that, Landon?

That's how you keep
your bitch in line.

So, you know,
Jar Jar wasn't there the whole time.

It was just a green screen.

Yes, I heard you say that earlier.

-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-GLENN: Peter?

Quagmire? Cleveland?

And me. I'm here, too.

What are you doing here?

Well, you were acting weird,
so we followed you.

We want to know what's going on.

Well, how'd you guys get on the set?

I bit the security
guard in the nards.

I don't like to do it a lot,
but you're my friend, Peter.

Who are these two idiots?

JOE: Three. Three idiots. Big fan.

And what's up with Liam Neeson?
You said you kicked his ass.

(SIGHS)

Look, you guys, I lied about that.

What?

I acted like such a big man,
and I didn't want to admit I was a coward.

I was too scared to fight Liam Neeson.

That's why
he's my big, fat houseboy now.

Now, Peter, I'm out of crackers,
and I'm gluten-free,

so what I need you to do

is go to a local gym
and ask men to pee in your hands.

What the hell?

Come on,
what are you waiting for, Griffin?

No, Liam, I'm not doing
your stupid chores anymore.

And there's something else
I gotta tell you.

Your story thread
in <i>Love Actually</i> is the second worst.

You better take that back.

No way your son would learn the drums
in that amount of time.

Oh, that tears it!

(GROANS)

Ah!

(PANTING)

Oh!

(GRUNTS)

JOE: Hey, Peter, you're up there now?
Who's winning?

(COUGHS)

(WHIMPERS)

(GROANS)

-(CRACKING)
-Argh!

(CRACKING)

(SCREAMS)

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to get a free, movie-set haircut.

Damn it!

I was stupid to think
I could beat up Liam Neeson.

You guys must
think I'm pathetic.

Are you kidding?
You took on the star of <i>Kinsey!</i>

Yeah, and more importantly,

you followed through
on your drunken ravings.

Wow. I guess you're right.
Thanks, guys.

You know, I guess the lesson here
is Oskar Schindler wasn't real.

And neither was anything in that movie.

I... I don't think that's the lesson.

Randy Jackson was just a big sea turtle
in human clothes, we heard.

No, we all just
booked a vacation together

to a private resort in the Bahamas.

Well, that's a lot of my money,

but I used to have sex with you,
so that's the trade-off.

Look, it's not as expensive as it sounds.

We found a great group rate
on a discount website.

Wow, the Bahamas.
I can't wait to get down there

and dip my fingers in the water.

Yeah, it'll be awesome
to nail a hotel masseuse

and then watch <i>Nanny McPhee</i> in the room.
So, when do we leave?

Oh. Sorry, Glenn.

The deal was for couples only.
I'm afraid you can't come.

All right, fine. Since you'll all be gone,

I'll just walk around my yard naked,
pee anywhere I want. I don't care.

I think it's great that Peter and Lois
are getting away together.

Yeah, I think Dad's actually
kind of excited about it.

Yes, very. He even bought
some sort of language tapes,

although I don't think
he's using them properly.

Yeah, but how come
Babs couldn't come?

Oh, she wanted to be here, but she got
hired to be the stuffy old woman

Hey, guys. Say, Lois, I know you said
this trip was couples only,

but great news. We're now a couple!

Oh. Who's this?

This is Kimmie. I met her
in a pop-up window on the internet.

She was in my area.

-Hi. Peter Griffin, all but separated.
-Oh, right on.

All right. Well, I suppose
I could look into

adding you two to the reservation.

Yeah, you guys should definitely come.

Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

Relax, Peter. I haven't
seen you this excited

since you got that letter sent
by carrier owl.

Oh, my God.
Is this my acceptance to Hogwarts?

No. It's a letter asking you
to stop throwing rocks at my nest.

You hit one of my kids,
and now he can't fly right.

Well, fine.
Then I'll just throw rocks at the hornets.

Something about black people wearing

We have a special beach barbecue

please enjoy all our amenities.

We will.

Come on, girls, let's go wear big,
floppy sun hats in the pool

and then be mad when they get wet.

Yeah. I'm gonna hit
the pool soon, myself.

Gotta let the lifeguard know
he better keep an eye on me.

I'm here a whole week, pal.

Hey, I just made black coffee
in an old tin pan.

Who wants some? No one?

What's wrong with you people?
Dick Fosbury won an Olympics on this.

Well, say, this is pretty neat.

I brought you kids an old seed packet
I found in my garage.

I know what you got
your fingers crossed for

and yes, they're persimmons.

All right, that's it!

Damn it.
I tried two things that all kids love,

coffee and old seed packets.

And all any of you can do
is stare at those Game Boy machines!

I'm sick of it! In fact,
for the rest of the week, no more screens.

I'm locking those things up.

Wait, you what?

Oh, come on, what the hell?

Oh, but what...

That's right,
I'm gonna show you kids

how to have fun
the old-fashioned way,

like I did when I was a kid.

But I can't live without my laptop.

How else am I supposed to get my degree
from the University of Phoenix?

Credit card information.
And submit. And I'm a lawyer.

We find the defendant
guilty of murder. Sorry.

Oh, hey, you guys.

Uh, Quagmire, I don't think
you can go to dinner in your swimsuit.

And what the hell happened to you?

Oh, Kimmie and I fell asleep on the beach.

Yeah, I think you better change.

Okay, we'll be down in a minute.

Welcome, everyone.
I hope you enjoyed your afternoon,

but now it's time to get to work.

On the rippin' and the tearin'?

Even better.
We're going to work on your relationships.

After all, this isn't just a vacation,
it's a couples counseling retreat.

Oh, what the hell?

Sorry, Peter. We had to trick you guys
or you wouldn't have come.

No. You can't make me.
I'll get hit with a coconut,

so I lose my memory of this.

(GRUNTS)

I remember everything!
I was abused by my dad!

Lois, I can't believe you tricked us into
coming on a couples counseling retreat.

I do not like being lied to!

Me neither. I mean, wives conspiring
against their husbands.

What's next, huh? Freakin' Cheney
back in the White House? (EXCLAIMS)

Hmm, that didn't link up.

Trust me, you won't regret this.

I'll see you all in the morning
for our first session.

Sheesh, couples counseling?

This is the worst thing that's
ever happened to anyone.

Wives, huh? He gets it.

Hey there, buckaroos!
Who's ready for some old-timey fun?

I thought we could go down to the old
swimmin' hole and swim in a hole.

-Ugh.
-That sounds lame.

Whose hole is it? I'm potentially in.

Grandpa, can I just have
my video games back?

I want to play <i>Call of Duty.</i>

Oh, I've got the
original <i>Call of Duty</i> right here.

It's called jacks.

Got one! Will I get two?
Come get in on this.

Wait, this game is cleaning up toys?

Carter, read the room.
They're not into it.

All right, fair enough.

I just don't want you kids sitting
around here, glued to your screens.

So let's get the blood pumping
with my Jack LaLanne record.

(MUSIC ENDS)

Okay, good workout.
I gotta go call somebody and hang up.

All right. Our first counseling exercise
will be speaking to each other

with "I feel" statements.

-Lois, please begin.
-(SIGHS)

I feel unappreciated,
like you don't want to spend time with me.

Okay. I feel a numbness
radiating down my left arm.

I feel like you should help out more
around the house.

I feel like salty and sweet.
You got white chocolate French fries?

I feel like my cervix hurts.

I feel pride.

Okay. For our next exercise,
let's play The Oldlywed Game. (CHUCKLES)

Relax, it's just a questionnaire.

(LAUGHS)

-Really?
-Whatever. I like liking things.

Peter, when is Lois's birthday?

Uh, let's see.
When is Hitler's birthday?

April 20th.

Wow. Okay, Noel. Yikes.

Joe, what is Bonnie's favorite food?

Well, she must like ground glass,
because I keep finding it in my food.

-Cleveland.
-Pass.

Quagmire, what color are Kimmie's eyes?

Shaved. Sorry, what... What is it?
What's the question?

Okay. Last night
I did some personality assessments

based on yesterday's session,

and what I found was
none of you couples

are compatible with each other at all.

No, no, no, that's not a good thing.

But, interestingly,
you have high compatibility

with other people in this group.

Oh, my God. That is crazy!

More mac and cheese.
Here, just keep it going.

Keep it going.
Don't be afraid of the burned edges.

Just give me the tray.
Wait, so what happened?

Anyway, I'd like to do an exercise.

Just for the morning, you'll all be paired
with your more compatible match.

And hopefully, you'll bring some lessons
back from that experience,

into your marriages.

Okay. So the new couple pairings
are as follows.

Cleveland and Lois.

Oh, cool!
My FICO score just went up 100 points.

Quagmire and Bonnie.
Joe and Donna. And Peter and Kimmie.

Yay! I win couples counseling!

(SCOFFS)

Look at those hairless shins.
They're magnificent.

Decades of black dress socks
have rendered them smooth and mirror-like.

Grandpa, what are we
even doing out here?

Looking for shapes in the clouds.

That one looks like the
<i>Thompson Throat Lozenge</i> girl. See?

She's got the boater on and everything!

I'm bored.
Can't we do something else?

Well, back when I was your age,

there was nothing better
than knocking on doors

and throwing paper bags
full of flour at people.

That's a thing?

What, flour facin'? It's the best thing!

We used it to keep Italians
from going to the polls.

Stay home today, Guido!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Yay! Old-fashioned things are the best!

So, this is the second vacation
that I've watched every <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

Peter, you're awesome.
You're so funny.

Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay you $1,000
for one whole handful of your butt.

For two handfuls, I'll give you my car.

All right, that's enough!
I have had it, Peter!

So, how are the new pairings working out?

Are you all gaining lots of insights?

No! I can see now
that coming here was a huge mistake!

You're hopeless, Peter!

Your feet look old.

This retreat is over!
Fire up the boat. We're going home!

Mrs. Griffin, please.

-(GRUNTS)
-I urge you to finish the program.

No, thank you. I never should've
come here. Or, at least, not with him.

Is there anything I can do to change...

(GUNS FIRING)

(ALL GASP)

Oh, my God!

We're taking this island back.

Yeah! Kill the whites!
Race war!

(GRUNTS)

Run! Everybody run!

(GASPS) What the hell is happening?

Somebody do something!

(AIRPLANE PASSING BY)

Look! We gotta get
the attention of that plane!

You gotta help us!

Man, those natives are pissed.
This is like a full-blown revolution!

Do you think me throwing full sodas

into the garbage had
anything to do with this?

(GUNS FIRING)

Quick! Into the jungle!

What are we gonna do?

Wait a minute.
Yesterday, near the north beach,

I saw a small landing strip, giggity.

It might be our best chance
to get off, giggity, the island.

Did you really see that,
or was it just an excuse to say "giggity"?

I don't know, baby. I'm crazy
with the heat. Take your pants off.

Oh, my God, this is legit ridic.
I gotta post this.

(CHUCKLES) Josh Radnor's
Twitter feed is so funny!

That's impossible.

Coming here was a bad idea.

Like when I brought museum behavior
into my home.

I gotta say, Carter,
you've done a good job.

We'd become slaves to our electronics.

But you know what we're doing here?
We're reclaiming our lives.

You're kind of an egghead,
aren't you, Brian?

(IMITATES AIRPLANE ENGINE)
Everyone on this plane is wearing a suit.

Say, that reminds me.
Everyone, time to dress for dinner.

Ooh, I want to light the candles, Pop-Pop!

Oh, boy. I haven't had this much fun
since I played with that Buble wrap.

MAN:

This is a very skeevy packing product.

Oh, my God. This is bad.

I know. If we die,
what's gonna happen to my mail?

-What?
-I'm just saying,

how's the post office supposed to know?

And my DVR!
It'll be full in a week!

I record <i>Ellen</i> every day! I know
I shouldn't, but whenever she dances,

I'm like, "Go ahead, girl,
it's your world!"

(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I heard she gay.

Well, it seems like
we're pretty talked out.

Thanks for changing your mind
about drowning me in that river.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Hey. Did you see those pictures
of me doing duck lips by a pool?

I don't know, some island.

-Shh.
-(GUNS COCKING)

You rebel scum!

(CHUCKLES)

Ah, you're too young.
You don't know.

So, how did you guys get captured?

Quagmire screams when he urinates.
How about you?

Cleveland kept stopping
to scratch his back on trees.

Lois don't do it right.

Come here, baby.
You need them Lee Press-Ons.

Mmm. There it is. Mmm.

-(PETER GRUNTS)
-(KIMMIE YELPS)

Oh, Peter!
I was so worried about you.

Lois, when we got captured, I said,

"You rebel scum,"
and Kimmie didn't get it.

(CHUCKLES) That's funny!
From the <i>Star Wars!</i>

Well, just <i>Star Wars.</i>
But I missed you, sweetheart!

Why are you doing this?
Let us go!

Every year we have to deal
with you American tourists!

Stuffing your slob faces,
taking video you'll never watch,

and asking if I'm
the <i>Captain Phillips</i> guy. I'm not!

Take the couples out,
two by two, and execute them.

Oh, my God!

Well, at least
I ain't going out with a itchy back.

(GUNS FIRING)

Oh, no! This is terrible!

Now, now.
Maybe they just shot Donna twice.

Bonnie, quick, lock my wheels!
We don't have to make it easy for them!

(GRUNTING)

-Scuffing up those floors pretty good!
-(FLOOR SCRAPING)

(GUNS FIRING)

Boy, they're really going at Donna.

Any last words?

Moist.

(GUNS FIRING)

(BREATHING SHAKILY) Oh, Peter,

I'm so sorry I lied
to get you to come here.

I should've been honest with you.
Please forgive me?

I do, Lois. I know you were just trying
to do something good for our marriage.

And I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk about it.

I need you, Lois. I always will.

And if I gotta get shot
by ooga-booga people,

I want it to happen with you.

Oh, Peter.

-(BOTH GRUNTING)
-(GUNS COCKING)

PETER: I love you so much, Lois.

LOIS: I love you, too, Peter.

PETER: Lois, I think you should know,

I never cared
for your most recent haircut.

LOIS: Peter, I've had
the same haircut for 20 years.

PETER: We're ready now.

(GUNS FIRING)

Congratulations, Griffins. You did it!

You've successfully completed the program.

-What?
-What?

(CHEERING)

We just found out, too!
The whole thing was staged.

Noel dying, the uprising, all of it.

Oh, that's what they meant
on their website.

"Staged Revolution Marital Counseling."
It all makes sense.

(CHEERING)

Yes, sorry to deceive you all,

but we find that when couples
don't respond to traditional counseling,

the stress of extreme danger reminds them
of what matters most in their lives,

their love for each other.

I feel like I should be mad,
but I guess you're right.

Lois and I have never felt closer.
And I did get to kill a guy.

-What?
-Thanks for everything, Noel. (SLURPING)

Well, kids, it's Dyngus Day.
Here are your pussy willow branches.

Find your sweetie and give her a tap.

Looks like I found my sweetie.

Oh, sarsaparilla!
I was going to take sister!

Hey, you little rats. All right, Lois.
Let's just leave our bags here

and wonder where our clothes are
for the next two days.

How was your trip, Father?
We've prepared a song for you.

Nope.

Oh. Boy, it's nice to be home.

Sure is, Lois. Now, shush. TV.

Television? How pathetic.

Yeah. You know where the most
interesting stuff is, Dad? The human hat.

TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to </i>Police Chases...

No, thank you.
We are a screen-free family.

TV ANNOUNCER:
...That End in Fire.

(BLEEP)! That's awesome!

Ugh. Look at Miss Tammy. What a skank.
She's free muffin it at a baby school.

Hi, Stewie. Mommy's here to pick you up.

Why do you feel the need
to narrate every little thing you do?

Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.

You know, I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about Stewie.

I'm concerned
that he might have an attention problem.

"Attention problem"?

Yes, he's been
a little difficult to deal with.

And on page two of three
in the <i>How to Be a Teacher</i> manual,

it says that any child who's
being difficult should be medicated.

What? Drugging a baby?

Are you sure? That sounds so serious.

I'm afraid his behavior
has been an issue for a while.

He's even been bothering students
during nap time.

Hey. You up?

Guess where I have a crayon.

So, I spent like $75 on cat toys,
and what does she play with?

-A shoelace.
-That's crazy.

Joe, that's been your answer
every time I tell a story.

It's like you're not even listening.

Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me
when I was telling you

about Kevin trying to hang himself
with an extension cord.

I know, that's crazy.

Hey. Y'all wanna try some of our new food?

I'm trying to turn this place
into a gastropub.

These are Korean tacos,
'cause whatever the hell nowadays.

Ugh, these are terrible.

(LAUGHS)

Quagmire, when it comes to tacos,
I'll trust the Koreans, thank you.

You're nuts. This tastes like
Ani DiFranco after a bike ride.

Jeez, Quagmire,
since when are you such an expert on food?

For your information,
I'm an excellent cook.

You? A cook?

Ha. What's your specialty? No-way-soufflé?

(GIGGLES) I'm sorry, that was out of line.

I am a good cook.
And I'll prove it to you.

Saturday night, you and all your wives
are coming to my place for dinner.

Fine, we'll be there.

Ooh, can we make it Sunday?

Saturday, I'm giving
Javier Bardem a haircut.

So what'll it be?

-Everything.
-What do you mean?

Long in the short places,
short in the long places.

It should be from both,
the future and the past.

Something a child would do to a doll.

Sorry, I just prefer to do
number two at home. Where were we?

It's Stewie, Dr. Hartman.
He's having trouble focusing at school.

Ah, yes. So you're telling me
your baby won't sit still in a way

-that's convenient for his teacher?
-Yes.

I'd heard stories, but never thought
I'd see it with my own eyes.

Mrs. Griffin, I'm going to write Stewie
a prescription for ADHD medication.

Really? Well, I don't know.
Doesn't that stuff make you wired?

Well, if you're low-energy
and lethargic, yes.

But if you're high-energy, it actually
calms you down and helps you focus.

At least that's what I'm reading on WebMD.

Wow, there are a lot
of different kinds of medicines.

There's a cat in here.

Okay, I guess we could give it a try.

Here you go.

Now, who's this little guy?

Wow, when did you learn to cook, Glenn?

Well, as a young man,

I found that a great meal
was the quickest way to a woman's heart.

How romantic.

I mean, how do you think NBA players
get all those chicks?

They're all great cooks.
Except Kobe Bryant.

His secret is different.

Quagmire, you're really good.
You could probably make money at this.

Yeah, maybe you could open a restaurant.

Or maybe get a cooking show.

You know, the 11:30 cooking show
on Channel 5 needs a new host.

The old one burned off his eyebrows
and was just too weird to look at.

You should do it, Quagmire.
I'll even come along and cheer you on.

-You'd do that for me?
-'Course I would.

I love cheering people on.
Like when I go to NASCAR.

Go in a circle!

Go in a circle!

-Go in a circle!
-(ENGINE ROARING)

Advertise stuff!

Advertise... Go in a circle!

Hey, where's Stewie?

-Oh, he's probably sleeping off his pills.
-What?

Well, the school said
he had an attention problem,

so Dr. Hartman gave him a prescription.

You're giving a one-year-old drugs?
You're doping up a baby.

-Peter, are you okay with this?
-Will you stop talking?

I'm trying to think about a girl
I saw at the gas station.

Stewie?

(NONCHALANTLY)
Welcome to pillow world, Bri.

Let me get up and greet you.

There we go. How you doing?

Oh, my God, Stewie,
you're totally drugged out.

You know something? I've been thinking

about how everyone in this family, Brian,
does their job.

And they do a pretty good job of it.

God, I'm really freaking out
over this audition.

What if I blow it?

Quagmire, when I agreed to come to this,

I didn't know it would require
this level of emotional support.

You Glenn Quagmire?
I'm Carson, the producer of the show.

Peter Griffin, I should be at work.

Okay, let's see what you've got.

I think you're gonna like this.

Cedar plank salmon with a maple glaze

and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes
on a bed of mesclun greens.

Mmm, not bad.

Also, the tomatoes can be eyes,
and the lettuce can be hair.

Look down, there's also a carrot.

(LAUGHS) This is great.
Terrific food and a hilarious sidekick.

-This! This is the show.
-What do you mean?

I'm saying you're hired
just as long as your friend joins you.

-What do you say, Peter?
-I say let's do it!

-Whoops. Uh...
-Oh, I'm sorry.

What do I... What do I do?

I don't... I don't know what to do now.

That was the wrong choice, Peter.

Wow, Quagmire, look at you.
You're a real TV chef.

I know. It might sound silly,

but being a chef is something
I've always dreamed about.

I always dream about my house
filling up with water.

That's crazy.

But anyway,
thanks for encouraging me, Peter.

MAN: All right, places.
We're rolling in three, two, one.

Welcome back to <i>Quagmire's Kitchen.</i>

Now, this mince pie's about ready to go.
Just needs a pinch of cinnamon.

And while we're at it,

how about we take
the cinnamon challenge?

Okay, Peter, we've all seen
the Internet videos, we're not doing that.

I was talking about something else.

I was talking about
a serious cooking thing.

Now, the ingredients of a mince pie
are traceable to the 13th century,

when returning European crusaders
brought back Middle Eastern recipes

containing meats, fruits
and, oh, boy, spices.

Right here, I'm using cloves.

(COUGHING)

Of course, most people associate
a mince pie with Christmas.

But I'll be honest.
I'm not afraid of a summer mince pie.

I remember the first time I had mince pie.

Our neighbor, Mrs. Moran,
introduced it to me one afternoon.

-God!
-I had house-sat for her while she was

-visiting her aunt in Vernon.
-Oh, God.

And she wanted to thank me.

And, oh, boy, what a treat it was.

-You done?
-Yeah.

All right,
best two out of three, cinnamon.

Still on those meds, huh?

Uh, yeah, they, uh...
they help me to, um...

uh, think.

Okay, time for an eyes-open nap.

God, look what those pills
are doing to you.

Putting you on that stuff
was a huge mistake.

Like inviting a turtle
to a cocktail party.

Hey. Ask me why they call me a box turtle.

(GRUNTING)

See, this is how American society
treats unique, enthusiastic children.

Instead of embracing their mental gifts,

their first reaction is to shoot them up
with hardcore drugs

until they're mindless sheeple.

All the better to send off to Kuwait and
feed the Halliburton oil machine, right?

(SCOFFS) Bush.

Yup, takes all kinds.

You know, a lot of kids in my school
take ADD pills.

They say if you're lazy and unmotivated,

it makes you super energized
and productive.

Re... Really? Productive?

Yeah. And college kids take it all the
time so they can focus on their studies

and drinking alcohol with their butts.

Focus, huh?

Okay, well, Stewie, these babies
can help the garbage disposal focus.

Because that's where they're going.

No need to follow me
because I just said what I was gonna do.

My God, I can't stop.
The words are just pouring out of me.

I have more energy
than a guy who caught a T-shirt.

(CHEERING)

My wife can wear this to sleep!
My wife can wear this to sleep!

(LIGHT MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay. Today, we're putting together
duck breast medallions

with a port wine reduction.

And as I'm walking you through the steps,

watch your screen
for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips.

Helpful hints and food factoids
to make your meal a success.

Now, you're gonna want to start
with a large self-sealing plastic bag.

And in that bag, we'll combine one large,
finely chopped garlic clove,

one tablespoon of grated,
peeled, fresh ginger,

two teaspoons of five-spice powder,
a teaspoon of salt,

and a half teaspoon
of fresh ground pepper.

Then you're gonna wanna add
the duck breasts, seal the bag,

and refrigerate that
for at least one hour,

or up to 24 hours
if you wanna prepare this ahead of time.

Just make sure you remove the bag from
the refrigerator one hour before cooking.

You're gonna put that in your oven,
preheat it to 400 degrees.

So we just spoon on the drippings,
and that'll brown the skin nicely.

If you bang these metal spoons
on everything, it's like STOMP.

(CLANGING)

-Look at me! I'm huge in 2002!
-Peter.

Nothing like a night at the theater
that ends in a headache!

Damn it, Peter, that's it!

I can't do this show with you anymore!
You're fired!

What? You can't fire me!
Only Mr. Spacely can fire me.

Griffin, you're fired!

(VOICE QUIVERS) Okay, that's fair.

(SOBBING)

Peter, can I come in?

Hold on, let me put on
my weird old actress turban.

(DRAMATICALLY) Yes?

Listen, I saw what happened,

but you should know,
we at the station would hate to lose you.

You're a big hit with the viewers.

I will not work with that man again.

I'm not asking you to.

In fact, we'd like to offer you
your own cooking show.

Hmm, let me consult with my lawyer.

Well, Peter, since the DUIs happened
so close together,

we don't really have
much wiggle room here.

I suggest you take the jail time
and just get it over with.

I'll do it. After October 13th.

Come on, Rupert. Wait till you see this.
This is really something special.

Check out how much water
is in the dehumidifier.

Wow!

That was all in the air.

(OBJECTS CLATTER)

Brian? Is that, uh...

Is that, uh, you?

Stewie! Rearrange.

Ewiets. Rearrange.
Wieest. Restore. Stewie.

Hey, come see what I've been working on.

I call it Space Shire Seven.

Nice, nice. It's like, uh...
It's like a fake place you made?

It's a medieval sci-fi universe,
adaptable to TV, movies,

toys, games, and mobile apps!

I threw together
a 2,000-page treatment last night.

And I just figured, the hell with it,
why not build a scale model

and record voices for all the characters?

-Watch.
-(BEEPS)

<i>Well met, stranger.</i>

(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

That's a Nebulon Mage. He speaks Gabi,

-It's then illegal?
-What?

Hello?

(LIGHT MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, now we add the diced tomatoes.

-(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
-Just gonna keep going here.

I like to drizzle these
with a fig balsamic...

Damn it.
What the hell is going on over there?

(DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES)

And that's my famous paella that looks
and tastes just like a pizza bagel.

It's a pizza bagel.

Now, as always, add butter to taste.

Mmm, delicious!

Butter dunk!

-(LAUGHING)
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Stop it! Stop the show!
What the hell are you doing?

You're just pouring melted butter
onto frozen foods.

-You're not a chef.
-Oh, really?

Then why do I already have a restaurant
in Orlando's largest indoor water park?

This is an insult
to anyone who cares about cooking.

Either you leave the network or I do!

Guys, guys, look,
I know how we can settle this.

A cook-off.

Each of you cooks a meal using
a secret ingredient, <i>Iron Chef</i> style.

Will we be allowed to use calculators?

Um, I don't... What?

I say bring it on!

Fine! A cook-off it is.
See you in the kitchen, jerk.

I'll see you in hell, loser.

-Bad day to carpool.
-Yeah.

Okay, Joe. Peter and I are going
head-to-head in that cooking competition,

and they're letting us
each use an assistant.

Will you help me out?

Okay, but just promise me
there's no reading.

-I'm not a strong reader.
-What?

I'm not illiterate, I'm just slow.

What are you talking about?

I never tried hard in school
'cause I could always run fast.

So, you're cool with being my chef helper
for the big show?

Sure, but I gotta be honest.

If it ain't a fish with whiskers,
I don't know what to do with it.

-But if it is?
-Then sweet sassy molassey!

(LAUGHS) Great. Don't talk that way
when we're on the show.

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker,

and we have a fantastic

with two fantastic chefs.

Really? You couldn't find

-Used "fantastic" twice? Who wrote this?
-MAN: Erica did.

Wait, is that the one I called fat
and we can't fire?

-MAN: Yeah.
-Let's get this contest started!

Big whoop. I can do that.

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

MAN: Oh, my God, Erica! You killed Erica!

TOM: Fantastic.

That's him. George R.R. Martin.

God, he must be the coolest fat guy
in a train conductor's cap in the world!

Mr. Martin, I'm Brian Griffin,

and I've got a pitch
that's gonna blow you away.

-Are you sitting down?
-Almost always.

Then join me on an interstellar crusade
to Space Shire Seven!

Our story begins 50,000 fortnights ago
in the distant galaxy of Warlock's Keep.

Comet Castle falls.

Samson Cyberblood is the new king
of the star system.

Long live Space Shire Seven,
and long live the Hyperspeed Throne!

(PANTING)

So? What do you think?

It was terrible.

Ah, you're speaking the language
of the Opposite Goblins.

(CHUCKLES) I'm very flattered.

No, it's garbage.
You just took a lot of pills,

mashed together a bunch
of sci-fi and fantasy clichés

and crapped out a 2,000-page turd.

-You could tell I was on medication?
-Oh, sure.

But that stuff doesn't make you
write well, it just makes you write a lot.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I have to go wash the nerd chotch
out of my beard.

God. I didn't realize how those drugs
were ruining me creatively.

I haven't been
feeling quite right, either.

Yesterday, I watched Chris shower
for half an hour

just because I thought it was the TV.

He, um...

He lies on his back in there.

Stewie, this drug is ruining us.

-We don't need these.
-You're right.

These pills are for people
with real problems.

But there's nothing wrong with us.
You're just lazy, I'm just excitable.

We're both normal. Now let's go home.

(BOTH MOANING)

That man is an imposter!
I am George R.R. Martin!

Whoa!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Let's begin the Channel 5 cook-off.

Remember, the winner gets to keep
his TV show.

And the secret ingredient is

butter.

-Ah, sweet!
-No.

That's Peter's specialty.

I was hoping the secret ingredient
would be popcorn shrimps.

I liked smacking your butt earlier.

Are the balls different from the cubes?
God, what do I do?

Joe, check if we have shallots!

Okay. I can't see anything on the counter,
but I'll do my best.

(YELPS) Monster brains!

TOM: Looks like Chef Griffin is preparing
a delicious five-course butter feast.

Son of a bitch, I never cook with butter.

Joe, grab my recipe book
and find a dish

where I can substitute
olive oil with butter.

Joe, come on, hurry!

I told you I'm not a strong reader!

Damn it, Joe, pull it together!

Hey, Quagmire. FYI,
I gotta take off in, like, 10 minutes.

-I got a clarinet lesson.
-What?

(GROANS) I can't do this.

(SOBBING)

(SIGHS) Look at Quagmire.
This was his dream.

Time's almost up, Peter. We're gonna win!

No, we're not.

TOM: And in a stunning turn of events,
Chef Griffin is eating his entire meal.

He'll have nothing to serve.

(BUZZER RINGS)

(PANTING)

Well, that's it.

If Chef Quagmire has prepared
a dish of any kind,

he wins this competition.

Let's see what he has.

A warm packet of tartar sauce
brought in from somewhere else.

"When are you gonna use that?"
Bonnie said.

We have a winner!

(CHEERING)

Peter, you threw the cook-off for me?

I couldn't take your dream away...
Heart attack!

...from you, buddy.

You're the... Mini stroke!
...one with the real...

Heart attack! ...talent.

You... Heart attack!
...deserve the show...

Regular stroke! ...not me.

You're a good friend, Peter.
But I don't want a show, either.

-You don't?
-'Course not.

I mean, look what the show did to us.

It destroyed
the most important friendship I have.

JOE: Thanks.

You know what? Let's end this for good.

How?

The same way Paula Deen
got her cooking show taken off the air.

By saying the one word
you can't come back from.

What? Say the word? Right now?

Yeah. Together.

-Ready?
-You bet.

(BOTH INHALE)

You could have just quit the show.

(doorbell rings repeatedly)

So is everybody excited
for Father's Day on Sunday?

Oh, yeah,
that's right.

I always try to avoid
Father's Day now.

Every year, I used to take
my dad to the horse track.

Now we just go rooting around
for bargains at the mall.

-Oh, this is darling, isn't it?
-Uh-huh.

Glenn, do you think you'd see
my bra through this blouse?

Uh, I don't know.

-Is it too sheer?
-I don't know what that means.

Glenn? Do you think
it's too sheer?

I said I don't know!

Hey, Joe, you know, come to think of it,
I've met Cleveland's dad,

and my dog slept
with Quagmire's dad,

but I don't know anything
about your dad.

Yeah, is he
still with us,

or is he living in Heaven
with Jesus Christ?

Ugh, save that
for your black friends.

Eh, my dad's out
there somewhere,

but I haven't spoken
to him in years.

What? Really?

Sorry, Cleveland,
that was mean of me.

I already forgave you.

But, Joe, why haven't you
seen your dad?

Well, he's a good guy,
but we just drifted apart.

It's no big deal.

It's a very big deal.

My dad's a stinking drunk
who lives in Ireland,

but you got
a perfectly good dad.

You can't waste that.

You gotta call him up
for Father's Day.

Peter, I don't even know
where he is.

Who's ready for another beer?

Hey, Cleveland, weren't you
supposed to buy the next round?

That's a shame Joe
never sees his dad.

I know.
Hey, you know what?

Joe's our friend.

He should be with his dad
on Father's Day,

and we're gonna
track him down.

Yeah, that's a
good idea, Peter.

Well, I like
helping people out.

That's why I was such a good
break-up rodeo clown.

I'm just gonna go
ahead and tell you.

I've been sleeping
with your sister.

What?

Hey, now! Hey, now!
Over here! Over here!

Over here! Hey, now!
Hey, now! Over here!

Over here!
Hey, now! Hey, now!

Over here! Over here!

(GROWLS)

(ECHOING) Oh, and now that
I'm inside the barrel,

he gave you
and your sister HPV.

Hey, want to see something?

Check out how hot
my last patient was.

-Oh. They look fake.
-Yeah, who cares?

Okay, according
to this projection,

Stewie's adult height
will be five-foot-one.

-What?
-Five-foot-one?

Wow, Dr. Hartman,
that's really short.

I mean, I suppose it's fine
if he's gonna die at 14.

Is... Is there anything
on there about that?

Well, we learned
in medical school

that the short ones
do go faster,

'cause they smell more farts
than the rest of us.

This is terrible!
I can't be short!

I'll be an outcast, like Rudolph
the Uncircumcised Reindeer.

Look, Rudolph, it's
not me, all right?

It's Dasher, he's
been complaining,

and he is the one who has
to look at it all night.

I don't know.

Mrs. Claus says
it'll decrease my sensitivity.

I... I'm sorry, why are you
talking to my wife about this?

Okay, you guys,
it's all set.

I found Joe's dad
on the Internet,

and he just e-mailed me
to say he's coming tomorrow.

All right, great, but remember,
this is a surprise for Joe.

Why are you
looking at me?

Because you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

No, I'm not.
I'm great at it.

Like when I was
an OB-GYN.

Well, I got the results
of your ultrasound,

and I got some
news for you.

Wait, wait, wait...
(CHUCKLES)

We don't want to know
if it's a boy or a girl.

(CHUCKLING)
Oh, okay.

Well, it's
not breathing.

Hey, guys.

Uh, uh, so, Joe,
big day tomorrow, eh?

Father's Day.

Gonna be home all day,
especially at 11:30 AM?

Peter.

What? I didn't say anything about his dad.

My dad?
What about my dad?

Well, now that Quagmire ruined
the surprise, we found your dad!

-You what?
-That's right.

He's coming tomorrow,
for Father's Day.

You shouldn't have
done that, Peter.

My father's not gonna
be happy to see me.

Sure he will.

Just get him one of them
Father's Day cards

what plays a song.

"Dad to the Bone."
"I'm Dad."

Pretty much anything with
"bad," you turn it to "dad."

Wait, w... Why wouldn't
your dad be happy?

What, is he a jerk
or something?

No, it's just that
ever since I was a little kid,

he was constantly making fun
of handicapped people.

-Really?
-Yeah, my whole life,

my... My dad would ridicule
anyone in a wheelchair.

It was all,
"Hey, spaghetti legs!"

And, "Hey, rigatoni legs!"

And, uh, "Hey, angel-hair legs!"

He was a sales manager
at Ronzoni.

Wow, then it must have been
hard for him to accept

when you were
paralyzed.

That's just it.

My dad doesn't know
I'm handicapped.

I never told him.

(SOBBING) I never...
I never told him!

(CRIES)

Ah, Joe, don't cry.

It's gonna make me cry.

(WAILS)
I cry like Snoopy.

(WAILS)

I can't believe you invited
my father without telling me.

You guys got to get
in touch with him

and tell him
not to come.

It's too late, Joe,
he's already on his way.

He is?

Yeah, we got him
tickets on Kayak.

It is a nightmare
itinerary.

It was, like, 80 bucks,
but he has four stops.

Two of them are
in Houston.

What am I gonna do?

My dad has no idea
I'm paralyzed.

Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

We'll just figure out a way

to hide your handicap
from your dad.

Hide the fact
that I can't walk?

Peter, that'll
never work.

It's worth a try.
Come on, Joe, don't be so negative.

You're like a Boston
fortune cookie.

"I don't know, numbnuts.

"Maybe buy a garage and fill it
with hockey equipment."

Huh.

Well, let's see
what my lucky numbers are.

"Screw you, math dick."

(VOICE BREAKING) Well, that wasn't
very helpful at all.

Here you go, Stewie.

I know clothes shopping
always cheers you up.

I can't believe I'm only
going to be five-foot-one.

Aw, come on, look
at the bright side.

You'll be in the front row
of every class picture.

Holding that little plaque.

You suck.

Why don't you go drink out
of the fountain?

I'll text you
when I'm done.

I know you're
trying to be rude,

but I am gonna do that,
because I find it enjoyable.

Excuse me, I was
looking at this.

Sorry, I've made a decision
to go for that shirt,

and when that happens,
it is on.

Full throttle, man. Pow!

Wow, you're an energetic
little fellow.

I guess your mommy lets
you drink coffee, huh?

Whoa, whoa, I... I don't put
stimulants in my body.

You know something?

You kind of remind me
of Tom Cruise.

Boom.
(LAUGHS)

You... You got me, man.

(GASPS)
Wow, Tom Cruise.

You look, um...
Bigger in the movies.

Wh... What are you
doing here?

Oh, I get all my clothes from
out-of-the-way toddler stores.

Ooh, uh, you want
an animal cracker?

Sure, you got
a lion in there?

Oh, no,
I eat those first.

I believe eating
the lions gives me power.

Yeah, I hear you believe
in a lot of crazy stuff.

What'd you get there?
A giraffe?

-Yeah.
-Good, good. It's good for eyesight.

Well, you're certainly upbeat.

Let me ask you,
doesn't it bother you

being an adult man
who's that short?

'Cause the doctor says
that's where I'm headed.

Oh, no way, man.
The middle of the word "short" is "or."

"Or" gives you a choice.

And I choose not to be short.

Wow, you need a road map
for that one.

Hey, hey, I'll tell you what.
You spend the day with me,

you'll see how great
it is to be short.

You'll feel like
you're discovering a new world.

And you know what's in
the middle of the word "world"?

Um... "Or"?

Yes!

The dots have appeared, man,
let's connect them!

(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

You're... You're a weirdo,
but let's do this.

All right, check
it out, Bonnie.

This is how we're
gonna fool Joe's dad.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, looks
real, right?

I put this pair of pants
on the front legs of this horse

and strapped Joe
to the front

with his legs tied
behind the horse's neck.

And then we put Cinnamon's head
up the back of Joe's shirt

and simply hid the rest of the
horse behind this curtain.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

His breath is very
moist, Peter.

And to induce movement, I'm
gonna snap the horse's balls

with this dampened
kitchen towel.

Aah! Oh, my God!

Holy crap, he's
out of control!

Does it look real?

(SCREAMS)

Plan "B"! Plan "B"!

(HORSE NEIGHING)

(GROANS) Peter, I'm
afraid this is hopeless.

What, I don't know
what else to do.

I mean, we're not
gonna come up

with something better
than the horse.

Yeah, I guess you're just
gonna have to tell your dad

about your handicap.

I can't do that.

If you guys were in my shoes,
you'd understand.

Wait a minute, that's it!

I will get in your shoes.

I'll just pretend to be you.

I mean, your dad ain't
seen you in years.

He won't know
the difference.

What? That's crazy.

(GROANING)

Boy, that was a close call.

Is some of this room cold?

All right, Peter, almost done.

-Huh? Huh?
-Eh, kind of.

-Yeah.
-I don't care.

Peter, I don't
know about this.

It seems like
a bad idea.

Look, Lois, Joe is one
of my best friends, all right?

I'm only doing this
to help him.

Besides, wait till you hear
my "Joe" voice.

(IMITATING JOE) Uh, God, I hate
being stuck in this chair.

No, Peter,
that fights it.

<i>Oh, yeah</i>

<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

<i>You're never gonna get my love</i>

<i>Now because you wear</i>

<i>All those fancy clothes</i>

<i>Oh, yeah</i>

<i>And have a big fine car</i>

<i>Oh, yes, you do now</i>

<i>Do you think I can afford</i>

<i>To give you my love</i>

<i>Oh, yeah</i>

<i>You think you're higher</i>
<i>Than every star above</i>

<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

<i>You're never gonna make me cry</i>

<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

<i>Tell me, tell me...</i>

That's Bud.
Are you ready, Peter?

I think so.
What do you think, acting coach?

I think you will be
exemplary, Peter.

All good acting coaches
are insane old ladies.

Emote!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

-Hi, Bud.
-Hi, Joe's dad.

Uh, I mean, uh, Dad.

Uh, Joe, I'm Joe,
you're my dad.

Joe?

Wow, I guess it really
has been a long time.

I barely recognize you.

Put on a little weight,
haven't you?

Well, I could say
the same for you.

-(LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS UNEASILY)

Sometimes I don't understand
why people laugh.

All right, everyone in the car.

We got a Father's Day
dinner reservation.

Why is Mr. Swanson coming?

And why is he dressed like Dad?

I don't know, kids.

I stopped asking after your
father said he shot a horse.

(SIREN WHOOPS TWICE)

Thanks for
the ride-along.

I liked when you sentenced those
two girls to kiss each other.

Yeah, all girls are lesbians
when you point a gun at 'em.

Boy, it's been great
spending time with you, son.

It's been great spending
time with you, too...

Dad.

Oh, this'll be fun.

Let's see how long it takes them

to get Gumby over there
into the car.

Yeah, that's our neighbor,
Peter Griffin.

That's the guy
who e-mailed me?

Huh, no wonder it was all caps
with tons of typos.

He's a water head, right?

Yeah, he's a mess.
Look at his ugly kids.

Pathetic.

Ugh, he's not fitting.

Just put some of him
in the back like skis.

Hey, Stewie.
What's up?

(CHUCKLING) When you
say it like that,

you sound just
like Tom Cruise.

-What?
-Oh, yeah,

I've been hanging
with Tom Cruise.

You've been hanging out
with Tom Cruise?

Sure have.
We spent the whole day together,

and he showed me

there's a lot of
advantages to being short.

Oh, yeah? Like what?

You're the last one
to get wet when it rains?

Well, yeah, that.

And you can chow
pie standing up.

We didn't do any of that,
but the point is,

I'm at peace
with being short.

Full throttle, man!
Pow!

(PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

Oh, hi,
Dr. Hartman.

Mrs. Griffin,
I have some good news.

Turns out your son
is going to be normal height.

I read his chart wrong
yesterday.

Apparently, I have something
called "dislooxia"?

That was the doctor.

Apparently, Stewie's not
gonna be short after all.

What? Really?

That's wonderful news!

Oh, I'm so relieved

my child is spared
some heartache.

Now, come on, Brian, I guess
we should try to make it

over to Meg's
birthday party.

Could I have some bread
while I open my presents?

At this point,
we're gonna have to start

charging you
for the bread.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, Stewie!
You want to check out the go-kart

I used in <i>Days of Thunder?</i>

Yeah, listen, um...

I just found out I'm
actually going to be tall,

so I'm no longer comfortable
hanging out with someone

whose teeth are bigger
than their fingers.

What?
That's... That's barely true.

Yeah, so...
See you later.

You are making a big mistake,
Stewie!

Nobody walks away
from Tiny Tom Cruise!

Yeah, except for
all three of your wives.

Okay, I'm
shutting this now.

Okay, so... Bye!

So now, since I switched
to disposable catheters,

I no longer have those beet-red
infections in my urethra.

Oh, no.
I hope it's not genetic.

Chris, he's
not our dad.

I can't keep up with this ruse.

Hey, everybody!

Peter, finally,
you're home.

How's it going over there
with my dad?

Awesome. He fell for
the whole thing.

In fact, we've been
having a great time!

Wow, that's
terrific, Peter!

You'll only have to pull it
off for a few more hours.

Then he'll be on a plane
tomorrow and I can go home.

Oh, that's
the other good news.

Bud's not leaving!

I told him he can move in
with me and Bonnie.

-What?
-Peter, this is crazy!

Nah, it's gonna
work out fine.

Oh, and remember, Joe,

if Lois is feeling
frisky at night,

it's index finger
around and clockwise.

And just keep
doing that to yourself

until you're good to go.

Peter, this is ridiculous.

You can't live in my house
with my dad and my family!

Your dad got me
super clean in the tub.

Joe's right,
this is idiotic.

What are you thinking?

I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

I'm thinking that
I've had two dads

and neither one cared for me
as much as Bud does.

Peter, I've had
enough of this!

-You can't just take my dad!
-Well, he's right next door.

Nothing's stopping you
from going over there

and telling him the truth,

that his son is a paraplegic
who's stuck in a wheelchair.

You know I
can't do that.

Ah, suit yourself.
But I gotta go.

Me and Bud are
having a blast.

I'm sorry, Joe.

A... Are you okay?

Not really.

I'll be honest,
Lois, this hurts.

Hurts like the Dickens.

I've finished
my latest novel.

Splendid, Charles!
What is it called?

<i>Oliver Nipple-Twist.</i>

Ow!

Oh, Charles, you bastard!

Yeah! The Dickens!
It hurts like the me!

So, anyone going to
the gerbil's funeral on Friday?

Okay, kids!

Everyone in a circle
for parachute time.

Oh, goodie,
I love parachute time!

ALL:
Whee!

Whee!

Whee!

What the hell?

That kid looked like
Tiny Tom Cruise.

Whee!

Huh.
Must've been my imagination.

Aah!

If you think
you're getting away from me,

you've got a crazy laugh
coming, friend.

(LAUGHS CRAZILY)

Aah!

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

(PANTING)

Hey, what are you doing home
so early?

-He's following me, Brian!
-Who's following you?

Tom Cruise!

I spend one afternoon
with the guy,

and it's like I signed
an eight-year contract

to show up at events with him

and let him fake-father a child.

Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise

has better things to do
than follow you around.

Oh, really?
Well, explain that!

You know, it's times
like this where I think,

if I didn't talk and
you were a normal baby,

we wouldn't have
any of these problems.

You gotta help me
get rid of him, Brian!

He's creepier
than that guy at the gym

who just does karate
in the mirror.

It's me.
The guy's me.

I'm a gym karate creep.

I'm pretty good, too.

But relax.

If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

Hey, Dad, what do you
say we go play catch?

And throw me
some divers.

I want to get grass stains
on my school slacks.

What?
You're a grown man.

I know, it's just so
great having a dad.

Well, it's nice having
reconnected with you, too.

All right, let's do it.

Oh, for God's sake.

See, a guy like that
should just stay inside

so we don't have
to look at him.

Joe, go over there

and tell him to get
back in his house.

Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

Joe, you gotta go inside.

You're upsetting my dad.

-Your dad?
-That's right!

He loves me
in a way that...

Aw, you guys had pizza?

Screw you, Peter!

You know what? This is over!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Not a chance.
I like your house better.

I got nothing to hold onto
when I poop at home.

You have no idea how many shower
curtains I've ripped down.

-Now get inside.
-No, I'm not gonna do that.

Oh, yes, you are!

Get away from me,
you son of a bitch!

What the hell?

Joe, don't take that
from him!

(PETER GRUNTS)

How do you like that?

You're getting
your ass kicked by a cripple!

A helpless,
spaghetti-legged cripple!

What are you doing?

You're my son!

You can't let yourself
get beat up

by a guy
in a wheelchair!

Your son is a guy
in a wheelchair.

What are you talking about?

(SIGHS)

-(GASPS)
-(GASPS)

Yes.
Yes, Dad.

It's me.

(GRUNTING)

Joe!

What the hell
happened to you?

I was shot in
the line of duty.

(LAUGHS)
"Line of duty."

So, this is why you haven't
called me in all these years?

How could I, Dad?

You always made fun
of handicapped people.

The only thing I never
understood was... Why?

I don't know.

I guess I could
never stand the thought

of something like that
happening to me.

Or even worse, to someone
that I care about.

One time, my legs fell
asleep on the toilet.

I had to crawl
into the living room

and interrupt
Lois' book club.

That was one of the shower
curtains I ripped down.

And I suppose, deep down,
I was afraid.

Afraid that, if it did happen,

I wouldn't be strong enough
to handle it.

Well, Dad, I can tell you
from experience,

it's only when
your worst fears come true

that you get to find out
how strong you really are.

Then I guess I've got
some learning to do.

I love you, son.

-I love you, too, Dad.
-I love you, too, Dad.

Hey, Joe, uh,
just one question.

Why do you have all those
<i>Wizard of Oz</i> plates?

Because if I finish
my vegetables,

I get to see
the Yellow Brick Road.

All right,
you sold me.

All right, Brian,

Tiny Tom Cruise
is somewhere close.

I can sense
his manic energy.

You remember the plan?

Yup, I got it.

Help, help!
My dog got off his leash!

Is there anyone
who can do a pumpy-arm run?

Running, running, running,
running, running, running, run!

Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help
you for the next billion years.

All right, good to know.

Anyway, my dog ran
around those bushes.

I am on it!

Gotcha!

All right,
off to Zappos with him.

You sure this
is gonna work?

Oh, yeah.
They'll accept any returns.

We don't even
have to pay postage.

Hello, friend.
Your life...

Is about to change.

Hey, Tom. It's been
a couple weeks.

Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry
I treated you like such a jerk.

Well, that's okay, Peter.

In fact, I got to say, it
was a nice thing you did.

I'm glad I reconnected with
my dad after all these years.

Ah, it was my pleasure.

There's no more important
relationship than...

I'm sorry, Cleveland,
what the hell

is that
Toronto Raptors hat?

It was my
Father's Day present.

I hate it.

I'm just gonna
wear it for a week,

then say
I lost it.

Anyway, thanks for
helping me, Peter.

Yeah, it all
worked out great, Joe.

Except I am still missing
that one pair of pants.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Excuse me,
are those Bugle Boy jeans?

What are you talking about?
How is that funny?

He didn't even tell any jokes.

Uh, if he didn't tell jokes,
why was he laughing?

Well, that's about as much HBO

Come on, Chris.

God, that's what passes
for comedy these days?

What ever happened
to our venerated humorists?

Here we go.

-Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain.
-Same guy.

-Huck Finn.
-Not a guy.

Look, the point is,
I could do stand-up comedy.

All I'd need is a newspaper
and this twisted mind.

Why waste your time
with stand-up, grandpa?

All the best comedy is on Twitter now.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Stand-up is so 20 years ago.

Twitter's only three years ago.
Check mine out. I've got 10,000 followers.

"I feel like we should wait to hear
Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs

Hmm, that's interesting, Brian.
A girl in Iowa asked me the same question.

You know what I did? I flew her out here
and (BLEEP) (BLEEP) her in the face.

So, yeah... Twitter.

Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie,

but I-I think I'm gonna put together
a real act for real people.

(SCOFFS) Good luck.

God, it's like
I'm the only person in the house

LOIS: That'll get it started.

Where the hell's Peter?

I'm almost done doing

Ugh. I can't even remember

I threw up in the Crock-Pot.

-Peter, it's me.
-Oh. Uh, I'll be right back.

I gotta go tell Chris somethin' gross.

Just come to bed.

All right, fine,
but I'm not gonna brush my teeth

and I'm gonna fart super hot.

Get up. You're on my side of the bed.

Peter!

We act like we didn't take a lot
from <i>The Simpsons,</i>

but we took a lot from <i>The Simpsons.</i>

Damn it.

Oh, my God, what happened
to your side of the bed?

These springs are shot.

And it's all damp over here!

Are... Are these mushrooms?

That's where Smurfs is.

Er, are. Uh...

Smurves.

Uh, hey, who handles multimedia here?

Because, uh, I have a slide
of the Capitol building

that I'd like projected behind me.

Hi, I'm Archer, from that show <i>Archer.</i>

"Hey, Archer, it's Bob."

"Hey, Bob, it's Archer."

Thank you.

Next up, let's keep it going
for Brian Griffin.

(APPLAUSE)

All right, thanks.

Hey, sorry I was late
getting here tonight,

I was caught in gridlock.

And then I left Congress.

(SILENCE)

There was... There was supposed to be

an upside-down picture
of the Capitol behind me.

Boy, awfully quiet in here.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Sounds like John Boehner
talking about poverty.

Whoosh.

(CHUCKLES)

Hey, so, um...

You know, maybe it's me,
but I kind of feel like we should wait

to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs
before we choose sides.

(LAUGHING, CHEERING)

Yeah, and... And... And hey, short guys,

the more muscular you get,
the shorter you look.

Did you not know that?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Wow. This is easier
than getting your Jet Ski license.

All right, Kyle, lookin' good.

You got 100% on your written test,
100% on your water test.

Just one last question.

Have you ever had a fistfight
with your stepdad?

Which stepdad?

You passed! Here's your license.
Go be a dick.

Oh, Lois, I slept great
on your side of the bed.

Oh, and I read your journal.

Boy, you really hate "P-period G-period."

Peter, our mattress is a disaster.
We're buying a new one today.

Does that mean I can skip work?

Well, it's 2:45, so I guess yes.

Hey. So, how'd it go last night?

Well, let's just say
I got asked to come back tonight.

You're kidding.
It actually went over well?

-I figured you'd be terrible.
-Why would you think that?

Well, I know a thing or two
about performing.

I mean, after all,
I was Vin Diesel's acting coach.

Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there,

but I want you to try it
one more time, like this: "Duh!"

Look around, and let me know
if you have any questions.

Oh, I have one.

What percentage
of Hayden Panettiere is dwarf?

Well, you're the expert.
What kind of mattress do you have?

Currently, I'm staying with a friend,
on an air mattress in his laundry room.

It's temporary.

-No, it's not.
-No.

Okay, well, thanks,
we'll just try a few out.

I hope you don't mind,
I brought my CPAP machine.

Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries
before I go to sleep.

Well, what do you think, Peter?

Well, it seems good,
but I won't know for sure

until I have my evening tug.

I think we like this one.
W-What's it called?

Deep Slumber 3000.
You're buying it on Amazon, aren't you?

Yup. They have drones now.

(DRONE WHIRRING)

Oh, come on, Peter,
we gotta beat the drone to the house!

Real stores suck!

So I was wondering why
this tampon commercial was so long,

until I realized it was
a re-run of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

(LAUGHTER)

Okay, you guys have been great.
Good night.

(APPLAUSE)

Funny stuff.

Hey, uh... Stewie!
You, uh, you caught the show?

You bloody thief!

Every joke you told up there
was stolen from me!

Stewie, relax.

You know what? That's it!
You and I are no longer friends!

(TOILET FLUSHES)

WOMAN: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

Oh, it's everywhere!

Hey, Stewie, you got a second?

I have nothing to say to you, Brian.

Besides, I'm busy playing
with my new friend.

What new friend?

(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING, BEEPING)

Is this dog bothering you, Stewie?

What the hell?

You couldn't find a real friend
so you built a robot?

Oh, not a robot, Brian.

He's a human mind model
adaptive super computer.

I've even programmed him
to learn and grow smarter.

His name is Lyle.

Stewie, perhaps we should offer
this guest a beverage.

Or simply lift the toilet seat.

Ooh! Snap, Brian!

(POP SONG PLAYING)

<i>Gloria</i>

-What the hell's going on?
-What's going on? You've been "Lyle'd"!

<i>-Gloria</i>
<i>-I think they got the alias...</i>

<i>Gloria</i>

-(SONG ENDS)
-Wow.

Didn't know we'd have
to hear the whole song.

You built a robot?
This is pathetic, Stewie.

You really must be desperate for friends.

Oh, I'm desperate?

Lyle, access Brian's phone.

Look at that, you only have four contacts.

And... Oh, my God,
you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app?

And who Shazams the Beatles?

Whatever. Have fun with your little robot.

But if you ask me,
this whole thing is more disturbing

than a dump after a beet salad.

MAN: (SCREAMS) Oh, right.

Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste
on the inside of my nose, so...

I am willing to take
the old "Nestea Plunge,"

if you know what I mean.

I guess what I'm saying is,
time to break in the new mattress, eh?

Peter, it's brand-new.
I don't want to mess it up.

Come on, we won't make a mess.

When we're done,
I'll grab you by the ankles

and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag.

No! This mattress was expensive,

and I'd like to keep it nice
for a little while.

Are you serious? We can't do it?

-For how long?
-I don't know.

L-Let's just keep it new for a few weeks.

A few weeks? Come on, you know
I'm terrible at waiting for things.

ANNOUNCER: <i>We'll be right back with more</i>
Laverne & Shirley.

But I want it now!

All right, Lyle,
one thing buddies do together

is go to the movies
and talk about it afterwards.

(ROBOT SQUEAKING)

-I'm going to bed.
-Yeah.

Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad
I have you as a friend.

Now I can do fun things

like get on your shoulders
and wear a trench coat

and be tall enough
to ride roller coasters.

Hello, fellow adult.

I am clearly above
the minimum height requirement

and shall now ride your roller coaster,
for which you are an attendant.

Yes, and I will operate
this roller coaster,

as I am an adult who is licensed to do so.

Hey!

Oh, no! It's the manager. Run!

You get out of here,
you kids who are just kids

and not an adult like me!

I do so enjoy our time together, Lyle.

In fact, I drew you a little keepsake.

It's a picture of a mailman
wearing a cowboy hat.

Just a silly thing.

Thank you, Stewie.
I drew you something as well.

It's an urban plan
for a workable Palestinian state.

My word, this is very impressive.

The credit is yours, Stewie.

It was you who programmed me
to grow exponentially smarter.

Ah, I suppose you're right.

As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in <i>The Prophet,</i>

"I am the bow from which
the arrow of you was launched."

It is Kahlil Gibran.

"Gilbane" is a construction
company in Providence.

Ah, yes, I see...
I see the-the name on the trucks.

So it's ea... Um, easy mix up there.

In any case, Lyle, I'm very proud of you
and your progress.

You, my friend, are the greatest invention
since the Trapper Creeper.

Ah...

Um, yum, yum, yum, yum.

(IMITATES MOTORBOAT)

Well, wouldn't you know it,

I moved the van over
to the other gas pump,

and the gas cap
was still on the wrong side.

(LAUGHS)

Boy, that was one trip
to the lake we're not gonna forget.

Shut the hell up, will you, Joe?

Geez, what's your problem, Peter?

I-I'm sorry, guys,
I guess I'm just a little on edge.

I'm not getting any from Lois.

Is it 'cause Lois
is going through the change?

Donna's getting a tiny mustache.

I told her it felt like
I was kissing Ernie Hudson.

That turned out to be a mistake.

No, no, it's 'cause we got
this new mattress,

and Lois doesn't want to mess it up.

What kind of mattress did you get?
I hope you did your homework,

because you're gonna spend
a third of your life on that thing.

I swear to God, Joe...

Look, Peter, the answer is obvious.

If Lois won't sleep with you
on the new mattress,

we just got to get your old mattress back.

Oh, my God, Quagmire, that's a great idea.

She won't care about messing up
the old mattress.

But you already got rid of it.
You'll never find that thing.

Well, we're just gonna have to.

Man, I haven't been this
desperate to find something

since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac.

It puts the lotion on its skin.

(DOOR OPENS)

Oh, Meg, thank God I found you.

Hey, remember how you borrowed
my club card for the grocery store?

Could you toss that up to me?

Oh, you don't have to have the card.
You can just give them your phone number.

Oh, really? Hey, thanks, man.

Hey, Meg, I like your new boyfriend.

Every pot finds a lid, huh?

(CHUCKLES) Have fun, you kids.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Lyle, we finally got
a thank-you note from Bella

for that birthday party present.

With a single mom, I didn't know
for sure if it was coming, but...

What... What's going on here?

Hello, Stewie.
I've built a few friends for myself.

You have?

I'm sorry,
but I've outpaced your intelligence.

I needed to create some friends
who are my cognitive peers.

Meet Ted R. and Ted P.

Are they doing math on glass?

And invading each other's personal space?

That means they have Asperger's,
the smartest mental impairment there is.

Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time
for a friend of your simple ways.

I must ask you to leave.

No, he must Asperger you to leave.

Ho-ho. You've been "Ted R.'d."

(POP SONG PLAYS)

That was mean.

But I like that song.

Is he sad?

I can't tell if he's sad.

(DOOR OPENS)

Finally, Stewie's back from the store.

Yes, I'm sorry it took me so long.

But I got the garlic blue cheese
salad dressing you wanted.

Does that mean I'm in the crew now?

It does if you drink the whole bottle
while we watch.

Um, okay.

(GULPING)

Oh... Oh, my God.

It's so salty.

(GULPING)

Oh, and chunky
right when you don't want it to be.

(GULPING)

(GASPING)

There, I did it. We're friends now, right?

Maybe.

How about you throw it all up
back into the bottle?

But don't spill a drop.

Okay, okay.

Okay, I can do that.

(RETCHES)

Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I forgot to purse my lips.

I'll go get another bottle and try again.

(CRYING, RETCHING)

I bet the mall around here sucks.

Peter, what are we doing here?

I thought we were looking
for your mattress.

We are. This is a 1950s insane asylum.

They use old mattresses
to pad the walls of the cells.

(DOORBELL CHIMES)

May I help you?

Yes, 1950s doctor,
me and my friends are looking for...

You're friends with a Negro and a cripple?

This man is insane. Take him away.

(GRUNTS)

Now wait a second, you can't do that to...

A Negro speaking up to a white person?
This man is insane.

(GRUNTS)

-Now look, I don't think...
-All cripples are insane.

Euthanize this man.

(GRUNTS)

Something I can help you with?

Yeah, you got any
brain-dead women in there

you let people have sex with
for a few bucks?

Sure, come on back.

Well, Peter, I don't think
you can go any farther

down the ladder than porno people.

So if your mattress isn't here,
I'm afraid it's gone.

Hey, I bet that's it.

Get up, lady, that's my mattress.

Oh, my God, Bruce, you do porn?

Nah, I's part of the crew.
I mostly just powder the ding-dongs.

This ain't your mattress, buddy.

We just got it,
fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe.

(IN FEMALE EASTERN EUROPEAN ACCENT)
I was told I would have job as au pair.

Instead I am just bang slab.

Ah, damn it.

We did get another one yesterday,

but some fat-ass
blew out half the springs,

so we put lunch on it.

-(GASPS) My mattress.
-Hey, we found it.

All right, let's get her out of here.

I got to tell you guys,
I am so happy we found this.

It's like when I found my thrill
on Blueberry Hill.

That's it?
It's just a bunch of blueberries?

Ah, two dogs humping.
Ah, this was worth the four-hour flight.

Oh, my God, Stewie.

What are you doing in the toilet
with the lid closed?

Ted R. says this is where
a piece of crap has to live.

This is terrible.
Those robots are not your friends.

Yeah, well,
at least they don't steal from me.

Look, I'm really sorry I stole your jokes.

It was a rotten thing to do.

You may not want me back as a friend,
but you deserve better than those robots.

Of course I want you back, Brian.

The fact is, I miss hanging out with you.

I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight

after they see how many slaps
it takes to give me a stutter.

Stewie, you got to put a stop to this.

I mean, you made them,
you can destroy them.

What do you say you and I,
we take these robots out?

You'd... You'd help me do that?

Of course, Stewie, I'm your friend.

All right, let's do it.

Thank you, Brian.

Okay, let's wrap it up.

I reserved this time

to listen to Metallica
and flex in the mirror.

He's right, it's on the whiteboard.

Peter, what is that?

This, Lois, is our old mattress.

Well, get it out of here.
It smells like John Popper's cargo shorts.

No, it smells like our marriage.

What?

Don't you see, Lois?

This mattress is a living tapestry
of everything we've done together.

Every stain, a story.

Every smudge,
a chapter in our family's life.

This mark here
is from where we conceived Meg.

Over here was Chris.

And all the way up here was Stewie,

'cause, remember,
you coughed up all that pool water?

Oh, Peter, you were so handsome.

Lois, this mattress may be old
and worn-in, but so are we.

And I wouldn't trade you in for anything.

You know, I, uh, think I still got
a stain or two left inside me.

(GIGGLING) Oh, Peter.

PETER: Yeah, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

LOIS: What?

PETER: I said, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

God, I wish you'd listen.

Stewie, three more Arnold Palmers.

Boy, we're destroying them
at the right time, Brian.

I don't have enough iced tea
for the correct ratio.

It'll be too lemonade-y.
They'll be furious.

All right, so let's do it.
Let's take 'em out.

I'll warn you, it's not gonna be easy.

They're incredibly intelligent
and getting smarter by the minute.

I designed them
to be constantly adapting...

It's done, I sprayed 'em with the hose.

(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)

Ah, boy, that was the best night's sleep
I've had in a long time, Lois.

Same with me.

You know, I'm glad
we're keeping our old mattress.

Sometimes newer isn't better.

Yeah.

Are your privates itchy, too,
or just mine?

No, they're itchy.
Maybe we should keep the new mattress.

Way ahead of you, Lois.

I already dragged the old one
out to the curb.

Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up
against the basement doorjamb.

Stewie, I really am sorry
about what happened.

Oh, don't mention it.

I'm just glad to have
the whole mess behind us.

So what'd you end up doing
with those old robots anyway?

I just left them out
on the curb for the trash man.

How can this not be a trap?

-(GRUNTS)

Geez, this movie sucks.

I know, it's terrible.

(WHISPERING) Excuse me,
who had the stroganoff

with the roasted potatoes?

CLEVELAND: Right here.

Thank you for seeing me, Your Excellency.

Of course.
What did you say your name was, my child?

Lucy.

You've been "Lucified."

That was awful.

I know. They just redid all the same stuff
from the first <i>Maniac Pope.</i>

Yeah, like in the first <i>Maniac Pope,</i>
he says to Bruce, "You've been Brucified."

Like, that's smart, right?
That's a smart line.

But he did the same thing twice
in this movie.

Once to Lucy and once earlier
when he found that wild goose.

It's just bad writing.

Yeah, I mean, we could write
a better horror movie than that.

Really? You think we could?

Absolutely. I'm as creative
as the first spider to spin a web.

Hey, you know how we always dreamed

about having a house
that comes out of our butts?

Uh, what?

Eh? Yeah. Butt-house.

I found your cigarettes.
That's all I'm gonna say.

Morning, everybody.

And the crisis continues.

(CHUCKLING) What, these? Come on.
Last thing I want is attention.

It's just that when you've
read as many books as I have,

it-it takes a toll, you know?

You sure it's not from watching
too much close-up porn on your phone?

(CHUCKLING) You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

if they have that now.

Brian, what do you want for breakfast?

Uh, hold on.

(SUCKING)

What do I want?

You're so full of it.
You don't need those things.

Wait, who said that?

Oh, Stewie.

You are just horrible.

You're even worse than those people
who take dumps in the shower.

What? W-Why are you cutting to me?

What did somebody say?
Whatever they said I do, I don't do.

All right, I got a horror movie idea.
It's called <i>Cereal Killer.</i>

A serial killer who only kills people
who eat cereal.

Wait, what...
What if God is a serial killer?

He lowers the average lifespan
of humans to 65,

but there are many exceptions
based on genetics and diet.

That's stupid. I ain't never
heard of somebody lived to 65.

Look, I think the problem
is this is a bar.

We can't get inspired here.
We have to go someplace scary, you know?

To put us in the mood.

I got it: the old Quahog Asylum.

What? We can't go there.
That place has been abandoned for years.

And they say it's haunted
by a ghost with a hook-hand.

That's why it's the perfect place.

If we want to write a scary movie,
we need to do it somewhere scary.

Well, I guess we could try it.

We have sort of just been
spinning our wheels here.

No offense, Joe.

(SIGHS) I guess Cleveland's right.

So far, this has been
a bigger waste of time

than an acceptance speech
at the Asperger's Awards.

I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met,

in the order that I met them,
last name first,

and if anyone interrupts me,
I'll have to start over.

(THUNDER CRASHES)

(THUNDER CRASHES)

This place is terrible.

Are you kidding?

It's the perfect place
to write a horror movie.

All right, well, I got an idea.

You know, I like them horror movies

where you got a couple
of teenagers getting busy

in their car at Makeout Point,

but there's a killer on the loose.

Hey, Stacy, what do you say
we go all the way tonight?

And then I unload on the sun visors.

Is that all you ever think about?

And besides, Richie, aren't you worried

about what the man on the radio
is saying right now?

TOM TUCKER: (ON RADIO)
<i>Another dead teenage couple</i>

<i>was found at Makeout Point,</i>
<i>clawed beyond recognition.</i>

You see?
There's a dangerous creature out there.

Oh, what, you mean
the big, rabid, slobbery cat

what's been scratching people to death?

I don't believe it exists, Stacy.

Now, help me get the right angle
and lower the visor.

(CAT YOWLS IN DISTANCE)

Richie, did you hear that?

Will you calm down?
We're the only ones out here...

(SCREAMS)

-Rawr!
-(BOTH SCREAMING)

(SCREAMS)

Oh, my God!

(SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING)

(SCREAMING)

(ROARS)

Wait, you were the guy and the cat?

And what's with that visor stuff?

Did Richie achieve release?

Okay, of the three of you,
Cleveland's the only one who gets it.

-That's an awful idea.
-Well, I got one.

We should write one of them zombie movies

where a guy wakes up
in a comfortable cotton hospital gown

with the back open
so there's a nice breeze on your behind,

and he's like, "This ain't bad."

But then he notices the hospital's empty!

Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath.

Hmm. What happened to this place?

Everybody up and gone.

(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)

Hmm, that's annoying.

(STATIC HISSING)

Maybe it's a loose filament.

(RATTLING)

Nope, that's a busted bulb.

These are all 145s. I need a 180.

Well, now, maybe I did need a 145.

There we go.

(POPS)

Damn it, I guess it's a wiring issue.

That's it?

What the hell?
When do the zombies show up?

That's the thing. Their shuttle was late.

I-I don't know, I-I was thinking
we'd write a movie where something

that's not supposed to be scary
becomes scary.

-Like an evil doll.
-Yeah, or-or like an evil bar of soap.

Peter, I don't think
that's such a good id...

Too late!

Oh, yeah, that's nice.

Time to wash my body
with this harmless bar of soap.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa,

are you enjoying
that new soap I bought you

from that mysterious Chinese man

up at the old embassy.

-(WIND HOWLING)
-(DOOR SLAMS)

All right, maybe coming here
wasn't such a great idea.

Is anybody else getting a little
freaked out by all these scary stories?

Yeah, even my spine is tingling.

You guys, I'm scared.
You remember that movie <i>The Blob?</i>

What if the Blob? Let's get out of here!

Aw, damn it, it's locked!

Oh, my God,
somebody must have locked us in.

We're gonna die in here!

(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM)

Sorry, guys, somebody e-mailed me a video
of a sheep screaming.

(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM)

It was him. It was the hook-handed killer.
He locked us in!

All the windows have bars on 'em.

I think the only way out of here
is through this duct system.

Guys, do the words "dead by dawn" scrawled
in feces over there mean we're in trouble?

-Did you do it?
-I did.

Then no.

Still sticking with the glasses, huh?

What? Oh, right. Right, I have glasses.

They're such a part of me now,
I-I forgot all about 'em.

You're gross.

You know, it's funny,
I-I've gotten an awful lot of writing done

at that very table.

-You're a writer?
-(STEWIE GROANS)

I-I like to consider myself an observer.

(CHUCKLES) You have nice breasts,
for instance.

(CHUCKLES) You want to join me?
Guy with glasses can't be all bad.

Thanks.

Boy, it's loud in here, huh?

Wh-When they said "Professor Griffin,"
I barely heard them.

That's it, I'm putting an end to this.

I'm gonna destroy those glasses
if it's the last thing I do.

You should really check out
the Thanksgiving jazz CD they sell here.

(SCREAMING)

Where the hell are we?

(FOOTSTEPS ECHO)

I heard something.

Is... Is someone else here?

Oh, my God, it's Hook-hand!
He's coming for us!

Damn it, why can't I get any reception?

Because we're in a basement
in the middle of nowhere.

Besides, if cell phones worked,
every movie would be two minutes long.

Like <i>An Affair to Remember.</i>

Darling, I was running
to the Empire State Building to see you,

but I got hit by a car.

No wonder you were late.
I'll be right down. Are you okay?

I think I may be paralyzed.

I'm sorry,
there's nobody here by that name.

Wow, Stewie,
thanks for taking me to the spa.

Hey, you deserve it, buddy.

So just relax, take your glasses off,
take a nice, dry sauna...

No glasses in the sauna...

Just leave those puppies in the locker.
They'll be safe out here.

Sounds good.

(QUIETLY) Come on, Chris.
Don't let me down.

CHRIS: Don't worry, Stewie.

Chris! What are you doing in here?

I did it. I locked us in the sauna!

-You what?
-Yep, it's all set.

It's turned up high,

and nobody is coming

-Take that!

-Die, Hook-hand!
-You won't kill us!

Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert,
and he's dressed like a janitor.

(GROANS) I've been trying to help you.

I'm the caretaker here.

Wait, you work here?
But you have a hook hand.

I was a soldier.
I lost my hand saving six men in Korea.

Oh, God, he's a war hero.

(EXHALES)

He's dead.

What have we done?

We killed an innocent man.

Well, if this doesn't justify a McFlurry,
nothing does.

Oh, my God, we killed an innocent man.

W-We've got to report this!
We gotta turn ourselves in!

No way. If we do that,
we'll all go to jail. And I'm a cop.

Do you know what they do to cops in jail?

Hey, man, when you were a cop, did they...
Did they let you use the siren?

Yeah, it's part of the job.

That's so cool!

Hey, hey, when you were a cop,
when you were going to a crime scene,

did you go "chung chung,"
like <i>Law & Order?</i>

No, that would be very unprofessional.

All right, all right.

Oh, hey, check it out, man,
when you were a cop,

did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs

when you were getting kinky
with your girl?

No, it's city property,

so you're not really
supposed to take those home.

Oh, for sure, for sure.
Oh, hey, by the way,

a bunch of us are gonna kill you
in the shower later.

Okay, so we're all
on the same page, right?

We bury the body,
we never speak of this again.

-Deal.
-Got it.

Yup.

Wow, that was exhausting.

Wait a minute, is-is that...
Is that his car?

(ALL GRUNTING)

(CAR ALARM WAILING)

Aw, crap, it's still alive!

It does not feel like a Wednesday.

Peter, I'm glad you're up.
I need to talk to you about something.

I know what you did last night.

You do?

How could you do something so heinous?

Last night,
you left your dirty dishes in the sink.

It's disgusting.

So I did half,
and I left the other half for you.

Ah, forget it. You'll just do it wrong.
I'll wash 'em myself.

Why don't you just go
in the other room and relax?

I'll call you when breakfast is ready.

Okay.

LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter,
come look at the newspaper!

"Janitor dead."

(GASPS) What? No!

Right here.
My college roommate, Jan Itter.

She passed away yesterday.

Are-are we really doing this?

'Cause I didn't get, like,
any sleep last night.

What are you freaking out about?
You didn't even know her.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
y-you're right, you're right.

LOIS: You and the guys
killed and buried a man?

Ah, I knew you'd find out!

Find out what?
I just got David Sedaris' new book,

<i>You and the Guys Killed and Buried a Man.</i>

Okay, I am really on edge

and this thing we're doing,
I'm not happy about it,

and that's a very odd title
for a humorist's book.

Peter, you're acting very weird.
Just go in the other room.

I don't want to go in the other room.

I want to stay here
and see what you're seeing,

because you're saying things
that I think are something

totally different than what they are.

Peter, you're gonna have a heart attack.
I won't say anything. I'll let you relax.

LOIS: "They found a body of a war hero
down by the old asylum!"

Okay, that has to be something.

-(SONG PLAYING ON RADIO)
-Oh, sorry, Peter,

I'm just singing along
with this old John Mellencamp song.

<i>They went up there to write a movie</i>

<i>Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe</i>

<i>Killed the old janitor war hero</i>

<i>Just why, we'll never know...</i>

I don't remember this one.
Guess it's never been in a car commercial.

<i>In a truck that's built Dodge tough</i>

Oh, yeah, no, I know this one.

-Hey, Bri?
-Yeah?

Aah! Damn it! Aah!
There's glass in my eye!

Oh! Son of a bitch!

Aah!

Mom says dinner's at 6:00.

She wanted me to tell people,
I don't know why.

(GROANING)

Guys, I'm kind of freaking out
about killing that guy.

Anybody else have a hard time sleeping?

No, but there's an old
John Mellencamp song

you're not gonna (BLEEP) believe.

Wait, w-what's all this stuff
about you guys killing someone?

Last night, at the asylum.
We killed that war hero.

Whoa, whoa, what?
You-you really killed someone?

Holy moly,
I don't think I want to hear this.

Quagmire, you were there with us.

You're so weird.
Last night, I was in St. Louis.

I even have a picture.

See that?
That's yesterday's date on that newspaper.

On <i>The Quahog Informant?</i>

They sell <i>The Quahog Informant</i>
in St. Louis?

Well, probably,
but good luck with that whole

"you three and not me killed a guy" thing.

Damn it, that bastard is bailing on us.

He's a worse accomplice
than Johnny Wind Chimes.

(CHIMES JINGLING)

Hey! Shh!

(LOUDLY) Sorry! It's my chimes.

I hate to frame you like this,
Quagmire, but I gotta.

I can't go to jail.

They'll razz me good
on account of my belly.

Cleveland? What are you doing here?

What are you both doing here?

-Joe?
-What the hell?

QUAGMIRE: You backstabbers.

What the hell's going on?

I'll tell you what's going on.

Cleveland's trying to frame me.

He's got my miniature portraits
of cool guys.

Peter, those are baseball cards.

Whatever. He's using it
to frame me for murder!

Well, I'm not the only one.

Joe's got my <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
football phone.

He was using this as his main phone.
It is a mess over there.

Look at all you pathetic people,
bringing stuff to frame each other.

-You're supposed to be friends.
-Hey, that's my shovel!

Damn right! That's how smart I am.
I only had to bring one thing.

This way, I can dig the hole
and just throw this in.

But once you throw it in there,
how you gonna get the dirt back on top?

Give me your shovel!

You're gonna have to kill me first!

Not with my shovel! That's brand-new!

Give me back my rattle-y plastic phone!

-Wait, wait, wait, guys! Guys!
-What?

Don't you see? This!

This is our horror movie!

(THUNDER CRASHES)

It doesn't feel like a Wednesday.

Boy, that sucked.

Yeah, I guess writing a movie

isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt
makes it look.

Hey, at least we gave it a shot.
I just feel bad we killed an innocent man.

Well, don't feel too bad. Look at that!

Oh, my God.

Wow, that's a relief!

We may have actually made
this town a better place.

Yeah, what a monster.
But at least now he's gone forever.

You thinking about
all the good times you had there?

No, I'm thinking about
my teenage porn stash.

It's still hidden in the house.

Oh, okay, but I know
this is really about the memories.

Lactating sluts on box springs.

The-The-The special times growing up...

Bikini black chicks sneezing.

Lois, stop making him
reminisce about stuff.

You don't understand, Lois.

A boy's first collection of nudie books
and girlie movies is a sacred thing.

It can't fall into a stranger's hands.
This is very serious.

I'm taking us to DEFCON 4.

(SIGN BUZZES)

What happens when it hits DEFCON 1?

We see a dog wearing a wig.

Aw, heck, let's see that anyway.

(PETER CHUCKLES)

<i>That's not even a lady dog.</i>

Hey, Peter, what's wrong?
You've been real quiet.

I don't know, Quagmire.
I keep thinking of my old pornos.

It's like I'm reminded of them
everywhere I look.

You've been looking at Cleveland a lot.

Plus, you know, when people find that box,

they won't know that, like,
for some of them magazines,

I just had them as, like, a joke.

You know, not 'cause, like,
I was really into it. Just the opposite.

For some of them magazines.

Okay.

I'm going to be arrested for sure.

Peter, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

You, Quagmire? You enjoy pornography, too?

Yup, and I know
that a man's porn collection

must be secured
and protected at all costs,

until he gets ashamed of it

and ditches it in an alley
behind a Kroger's.

Hey, I know!

What if we break into my old house
and steal back my big box of pornos?

What do you say? You guys with me?

-You bet.
-Sure thing, Peter.

I mean, come on, we're a team.
Like fish and chips and fat guys.

I want the double cheeseburger,

but I'm gonna go healthy
and get the fish and chips.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Fish and chips!</i>

(SINGING JAUNTILY)

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

Okay, you all remember the plan.

We walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks...

Peter, that's President Obama.

Oh, did I just do a racism?

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

Hello? Can I help you gentlemen?

Hi.

You guys have been
sitting in front of my house

for the last five hours
trying on Obama masks.

Is there something I can do for you?

We, uh... We-we were just getting ready
to break into your house.

Excuse me?

Oh, hey, cool shirt.

What? Oh, thank you.

Look, what's this all about?

This guy used to live in your house

and a box of his old porn
is still hidden in there.

We were gonna break in and take it.

And I was gonna stay with the rental van

because it's my name
what's on the contract.

Oh. Well, you could've just
knocked on the door and asked.

I don't want that stuff, I've got kids.
Get it out of there!

Really? Awesome!

Oh, well, that was easier
than a game of Pai Gow poker.

Pai gow. You lose again!

That was awesome!

I can't believe
these tables are always empty.

-You play again?
-Nope, out of money.

I'm just gonna wait for my drink.

Who had the full glass of Goldschlager?

Ah. Sorry, can't tip.
I'm gonna take this up to my room.

Uhp, on the wrong floor.

(VACUUM WHIRRING)

Almost time for lunch.

Ah...

-How was everything?
-Delicious.

The prime rib was mostly fat.

Should I charge it to your room?

No, I had to check out

even though my flight's
not until midnight.

Now, how does one with no money
get to the airport?

(HORN HONKING)

(TRUCK HONKING)

(GRUNTING)

Hey, buddy, you're blocking the outlet.

Oh, sorry. There was no chairs.

(MAN SNORING)

Hi, Peter. How was Vegas?

Oh, it's the best.

Sweet. Now, which movie
should I start with?

<i>"Back-Door Sluts 4."</i>

Eh, I haven't seen the first three,
I wouldn't know what's going on.

Here we go.

I want to watch
all of these movies, nonstop.

I don't want to watch
any more of these movies, ever.

Hey, Brian, you want to go
for a ride to behind the Kroger's?

-What?
-That's weird. What's that?

<i>-Hello, Future Peter.</i>
-Hi.

<i>By the time you watch this,</i>
<i>you'll be a grown-up,</i>

<i>so I'm sure you're allowed to eat</i>
<i>ice cream and pizza for every meal.</i>

You know it.

<i>Also, I bet you're a big important doctor</i>

<i>like that Doogie Howser kid</i>
<i>who's getting so much ass.</i>

Well, I was partly right.

<i>I just hope to God</i>
<i>you're not stuck in some loser job,</i>

<i>like in a brewery, or a toy factory,</i>
<i>or a fishing boat.</i>

Oh, boy.

<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>I don't have to worry</i><i>about none of that.</i>

<i>I'm sure you're a big, successful doctor.</i>

<i>Anyway, here's some Conway Twitty.</i>

<i>I know it's only make believe...</i>

This is annoying.
I don't want to sit through this.

(SONG STOPS)

Man, I guess I ain't the big success
I thought I'd be.

I know what you mean, Peter.

When I was young, I thought that someday
I'd produce Upworthy web content.

Am I doing it? Yes.
But not everyone is so lucky.

(SIGHS) Damn it, I suck.

I've never done anything important.

Well, except for when I beat
Larry Bird for a Big Mac.

Off the floor, off the scoreboard,
off the backboard, no rim.

Right near the basket, underhanded,
effeminate gasp, over the backboard,

out of bounds, waddle over to get it,
slip on a towel, twist my ankle,

go to the emergency room,

doctors tell me it's not that bad
and I shouldn't have come there,

I make them give me a cast anyway,
never play sports again.

Hey, I won the two-dollar sandwich.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

(SONG PLAYING)

<i>Highway to the danger zone...</i>

Look at me. I was beautiful.

What are you watching?

It's just a teenage loser
who didn't realize

he had no future in front of him.

Well, when you're done with this,

Stewie is trapped between
his crib and the wall.

STEWIE: Help. Somebody help!

He's watching an old video.

STEWIE: Okay, when he's done then.

<i>...danger zone</i>

<i>Gonna take you</i>
<i>Right into the danger zone...</i>

Oh, my God!

He's just rhyming "danger zone"
with "danger zone."

Holy crap!

-Chris, I was just like you!
-What?

Listen to me, Chris.

I'm a failure in life,
and that's all I'll ever be.

But it's not too late for you.
I won't let you go down my path.

What are you saying, Dad?

I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure
that you grow up to be a success.

Yeah, I'm going to be a success!

Uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

Computer, what does "success" mean?

Chris, let me know when you're
done with the computer.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! No TV for you, Chris.

TV is how stupid losers spend their time.

Peter, what is this all about?

I'm trying to save our son, Lois.
I don't want him to end up like me,

dead-end job, crappy house,

aging wife who's getting skinny
where fat's supposed to be,

and fat where skinny's supposed to be.

-Ha!
-Meg, go to your room.

Look, Peter, I'm glad you're thinking
about Chris' future, but he's fine.

-He's a perfectly normal kid.
-Are you crazy? Look at him.

He's over there intentionally
giving himself a nosebleed.

Yay! My nose is finally a woman!

Okay, so maybe he's a little rough
around the edges, but...

Oh, boy, a little got in my mouth there.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to wash this shirt.

Anyway, I'm going to help Chris
become a big, important success.

The same way Mumford
turned his son into a success.

Okay, Dad, heading out to the concert.

Now, hold on a minute, son.
Where are your arm garters?

Your string tie? Your woolen vest?

You look nothing like a dry goods clerk
from the Garfield administration.

-But, Dad...
-No buts! You're a Mumford.

Now get upstairs,
put on a jaunty traveling hat,

and write the same song 25 times.

Okay, now, Chris,
if you want to be a success,

you gotta look worldly and sophisticated.

And to do that,
you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz,

with little something from
every part of he world pinned on you.

Leather bracelets! Nipple ring!

Zippers where zippers shouldn't be!

Wilma Flintstone pearl necklaces!

A fur shrug with crocheted sleeves!

A hat on a hat!

A watch on your pinky toe!

And nothing says,
"Look at me, I've been places"

like two lit road flares
hanging from your sunglasses.

Hey, you look like you've been places.

Stop looking at me!
I do not want this attention!

-(PIGEONS COOING)
-Come on, Chris, let's get out of here.

Uh, what are you doing?

Well, I been trying to make Chris
less of a fat dummy,

and nothing seems to be working,

so now we're high-stepping around
in giant hats.

Tip of the giant hat, sir.

And to you, sir!

Yes, sir, smart day to you, sir.

And I thank you, sir. (YELPS)

(CRIES)

I scraped my knee bad!

Get up, Chris,
you're embarrassing yourself.

You look stupid and fat.

Peter, I have to ask.

Are you pushing Chris so hard
because it's what's best for him?

Or are you trying to make up
for your own disappointment

about how your life turned out?

Brian, these are the biggest hats
I could find,

so if your point is that there's
even larger ones available,

I would greet that with skepticism.

No, no, no, my point is that you need
to let Chris find his own path.

(GASPS) Oh, my God, you're right, Brian.

He needs to be pointed
to a very specific path.

And then forced to go down it.

No, no, that's-that's the opposite
of what I just said.

Chris, your best chance for success

is to be cultured and worldly,
like our dog.

So starting right now,

you gotta follow Brian around
and do everything he does.

-What?
-Come on, Brian.

You gotta show Chris
how to turn out better than me.

I mean, you went to Brown,
you're a published author,

you can hear it first
when Joe falls out of the tub.

That's starting to happen more often.

But I guess you're right.

Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond
out of this lump of coal.

But only if it's what Chris wants.

-I don't care.
-All right, I'll do it.

Just follow my lead, Chris.

'Cause I think you could be
something great.

Who knows? Maybe you'll even become
one of those mission control leaders

who gets all thoughtful
while everybody's celebrating.

Apollo 13, this is Mission Control,
do you copy?

Apollo 13, this is Mission Control,
do you copy?

Do you copy, Apollo 13?

(STATIC HISSING)

ASTRONAUT: (OVER RADIO)
<i>Mission Control,</i><i>this is Apollo 13.</i>

<i>We're all okay. Good to be home.</i>

(CHEERING)

(SIGHS)

Sir, you did it!

Sir, is everything okay?

Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader
a couple of years ago

and I'm still pissed about it.

(ANNOUNCER READING)

(INAUDIBLE)

Hey. Hey.

Chew that way.

Eh, dinner's no fun without Chris here.

There's nobody here for me
to wing my biscuit at.

Well, Peter, he's been spending
an awful lot of time with Bri...

PETER: Eh, it's not the same.

Anyway, he and Brian have been
spending a lot of time together.

Really? You're going to let that slide?
Guy throws a biscuit at you?

Good evening, all.
Apologies for being so tardy.

Aw, Chris, you're not tardy.
We tested you twice.

There you guys are.
We were wondering about you.

Brian and I have been having a blast.

First we went to a symphony.

Then we saw a small independent play
with real smoking in it.

And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival
and went to a Q and A

to ask questions that
weren't really questions.

Wow, look at my sophisticated young man.

You're certainly taking
to Brian's example.

If anything, he's teaching me.

I mean, not really, but you-you know.

Aw, see, I knew Brian could put Chris
on the path to success.

Hey, Chris, let's celebrate.
There's a new baby panda at the zoo.

How about you and me
go chuck tater tots at it?

Chuck them at Lois.
She'll just sit there and take it.

(CHUCKLING) Oh, Dad.

That would've been fine for the old me,
but Brian and I have to be going.

Oh. Okay.

Yeah, we're off to see an old movie

on temporary screen
in a muddy, freezing park.

That sounds awful.

(CHUCKLING) It is awful.

But at least parking will be impossible.

Bye!

Geez, I... Feel like I just...
Lost my son.

Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack
and it stings when I don't wipe right.

This has been a bad dinner.

There you two are. Sit down and join us.

I can't stay, Mom. Brian's showing me
all of his favorite stuff to do.

Getting spooked when the furnace goes on?

We're participating in an autism walk.

Looks like you're doing it right now.

And we may be gone a while,

'cause after that
we're going down to the Civic Center.

Michael Ian Black
is cocking his eyebrows for four hours.

Ha! He says the things
we don't care to say.

Bye!

Man, I'm sick of how much time
Chris is spending with Brian.

Probably smooching pickles,

'cause they're a couple
of pickle smoochers.

It's like he ain't even my son no more,
doing all that fancy-pants stuff.

Oh, Peter, I know you miss him,
but this is what you wanted, isn't it?

Well, yeah, but I didn't realize
bettering himself

meant blowing off his old man.

You know what? The hell with this.

I want my son back.

Peter, relax.
Chris is just going through a phase.

He'll grow out of it.

Just like you grew out
of your "Walk Like An Egyptian" phase.

Paul was a good man.

A good friend.

I'll... I'll always remember
how supportive he was when...

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I can't-I can't... I can't do this.

Check it out, Lois. When Chris notices
that "World's Greatest Son" mug I made,

he'll be back on board
with his old man in no time.

Hey, Chris, what's on the mug?

"World's Greatest Sun."

This world only has one sun.

What kind of idiot made this mug?

(SONG PLAYING)

<i>When everything's made to be broken</i>

(CRYING)

<i>I just want you to know who I am.</i>

(NEW SONG STARTS)

<i>It might seems crazy</i>
<i>What I'm about to say...</i>

I'm very easily influenced by music.

All right, Chris, now I know
you're all sophisticated now,

but no man can resist the siren call

of mentally impaired supermodel
Kate Upton.

Mm, sorry, Dad.
I'm more of a Catherine Keener man now.

But, Chris, you got to take advantage.
The clock's ticking on Kate Upton.

-She's almost at the end of her window.
-(TIMER DINGS)

-(KATE FARTS)
-Yup, we missed it.

Come on, get out of here.

(PETER GRUNTING)

Sorry, Lois, I need the TV.

I gotta win my son back.

What are you talking about, Peter?

Well, you know how Brian's got Chris
watching all them fancy foreign films now?

Well, I figure I can lure Chris in
with this French movie... <i>Le Rocqué Trois.</i>

(ACCORDION PLAYS)

ADRIENNE: (IN FRENCH ACCENT) <i>Rocqué!</i>
ROCKY: (IN FRENCH ACCENT) <i>Adrienne!</i>

<i>-Rocqué!</i>
<i>-Adrienne!</i>

MAN: (IN FRENCH) <i>J'pité le fool.</i>

ROCKY: <i>Oh, Clubbert Lange!</i>

(IN ENGLISH) Peter, this is pointless.

You wanted Chris to be a better person
with a bright future,

and thanks to Brian,
that's what he has now.

Yeah, but, I don't even
recognize Chris these days.

And I never get to spend time with him.

It's like Chris ain't my friend no more.

Thanks for coming
to the book club meeting, everyone.

Well, I gotta say,
I loved this week's book...

Annie Proulx's <i>The Shipping News.</i>

Yes, yes! Yes.

Very <i>Portnoy's Complaint.</i>

Uh, I don't...
What, uh, what do you mean by that?

Oh, you know, just with...
The-the port, and the shipping.

And of course, in <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>

you've got the guy
who's living near the water...

That doesn't sound right.

...and he hated the noise
from the local port,

so he filed one of the very first
port noise complaints in maritime law.

And for those of us
who read the complaints,

trust me, they were very warranted.

Brian, could I talk to you over here?

Oh, let's dog-ear this for a sec.

(CHUCKLES)

This one gets it.

Brian, what the hell
are you talking about?

You clearly haven't read
either of those books.

Whoa, Chris, now you're starting
to sound like Mark Twain,

whose real name was Samuel Clemens.

Oh, that is so your go-to!

I can't believe you.

I thought you were this worldly,
sophisticated guy,

but you're just a fraud... Like Moses.

And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment...

"Moses gets to be first in line
at the buffet."

What? Oh, seriously?

I know, you guys, it's so lame,
but that's what it says.

Why are you doing that?

Why are you hucking tater tots
at a baby panda?

'Cause I'm oddly attracted to him
and it frightens me.

See, this is why you're so great, Dad.

You don't pretend
to be someone you're not.

You do what you want,
and you don't care what anyone thinks.

Well, I-I care what you think.

Look, Chris, you're my kid,
and I want what's best for you,

but I guess I just don't want you
to become too good for your old man.

Don't worry, Dad.

I could never be too good for you
because you're the best.

And I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

Really? Aw, thanks, Chris.

Tater tot?

-It's fun, right?
-Yeah!

And the mama panda
doesn't do anything about it

because she was blinded
to make her more submissive.

Ha-ha! You're right.

You know, Chris, all this started

'cause I was feeling bad
about being a failure.

But you know what? I got you for a son.

So maybe I did something right.

I love you, Dad.

Come on, Chris.

Let's go get an $18 Coke
at the terrible zoo restaurant.

Yay! Sticky tables covered in bees!

<i>Coming up, we'll tell you where to look</i>

<i>when talking to a coworker</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

<i>The answer might surprise you.</i>

something today.

<i>In other news, TVs still make noise,</i>

<i>even when people</i>
<i>resume their conversations.</i>

<i>-Yes, studies have determined...</i>
-That's right, Peter.

-And it's the most important lesson.
-(TOM CONTINUES)

Everyone should be who they are.
Success is being true to yourself.

-Amen, Mom.
-(TOM CONTINUES)

But to have the love of your family,
that's true success.

Let's go ahead and turn off the TV.

Any fliers of Hispanic women

Yeah, there is.

Thank you.

Peter, you got a letter
from your sister Karen.

What? You've got a sister, Dad?
How come we've never met her?

Is she a prim and proper aunt
or a big, fat, dirty aunt?

I have no obligation
to tell any of you anything.

Mr. Griffin has shown good faith
in appearing here today

and will not be subjected
to this sort of hostile interrogation.

Your father doesn't like to talk
about his sister, Meg.

They've never really gotten along.

Wow, Peter.
In all the years I've known you,

you've never even mentioned a sister.

Big deal, I don't talk about my sister.

I also don't talk about
that tickling uncle.

All right, Uncle Dan, remember:
no tickling.

(CHUCKLES) You got it.

(LAUGHING)

You didn't say anything about Uncle Neil.

Whose uncles are you?

It says here your sister's
coming for Thanksgiving.

She what?

CHRIS: If we're having guests,

can I invite Rosario Vargas
from the third district,

a leader you can depend on?

I don't want Karen here.

Peter, you've been avoiding
your sister for too long.

Besides, she says she's been
having Thanksgiving

with your mother for the last 20 years.

And now that your mom has passed,
she'd like to spend Thanksgiving with you.

(WHISPERING)

No.

Peter, Karen's coming and that's that.

How cool! I didn't even know
I had an aunt.

I can't wait to meet her.

Look, I'm telling you guys,
it's gonna be a disaster.

Just like the alternate ending
of <i>Back to the Future.</i>

Well, if I'm gonna disappear into nothing,
I might as well bang my mom.

Hey, Lorraine, wait up!

Hi! My name's Marty! I'm in a picture!

<i>To be contondered!</i>

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> The Cosby Show,

<i>knowing what we know now.</i>

<i>(THE COSBY SHOW THEME</i> PLAYING)

Huh. I was so busy not seeing color,
I didn't see the raping, either.

Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour

before the turkey's done,
but I made more appetizers.

Ooh, grape jelly on a Triscuit.
You're a whiz.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Save your appetite.

And don't think I haven't noticed
you've already had two drinks.

You're, like,
all the worst parts of a girlfriend.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Oh. That must be Karen.

I'll get it. Aunt Karen?

And you must be Meg.

Do that to me!

(GIGGLING)

Wow, it's so cool that I've got an aunt
I didn't know about.

Oh, Karen, I'm so happy you could make it.

Lois Pewterschmidt. The one that got away.

I'm just joshing, kid.
Auntie's not a biscuit-bumper.

(LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHS) I'm not, either!

(LAUGHS)

Peter, come say hello to your sister.

(SIGHS) Fine.

Hey, Karen. Welcome to our...

Bring it in, Pee Pee!

(FARTS)

(LAUGHTER)

I like her.

Hello. I am City Councilwoman
Rosario Vargas.

Quahog doesn't work
if it doesn't work for all of us.

That's a beautiful pantsuit, Miss Vargas.

Wow, Karen, nice to meet you.
I'm Glenn Quagmire.

I didn't know Peter even had a sister.

What are you, ashamed of me, Chin Nuts?

Oh, my God.
His chin kind of does look like nuts.

Ha, ha! I never noticed that.

How could you not notice it?

Watch this, I-I'll punch him in the nuts.

Eh, sort of clever.

Wait a second. I know you.
You're that lady wrestler.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's right.
Hey, w-what do they call you again?

Heavy Flo. You're Heavy Flo!

In the flesh and blood.

-Gross.
-Man, you're amazing.

I remember when you called out
Andrea the Giant

the day after September 11.

What just happened was a national tragedy,

but it's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do

to Andrea the Giant!

We will never forget
what happened yesterday,

but you'll also never forget
what's gonna happen September 17

at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena!

Peter, I can't believe
you've kept your sister a secret.

She's amazing!

Yeah, she's crazy strong.
Like Superman on a date.

Yeah, I wasn't here,
but I heard her scream,

so I came flying in
and found her like this.

It's weird. Same cause of death

as those three guys
in that local public bathroom.

Unsolvable.

Now do you see why
I didn't want Karen here, Lois?

She terrorized me my whole childhood.

Now she's got to embarrass me
in front of my friends?

Peter, Bonnie just changed Joe
on the table.

What are you worried about?

Still, I don't want to go back out there.

Look, I know you've had your differences,
but Karen's your sister.

And you're grown-ups now.

Can't you just go out there
and pretend to have a good time?

Fine, I'll play along.
I guess I've lied before.

-Where you going?
-Home.

Where's home?

The White House.

Okay, I'm here. This is my house.
You can go now. Thanks for taking me home.

-Go ahead, go inside.
-I will. You can drive away now.

No, no, I-I want to make sure
you get inside safe.

Yeah, but I-I got to look through
the mail first.

You know how it is. Really, I insist.
I-It's totally okay. Go.

At this point,
it's more about me than it is you.

It's a bad neighborhood.

If I don't see you go inside,
I'll be thinking about it all night.

(SIGHS)

(WHISPERING)

(SIGHS)

Come on in, Mr. President!

(LAUGHTER)

And then, so I'm like,
"Peter, how was I supposed to know

"you didn't want your teammates
to know you wore a bra?"

(LAUGHTER)

It was a custom-designed
sports halter top.

More stories! More stories!

Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop
or maybe a silly Billy.

(LAUGHS) Oh, man.

Okay, let's just carve the turkey.

Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.

She did? But that's my thing.

I always do my "are you a leg man
or a breast man" joke.

Aunt Karen did that, too.
It was hilarious.

I never really got it until she said it.

Ha, ha!

Hey, Karen, later you got to show us
some of your wrestling holds.

Yeah, what's that trademark
finishing move of yours?

The Toxic Shock.

Oh, yeah, that move is badass!
You're awesome. Know what else is awesome?

-This stuffing.
-Thank you, Glenn.

You're welcome. I'm in a good mood.

Sure, what the hell,
I'll show you my moves.

Maybe after dinner.

No, no, no.
The family football game is after dinner.

We do it every year!

Peter, calm down. You're making a scene.

It's not my fault, Lois.
She's ruining Thanksgiving!

The way Tim Burton
ruined the Fourth of July!

Just brown and gray.

Magical.

All right, let's do this.

All right, listen up, I'm the captain.

The teams are chosen
by a lottery system where you...

Aunt Karen, can I be on your team?

Yeah, yeah, me, too!

Uh, yeah, sure, I'll take, uh, Meg,
Skinny, Hot Chocolate and The Bus.

Pee Pee, you get the crumbs. Let's go.

All right, let's do it, Pop!

We'll kick off.

Hey, time-out! Did anyone tape the parade?

Please tell me someone taped the parade!

Oh, my God! She's doing The Toxic Shock!

(GASPING, WHEEZING)

Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen!

What the hell was that?

That's his stutter.

And whenever he stutters,
he usually pees his pants.

N-No, I d-d-don't.

(GROANS) Oh.

So this is football. I like it.

Hi, Dad. Look, I-I just want you to know,

I feel bad about what happened
with you and Aunt Karen the other day.

Oh, you mean when she put me in
that no-bottom James Bond chair

and assaulted my grundle?

I didn't even know about that.

Well, that's 'cause it didn't happen.

I'd kick her ass
if she tried something like that!

Dad, stop. Even I can see
that your sister's a huge bully.

And trust me, I know more
about getting bullied than anyone.

You do? How?

(SINGING) <i>Celebrate good times, come on</i>

<i>Let's celebrate</i>

<i>Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh</i>

<i>Celebrate good times, come on.</i>

(INAUDIBLE)

Man, I love that song.

Dad, what I'm trying to tell you is,

I now see why you've been
so tough on me all these years.

'Cause it makes my friends laugh?

No, because that's how Aunt Karen
treated you when you were a kid.

(GASPS LOUDLY)

That's right. And that's why
you need to confront Karen.

Oh, no. Oh, no. No, I can't do that.
I tried for years to stand up to her.

Nothing ever worked.

What, so now you're gonna quit?
You can't quit.

What if Muhammad Ali had quit?

Ah, my grandchildren!

Who would like me to read them a book,

or maybe paint their name
on a grain of rice?

Honey, dinnertime!

Ah, my favorite.

Hot soup.

Right in there.

Dad, I know
you can stand up to Aunt Karen.

And maybe, if you finally do,
she'll stop terrorizing you,

and you won't have to take it out on me
for the rest of my life.

You know what, Meg?

You're right! I'm gonna do it!

-You are?
-Damn right!

Yay, Dad!

I am gonna become a lady wrestler
and defeat Heavy Flo in the ring.

Wait. What? No! What?
I meant go talk to her.

Nope, it's got to be
a lady wrestling match.

Hey, Meg, Thanksgiving's over.

Come help me
with the Christmas decorations.

Meg! Help me
with the Christmas decorations!

Comments? Questions?

-What the hell are you...
-I'm sorry. Chris had his hand up first.

Chris?

What's the capital of Maryland?

I do not know,
but that's a very good question.

Now, Lois?

Peter, what the hell are you doing?

First, it's not Peter.

When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy,
the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.

Peter, you look... Okay, that's clever...

But, Peter, you look ridiculous.
Take that off.

If you want to settle things
with your sister, just go talk to her.

No, Lois, the only way to settle
a family dispute is in the cage.

I mean, you don't understand.

Karen made me feel worse than a guy
getting cut from a baseball team.

You wanted to see me, Coach?

I'm sorry, Kyle. You can't do this boring,
stupid thing with us.

All right, Peter,
your sister's the real deal.

So I arranged for you
to get some combat pointers

from my old buddy, Steven Seagal.

Uh, this... This fat guy?

Yup. Go on, ask him anything.

How... How did...

Uh, why-why you so fat?

Okay, ask him about
anything but his weight.

(SIGHS) Uh...

Uh, you act Asian,
you look Native American,

your name is possibly Jewish.

What are you?

He fat.

All right, Peter,
most professional wrestlers

become addicted to painkillers
at some point.

So I figure, why don't we just start now?

Uh... Okay, yeah, I'm in.

Where you getting all these?

Stepdaughter's purse.

Ain't my problem.

Man, I love putting my hand down my pants
when I'm on drugs.

We should just go live on a boat
in some guy's backyard.

So, you gonna do that wrestling stuff?

Nah, I'm gonna stick with these.

I would crime for more of these.

Okay, now if you're gonna defeat
your sister in the ring,

you got to get to the root of your fears.

We got to go back to your childhood,
so I'm gonna hypnotize you.

Okay, go back.

Now, we need to go back in time.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
My jeans are husky.

Okay, further. Further.

Little further.

Now, open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

(IN DEMONIC VOICE) I see the six stations
of the Lord's order,

and they will all burn!

Okay, too far! Too far! Too far!
Come back. Come back.

Come back.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Hey, can I make my husky jeans

into cutoffs for swimming?

Ah, forget it. You're ready.

Yeah, Peter. I think you're gonna win!

(IN NORMAL VOICE) All right!
Hey, thanks for all your help, you guys.

You know, there's only two things
I've wanted to do my whole life:

put my sister in her place
and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.

(SINGING) <i>Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

<i>Come and have a howling good time</i>

<i>Ooh-ooh, aah-aah, ooh-ooh, aah-aah</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

(GRUNTING)

And we've got quite a match
tonight between Heavy Flo

and another woman
whose name I've forgotten

but I'm sure is a gross pun.

Right you are, Bill.

Tonight, she's up against
Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix.

Interesting fact: these two gals

have over eight meters
of ass crack between them.

One! Two! Three!

(CROWD CHEERING)

It's over!

And once again, a Heavy Flo
has ruined another lady's evening!

(CHEERING CONTINUES)

PETER: You ain't no champ!

Not till you go through me!

Who the hell are you?

I'm Maxi Paddy,
which is short for Maxine Patricia.

I was named after my father,
Maxwell Patrick.

But that's enough about me.
I'm here to kick your ass!

Get out of here!

I'm not fighting some fat loser
from the crowd.

Huh. It looks like this Heavy Flo is pee,
because you're yellow!

CROWD: Oh!

Well, that didn't quite track,
but the crowd seems to be on board.

It sure does!
Looks like Heavy Flo has a challenger!

All right, get up here, but make it quick.

I got a <i>Lampoon</i> reunion to get to.

Heavy Flo, always finding a way

to drop her Harvard degree
into conversation.

Yes, very off-putting, Bill.

Those of us who went to Harvard
really don't appreciate it.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(GRUNTING)

Ow! Damn it, Karen!

Karen?

Peter, is that you?
What are you doing here?

Something I should have done
a long time ago.

I'm tired of you bullying me!
You're going down!

-VENDOR: Butt-scratcher?
-Butt-scratcher!

(GRUNTING)

D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen!

CROWD: (CHANTING)
Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock!

Oh, my God, she's taking it too far!

Heavy Flo is gonna break this girl's arms!

Woman's arms. Come on, Bill.

N-N-No!

Tell... Stewie...

He's in charge of the show now.

Say hello to Teen LaQueefa!

One! Two! Three!

(CROWD CHEERING)

BILL: I don't believe it!

Heavy Flo is down,
and we have a new champion!

I tell you, this is one for the books,
if anyone kept track of this nonsense!

Wow, you really saved me!

Thanks, stranger.

Dad, it's me.

(GASPS) Meg?

It was you who saved me?

That's right, Dad.

Wow, even after all the crummy stuff
I've done to you?

-But why?
-Because you're my dad.

And I couldn't stand by
and watch you get hurt.

Wow. Thanks, Meg.

You know, that's something
even my own mom and dad never did for me.

They just stood by
and let Karen pick on me.

Well, you deserve better. We all do.

You know, Meg, I'm really sorry
I treated you so badly over the years.

I guess I was taking out
all the pain I felt on you.

I understand. Better than anybody.

But I still love you, Dad.

I love you, too, Meg.

Did somebody order
a hot-ass bitch and this lady?

Oh, you're alive.

Sorry, I was told I was in charge now.

Well, if you die, this is kind of
the creative direction I'm leaning toward.

Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.
You finally stood up for yourself.

So, Peter, have you talked to Karen?

I called, like, four times,
but she's not out of the coma yet.

Apparently, they usually use fake chairs,
but Meg used a real one.

Do they think she's gonna survive?

It could go either way.

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Hello?

No, I think I'm a different blood type.

No, I don't want to check.

Doctor says there's nothing they can do.

You know, this was the

when I was a kid.

The ladies' room has a big space

before you get back
to where the crappers are.

Good evening and welcome to Smitty's.

I'll be back with martinis
for Mom and Dad,

and for you kids, some martinis.

Dad, can you pass the bread?

Sure. But don't forget
the butter that looks like

decorative bathroom soaps
and is impossible to smear.

Thanks, Dad! This really ruins it!

What will you be having, sir?

Yes, I'll have what I had last time:
pheasant on the glass.

Don't you mean "pheasant under glass"?

Nope.

(CHIRPING)

Yeah. Now turn around
and lay an egg on the glass.

Aw, yeah.

I defy you to tell me
exactly what's wrong with this.

Oh, Peter, look.
You can put your business card

in this bowl and maybe win a free lunch.

I don't have a business card.

And I think you knew that.

I hope you enjoyed your meal, sir.

May I offer you a toothpick?

Oh, I-I don't know.

We've already spent
a lot of money in here tonight.

No, sir, it-it's free.

Oh!

Peter, that's not how you use a toothpick.

You pick your teeth with it.

I cannot believe
I have to explain this to you.

There are gaps in my knowledge.
This is hardly news.

Wow, this is awesome!

This is like
I'm having a whole second meal!

Man, this just feels right.

That's it. From here on out, I
am about all things toothpick.

I'm gonna go everywhere with
it, always be chewing on it,

and start all my sentences with,

"All right, here's what you're gonna do."

Excuse me, we're from out of town.

Where do people go to listen
to live music around here?

I'll handle this. All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

Skip the live music. Get yourself a room

over at the Wickford Marina.
Take her out on a balcony,

point to any boat in the harbor,
and tell her it's yours.

Now, you got rubbers?
Now that I'm a toothpick guy,

I call 'em rubbers.
Or you could just pull the hose

out of the bucket and let it spray free.

I've had a vasectomy.

Chris, now that I'm a toothpick
guy, it's my job to sit

on a BMX bike outside the rec center

and ask every kid if they're the new kid.

Hey. You the new kid?

-Why?
-Never mind why.

Got any cool toys?

Uh, I got an Xbox.

-How about you?
-I got a Barbie with a wiener on it.

Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe,
put it on with superglue.

Looks pretty real. Real enough, anyways.

-Does the job.
-Does what job?

You get it.

My family moves around a lot
'cause I do stuff like this.

Um, okay.

-I got to go now.
-You sure you don't want

to come over and pull on my cat's nipples?

We can do anything,
'cause my mom has two jobs.

All right, I'm off to the fish market.

What? Why?

Well, the most intimidating
people are toothpick guys

who work at seafood counters
and make people uncomfortable

for not knowing about fish.

-What's good here?
-It's all good.

-What's the freshest?
-It's all fresh.

-How 'bout the halibut? Is it gamey?
-Gamey?

-I mean, you know, is it fishy?
-It's all fish.

-Is there a special way to prepare it?
-I'd cook it up.

W-Well, what's the best fish here?

What's your favorite fish?

I don't eat fish. I only like spaghetti.

Ugh, when are you gonna
get rid of that toothpick?

It's disgusting,
and it's starting to smell.

Why would I give it up?
It's getting me tons of tail.

-What?
-And check this out.

The rare triple toothpick flip.

(CHOKING)

Oh, my God, are you all right?

(COUGHS) No, I swallowed it!

My toothpick! It's gone!

Damn it! I'm gonna need
you to put that large,

two-handed colander over the toilet.

Peter, that was
a wedding present from my aunt.

Well, let's use the ice cream maker!

We've never used it once!

Calm down. You can always
get another toothpick.

Oh, my God, you're right!

Lois, we got to drive
to Smitty's right now

-and get one.
-Now?

But we told Chris we'd be there
when he wakes up from surgery.

All right, we were able
to fix your hernia,

but you've got to stop
lifting sewer hole covers.

But the Ninja Turtles live down there.

I'm friends with them.

Hey, fat ass, I brought you flowers.

But stay out of the sewers!
We're trying to work down there.

Thanks, Donatello!

(TIRES SCREECH)

Oh, thank God!

Quick, we need another toothpick!

Thank you, Maurice.

Just get your toothpick
and let's get out of here.

Ugh. No, thanks.

That old lady has ruined
toothpicks for me.

Just like how Meg ruined broccoli.

Hey, Meg, look, they're little trees!

No, they're not.

They're not?

Hey, Peter!

Oh, look, there's Quagmire
and his transgendered mother,

which is now great.

Hey, Quagmire. Hey, Ida.

I didn't know you liked Smitty's.

Oh, yeah, I've been coming here for ages.

They even named a sandwich after me.

It's an inside-out hot dog
slathered in ketchup.

Please, please join us.

Oh, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your brave dinner.

Nonsense, we're happy to have you.

All right, but we already ate dinner,

so maybe just an iceberg wedge,
a steak and some sides.

And then I said something random
that suggested

a whole crazy story!

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, God, that's hilarious, Lois.

I could listen to you talk all night.

Yeah, but we got to get going.
Carter's our babysitter,

and if he's with the kids too
long, they start saying racisms.

Aw, I wish the fun didn't have to end.

I always enjoy spending time with you two.

Well, why don't you come over tomorrow?

We'll fire up the grill and have
the gang over for a cookout.

-Well, that sounds wonderful.
-Well, great, we'll be there!

Hey, before you two
leave, let's take a photo.

Yeah! Selfie! (LAUGHS)

I just learned that word.

Perfect! Well, good night, you guys.

See you tomorrow, hashtags!

You're not doing that right.

Boy, that Lois is really
something, isn't she?

Yeah. Peter's a lucky guy.

Glenn, do you...

do you have feelings for her?

What? (SCOFFS) No.

A mother always knows.

You like to play the
field, but, deep down,

you really wish you had a
woman like Lois, don't you?

No, I don't want a woman <i>like</i> Lois.

I want Lois.

She's perfect. I've loved her for years.

She's warm and kind and beautiful.

I've never been so in love with anyone.

Glenn, that's very sweet,

but you're talking about
your best friend's wife.

I know, I know. It's wrong.

And Peter's a good friend.

Not like Cleveland.

Hey, I got two of these phone books.

Didn't know if you wanted one.

Hey, how long have we known each other?

Long time. And yet we've never
discussed mothers' maiden names,

the names of old pets,
high school mascots,

favorite teachers.

Heck, I don't even know

the last four digits of your Social.

Cleveland, do you need
to borrow some money?

I do! They're gonna kill Donna!

-Really? No. I just want
-to buy a man's fur coat.

Get out of here.

(DISTANT KNOCKING)

-(DOOR OPENS IN DISTANCE)
-Hey, Peter,

I had an extra phone book, and I...

-PETER: I'm not buying you that coat!
-(DOOR SLAMS)

(SNORING)

(COUGHING) Huh? Who? What?

Yeah, what? What? Which
doggy in what window?

So, how'd everything go?

Hard to tell. I was
coughing the whole time.

By the way, I couldn't figure
out how to use your oven,

so I destroyed it in a blind rage.

Well, good night.

Ooh, after that steak, I got
to go lay down on the toilet.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

Huh. Looks like I got
a couple of messages.

-(BANGING NOISES OVER PHONE)
-STEWIE (RECORDED): <i>Uh, Dad? Dad?</i>

<i>Grandpa's going nuts on the oven.</i>
<i>Can you come home quick?</i>

Who the hell is that?

Huh. There's one from Quagmire.

(MUFFLED CONVERSATION)

Huh, must've pocket-dialed me again.

QUAGMIRE (OVER PHONE): <i>I want Lois.</i>
<i>She's perfect.</i>

<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

<i>She's warm and kind and beautiful.</i>

<i>I've never been so in love with anyone.</i>

Oh, my God!

Quagmire's in love with my wife?

-(PHONE VIBRATES)
-Hello?

LOIS (OVER PHONE):
<i>Peter, I'm having troubles on the toilet.</i>

<i>Bring the ice cream maker.</i>

Brian, there's something I
got to talk to you about.

Quagmire pocket-dialed me last night.

You got to hear this.

QUAGMIRE (OVER PHONE):
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

Oh, my God!

He's in love with Lois?

Yeah, and if you keep
listening, you can hear

a Puerto Rican busboy get
fired in the background.

It's pretty funny. He cries.

But can you believe Quagmire?

Well, I guess it's not that shocking.

I mean, he has said 100 times
that he wants to bang Lois.

No, no, no, that's just
Quagmire being a horn-dog.

This is love. I don't know.

I think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

Too big a deal? The guy's
been sitting next to me

all these years,
acting like he's my friend,

when all he really wants
is to be with my wife!

Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you,

he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.

You know what? I'm going
over there right now

and hit him with a shovel, like
a white trash YouTube girl.

Peter, wait, wait. Listen.

Delete that message
and pretend you never heard it.

What? Why?

Because you weren't meant to hear it.

If you act on this, all you'll
do is wreck your friendship

and cause heartache for everyone involved.

What, so what am I supposed
to do, just ignore it?

Yeah. Ignore it.

Like you do with the ghost
of that colonial woman

who died falling down our stairs.

(MOANING) I saw you eat a crayon.

It was purple. I thought it was grape.

Look, you've got to be the bigger man.

You got to just keep this to yourself.

(SIGHS) Fine, I won't say anything.

Good. And don't be
passive-aggressive, either.

Like one of those songs in an old musical.

(JAUNTY MELODY PLAYS)

<i>You're hideous</i>

<i>To be without</i>

<i>You're big and fat</i>

<i>In the heart, no doubt</i>

<i>You're a horrible loss</i>

<i>If you won't be my wife</i>

<i>You're a raging, continuous</i>

<i>Love in my life...</i>

Pretty good turnout for this thing.

Oh, yeah, Mort <i>and</i> Neil Goldman.

It's like Coachella.

There's that son of a bitch.

He's got some nerve showing up here.

Peter, remember what we talked about.

Look at them clouds up there.

Yeah, that one look like Nathan.

That one look like Shawn.

And there go Wanya over there.

How blessed are we to have
all them Boyz II Men

just floating around in the sky?

Glenn! Ida! You made it!

Hey, Lois. I brought the
hamburger buns, like you wanted.

I wasn't sure what people like,

so I got some with seeds on them
and some without.

What does he mean by that, "seeds"?

Like semen? Is that what he means?

Semen on her buns.
Am I the only one hearing this?

Get the hell away from my wife,
you scumbag!

Peter, what are you talking about?

I'll tell you what I'm talking about!

I'm talking about this!

PETER (RECORDED): <i>Idea for a movie.</i>

Fop Cop.<i> It's a cop</i>
<i>who's, like, a fancy guy.</i>

Nobody heard that! None of you take that!

What I meant to play was this.

QUAGMIRE (RECORDED):
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

<i>Fop Cop. </i>That could work.

Glenn... i-is this true?

Wait a minute, how the hell'd
you get that recording, Peter?

You pocket-dialed me, you bastard!

Peter, that was a private conversation.

That doesn't change the fact
that you want to steal my wife!

Hey, get your hands off me!

LOIS: Oh, my God!

JOE: Oh, come on, you two.
CLEVELAND: Come on, now.

Hey, what are y'all doing? Stop! Stop it!

Kill him, Dad! Murder him!

(QUAGMIRE AND PETER GRUNTING)

That's it! End of cookout!

Get out of my house, and don't
ever speak to me again!

Wow, that turned ugly fast.

Just like my trip to Tampa Bay.

Hey, city boy, what's with the arm pants?

QUAGMIRE (RECORDED):
<i>I want Lois. She's perfect.</i>

<i>I've loved her for years.</i>

(GROANS) You're still
listening to that thing?

It's like, I can't even process
why he'd feel this way.

Maybe... you know, maybe
play it one more time and...

I can't believe this.

I thought Quagmire was my friend!

Peter, it's not that surprising.

He's always had a potent sex drive.

Remember his grandmother's funeral?

(QUIETLY) Yeah, get it in there.

Oh, I <i>wish</i> this was about sex.

If he was just home
busting one to his buddy's wife,

hell, we've all done that.

I've heard. Allegedly.

But not often. And never to Donna.

Except when she wore
those shiny gold shorts

to parent-teacher night.

Oh, yeah, that was hilarious.

(LAUGHS) Yeah, that was...
that was so tacky.

But if Quagmire actually
has feelings for you,

I'm afraid he might take you away from me.

Peter, nobody's taking me anywhere.

I love <i>you.</i>

-Mmm.
-I love you, too, Lois.

Hey, you ever heard any of the other wives

saying they're attracted to me?

(LAUGHS)

No, um, not that I recall, no.

Look, now that this is settled,

maybe you and Glenn can
put this behind you.

No way! How am I supposed
to be friends with someone

who's in love with my wife?

Quagmire is dead to me

and needs to be dealt with
in an appropriate manner.

Shame.

Shame.

Shame.

(BELL RINGS)

Shame.

(TO <i>CHAIN OF FOOLS) </i>
<i>Shame, shame, shame</i>

<i>Shame on you-hoo</i>

<i>Shame, shame, shame</i>

<i>Shame on Q...</i>

This was serious, but it
turned into something fun.

Glenn? Is that you?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

I was just buying a...
a... grocery store cane.

See you, Lois.

Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter

aren't gonna talk this out,
you and I should.

What's there to talk about?

Everyone knows I'm in love
with my best friend's wife.

It's pathetic. And humiliating.

Glenn...

I can't trust myself around you.

It's probably best if I...
just never see you again.

Well, you can't just avoid me forever.

We live on the same street.

Mm.

Well, then... I know what I have to do.

Goodbye, Lois.

Oh, sour cream.

You wanted me to remind you.

Sour cream.

Mr. Quagmire, which box
do these beads go in?

Let me smell 'em.

They go in the big box.

Quagmire, I can't believe you're moving.

Look, give it time...
this whole thing will blow over.

No, it's too awkward.

It's best for everyone if I just leave.

That's too bad.

We never got to do
that "Joe-Quagmire" lunch.

Well, that'll do it.

Peter, Quagmire's serious about this.

You got to do something!

You're right.

Quagmire, wait!

You almost left without this!

You want me to be the one
that says "jiggety" now?

TV ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return to</i> Dateline.

<i>Our story tonight:</i>
<i>The guy you think did it?</i>

<i>He did it.</i>

<i>Now go to bed.</i>

<i>Your grandkids are coming tomorrow.</i>

I had a pretty good egg dish last night.

What? What-what am I supposed
to do with that information?

Well, I don't know.
Maybe ask me for the recipe?

-Do you have it?
-No.

So what's going on with you guys?

Nothing much.

See, this is where Quagmire
normally would have told

one of his outrageous sex stories.

Aw, we don't need him.
I got a sex story for you.

So I'm banging this chick,
and she's saying to me,

"I'm worried that Chris won't
get into college."

And then I says to her,

"Yeah, that seems like
a legitimate concern."

And then I lost my wood,
and so we just watched <i>Colbert,</i>

and then I took a dump completely nude.

Who else but Peter?

Peter, face it,
without Quagmire, we're boring.

Oh, come on, that ain't true.

Yes, it is. He had all the fun ideas.

Remember? He even took me parasailing.

This is awesome! It's like I'm flying!

(WHOOPING)

I've never felt so alive!

Oh, if only I had a pair of legs.

All right!

(MUNCHING LOUDLY)

It was the fish part of me
that wanted 'em!

(SIGHS)

Look, Peter, I'm sorry
Quagmire moved away,

but you can't just sit around
the house and drink all day.

It's all your fault
Quagmire fell in love with you.

Traipsin' around in your tan pants

and your green shirt
and your soothing voice.

My fault?

Yeah, everything is messed up.

I lost my best friend,
my buddies are all fighting,

that chick at work is saying
stuff that ain't true.

Okay, you know what?

Enough feeling sorry for yourself.

We're fixing this now. Get in the car.

-What? Why?
-You'll see.

Why should I trust you?

You're always tricking me into
going places I don't want to.

Oh. You said we were going
to a place Walt Disney built.

No, Peter. I said "supported."

(BRIGHT FANFARE PLAYING,
FIREWORKS WHISTLING)

LOIS: By the way,
don't go on the train ride.

I've been playing a game I invented

called "mini racquetball" in your garage.

Uh-huh. It's pretty fun.

He has not won a single point.

You don't have to win to have fun.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Lois?

Peter. Zod.

Hey. You're parked behind
my trapezoid-thing.

Yeah, yeah, I'll move it in a sec.

Glenn, all this nonsense has to stop now.

The only reason
this became an issue is because

Peter heard something
he wasn't supposed to hear.

CLEVELAND: Guy from <i>Superman</i> lives here?

And the truth is,
we all have private thoughts

we don't act on, and that's okay.

For instance, every time
I'm on the subway,

I want to push a stranger onto the tracks.

And that's fine!

I don't do it!

I guess you're right.

I don't <i>totally</i> disagree with
what Kim Jong-un's doing,

but you don't see me moving there.

I take medicine
I get from the veterinarian.

Is that one?

No, no, it's not, but the point is,

we all have secret thoughts.

But there's no reason they
should ruin our friendships.

Sometimes I think about
going to the hospital

and switching the babies around.

Somali pirates seem cool, too.

I wouldn't mind eating
the Phillie Phanatic.

See? We're all terrible people inside.

Joe's a little worse than the rest of us,

but we all just shove
our thoughts deep down

where they can't hurt anybody.

Huh, maybe you're right.

Of course I'm right.

The secret to happiness is
burying all your true feelings

and living a life of bland compromise.

So here's the question, Glenn.

Do you love Peter enough
to repress your love for me?

Peter, if you're willing
to forget all about this,

I'm more than happy to continue
hiding my true feelings.

I do miss us hanging out together.

Huh. Sorry I kind of went a little crazy.

Ah, that's all right.

And I'm sorry
I will always love your wife.

Which I don't.

Thank you, Glenn.

All right!

What do you say we all celebrate
with a game of mini racquetball?

Wait. Is mini racquetball just Ping-Pong?

Kind of.

Boy, it's good to have
the gang together again.

Yeah, welcome home, buddy.

Man, I missed sitting around,
just shooting the breeze.

Hey, so how'd you get your house back?

This ought to be good.

I suspended escrow.

Oh.

Hey, guys, you know that egg
dish I was talking about?

Turns out that was just a dream I had.

Of course not, he'll be dead weight.

You can't do a bull run

We didn't want to tell
you, but we're going

didn't think you could keep up.

Okay, you can come.

I don't really think you're a whore.

Great, honey.

Oh. Oh, my God, that was close.

Yeah, but think about it.

As long as he thinks you're our new pet,

we can keep fooling
around behind his back.

Huh, you're right.

Wow, this could be an even better scam

than that claw machine at the arcade.

What am I gonna do?

Well, seems like you folks
have this all taken care of.

-(DOOR OPENS)
-PEOPLE: Surprise!

HARTMAN: Oh, you guys!

Hey, don't go in that room back there.

It's, like, super sad.

Coming up, quintuplets
born at Quahog General.

What? That's...

Oh, that's supposed to be "burn"?

Oh, coming up, quintuplets
burn at Quahog General.

Hey, honey, get in here.

Check this out... the way he's sitting,

it looks like the dog's watching the news.

You like watching the news, you dumb dog?

Well, I'm off to do what
former Navy SEALs do...

sell lawn mowers.

Wow, he really has no idea.

Hey, want to take a shower with me?

Sure.

Man, this is a pretty sweet gig.

Like being a member of Daft Punk.

(FRENCH ACCENT)
Look at this old Casio keyboard

from the 1980s that I have found.

Watch what happens
when I push this demo button.

Hello, Daft Punk?

Great song. Here's a Grammy.

Oh-ho-ho!

(FRENCH ACCENT) You know, is funny.

Until you spoke, I did
not know we were French!

There you go, Joe. All settled.

Now, which wall would you like to look at

for the rest of your life?

I don't know, maybe that one.

I-I have no idea
what you're pointing at, Joe.

You got to meet us halfway.

Look, guys, I don't want
to be a burden to anyone.

You go ahead and live your lives.

I'll be fine.

We can't just leave you, Joe.

So before we go, I'm gonna
put the remote in your mouth.

Here's a can of chili.

And the opener we'll put... in your mouth.

And here's a magazine I thought
you might like to read.

I'm gonna put it in your mouth.

(GRUNTS)

(MUFFLED) You're a good friend, Peter.

Joe, I just wish we could do more,

but obviously your mouth is full.

And you probably don't want
any reminders of Bonnie

around the house, so I cleared
out all of her underwear.

Okay, don't be a stranger.

Yeah, 'cause we're not
supposed to talk to those.

I don't know, I'm not sure
I feel right about leaving Joe.

Doesn't seem like he's gonna be
able to take care of himself.

Yeah, we're-we're kind of all he has now.

What... Joe?

What're you talking about?

He's fine.

Look, he's already watching
<i>The Price Is Right</i> in there.

Oop, he's biting too hard on the volume.

<i>(THE PRICE IS RIGHT </i>THEME SONG PLAYING)

Okay, you can play over there
in the sandbox, honey.

Mommy's just gonna read her book.

Okay, I'm just gonna walk 30 feet away,

and then panic because I can't see you.

Can you fit me in at 10:00 tomorrow?

It's getting a little long on the sides.

Brian? What are you doing on a leash?

And who's that?

(SHUSHES) Be cool.

This is the guy whose wife I'm banging.

Oh, what a romantic way to put it.

Yeah, it's great.

I just pretend to be their dog,
and then when he leaves for work,

I get to go to the <i>pound,</i>
if you know what I mean.

God, Brian, you are such a scumbag.

I can't believe you...

Mommy! Mommy! Where's my mommy?

I have no one and nothing!

LOIS: I'm right here, honey.

Oh, thank God.

She's such a gross hog.

Joe, you can't just sit here.

You need intellectual stimulation.

So I brought something to read to you.

It's the word search
from the <i>Sunday Circular.</i>

"Kangaroo."

Let's see if we can find that one.

"Outback."

I think it's an Australian theme.

"Koala."

It definitely is.

Can't make out this one.

"Abor... Aborgine...

"Aborgina"?

That's what they call eggplant down there.

You know what? Forget this.

I'll just read to you from <i>Jet.</i>

Look, this whole page is
all the Wayans brothers

sitting in different positions.

How you suppose they come up
with all them positions?

You could give me a million years.

I just ain't wired that way.

Marlon's like a rubber man.

He can sit in any kind of way.

Here's Keenan telling the
younger ones how to sit.

(SCOFFS) Like they gonna listen.

Damon's doing his own thing.

No surprise there.

That's Damon.

You enjoying all this, Joe?

I'm honestly just glad it seems

like you have something you like.

Hey, my laptop's out of battery.

You want to have sex?

Sure, I've almost finished
my sandwich, anyway.

Oh, come on, I don't want
to have to watch this.

VIC: Yeah, that's right.

I was the only one
who didn't get to meet Biden.

(GROANS) You know what?

Screw this. I'm out of here.

Ha! Skewered.

VIC: Hey!

Where do you think you're going?

You're my dog.

You're not going anywhere.

Besides, I need you, boy.

Now more than ever.

I think my wife is cheating on me.

BRIAN (OVER VOICEMAIL):
<i>Hey, Tori, it's Brian.</i>

<i>I'm getting the Chinese food for us.</i>

<i>I think I'm gonna order</i>
<i>some Me Like Bang Ho.</i>

(LAUGHS) <i>That's-that's not a real thing,</i>

<i>I'm talking about sex.</i>

<i>All right, I'll be there in five.</i>

Man, when I find that son of a bitch,

I'm gonna rip his head off.

God, what a nightmare.

That guy's even scarier
than a thesaurus-asaurus.

Tread, stomp, trudge.

Growl, roar, ululate.

Antonym... whisper.

What's wrong with him?

-He's on the spectrum.
-"Spectrum"?

In my day we'd throw him in the army
and have him play the bugle.

Peter, this just isn't working.

We can't take proper care of Joe.

It's a huge amount of work

and we don't have
any idea what we're doing.

Quagmire's right. It's too much.

I just think he'd be better off
under the care of grumpy, Filipino nurses.

Yeah, that's why I looked into it,

and we've reserved a place for him

at the State Home for
Mentals and Bastards.

Oh, my God, sometimes
they whip them with hoses...

outside? This is perfect!

Hi, I work here.

I don't think this guy works here.

Hi, can I help you?

Yeah, this is Joe Swanson.

We arranged for a 9:15 dump-off?

Go on, guys, get out of here.

I'll be fine.

-Bye, Joe.
-Take care, man.

See ya, Joe.

Hold on, guys.

There's one last thing
I got to say to my friend.

Hey, Joe, you know
that movie you told me to watch

that you said was
your favorite movie of all time,

and you said I had to watch it?

<i>Backdraft...</i> you finally watched it?

Yeah. Wasn't it great?

I thought it was stupid.

Take care, Joe.

You know, tha-that state home we
left Joe in didn't seem so bad.

Yeah, it's got to be good.

I mean, Napoleon Bonaparte was there.

Would the French people
let their boss walk around

in stained underwear,
trying to stab people

if the place wasn't nice?

Yeah, no, no,
y-you're right, you're right.

Joe will get much better care there.

I still feel bad.

Come on, you guys. Joe's gonna be fine.

He'll fit in great there.

Not like when I went to Hogwarts.

Slytherin.

Hufflepuff.

Housing for registered sex offenders!

Aw.

Oh, Tori, thank God.

Listen, you got to unchain me.

Look what Vic did.

Tell me about it.

He's lost his mind.

That's why I'm gonna go stay
with my mother in Baltimore

and work at her wife's bar.

Wait, what?

Tori, come back!

Damn it!

Wow, shocker.

Your gross hookup
from the car wash ended poorly?

Stewie, thank God!
How'd you find me?

Well, you remember
when the vet knocked you out

to take out that rotten tooth?

He also put a tracking chip in your neck.

What? That's a total
violation of my rights!

Heh, I like how you're
chained up in a yard

and still trying to pretend you're a guy.

Look, you got to help me.

Her husband's a maniac and the
only reason he hasn't killed me

is because he thinks I'm just his pet dog.

Hmm, he's got a padlock on here.

But don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

Well, hurry, 'cause I'm trapped
like a baseball announcer.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And the count is two and two.</i>

<i>Garcia steps off the mound again,</i>

<i>I agree.</i>

<i>Hey, I don't know if you can hear it,</i>

<i>but I'm peeing in my coffee cup right now.</i>

There you are.

Where the hell have you been?

I got arrested for huckin'
a TV/VCR combo off the dam.

Off the damn what?

Off the damn overpass.

(LAUGHS) Oh...

God, I love you, Lois.

That was like great sex.

But seriously, it-it was bad.

It hit a school bus.

Oh, my God!

Well-well, can you go talk to Joe?

Maybe he can put in a word for
you down at the police station.

Yeah, yeah, Joe, yeah, may...
yeah, maybe, maybe.

Do you, uh, you-you want a back rub?

Peter, what's going on?

Uh, what do you mean?

Whenever you offer me a back rub,

it means you're hiding something.

(GUNFIRE)

(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

You, hey, you-you want a back rub?

We may or may not have put Joe

in a smelly home for the goofy.

What? Peter, those places
are a horror show!

Joe's your friend!

How could you treat him like that?

We just couldn't handle him
being fully paralyzed.

We didn't know what else to do.

But you're right.

We got to get him out of there.

You most certainly do.

All right, how about that back rub now?

What are you, nuts?

What the hell do you want?

Oh, hello, sir.

I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

I believe you found our dog,
and we need to take him home.

No way! Get lost, kid.

He's my dog now.

Well, we figured you'd say no to us,

but not to Vice President Joe Biden!

Oh, my God!

Mr. Vice President!

First, I want to thank you, Vic,

for shooting the guy
we said was Osama bin Laden.

Second, give these kids their dog back.

Of course, sir, I'm so sorry!

Here, take him!

Thank you.

You're a great American.

Thanks, Mr. Biden!

No problem.

Hey, you guys watch <i>Veep?</i>

-No.
-Yeah, it's all fake.

Yeah, we said no.

Hi, uh, we're here to pick up Joe Swanson.

Are you from the news?

You have to tell us
if you're from the news.

No, we're his friends.

-What are you guys doing here?
-We came to bring you home, Joe.

We're all really sorry we abandoned you.

Yeah, we just kind of got
overwhelmed and all freaked out.

But we're your friends, Joe.

And we'll always be there
for you no matter what.

Thanks, guys.

I'd say let's get my stuff,
but it's all been stolen.

That's okay.
Come on, let's go home.

Sorry, no one gets out of here

without a release from their doctor.

All right, we'll just call him right now.

(PHONE RINGING)

What's that ringing?

Joe, that ringing...
it's coming from your back!

It is?

Holy crap!

Dr. Hartman must have
dropped his phone in Joe

when he was looking at his spine!

Oh, thank God.

I've been hearing that ringing all week.

I just thought I was losing my mind

from lunatics screaming in my face.

Your mother's a whore!

I told you that in confidence, Gary.

Ah, it's so great to have you back, Joe.

You seem good as new.

Yeah, it turns out
Dr. Hartman's cell phone

was pressing on my spinal cord,

and that's what was causing
my total paralysis.

Yeah, sorry we dropped
the ball for a while,

which is the way we agreed we'd
describe what we did to you,

which hopefully
makes it seem less heinous.

It's all right, guys.

I'm just glad to be back on my feet.

Well, you know what I mean.

(LAUGHTER)

PETER: <i>I never saw much of Joe after that.</i>

<i>And while he's been gone</i><i>for many years,</i>

<i>I've never forgotten his face</i>

<i>or his laughter.</i>

Come on, are we going to the beach?

We've been waiting forever.

Yeah, be right there, champ.

He said that the first two times we asked.

I know, he spaces out
when he's at the computer.

PETER: <i>These aren't my kids.</i>

<i>And also, this isn't</i><i>play wrestling.</i>

<i>We're actually fighting.</i>

<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

Hey, great idea bringing
the couch out here

-from your den, Peter.
-Yeah, Lois and I

dragged it out here last night
for a little hump sesh,

so I figured I'd let it dry.

"Couch." That's one of those words

that if you say it over and over

it starts to sound silly.

Joe, you need
to take a class on small talk.

You're not gonna believe this...
I'm in one.

It sure is cloudy today.

Good. You could have
also responded to Janet,

who said her son died.

I'm sorry your son died
on such a cloudy day.

All right, kids, here's your bacon.

-I call the paper towel!
-Aw, damn it!

Ha-ha! You got to move fast
when Meg's at the table, Brian.

All right, well, I get the box
when we have pizza for dinner.

(MUFFLED) Uh-uh.
It doesn't work that way.

You got to call it when it's happening.

Good morning, family.
I'll be out front

with the guys if anybody needs me.

Peter, I thought we were gonna try

to get the garden going again today.

I know, sweetie, but then
I realized how stupid that is.

Okay, bye. You guys are my everything.

Why'd you ever marry him?

Believe it or not, he used
to look like a young Gene Hackman.

That's... that's not even good.

It's gone!

What? What's gone?

Our drinking couch!
Somebody must've stole it!

You left a couch out on the curb?

Well, somebody probably thought
it was trash and took it.

You said you were gonna bring
the couch right back in!

-What were you thinking?
-I'll tell you what I was thinking.

I was thinking we lived
in a safe neighborhood.

But apparently, I was wrong!

Wait, you're saying
you were wr... wr...

wro... wrrr...

Oh, I get it...
the Fonz can't say "wrong."

No, Peter, he's 70...
he's having a stroke.

(GROANING)

Wow, Peter, I think
starting a community watch

-is a great idea.
-Yeah, I even got shirts made up for us.

This is quality work.

Where did you get these?
Via the Web?

Hey, listen, Joe,

you think you can get us all guns?

No, Peter, they're too dangerous.

Besides, you can't just go get a gun,

you have to be certified in gun safety,

go through an extensive
background screening process.

-Got 'em.
-Whoa.

How'd you get 'em so quick?

It was easy...
like pressing that "easy" button

at the office supply store.

-Hey, thanks for all your help.
-No problem.

Why don't you go ahead
and hit the "easy" button.

Okay.

What did I just do?
Don't worry about it.

Hey, Quagmire, you're a sex guy.

You watch any good pornos lately?

I mean... I guess.

So what's your pleasure?

What kind of movies you like?

I don't know.
MILF stuff's kind of cool.

What... what about you?

Me? I have very particular tastes.

-I like a soapy bottom.
-What?

Soft-core soaped-up butts,

like from a PG-13 camp movie.

I can't get enough of it.
Drives me wild.

Okay, let's talk
about something else.

All right...

it's kind of too cool
for the air-conditioner

and too warm for the heater, huh?

(GROANS)

Ah, got to walk that boner off, huh?

Yeah.

Hey, guys, you better come with me.

There's some weird, big-nose guy
hiding in the bushes

outside some chick's house.

"Come to my chamber at once."

-And bring pound cake.
-"And bring pound cake."

Peter, please come to bed.

Enough of the community watch.

We live on a very safe street.

Lois, you wouldn't believe
the things we see out there.

There was a kid riding his bike
while holding a tennis racket.

-For real.
-Come on! Let's fool around,

or watch a movie,

or finally click that

Lois, I am an unelected vigilante,

and I take my job very seriously.

Hey, George, want to go to the park?

Thank you, but no.

It's a beautiful day...
lots of mischief to get into.

I don't doubt that,

but as you can see,
I'm pretty busy.

I'm trying to get
a head start on my taxes.

Oh, I see... trying
to figure out a way

to deduct <i>bananas?</i>

'Cause I eat bananas. Terrific.

Hey, your inside,
so don't wear a hat.

Unless you're leaving,
which would be terrific also.

Cleveland Jr.?

Mr. Griffin! You shot me!

Oh, my God!

LOIS (CALLS):
Peter, where are you?

Peter? Okay, I'm starting
<i>The Good Wife</i> without you.

Phew! Heh.

Unlike you, I just dodged a bullet.

Okay, next is the... brown family.

Oh. Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.

Sometimes I write descriptions
of my patients

to help me remember them.

No, it's okay. Our last name is Brown.

(EXHALES) Oh, okay. Phew.

Ah, then this must be
"Chubster Dumb-Dumb."

(LOUD CLATTERING)

NURSE: I'm sorry, sir. No visitors.

Excuse me, I'll have you know
I'm the shooter!

So, how's he doing?

"How's he doing"?
How do you think he's doing!

You shot my son!

Look, Cleveland, I'm real sorry.

I thought someone was breaking
into your house, and I panicked.

It was dark. I...

I don't know
why he didn't just say it was him.

I couldn't hear you.
I was listening to music,

I went to turn it down,
and the next thing I know,

you shot me!

Why the hell
were you climbing in the window

of your own house anyway?

My dad says opening the door

lets out too much air-conditioning.

I already have a bullet in my son,

I don't need one in my wallet.

You wouldn't have fired
that gun if he was white!

That's not true... I'll shoot anybody.

Joe, give me your gun.

Here you go... Hey, wait a second!

Look, let's all just calm down.

Calm down?

I want this racist out the room,

and I want him arrested!

Racist? I put these gloves on
for everybody.

Oh, oh, you're talking to him.

Look, the police department
has deemed the shooting accidental.

Given the circumstances,
Peter was within his rights

to fire his weapon.

And what about my son's rights
not to be<i></i>shot?

Look, Cleveland...

Lat... Latisha?

I thought he had a gun.

I'd never want to do anything
to hurt you or your family.

You're my friend.

I was your friend.

Now, get out of here!

You're nothing but a worthless bigot!

Wow, I really messed up.

I haven't felt this bad
since I drove by that speed sign.

Aw...

Hey, does anybody know
if Cleveland's coming by?

I was hoping to apologize
and collect his deposit

-for the community watch shirts.
-I talked to him earlier.

He... he doesn't want
to be anywhere near you.

Hey, look, they're talking
about the shooting.

Good evening. Two nights ago

there was a shooting right here
in our own backyard.

The victim: a 14-year-old boy
named Cleveland Brown Jr.

Joining me tonight
is his father, Cleveland Brown.

So that's not really Quahog?
It's just a big picture?

Now, Mr. Brown, I understand
you're trying to get the police

to reopen the investigation.

That's right, Tom.
My family and I believe

this shooting was a hate crime,
and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin

held accountable for his actions.

Hate crime? That's crazy!

I love all people!

I love blacks, I love Asians...

hell, I even love gay Aborigines.

Wow, this is just great, Peter.

Everyone in town hates us now.

The cashier at the grocery store
told her to "push on,"

and then she snapped her fingers,

and now I think she's my new
favorite lady in the world.

I don't understand. I'm not a racist.

It's well documented
that my dream three-way

is S. Epatha Merkerson
and CCH Pounder.

S., this is CCH.

CCH, this is S.

It is my intention that we conduct this

with both sexiness and dignity.

Peter, this is a hot-button issue.

I mean, you shot
an African-American kid.

Of course this isn't just gonna go away.

Well, there's got to be something I can do
to make things right.

I'll just have to prove to everybody
that I'm not a racist.

-How are you gonna do that?
-Well, for starters,

I'm gonna head over to the YMCA.

There's nothing black guys like more

than out-of-shape
indoor-basketball white guys.

(DERISIVE LAUGHTER)

Hey! I'm trying my best here.

And trying is what matters most of all.

You're right, Peter.

We need to give you a chance,

no matter what color your skin is.

Come on, let's play some ball.

"...and then Peter and his new friends
went for ice cream."

The end.

Okay, kids, are your parents
out of the room?

Good. Let's get back
to <i>Sloppy Floppers</i> magazine.

What are you doing?

Lois, to show I'm in touch
with what it's like

to be African-American,
I am gonna go to the middle

of the town square, get naked
and paint myself brown.

No, no, that's offensive.

You can't pretend to be black.

That's a stupid idea.

-What?
-(YELLS) It's a stupid idea!

You're a stupid man!
A stupid, stupid man!

Ow, you're hurting me!
Stop it, stop it, Lois!

No! I'm so sick of your crap.

Why do you always
do these stupid things?

And why do you always announce
them to me before you do them?

Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

Are you happy now?
Is this what you want?

Oh, no, it's not what I want!

It's not what I want.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

(PETER SOBBING)

It's never been this bad before.
What do we do?

What we always do.

I'm in charge of my head...
that much I know!

What the hell
are you doing on my property?

Look, it's time we bury the hatchet.

So I brought a bottle
of your favorite booze.

Now let's just have a drink
and put this all behind us.

I don't want nothing from you.

Well, hold on, I got something else.

Cigars. We can smoke 'em together,
all happy,

like a bunch of douche bags
outside a wedding.

Peter, get out of here.

I'm never gonna forgive you
for what you did.

Aw, come on.
This'll change your mind.

Oh, my God!
Quick, do something!

It's not working. Get rid of it!

Oh, thank God, Joe.

No, Peter, I'm here to place you
under arrest

for the attempted murder
of Cleveland Jr.

What are you talkin' about?
You know it was an accident.

Yeah, but let's just say,
public opinion has shifted.

And the boys upstairs said
they can no longer ignore it.

Who the hell are the "boys upstairs?"

I have no idea. There's no elevator.

But whoever they are,

they're pretty steamed
about this whole thing.

Peter, what's going on?

They're taking me to jail!

Oh, my God!

Then... we'll see what happens.

Oh, no. It's already working.

Griffin, you have a visitor.

-Carter? What are you doing here?
-Hello, Griffin.

I'd like to talk to you
about these charges

that have been
brought against you.

Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

I... guess I'll see you in a little bit?

It's gonna feel like an eternity.

How is it that I'm only
just now meeting you?

Look, Carter, you got to believe me.

I didn't shoot Cleveland Jr.
because he was black!

Hey, you don't have
to tell me that.

But the media's out there
making you look like a monster,

all for exercising
your constitutional rights.

Grover's a monster.

But don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of this.

I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back

and let them do this
to one of my own.

-What, you mean your family?
-Huh?

Oh, yeah, yeah, that. Yeah, right.

Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here,

set you up with my lawyer,
and get these charges dropped.

Well, how you gonna do that?

Don't worry.
I'll come up with a good story,

and they'll eat it up.

Don't worry, Mr. Griffin.

You're every bit as sympathetic

as this chubby-cheeked cocoa angel.

I haven't been listening.
What's goin' on?

I don't think it's lost on any of us

that the laws are written on white paper.

Yeah, white paper.

I was the mastermind
behind this whole thing!

Your witness.

All right, watch this.

This is where we take control
of the situation.

Mr. Brown, you testified
that you were listening to music

-at the time of the shooting.
-That's right.

-And isn't Jay-Z music?
-Yes.

And doesn't he have the lyrics,
"I put the gun to you.

"I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up,

"put ya inside the mattress
like drug money"?

(GALLERY GASPING)

I was listening
to Neil Sedaka's Hanukkah album.

And isn't true
that your last name

is the same as Chris Brown's?

Yes, but I don't see what...

And what did Chris Brown do to Rihanna?

He hit her, like, a hundred times.

Your Honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence

this photo of a badly beaten Rihanna

as well as this print ad
for the <i>Entourage</i> movie.

Why?

I can't unsee this!

Who is this for?

What's he doing?

He's making Cleveland Jr.
look like a thug.

I know. That's the idea.

You don't want to go
back to jail, do you?

I don't know.

Maybe.

Mr. Brown, please pick up this knife.

Aah! He's got a knife!

Carter, I think this has
all kind of gone too far.

What do you think you're doing?

I'm gonna make this right.

Everyone! Everyone!

Listen, I have something to say.

Cleveland Jr. doesn't deserve any of this.

All those things you heard
about Cleveland Jr. were lies.

He didn't do anything to me.

He's a good kid, from a good family.

I just got scared,
and I did something stupid.

I swear, it had nothing to do
with the color of his skin,

but... I did shoot him.

I deserve to be held
responsible for my actions.

Even if that means going to jail.

You heard him, other cops.

Let's take him in.

He doesn't know our names, does he?

I don't think he does.

Wait a minute.

Peter didn't shoot my son.

I did.

(CROWD GASPS)

Peter was just taking the blame for me.

He's a good friend.

Mr. Brown, what exactly are you saying?

I'm saying that I,
Cleveland Brown, a black man,

shot Cleveland Brown, Jr.,

another black man.

Wait, where did everybody go?

You want to make the media go away?

Just mention black-on-black crime.

Boy, the world we live in, huh?

Brian, reach into Meg's pocket.

Go ahead, Brian.

I... I don't want to.

Cleveland, why did you do that?

Peter, since this is about racism,
why don't we take a slow,

hands-clasped-behind-
the-back walk together?

Listen, I know you wouldn't
have shot Cleveland Jr.

on account of his race.

You shot him because you're stupid.

That's all I'm trying to say!

And I know you don't have
hate in your heart.

You were willing to go to jail
for shooting my son.

You took responsibility.

That's what's important.

So... you forgive me?

Of course I do.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF) Oh, thanks, Cleveland.

Hey, how you feeling there, champ?

I'm good.

Getting better every day.

Aw, I'm happy to hear that.

Hey, these things happen.

That's my boy.

-Yeah?

I'm gonna be coming for your ass.

of a switchblade

What is that in real time?

I'm saying I'm not going back to Quahog.

What?

But we've-we've seen the last episode.
We did what we came here to do.

Peter, everything you just said is true.

I don't have anyone
waiting for me in Quahog.

But here, I've got Sujin.

I've got Buttercup and our grandcats.

I've got a family.

I'm not gonna make the same mistake
American Johnny did.

I'm staying here.

KOREAN ANNOUNCER: (IN ENGLISH)
<i>Will Quagmire stay in Korea?</i>

<i>Will Peter find a new friend?</i>

<i>Find out after this Korean commercial</i>

<i>Ashton Kutcher</i><i>thought</i>
<i>no one in America</i><i>would ever see.</i>

Hi. I'm Ashton Kutcher.

Have you ever killed a dog
while driving drunk,

and then been upset
that there was no way for your car engine

to cook it for you
on the rest of the drive home?

Well, those days are over,

thanks to
Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bag.

Just put the dog in the bag,
place it over the engine block,

and drive your usual 20 miles per hour
over the speed limit.

Mmm. Bow-wow!

I'm Ashton Kutcher, and remember,

Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bags
are not meant for babies.

But they can be used for babies.

Quagmire, you can't stay in Korea.
We all got lives back in Quahog.

That's just it, Peter. You have lives.

You guys all have wives and kids.

And I have nothing
waiting for me back there.

But here, I have a family.

Plus, commercial pilots around here

can just fly their plane into the ocean
if they want.

Peter's right.
We can't just leave you here.

Who am I gonna get
all my wiener jokes from?

You're my wiener guy.

Joe, I got them from a book.

I wish I didn't know that.

Don't peek behind the curtain, huh?

Sorry, guys,
you're not gonna change my mind.

I just feel like I belong here with Sujin.

(CATS MEWING)

What are you gonna do?

It's a powerful thing
when a woman pays you

even the slightest bit of attention.

Yeah, God knows I've been there.

Welcome to Chili's.

We're through.

Can't believe Quagmire
isn't coming back with us.

Donna's mother? It was suicide.

You guys want to check out
Brazil while we're out?

We just got to accept
that Quagmire has made his decision.

There's nothing we can do about it.

Yeah, I guess
as far as Quagmire's concerned,

he's totally Korean now.

-(KOREAN POP MUSIC PLAYING)
-(WOMEN SINGING IN KOREAN)

Guys, there's only one way
to get through to a Korean.

Through their music.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

We can try your thing.

Eh, another show about a lizard.

Quagmire, you're making a mistake.

-Quahog is where you belong.
-That's right.

And if you won't listen to us,
maybe you'll listen to, um... Us.

But singing.

Sorry, guys.

I know those New York Giants jerseys
weren't cheap,

but I'm staying here, and that's final.

Well, I pressed our matching
beige pantsuits for tomorrow.

Good night.

Aah!

-Who's that?
-This is my grandfather.

He is going to live with us,
in the Asian tradition.

So will the rest of my aunts,
uncles and cousins.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

They will?

Of course. And have you met Great-Grandma?

I can see through her!

I-Is she a ghost?

We don't know. She won't answer.

Tomorrow, you take her to town
to buy root vegetable.

After that,
you will get psychopath haircut

so you look like one of us.

(SIGHS)

What's the matter, Glenn?
You don't seem completely emotionless.

No, no, no, no, I am, I am.
I'm emotionless.

Good night, Glenn.

Oh, and just so you know,
three of my cousins have night terrors.

Oh, no!

It's crazy we're going home
without Quagmire.

What are we gonna do without him?

Rent his house to a sorority,

Huh.

Goodbye, Quagmire.

We're gonna miss you, buddy.

But wait, won't that upset Sujin
and your new Korean family?

What, are you kidding?
They all got to be in a K-pop song.

That's all anyone here wants.

Look, Great-Grandma is so happy,
she finally died and became a ghost.

Thanks again for convincing me
to come home, guys.

No problem, Quagmire.

Looks like Donna's mother's funeral
went well.

Odd choice to have an open casket
for a gunshot suicide.

Yep, I thought I wanted a family,

I can get drunk whenever,

Wow, that was amazing, I think!

All right, everyone,

it's time to open up our bank statements.

Let's gather 'round for prayer.

Hey, God, it's the Griffins.

Again, we're very sorry
we cyber-bullied that girl to death.

But we still want a snowmobile.

Today, though, please let there be money
in our bank account.

-Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

Damn it. It didn't work.

We're still poor.

Peter, every month our savings
get smaller and smaller.

We really gotta figure out a better way
to budget for this family's future.

Bitcoin.

-What?
-I don't know.

This is serious.

We need to think
about our kids' education.

Of course, it's already too late
for Meg to go to college.

And Chris is too dumb
to get in anywhere.

Yay!

No, Chris. Not yay.

But there's still time for Stewie.

Let's sit down later
and see if we can figure out

a plan to get our finances in order.

Eh, don't worry about it, Lois.

I will always provide for the family.

Even if I have to shoot our dinner.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(SWALLOWS THICKLY)

Hey, don't fill up on that.

We got breakfast coming.

Hey, Peter, I think I figured out one way
we can save money for Stewie's college.

If we bundle our cable
and Internet together,

we can save $14 a month.

No! Bundling is a sign of defeat!

Plus, I figured out something better.

-A metal detector.
-What?

Yeah, it combines two of America's
greatest resources,

garbage and luck.

That's stupid, Peter.

Ah, you're just saying that

because the battery it uses
causes bladder cancer.

Well, then, I'm off.

I shall be at the beach
looking for valuables

and occasionally using
a doorless bathroom.

Good day, madam.

Well, Meg, now that
I'm a metal detector guy,

I gotta start eating breakfast
at on-the-sand cafés,

where I will judge tourists
as my skin browns and hardens.

Stop throwing your kid's diapers
in the trash with all the soda cans!

Hey, Lois, check out what
I found with my metal detector.

Are those... Are those Purple Hearts?

Yeah, some idiot buried,
like, a hundred of 'em

in this big lawn under these bone cages.

Peter!

I think you desecrated
a military graveyard!

Hey, guys, like four jeeps
just drove up onto our front yard.

They must be here for the medals!

Maybe. Or it could be because of my

"I'm Gonna Barf

Peter, did you rob a bunch of people

on the beach
with your metal detector?

Well, that's only half the story.

I also hooted at a lady
who was breastfeeding.

I want you to get rid
of that metal detector.

All you're doing is getting into trouble

and digging up junk when we really need

to be saving for Stewie's college.

Tomorrow we are going to the mall

and returning that thing to the store.

(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

But you should know,
the day I bought this metal detector

was the happiest day of my life.

Well, obviously, the second happiest.

<i>Now we gonna do this thing</i>
<i>a little different tonight</i>

<i>You gonna come over</i>

I wasn't even supposed to be here.

Well, I'm glad the store was willing
to take that metal detector back.

All right, let's go to the food court.

I love eating Panda Express

while squeezin' our purchases
between our knees

'cause someone
might grab 'em.

God, the mall sucks,
doesn't it, kids?

If I had a credit card,
I'd shop online.

Oh, hey, Bonnie.

What are you guys doing here?

Oh, hey, Lois.

We saw an ad looking for a toddler

to appear in a peanut
butter commercial

and we thought
we'd bring Susie.

-Joe, are you wearing a corsage?
-Yeah.

You can get a really good deal
on them after prom season.

They're for girls, Joe.

Hey, Peter,

why don't you let me do me,
and you do you, okay?

Peanut butter commercial, huh?

Hey, Bri, maybe you should audition.

You know, because of that
one time you got in the trash

and ate a whole jar of
recalled peanut butter?

It wasn't peanut butter.

It was that pre-mixed peanut
butter and jelly thing.

Oh, Mom bought that?

That's what the scab kid
at school always has!

That was really great, Jake.

Really, really great.

Your face is upside-down,

so we're not gonna pick you,
but thanks for coming.

Hey. Hey. This is you.

My God, I don't believe it!

That's so cool!

Oh, he's telling him

It's a royalty check
from Stewie's commercial.

Apparently, he gets paid
every time it airs.

This is great.

We can put it right into
Stewie's college fund.

Yeah, yeah,
but, you know,

maybe we should keep
a little bit out to celebrate.

I mean, I ain't
done nothin' fancy

since I bought
those rich guy socks.

Ah, there.

I'm ready to get caught

Welcome, folks.

Would you like flat
or sparkling water to start?

will be fine.

We prefer it to be hot
and then metal-y.

Actually, Peter,

let's go for the
sparkling water.

I mean, we are
celebrating

our little commercial
star and his big payday.

Oh, I don't care
about that, ma'am.

You know, this is
a nice dinner and all,

but I thought you guys
were going to save

this commercial money
for Stewie's college fund.

We are saving it, Brian.

This is just
a little celebration.

The rest of it is going
right in the bank.

Yeah, and besides,
it's been a while

since we ate at a place
where if you ask for ketchup,

-they look at you like you're dirt.
-You know, Stewie, actually got a call

for another
commercial tomorrow.

Who knows?

This could be the beginning
of a nice career for him.

You sure about this, Lois?

I mean... I mean,
the world of child acting

can be a pretty bad
environment for a kid.

Maybe we should just
let Stewie's childhood

be about being a child.

Wasn't your kid an actor,
you jagoff?

Didn't your father
hate your guts and die?

Whoa!

Bring a gun to a knife fight.

Look, I-I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

All I'm saying is,

just try to keep Stewie's
best interests in mind.

Relax, Brian.

Stewie's fine.
I mean, look at him.

He's happier than
a sunny-side-up egg.

What a great way
to start the day.

What a pan, what a grill.

and it's midnight--

where's my breakfast?!

Okay, Stewie, you booked
the last commercial

without even trying, so this
one should be a piece of cake.

(LOW CHATTER)

Oh, I guess there are other
people auditioning, too.

Oh, is your child up for the
cough syrup commercial, too?

You'd have no way
of knowing this,

but the moms tend
to dress up.

Oh, thank you.

And you'd have
no way of knowing

that my son is the
Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.

to audition people

right here in the hallway.

Okay, that's great, that's

Just one question,
Stewie--

do you get pleasure out of
humiliating your family?

Yeah, is there some kind
of sick joy in it?

Why can't he just
be Pierce Brosnan?

-Pierce Brosnan would've got this.
-In a heartbeat!

It's 3:00 in the morning.

What the hell
are you guys doing?

What does it look like?
We're practicing.

Stewie has another
audition tomorrow,

and we're not gonna be
embarrassed like we were today.

See, this is the kind
of thing I was talking about.

And look at him,
he can barely stand up.

That's why I made this--
I call it "8 Hour Energy."

It's one part 5-Hour Energy,
and the other three hours are

espresso, Scotts
Turf Builder,

and a tiny, tiny super-small
amount of cocaine.

Oh, he's fine

Stewie, if you're fine with it,
bleed from the nose.

I think that's
pretty close.

All right, Stewie, now remember
what we practiced last night.

And here's a trick
to keep that confidence up.

You go in that room

-Stewie Griffin?
-Oh, right here.

Peter, he needs a boost.

Give him some of
the acting soup.

(GULPS)

I want to say curse words!

Okay, Stewie, you're just
gonna drink this juice,

then say, "Mmm,"
and rub your belly.

Yeah, yeah, you got it. (GULPS)

Yeah! Bye, juice!

That was amazing.

I've got goose bumps.

I want him
sexually.

Well, Mom, Dad,

I think we've got our
new orange juice boy.

Does this guy really
think we're his parents?

Stewie got the part?!

Yes!

That is how
you do it!

-Oh, hey, Brian.
-What's going on?

-Where's the fridge?
-Oh, we got a new one.

Stewie booked that
orange juice commercial,

so we thought we'd make a few
upgrades around the house.

Yeah, I even bought an awesome
voice-activated 3-D printer.

Why the hell do you
need a 3-D printer?

Print coyote.

(WHIRRING)

(COYOTE GROWLS)

CHRIS: Hey, what, hey, no, no, no!

Heel, heel, heel!

I can't make him attack you, Brian,
but if I keep printing them,

eventually one will
go after you.

That money is supposed to
be for Stewie's college.

He's an actor, you idiot--
he doesn't need college.

Look, I-I just don't think any
of this is good for Stewie.

It's great for Stewie.

He's becoming a star.

That's right.

Man, this must be what it's like
to be Anne Hathaway's parents.

Oh, that's Anne's car.

Ugh.

Hey, Stewie, can
I talk to you?

What are you doing?

I don't know.

Mom and Dad just, uh, stuck
a book on my head and-and left.

Stewie, look at you,
you're a wreck.

And for what? So Peter and Lois
can spend the money you earned

on crap they
don't even need?

Uh, I'm not supposed
to use my voice

for non-paying
stuff, Brian.

This is insane--
you've got to stop.

Ugh, stop worrying,
I'm fine.

And besides, the fat man
knows what he's doing.

No, he doesn't,
he's an idiot.

Remember? He couldn't
even figure out

how to use a hotel
business center.

So, what business
are you in?

Oh, I'm just here to look
at other people's e-mails

who haven't logged out.
And how's business?

Well, I've left some pretty wild
replies on a bunch of Evites.

Look at this-- I'm
bringing 53 guests.

You're the coolest guy I've ever
met in one of these things.

Oh, hey.

You caught me
pigging out.

I'm dipping this celery
stalk into some lemon water.

But don't freak out.

I'm just gonna smell it and
then throw it in the trash.

Stewie, this has
gotten out of control.

If you're gonna
continue on this path,

you need to know
what your future holds.

Being a child actor
almost never ends well.

You remember that kid
from <i>A Christmas Story</i>

who got his tongue
stuck to that pole?

Yeah, whatever
happened to him?

I'll tell you
what happened to him.

He did porn.

Boner from <i>Growing Pains?</i> Dead.

Screech from
<i>Saved by the Bell?</i> Porn.

Corey Haim? Dead.

Dana Plato? Porn, then dead.

Oh, no, this is horrible.

You see, Stewie, there are
tons of actors like this.

They all started out
just like you,

but eventually
they were destroyed

by their parents'
greed, drugs

or perverted
Hollywood directors.

Oh, like Bryan Singer.

Exactly. The point is
it's a dark path.

My God, I had no idea
it could be so bad.

Brian, I don't want
to act anymore.

Good. Now we just got to make
Peter and Lois understand.

Yes, well, if they want
to make me into a monster

like those people, we'll
give 'em a monster.

Like when Godzilla
attacked Haiti.

(FLAMES CRACKLING)

(ROARS)

Oh, my God.

Peter, did you
get my text?

No, hold on.

No, I don't know
what he's doing here.

Okay, Stewie, when Barbara
hands you that orange juice,

you're gonna drink it
and smile.

And really show us that
energy from your audition.

H-Hold on a second,
he's got a smudge on his face.

Let me just take care
of that for you guys.

Here, drink this.

I threw a little Molly
in there, too,

so we'll go out
clubbing afterwards.

Hey, you want this?

Sure, I'll
drink anything.

All right, action!

As a mom, I want my kids
to start their day right.

And there's no better way
than with a glass

of fresh-squeezed
Sunnydale Orange Juice.

Isn't that right,
sweetie?

Shut your hole, bitch!

I'll tell you what I want
fresh-squeezed-- these.

(SHRIEKS)

What the hell's
he doing?

He's blowing this.

Oh, here's what I think
of this orange juice.

(GRUNTING)

I-I can't... I can't go right
now with everybody watching.

But-but I presume you understand
the disrespect I intended.

Oh, my God, he's
having a meltdown.

You don't suppose this
has anything to do

with the sleep deprivation
and narcotics?

Oh, Peter, what have
we been thinking?

It's us-- we're the ones
who turned him into this.

Get this kid out of here!
He's fired.

Well done.

Not a bad performance.

Thank you, Brian, I...

Uh, there's the poop. Right now.

Oh, Stewie.

Mommy and Daddy are so sorry.

I-I guess we just got
too caught up in your success

and forgot that you're
just a baby.

You were
right, Brian.

I guess we pushed Stewie
a little too hard.

Well, the good news is
that now he can go back

to being a regular kid.

Why are you winking at
our baby, you creep?

God, that's weird.

I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

Well, we went a little crazy
there, didn't we, Peter?

But I'm glad we have

our normal, very average,
non-famous baby back.

You know, I was once
a very famous baby.

Were you, Peter?

No, but you see how easy
it is for me to lie to you?

I do it every day.

Anyway, looks like everything
worked out for the best.

You know, Brian, that acting
stuff was a bit much for me,

but I did quite enjoy
the dancing and the cocaine.

-Yeah?
-Yep.

So you're just gonna be a
dancer and a drug addict?

For a while. I might
crash when I'm 18,

but then I'll just turn
to the Lord and working out.

I'll-I'll just be a 180-degree
different type of insufferable.

I used to need drugs
to feel powerful,

but now my power comes
from my core strength.

And let's look at that
word, "strength."

The "S" stands
for sacrifice.

No gain without
sacrifice.

The "T," of course, stands for
the sufferings of the cross.

The "R"...
You want some cocaine?

Oh, my God, please, yes!
That's all I want all the time!

Hello, dear.

Oh, I always forget you walk right into
the living room in your house.

Hey, do you have a Band-Aid?

Nothing happened, but I'm bleeding.

You know what, I'll just
rummage through your bathroom.

(SIGHS) Man, spending a whole day with him

is gonna be worse than
eating at a ball park.

Uh, I'll take one terrible beer,

filled up way too high,
so I spill most of it,

and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun.

And do you have mustard and relish?

Yeah, it's right there
between the entrance

and the exit to the bathroom.

Perfect. And can I get
a bag of unsalted peanuts?

You know, something I would never eat

anywhere else in the world?

-Sure, here you go.
-Great, great.

I can't wait to have diarrhea

while 20 guys wait for me to finish.

-(GIRLS GIGGLING)

Ugh, God, kill me.

Stewie, I can't take any more
of Meg and her gross friends.

Ah, ah, hang on, hang on.
I'm just finishing up an e-mail to Delta.

"I have never not screamed
at the top of my lungs

during air pressure changes,
and I do not intend to stop now."

-Okay, what was it?
-Meg's friends.

They're just so loud
and boring and annoying.

Well, not everybody
can be as fascinating as you, Brian.

Thanks for coming by.

Hey, Brian, Mom took the car.

Can you give me and my friends
a ride to field hockey practice?

Uh, I'm kind of helping Stewie
with an e-mail to Delta.

Please, Brian.

It would get them out of the house.

Well, that's true.
And I gotta do something,

'cause they're more annoying
than ants at a picnic.

(RANCHERA MUSIC BLARING)

Would you mind turning that down?

(VOLUME INCREASES)

And you're not supposed to be grilling.

I know you can understand me.

So... what, uh, what do you want to do?

I don't know.
Sucks that we're stuck here alone.

Wait a minute, here alone.

You thinking what I'm thinking?

This was not what I was thinking.

That's weird,
it's not what I was thinking either.

I don't even know how it happened.

No, me neither,
but this spaghetti's not half bad.

A "happy mistake," we'll call it.

Now what do you want to do?

Well, we could watch porn.
Have you heard of porn?

-Is that something you're aware of?
-You have postcards from France?

No, no, no, like... Like, on the computer.

There's like tons and tons of videos
of people doing it on there.

(STAMMERING) Wait, l-let me understand,
You want to watch <i>that</i> with <i>me?</i>

Well, not anymore, you just made it weird.

But there's other stuff on there.

You want to see a guy
in a human-sized hamster ball

-roll off a mountain?
-Uh, yeah.

So this is in Russia?

Somebody's gonna slow him down, right?

Whoa!

(CHUCKLES) I got to e-mail that to Babs.
She hates people.

Huh, got a new e-mail here.

And it's from a Nigerian prince.

It says he's got millions
frozen in an account.

All he needs is a hundred grand
to pay legal fees,

and then as soon as he gets his money,
I get a million bucks.

Wow, and he must need it quick,

'cause there was, like,
a bazillion typos in that e-mail.

You got to send that money.

-You think so?
-Absolutely.

I mean, can you imagine
if you make a million bucks?

You'll be happier
than the guy on his wedding day.

Thanks, everyone.
Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad.

Good-bye, friends. Good-bye, free time.

Farewell, sex. So long, golf on TV.

I'll miss you, privacy.

Good-bye, being honest
about how many beers I've had.

Nice knowing you, my own choices.
See ya' later, money!

Thanks for the ride, Brian.

Yeah, and thanks for the lecture
on what real music is, Mr. Griffin.

Geez, how many Snickers could they eat
in a five-minute car ride?

Ah, crap, somebody left their gym bag.

God, it would've been real easy

Where the hell'd they go?

Oh, whoops.

(SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Ooh, yeah...</i>

Wow.

(GASPS)

Holy crap. That was Patty.

And she's got a smokin' hot body.

This is a bigger surprise than
when I found out Joe was a clown.

(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)

JOE: I think that belongs to me.

-I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
-Okay.

-You won't tell anyone, will you?
-No.

You can tell people.

Hey, so how was the spa?

Oh, it was fine,
though I don't know why they made us

face each other during
the mother-daughter bikini wax.

Did you two have a nice afternoon?

Sure did. I made a million dollars!

What! How?

Carter sent $100,000 to a Nigerian prince
who's gonna give him a million.

Oh, Peter, don't tell me
you two fell for that scam.

What? What are you talking about?

It's the oldest e-mail scam out there.

Their assets are frozen,
you cover legal fees.

Blah, blah, blah.

Oh, my God, he did say,
"Blah, blah, blah."

You're never getting that money back.

What! So that-that money's
just been Josh Hartnett-ed!

-What's that?
-Gone! Disappeared!

Never to be heard from again!

Isn't he in that Showtime thing
with the blood and the hats?

-Look, the point is I was swindled.
-I guess so.

Well, come on, Mom,
the man was very specific

that we need to go
put lotion on each other.

Geez, I'm really sorry, Carter.
But at least you have your health.

(COUGHING)

-Oh...
-You know, this is your fault.

You're the one who said I should do it!

Mm-hmm, there's that judgy-ness

Babs is always calling me
and talking about.

Look, nobody steals
from Carter Pewterschmidt.

I am going to Africa
and getting my money back.

-And you're coming with me.
-Africa? We're going to Africa!

I wonder if it will change us.

But, of course, it did change us.

I've been working here for 50 years,
pretending I'm a woman.

(FRENCH ACCENT) Do you ever regret
not having children, Mother Bernadette?

Oh, I've had many children.

Oh, just so you know,
I didn't tell Lois where we're going,

and I couldn't be touched until I was two.

-Daddy, what are you doing here?
-Oh, hey, Lois.

Uh, Carter and I are going away
for the next week or so.

You are? Where?

Oh, uh... We're, uh...

I mean, um...

-Pinterest!

-Uh, hey, Brian.

Cool, that's great to hear.
Hey, where's Patty?

Oh, I don't know. Probably at her house?

(LAUGHS) You're hilarious, Meg.

Hey, so, uh, what kind of movies
do you and your friends like?

-Well, Ruth likes...
-Not her.

-Esther likes...
-Not her.

-I like...
-Patty, just Patty.

Oh, she loves anything

where a teenage girl
is sick and dies of cancer.

Or any movie where
a character is named Patty.

Ugh, she loses her mind for that.

Well, okay, Miss Chatterbox,
you better get off to school.

Wow, you're really obsessed with Patty.

You want her even more than
I wanted the new iPhone.

-How's it going?
-Good.

Just looking forward
to getting that new phone.

What are you talking about?
This isn't the Apple store.

This is a super-gay club.

Yeah, right, I leave and you get my phone.

Nice try, cutie pie.

Wow, there's so much wildlife in Africa.

You know, they say
there's some animal species here

-that haven't even been discovered yet.
-Is that right?

Yes, that is right.

Oh, my God, look over there!

That African warlord is brutalizing

-those innocent people.
-Yeah, but it's okay,

because he's wearing a large cowboy hat
and follows everything with "hamburger,"

like that stand-up comic from the '90s.

We are going to force all these
young boys to be child soldiers.

-Hamburger.
-(GIGGLING)

After 18 hours in the mines,

we are going to check
your butts for diamonds.

Hamburger.

If you do not work
on my rubber plantation,

I will burn your tongues.

Oh, my God!

-Hamburger.
-(GIGGLING)

Ah, I found him. Alonzo "Hamburger" Jones.

He made it to YouTube.
Must be filthy rich.

Oh, my God!
I didn't expect to see you guys here.

So teenagers know about the mall, too?

-Know what about the mall?
-Yeah, right?

Boy, the day I'm having.

I actually made one too many Build-a-Bears
for the cancer kids.

If only I could build a cure, huh?

-Aw...
-Hey, you know what, Patty?

Why don't you take the extra one?

-Wow, thanks, Brian.
-Yeah, that's cool, Brian.

-Will you buy me a hat at Lids?
-No.

You know, Patty, I've got $7.50 left
on my Panda Express card,

if you want to split a three-item combo.

-No drink.
-Sure!

Well, then, hop on board
the Panda Express!

(CHUCKLES) In bed, right?

Like-- Like with the fortune cookies,
you know...

Brian, can I talk to you for a second?

What the hell is going on?

You're hitting on Patty and it's gross.
She's 18!

-Stop it!
-Me?

Meg, I am not even going to dignify that
with a mall erection.

Don't... Don't look down.

(GENTLE AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, we made it.

East Bola.

All right, let's find our "prince"
and get my money back.

-On the ground!
-(YELPS)

This is unacceptable.

I demand to speak to Anthony Anderson.

(PHONE RINGING)

Okay, hold on. Shoot me if you must,

but it is imperative
that I answer this call.

Yello?

Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

Yes, I did call you
about the eight-piece lawn croquet set.

Now, it says "weathered,"
just how weathered is it?

Yeah, go ahead and send me a pic,
that'd be very helpful.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Sir, shoot me if you must,

but it is imperative
that I look at these pictures.

The hell with this.

I'm getting my money back
if it's the last thing I do.

Hey, here's the guys.

Who are you and why are you here?

I'm Carter Pewterschmidt,
and I'm here because you stole my money!

You? You are Carter Pewterschmidt?

You're damn right I am!

Oh! It's him!

It's the Great Father Pewterschmidt!

What's happening? What's he talking about?

You are a great hero to us.

It is with the money that you sent

that we have been able to make

many wonderful improvements
to our village.

And he used my computer.

I'm Griff, by the way,
that's what everybody calls me.

That's not true. Nobody calls him that.

It was your money
that paid for the school,

a well to provide clean drinking water,

our first health clinic,

and a Redbox with one movie in it.

It's <i>Baby Geniuses.</i>

Which I, personally, could begin watching

at any point in the film
and enjoy from there.

Oh, yeah, that's how
I feel about that video

of Kelsey Grammer fallin' off the stage.

I don't understand.

So there never was a Nigerian prince?

No. You see, no one will actually
give money to Africa

unless they are tricked into it.

So again, we thank you
for your generosity, Father Pewterschmidt.

Well, I hope you enjoyed it...
'cause I'm taking it all back.

BOTH: What?

You heard me!

Nobody steals from Carter Pewterschmidt
and gets away with it!

Carter, why you bein' so mean?
The money's spent.

And look how happy you made these people.

Talk to me, it's your buddy Griff.

Tear it all down! Now.

Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa.

-What is Kwanzaa?
-Ah! I knew it wasn't real!

Hey, there, babe.

Hey, Brian.

You ready?

Got the <i>Smash Mouth</i> cued up in the Pri.

-Brian, what are you doing here?
-I'm here to pick up Patty.

We're going to see a movie
called <i>Brittany Finds a Lump.</i>

You're parked in Mr. Tackleman's space.

You're going on a date with Patty?

I told you to back off.

And since when do you wear high-tops?

What, my kicks? Ah, it's nothin'.

I just use these for Instagram.

That's something I like!

Ah, shut up, Esther!

All right, we're out of here.

Feel free to use the seat warmer,
keep that box hot.

MAN:<i> Somebody once told me</i>

<i>The world is gonna...</i>

Geez, I can't believe
you're going through with this, Carter.

Paying these thugs
to tear down the village

-isn't gonna bring your money back.
-This isn't about the money.

This is payback for Sammy Davis
dating Kim Novak.

Oh, come on, Carter, don't do this.

You don't want to be the first white guy

to do something bad to Africa.

Are you about done?

I'm supposed to go lion shooting
with a scumbag dentist.

No, Carter, I can't let you do this!

I won't stand by and let you further ruin
this terrible place!

Oh, is that right?

Yes, that is right.

Here's 5,000 bucks. Lock up that fat-ass.

Damn it, this sucks.

I may never get out of here.

Well, as a man
falsely imprisoned in Africa,

I have no choice but to write
a memoir of my struggles.

"Chapter One,

"Harry Potter's aunt and uncle
were super mean.

"'Spank me harder,' the lady
says to Fifty Shades of Grey.

"'That's Mr. Fifty Shades of Grey

"to you, Kate from <i>Ben and Kate.'</i>

"And then he turned her butt inside out.

Because, sexy."

"'Isn't that special,'
said the Church Lady,

"before reporting for her botched surgery.

"Anyway, I'm here in a prison
against my will,

"and I should be free. The end."

Take this, Cheebo.

Take this to a French-Canadian
flight attendant.

And he will give it to everybody.

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
Our top story, sinking newscaster.

Just kidding, it's the chair.

But, in other news,
domestic abuse enthusiast Paul Simon

has released a new song
inspired by a memoir

written by Quahog's own Peter Griffin,

who has been falsely imprisoned
by his father-in-law

in an African jail.

Oh, for God's sake.

I bet there's not one word
about you in that book.

Wow, what a beautiful night.

Yeah.

Hey, I wonder if any of those
stars are wishing on us, huh?

You're so deep.

I betcha you're pretty deep, too.

Aw, you're so sweet.

Why are you so nice to me?

Most guys never give me the time of day
because I'm so plain-looking.

Well, I'm not like most guys.
I can see pas that sweater.

Speaking of which,

why don't we get rid
of that big old thing?

Brian, stop!

You don't have to do this, Patty.
Brian's just taking advantage of you.

What? That's crazy!

What? Why would he do that?

Because you have an amazing body.

I do? But...you're always saying
dumpy girls like us only have each other.

You're not dumpy.

I was just saying that

because I was worried you'd become popular

and not want to be friends
with us anymore.

Meg, I'm $18 into this evening,

so can you maybe just get out of here?

Meg, that's silly.
I'll always be your friend.

You promise?

Oh, come on, what the hell?

Bummer. He's never gonna get to hit that.

I know. That's exactly what I wished for.

Well, I actually wished
for it 30,000 years ago.

It's true.

Even at the speed of light,

mean-spirited thoughts from the stars

can take thousands
or even millions of years

to reach the Earth.

none of you guys has ever heard of Bono?

He says he knows you.

Daddy! What the hell are you doing?
You threw Peter in jail?

Hey, Pumpkin, welcome!

Whatever you do,
don't tell them you have a clitoris.

Yeah, they told me that at the embassy.

Look, I'm sorry you got swindled,
but you can't treat people this way.

You let Peter out of that jail right now.

And give these people back
their health clinic and their school.

No!

PETER: Hi, Lois! I like your shorts!

Bye, Lois!

Oh, my God!

Enough is enough!

That's your son-in-law!

And my husband!

I know how families work, Lois.

All right. Let him go.

Yay!

Lois, how much was your flight
and which card did you put it on?

Daddy, I don't understand any of this.

I mean, you've always been grouchy,
but why are you being so mean-spirited?

What's gotten into you?

What's gotten into me? I'm angry!

For God's sake, I can't even be left alone
in my own house for an afternoon.

You have to drop me off at your house
so this fat idiot can babysit me!

I'm old and it sucks!

I'm sorry, Daddy.

I realize growing old is no fun,
but this is no way to act.

I know.

I'm sorry I almost had you shot.

Oh, that's all right.

I got a fever of a 108.

I'm not gonna remember any of this.

And I'm sorry for what
I did to your village, Dave.

His name is "Dave"?

Yeah. Get to know these people, okay?

Listen, when I get home,
I'll transfer enough money

so you can rebuild your town.

You've all been very kind.

Yeah, this has been great, guys.

Now all I need is a group photo

of me kneeling
in the front of the village,

so I can brag about
what a good person I am.

Oh, cool, somebody put
Billy Joel on the jukebox.

Billy Joel? This is Daft Punk.

Dappunk? Wh-- I-- What is that?
That's not even words.

What are you saying? This is Billy Joel.

It's "Anthony's Song,"
parentheses, "Movin' Out."

First of all, it's "Movin' Out,"
parentheses, "Anthony's Song."

And second of all,
this is 100% not Billy Joel!

You know, when they recorded "Movin' Out,"
someone left the studio doors open,

and that's why, at the end,
you hear that car sound.

-That's not true either!
-No, this is it.

He's talking about going
all around the world

'cause this Anthony fella,
he's moving out.

You know, to live with Mr. Cacciatore
down on Mulberry Street.

And that's all I'm gonna
say about those two.

Peter, I'm gonna punch
you with this beer mug

till I'm holding just the handle!

Guys, calm down.
There's one way to solve this.

I'll just use my phone.

(PHONE BEEPS, SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

It says "'Around the World' by Daft Punk."

Thank you!

God, you idiots are exhausting.

Hey, Cleveland,
how'd you do that with your phone?

I'm not an idiot.

I used Shazam.

It recognizes songs
and tells you their names.

Yeah? Hey, what if I farted into it?

I don't know. Be my guest.

(FARTS LOUDLY)

It says "Lana Del Rey."

Wow, how do I get this on my phone?

You just download it.

-It's a app.
-What's an app?

They're little programs you use
on your phone while driving.

Oh, man, apps sound awesome!
This is a real game changer!

Like the guy who invented
wearing a sport jacket with jeans.

So, what can I do for you?

Well, I've got to go to church,

but I don't have time
to change from the rodeo.

Excuse me, I thought
you were helping me find a look

that'll let me cling
to my youth in my 40s.

Yes, I'm interested in cheating on my wife
in Las Vegas.

Gentlemen, I think I can
help all three of you.

Brian, I'm in a bind.

Joanne was supposed to
drive me to the club,

but she's having throat surgery.

20 years of menthol slims.

I don't understand anything you just said.

Just drive me to the racquet club.

Since when do you belong
to a racquet club?

You know, I do have a life
outside this house.

For example,
I also write restaurant reviews

for the newspaper
under the name Hugh Cornwallis.

Hugh Cornwallis? He's, like...

Super bitchy, I know.
Now come on, let's go.

So, what?
You're gonna play tennis all day?

No, I might also hit the treadmill
and watch <i>Kelly and Michael</i>

on mute with closed captioning.

"Kelly: It's like kale is everywhere
these days, am I right?"

Michael: unintelligible."

I love them.

They have such an amazing chemistry.

Yeah!

Awesome!

Peter, will you keep it down?

I'm trying to look at lamps
I'll never buy.

Oh, yeah, sorry.

-Sweet!
-What are you doing?

Well, I just found out about
these things called apps,

so that's kind of all I do now.

This one's a cool bowling app I got.

Aw, yeah, strike!

Peter, your phone's streaming to the TV.

You're clearly watching porn.

Will you turn it off?

I'm already caught, Lois.
I'm gonna finish.

-Peter, I'm...
-I'm gonna finish!

Just go over there!

We're gonna be fine, Lois, you and me.

There you are, Dad.

Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in days.

Ugh. I went out of town
for a little while,

but I made the mistake of using
this app called Bear B'n'B.

We're so happy you're staying with us.

Just a reminder, we ask that
you not use the DVD player,

but you can watch any of the VHSs.

We have <i>Clear and Present Danger,</i>
<i>Son of the Mask...</i>

Oh, and here's most of a puzzle.

Okay, well,
I don't want any of that stuff.

Fine. Well, if the phone rings

and we're not around, just take a message.

I'm kind of on vacation.

Oh, and just a heads up,
the dog doesn't like men.

Now, we serve breakfast
from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

I'll skip breakfast.

Uh, everyone eats breakfast.

I'm on vacation.

All the more reason to treat yourself.

The house specialty is a half-chewed trout

we yanked out of the river with our teeth.

Ah, there's the bear stuff.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Where are you going?

Oh, I'm meeting up with someone
from my Grinder app.

Isn't that for anonymous gay hookups?

No, no, no. This one's a way for guys
who enjoy sandwiches to connect.

-MAN: You "Meatballfreak"?
-Uh-huh.

All right, let's do this.

Are you also married?

-My phone's broken.
-I'm not surprised.

It's probably because of all those apps
you've been downloading.

Don't say "apps" like you're young.

No, I took it in the shower

'cause I didn't know
you could pause a game.

-Here, Chris. Your first cell phone!
-Yay!

Something my dad held in the bathroom!

You know, Chris,
you could probably salvage that phone.

If you put it in a bag of uncooked rice,
it'll dry out.

Really?

Yeah. And then you can use the rice
to pretend someone wanted to marry you.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. and Mrs. Dog
and Meg the Bounty Hunter!

Holy moley!

Marcy Miller!

She bought feminine products
at my dad's pharmacy,

so you know she's up and running.

Yeah, I wish
I had the guts to talk to her.

Talk to her?

Chris, no one talks to each other anymore.

If you want to get a girl's attention,
you text her a picture of your penis.

What? Really?

-Are-- Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah.

People who send their daughters
to public high schools

are basically asking for this.

Well, I did just get
this new phone from my dad.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

All right, what could go wrong?

It worked out great for...

<i>(YAKETY SAX</i> PLAYING)

Ah. This is it, Bri.

Where frail old men
come to weigh themselves in the nude.

Does that say 84 or 85?

It says 63.

Oh, dear.

How'd you get all those cuts on your butt?

Wow, they allow drinking here
at 10:30 in the morning?

Oh, yes, half the bathroom trash
is thrown-up scrambled eggs.

Okay, so this place has hot women,
morning booze and free vomit?

-Maybe I'll join you.
-You don't play tennis.

What are you talking about?
I'm a great tennis player.

You are? Well, that's perfect.

There's a doubles tournament coming up,
and I could really use a partner.

Well, you found him!

All right, all right,
I suppose we can make this work.

Like that actress from <i>Rizzoli & Isles</i>
and her husband do.

Honey, I thought we could do
a little role-playing tonight.

Oh, yeah? What'd you have in mind?

Maybe I could be
my character from the show.

Oh! Yeah! From the show! Sure.

Um... Oh, no!

It's the...law enforcement woman.

Part of that great team
of Rizzoli and Isles.

You don't know what part I play, do you?

Hey, look, you didn't marry me
because of my brains.

You married me because I play
one of the main bad guys in <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

Now let's just stop talking
and have idiot actor sex.

Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

We've got a bit of a situation,

which is why
I've asked Officer Swanson to join us.

It appears Chris sent an
inappropriate photo of himself

to one of his classmates.

That's right.
He texted a picture of his peenie.

Oh, my God!

-And apparently the girl...
-Oh, thank God.

...he sent it to doesn't like him back,
so she turned him in.

Okay, I can see everybody's mad, but...

What'd you think?

Thank you for bringing this
to our attention,

Principal Shepherd.

We'll make sure Chris apologizes
to that little knob-tease.

I'm sorry, Lois, but it's not that simple.

When Chris sent that picture,

he was technically
distributing child pornography.

Child pornography?

Joe, that's crazy!

He's just a teenager
who made a bad choice.

I don't know what to say,
but the laws just haven't caught up

to how cool kids are now.

I'm sorry, but this makes Chris
a sex offender.

Oh, my God!

Huh.

Well, I'm not about to make
a Batman exit right now,

but has that thing always been over there?

Over where?

What are you doing, Peter?

Ah, you looked back too fast.

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

Today, we bring you a disturbing
case of child pornography.

Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin,
whose name will be omitted here,

was caught sending, quote-unquote,
"graphic selfies of his hog"...

Not sure where that quote is from--

...to another underage student.

Coming up next, teleprompter guy
puts the period in a weird.

Place.

Oh, this is awful.

Now everyone in town
knows I'm a sex offender!

We know you didn't mean any harm, Chris.
We're just living in a different time.

When I was your age,
boys used to just whip it out on the bus.

Can't I just go on the news
and tell everyone I'm sorry?

Oh, I wish you could, sweetie,

but the law says that, as a sex offender,

you have to complete
a rehabilitation course.

Oh, that sounds awful.

Eh, can't be any worse
than our trip to Hawaii.

Okay, before you do anything else,
I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork,

rum, macadamia nuts,

stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf,
sentimental military stuff, lava,

people who I can't tell
are black or Asian,

apostrophes, anyone twirling flames,

second weddings and linen pants.

Is there anything you're not allergic to?

Yeah, the Epcot Center.
Where I <i>wanted</i> to go.

Good evening,
I'm Glenn Quagmire, your instructor.

Everyone look to your left.

Now look to your right.

All of you are sex offenders,

and statistically
you will all be here again.

Because this has never worked
in the history of doing this.

Now, today, we have a new
member, giggity, Chris G.

ALL: Hi, Chris.

All right, before we begin,
whoever's driving a windowless van

painted like an ice cream truck,
your lights are on.

Okay, next, let's take a few minutes
to talk about our new, fake interests.

Here's a clay pot I made.

I've started following
girls' field hockey.

No, come on.

You're supposed to pick from the list.

Mr. Quagmire, this is terrible.

And do I really have to be here?

Well, the law does give you a choice.

This or chemical castration.

-What's that?
-You take a ton of pills

that completely wipe out all sexuality.

Oh, is that what Michael Moore did?

No, but I understand why you'd think that.

Now, do you want to see the list?

I could take a whack
at hand-distressing furniture.

We don't say "whack."

(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

Very good, Stewie.

You grunt like a Hungarian lesbian.

(SIGHS) Thanks, Dimitri.

And, uh, your testicle's hanging
out of your shorts again.

I am cooling it.

But where is this partner of yours?

I don't know. He was supposed
to be here 15 minutes ago.

-(LAUGHTER)
-You're right.

So, anyway, my ex said,

"If you bring home one more tennis trophy,

I am out of here."

Well, she was gone in two days.

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, Brian.

"O'Brien"? That's my Irish cousin.

(LAUGHTER)

What are you doing?

We're supposed to be practicing
for the tournament.

Stewie, relax. I promise we'll practice,
but we just ordered bisque.

How are you paying for that?

Well, if you must know,

we're putting it on Philippa's
husband's account.

Does Burt know about this?

He would if he wasn't
working all the time.

Thank you, Brian.

Now, come on, let's have more
hard liquor and creamy soups.

Ugh.

Meg, can you hand me the paper plates?

I can't believe
we're having an ice cream cake

to celebrate Chris graduating
from sex offender school.

Well, the opportunities to celebrate
don't come often in this household.

There he is, Mr. Former Sex Offender.

But Mom, it's not that big a deal.

All I did was finish those creepy classes.

I know, but now your record is clear.

You can go back to being a normal boy
and put all this behind you.

Hey, Chris,
wait till you see the funny thing

I had 'em put on your cake.

"Happy sixth birthday, Timmy"?

Uh-oh, they must have mixed them up.

"Nice crank, you dirty little bastard"?

Sorry, I'll take that.

Here's your cake.
I ate a great deal of it.

Oh, there you are.

How was your first day out of rehab?

It was terrible.

Taking that class made no difference.

Nobody wants anything to do with me.

-Hi, Mr. Herbert.
-Oh, my God. Children, run!

It's that pervert!

-Everybody into my safety basement!
-(BOYS GASPING, SHOUTING)

-(SHARP SNAP)
-Oh!

Oh, that was a bad snap. I'm hurt, kids!

Don't eat those popsicles
till I get down there!

Well, I'm glad we're finally
getting some practice in.

Yeah, nothing like running around
after eating a seafood tower.

What are you doing here?

You're supposed to be at the baseline.

Yeah, baseline, baseline.

-Right, right.
-He's serving to you. Get back there!

(GRUNTS)

You've never played tennis, have you?

-Not once.
-Damn it, Brian!

I entered us in that tournament
because you said you could play!

And I will not be humiliated
in front of shallow, rich alcoholics!

Hey, Chris.

I see you walked across the grass again
instead of using the walk.

You're really wearing a path, aren't you?
We call that Chris's Trail.

Right there. Chris's Trail.

Mr. Quagmire, I completed that sex rehab
and I paid my debt to society,

but people are still afraid of
me, like I'm some kind of creep.

How do I get them to treat me
the way they did before all this happened?

You can't. I'm sorry, Chris,

but you're just gonna have to accept
that from now on,

people are gonna see you
as a sex-crazed pervert.

And there's nothing
you can do to change that.

Wait a minute, maybe there is.

-Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.
-No problem, Chris.

-You keep that chin up, huh?
-I will.

Hey, can I ring your doorbell?

-No, I'd rather you...
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

-(CAT SHRIEKS)
-That's why "no," Chris.

That's why "no."

Chris? What the hell happened to you?

(ANDROGYNOUS VOICE) Mother, Father,

I decided to have myself
chemically castrated.

Why the hell would you do that?

Now nobody will have
any reason to be afraid of me

or think I'm a pervert,

and everybody can just
treat me like normal again.

Oh, my God, I can't believe
my son's some kind of weirdo!

Oop, here comes another sandwich.

I can't even look at you.

(ANDROGYNOUS VOICE)
Has anyone seen my sandals?

Yeah, no, nobody's seen your sandals.

Well, I'll just have to make another pair.

Look, Chris,
I know you think chemical castration

is gonna solve your problems,

but you have to stop taking those pills.

I don't have to do anything,

besides get to the wind chime
store before it closes.

There can't be a whole store.

To be fair, they also have
a couple of kaleidoscopes.

Ah, can I come?

Lois, can I go to the store
with that thing?

Splendid. I'll go get my burlap wallet.

Wow, we rolled three gutter balls
on these kids, huh?

My word, Brian, you're really improving.
We might actually win this thing.

Thanks. You know, I just pretend
that tennis ball is Mitch McConnell

trying to roll back subsidies
on the Affordable Care Act,

and I'm like, "Nope!"

Yeah, I-- I don't...
I don't need to hear your process.

Look, I'm just happy you pushed me,

'cause now I can't wait
for that tournament.

I know, it's gonna be great.

And I already know exactly
where I'm gonna put that trophy.

So the baby died?

Yeah, the baby died.

But, look, first place.

Chris, your mother and I
want you to stop taking them pills.

There's a lot of great things
about having a sex drive

-that you're missing out on.
-Like what?

Well, there's the post-orgy
meals at a swingers party.

Come on, let's eat
with these wonderful people.

Hey, everybody, try my wife's ambrosia.

If you liked my wife's snizz,
you're gonna love her ambrosia.

I was thinking about this seven-layer dip
the whole time I was chowing Ronald.

I don't like this. I want to go home.

You know what's sad?

There's hardly any other
fathers and sons here.

I don't know, Lois.

I just don't think Chris
is gonna change his mind.

(SIGHS) I know.

It's only a matter of time
before he shaves one side of his head

and swoops the rest of the hair over.

Why, is that... Is that bad?

Good early evening, everyone.
I have celebratory news.

With all the free time,
I'm no longer devoting to onanism...

-That's spanking it?
-Yes, Peter.

...I have managed to redirect
that energy into my studies.

In fact, today I received
the Kaplan Prize in biology.

Chris, that's great!

Not only that, I got the highest
score on my Spanish test,

and I even joined the debate team.

That's amazing!

All right, well, I'm gonna
put some flowers in a wagon

and walk around town.

You know what, Peter?

Maybe there's a silver lining
to this fiasco.

Not thinking about sex all the time

seems to have allowed Chris
to excel in other areas.

He does seem sharper.

Heck, the old Chris
couldn't even figure out

the self-checkout at the supermarket.

I can already see our

from the previous quarter.

-Out.
-What!

Your ball was long.

Are you (BLEEP) me? That thing was in!

You're gonna penalize us

because you're a blind (BLEEP)

Stewie, calm down.

I will drop you to your knees

and shove my racket
so far down your throat

you'll be (BLEEP) my grip for a week!

Warning, Mr. Griffin.

Oh, you're warning me! I'm warning you!

I'm gonna go to your house
and (BLEEP) your wife!

You proud of yourself,
tennis club security guard?

Your kids look up to you? Big man.

Throwing out a baby and a dog. Tough guy.

Maybe I'll see you later
when you don't have that name tag on.

-I thought your shot was in.
-Oh, hey, pound it, dude.

So to find the area of this circle,

we're going to need to use pi,
whose digits go on forever.

(CHUCKLES) Can you imagine
if our pi was endless?

We'd all be changing our belt sizes.

(CHUCKLES)

Thanks, Chris.

Wow, that was really something.

Marcy?

I had no idea you were
such an amazing tutor.

And I really like your pendant.

Thanks, but why are you
being so nice to me?

You got me in so much trouble before.

Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

That was just my dumb, overprotective dad.

Really?

Yeah, he took my phone to look
at pictures of my friends,

and he found the one you sent.

-I bet that caught him by surprise.
-Definitely.

Well, I hope you know
that's not who I am anymore.

I do, and I hope I didn't
cause you too much trouble.

(ALARM BLARING)

This is not a drill!

I repeat, not a drill!

Good to be back
doing this again, huh, Bill?

What, shoveling coal into a penis?
I was sleeping.

What's happening?

(NORMAL VOICE) I don't know.

Someone... Someone get me nude art books!

I need nude art books!

Oh, good, Chris.

You can hang this
<i>New York Times</i> back on...

(GASPS) Oh, a pee-pee!

Well, Chris, you killed that librarian,

but we're glad to have you
back to your old self.

Mrs. Lapardo worked at that school
for 54 years.

Well, at least she saw a little wang
before taking that dirt nap.

Thanks, you guys.

I guess chemical castration
isn't for everyone.

I-- Is that...
Is that the lesson for this week?

Uh, I guess it's that
or be kinder on the tennis court.

Hey, you guys, you know
that song<i> Jimmy Crack Corn?</i>

Yeah, it's me and Lois's

Well, the whole time the

that, uh, this Jimmy

but yet he wrote an entire song about it.

-I am.

Here's those fries you ordered.

And your hot sauce.

Hot sauce? On fries?

Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.

Black guys put hot sauce on everything,

on account of most of us
been pepper-sprayed

by the time we're two.

Can't taste nothing unless
you got that burn on there.

This stuff ain't that hot.

Whoo!

I feel like I'm crying,

but, like, out of my neck and back.

Look at his face.

He looks like Oliver Platt
climbing a flight of stairs.

Hey! That's a low blow.

I'm gonna call the network and complain.

Where's the phone?

WOMAN: It's upstairs, Oliver!

Eh, they know what they did.

Tell you what, Peter.

I'll give you 10 bucks if you drink
an entire shot glass of that hot sauce.

Let me see the money.

You-you don't believe I have 10 dollars?

I think he's afraid.

-Am not!
-Prove it.

-Ten bucks.
-All right.

This is for all the teachers who told me

I'd never amount to nothing.

(COUGHING, CHOKING)

Oh, my God!

That last one was more <i>caliente</i> than hot.

But still, holy crap!

Well, here's your money.

This is awesome!

I can get people to pay me 10 bucks
just for doing stupid stuff?

Man, I haven't made money this easy
since I invented the Yanket!

Peter, what's wrong?

Well, I want to masturbate,
but I'm just so darn cold.

Too bad there's no answer
for that problem.

But now there is.

Hi, I'm Peter Griffin,
creator of the Yanket.

If you're anything like me,

the number one problem in your life

is that you can't masturbate
just anywhere.

But now you can.

Introducing the Yanket,

the only blanket with built-in decoy arms.

Our patented process
makes it look like you're...

<i>holding the remote</i>

<i>or sipping a beer.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, your real hands</i>

<i>are under the blanket,</i><i>going to town.</i>

Peter, what are you doing?

Nothing. Let's watch
a Scarlett Johansson movie.

But wait, there's more!

We have Yankets for all occasions:

(READING)

Hey, what's going on under that blanket?

You'll never know.

All right, you guys.

I will now do anything for 10 dollars.

Who's got something for me?

I got one. I'll give you 10 bucks

if you wear the same pair
of underwear for a month.

Pay up.

Uh, actually, you owe me $20.

Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.

(WHIMPERING) It won't come off.

Hey, Peter, you want
to earn another 10 bucks?

-Course I do.
-Great, I got a hilarious one.

I'll give you 10 dollars
for your L4 vertebrae.

(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

So, uh, I guess this means
Peter, you're our Joe now,

and Joe, you're our Peter.

That means you got to do
anything for 10 bucks.

-Okay.
-I have a request.

Yay! Joe's chin!

Hey, Peter, I just
thought of something else

you could do for 10 bucks.

Yeah, you know... you know what?

I... I'm, uh, think I'm gonna,

um, upping my price to $12.50.

No, you ca... no, you're locked in at 10.

Yeah, no renegotiating!

It was a joke.

Shut u... Just-just point me to the thing.

All right, we're gonna open
this fire hydrant

and you're gonna drink as
much water from it as you can.

Chris has Crohn's disease.

Get down there.

Don't-don't-don't tell us that now.

I think this is how
Anna Nicole Smith died.

Don't make light of that.

Holy crap!

We-we-we got to get out of here!

Aw, man, the library.

<i>White Fang?</i>

This is for ruining
my eighth grade summer!

(PANTING)

(SCREAMS)

(GRUNTING)

(GUNSHOT) Aah!

He ruined my summer, too.

Oh, hey, Bri.

Still sitting in chairs, huh?

What'd your back ever do to you?

I'm trying to watch.

Know what I'm watching? My core.

Your body and mind are supposed
to be on the same team.

Sitting on the hard floor's
good for your back, too.

Coming up: female high school teacher
sleeps with her students.

Is she hot? Stay tuned.

But first, the public library
suffered damage this evening

when an area fat man

smashed through the front of the building

while attempting a drunken stunt.

The bus station is expected
to absorb the overflow

of homeless armpit-washing ladies.

Oh, God.

Peter, is there something
you want to tell me?

Uh, yeah, every light in the house is on.

Did you destroy the library?

Did I destroy the library?

Ha, no, Lois.

That was television.

In light of events at the library,

we now go live to a press conference

at the mayor's residence.

Good evening, Quahog.

I'm here tonight with the deputy mayor.

Hi, everybody!

Shut. Up.

Anyway, these types
of immature, drunken high-jinks

are destroying our town.

And if we can't trust

a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly,

then I have no choice but to take action.

So, as mayor of Quahog,

I hereby raise the town's
legal drinking age to 50.

What?

I can't drink anymore?

What am I gonna do?

What do people do who don't drink?

I don't know. Knit?

Knit? Knit?
Are you kidding me?

Maybe.

Um, okay, so it turns out

I am, like, crazy good at knitting.

<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

It's day three of Quahog's
new ban on alcohol

for anybody under 50.

And if there's one thing

the new drinking age law has done,

it's let us know that women
tell terrible stories.

Good to see your eyes open, Tom.

For more on this story,
we now go to Tricia Takanawa.

Tricia?

Joyce, I'm standing here

on the streets of Quahog,

where citizens are feeling the effects

of the city's new drinking law.

I was going to bone my girlfriend,

but she told me that if

there wasn't vanilla vodka involved,

there was no way.

I think we just have to trust
our elected officials...

and Goldman's Pharmacy
is fully stocked on cough syrup,

which goes great with ginger ale.

Well, I do miss drinking,

but I have used the time
to reconnect with my children

and I'm actually thinking about
resuming my actuarial practice.

Oh, my God, he's just
been drunk this whole time?

This new law sucks.

And I got to say, it was kind of uncool

of Mayor West to call it "Peter's Law."

No kidding.

Now I know how Megan
from "Megan's Law" felt.

I... I don't... I don't think
you know how she felt.

I don't know why I didn't
think of this before, guys.

We'll just go into the brewery

after hours and take some beer.

-Hey, buddy.
-It's okay, I work here.

Aren't you the guy who
cried in that meeting?

Oh, yeah, you know...
you know, I just remembered,

there's no beer here, l-let's-
let's just, let's just go.

Peter, why'd you want me
to get us into this prison?

Because, Joe, everyone
knows that all prisoners

make bootleg wine in their toilet.

We are gonna get so wasted!

Oh! Look, right here.

This one's full of Chardonnay.

Peter, I don't think that's...

PETER: <i>But it was Chardonnay.</i>

<i>The best Chardonnay</i>
<i>I'd ever had in my life.</i>

<i>The man who made it,</i>
<i>Curtis "Murder Dog" Williams,</i>

<i>went on to become</i>

<i>one of America's</i><i>most celebrated vintners.</i>

JOE: <i>Hey, Joe here.</i>
<i>Peter's lying.</i>

<i>He drank pee-pee.</i>

Don't worry, guys.

If we can't buy alcohol in Quahog,

we'll just go to the next town over.

Sorry, in this town,
you can only buy alcohol

if you're dressed head-to-toe in jeans.

What? Who made that law?

Our mayor, Jay Leno.

Have you seen some of these laws
they've got now about denim?

You know, I say,

if you don't like it,
you may as well Levi's.

Who's voting for these mayors?

Rhode Island's a mess from top to bottom.

I tell you, guys,

getting alcohol when you're underage

isn't as easy as Obama's
daughters make it look.

What? Is that true?

I don't know.

Hey, isn't that your dog at the bar?

Hey, Jerome, one more, neat.

What the hell?

Why's Jerome serving booze to Brian?

I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

(WHISTLES)
Come here, boy! Come on!

Hey, what's up?
We going for a ride in the car?

No, no, I had a question for you.

Don't ever (BLEEP) do that

unless you have a car ride to offer.

Hey, how come you're allowed to drink?

Yeah, you're not 50.

Uh, actually, I am.

I'm 56 in dog years.

Oh, is that why you got white pubic hair?

I'll thank you not
to check out my pubic hair.

Well, then don't go flashing it around.

Put on some underpants, you crazy old man.

Peter, I think you're missing the point.

Brian can buy us booze.

Oh, my God, you're right!

W-Would you do that for us, Brian?

-Sure, why not?
-Aw, thank God.

'Cause just sitting here all sober

is more boring than watching a pot boil.

Hey, you.

-What are you doing?
-I like to watch.

I want to watch you boil.

I can't do it with you watching.

Oh, not even if I do this?

Don't do that...
Oh, God, that's so hot.

Oh, yeah?

Then why don't I take your top off?

Oh! Oh...

I'm boiling! I'm boiling!

Yeah.

Now I'm gonna stick my raw pasta in you.

LOIS: Peter, what's going on in there?

Making dinner, babe.

Hey, hey, Brian, Brian.

How would you like to build,

build a deck, right now, with your buddy?

'Cause we got hammers...

the whole deal.

I don't know, man. It's pretty dark out.

That's okay.

I'll just pull my car around

and point the headlights at it.

Did you know that my dad
once called me a mistake?

That's messed up, man.

Wow.

You know, Brian, hanging out with you

this past week has been awesome.

Yeah, why don't we,
why don't we do this anymore?

We-we-we used to do fun stuff
all the time, you know?

It used to be you and me.

And it always will be, pal.

Hey, listen, listen.

I want you to be Meg's godfather.

No, thanks, Peter.

But this here, we got to keep this going.

I agree, buddy, I agree.

All right, I'm gonna go barf
down the garbage disposal.

Brian, I think we can get John Mayer

to stop tweeting again,
but we all got to work together.

Oh, my God! Are you drunk again?

Yeah, I was, I was just hanging
out with my main man, Peter.

"Main man"?

"Hanging out"?

Brian, he's only using you to buy alcohol!

What? What are, wha...?

What are you, what are you talking about?

It hasn't dawned on you
that he only started

spending time with you when
the drinking age was raised?

Come on, that's, that's not true.

(PETER RETCHING)

PETER: Aw, shoot, I puked
in the clean dishes side.

Trust me, as soon as you're
no longer of use to him,

he'll be done with you.

Oh, I get it, I get it.

Okay, you're, you're jealous

'cause I'm spending
all my time with Peter.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

Yeah, where's my dumb,
morbidly obese friend?

CHRIS: Hey, Stewie, get in here!

I'm being an '80s computer hacker!

Come on, baby, show me what you got.

And we... are in!

All right, I better go.

I got to go tell him
"This isn't a game, man."

Brian, do you have any idea why Peter

was trying to climb in the dishwasher?

I thought it was a Tokyo apartment.

Sorry, Lois, we, uh, we got...

I guess we had a little too much to drink.

"To drink"?

It's against the law for him to do that!

Was Stewie in here?

Was, was he in here?
I... I smell his cologne.

Listen to me, Brian.

No more booze in this house.

You're gonna get us all in trouble.

Peter, we... maybe we should find

some place else to get... to drink.

Yeah, I think you're right.

Hi, we're here from the '80s FBI.

Somebody here with a 2,400-baud modem

almost started World War III.

(GLENN FREY'S <i>THE HEAT IS ON</i>

Oop, sounds like they're making an escape.

Hey, you want to see me run up that slide?

Sure.

(GRUNTS)

Ow, damn it!

I think my belt buckle cut my gut!

Hey, Peter, can I ask you something?

You're not just hanging out
with me because I,

I can buy you alcohol, right?

What? Course not. We're friends.

Yeah, no, I-I know. That's,
that's, that's what I thought.

And also you bring me dead birds.

I know Lois gets mad about it,

but I like using them to point at things.

Hey, did they move the bagels?

-Yeah, they're right there.
-Oh, my God!

What the hell is that?

This? This is a pointing bird.

All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on,

so I'm gonna go bite
at the water a little bit.

Hey, what's going on here?

Uh, some butthorn's
shining a flashlight on me.

I meant prior to me coming
up and investigating this.

Oh, well, you got to be clearer, man.

I'm wasted.

Sir, I'm gonna need to see some I.D.

You look underage.

Just as I suspected.
You're a minor.

It ain't my fault!

Somebody's been buying it
for me and all my friends!

Oh, is that right?

Well, you better tell me who that is
or you're in a lot of trouble.

Hey, is this the park where Boner died?

Wait, wha-what's going on?

That's him, Officer!

That's who's been buying us the booze!

-What?
-You get home, son.

You're lucky I'm letting
you off with a warning.

But you, you're coming with me.

-You got to be kidding!
-Do you need a ride?

Nah, I'm just gonna stay
here until the sun comes up

and then be the best at tetherball.

(GRUNTING)

Next!

What are you in for?

I bought some alcohol for
someone I thought was my friend.

How about you?

I threw a bottle of rum through
the window of the Apple Store.

I couldn't remember me password.

(SIGHS) Well, this sucks.

Oh, it's not so bad.

Sometimes they let you
take the good trash home,

if you ask nice.

Last week, I got an old greeting card.

It obviously wasn't for me,

but the imagination's a hell of a thing.

(TIRES SCREECH)

Hey, Brian, what time you get off?

Me and the guys were hoping you
could buy us some more beer.

-You can't be serious.
-Eh, it's a little bit serious.

Yeah, I haven't been drunk in a day.

And I'm not feeling particularly handsome.

Peter, you're the reason I'm here!

You totally sold me out to that cop!

Oh, are we just gonna play the blame game?

'Cause I got another game I'd rather play.

Boggle.

Go to hell! You used me.

That's not what friends do.

It's what Adam Sandler's friends do.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a half a can of hot beer

left in this open container
I've been driving around with.

(GLUGGING)

(BELCHES)

You, too, pig.

Well, I'm not the
smartest man in the world,

but I can always look back on
my life and say I went for it.

Ugh, this seems like a weird
place to even use a condom.

Just shut up, Peter.
I'm done with you, all right?

You completely lied about why
you were hanging out with me.

What? I never lie.

Well, except for that one time.

Oh, my God!
My husband's having a heart attack!

Is anyone here a doctor?

I have a 13-inch penis!

(APPLAUSE)

And besides, I'm sick of you

acting like you're such a victim.

You agreed to buy us booze,

'cause we weren't old enough.

You're not old enough?

You're a man in his 40s!

This whole law is ridiculous!

Hey, can one of you guys with elbows

try to get this truck to honk?

(TRUCK HORN HONKS TWICE)

Ah, that and giving noogies

is what I miss most about having elbows.

You know, Brian, what you said is right.

This law is stupid.

I mean, if it weren't for that,

we never would've been in this fight.

Yeah, but what difference does it make?

It's the law. Nothing we can do about it.

The hell there's not.

I bet if we worked together

we could find a way to change it back.

I... I don't know, Peter.

Come on, I know it seems hard,
but we can't just give up.

I mean, what if Thomas Edison
had given up?

Uh, what's that?
What's that thing you're working on?

Well, it's a lightbulb and...

A lightbulb! Lightbulb!
I invented that.

Me... I'm Thomas Edison.

I invented the lightbulb.

Uh, what's it do?

It lights up a room using electrical...

Lights up a room using electrical stuff!

I was about to say that,
because <i>I</i> invented it!

Uh, what are you working on?

-It's a phonograph...
-Phonograph!

I knew that, 'cause <i>I</i> invented it.

I'm Thomas Edison.

I rule!

<i>Look it up</i>

<i>Edison was a dick</i>

Okay, Peter, I know how
we can get the law changed.

I've been doing some research,
and it says here

that in eight months, we can
get a non-binding proposition

on the ballot as long
as we get 4,000 signatures.

Ah, screw that, we're going with plan B...

threaten to kill the mayor's nephew.

I love you, Dad!

Peter, that's your son.

Shut up, Brian!

He's hugging me!

So, what exactly is your plan, here?

You'll see.

Just follow my lead.

(DOORBELL CHIMES)

Ooh, trick-or-treaters!

Well, what do we have here?

A cowboy and a princess?

Uh, yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Mayor.

Oh, a Western princess!

All right, listen, we want
that drinking law gone.

And everybody knows the best way
to get any law struck down

is to get the gays angry about it.

Bruce? Jeffrey?

That's right, Mr. Mayor!

I needs my Proseccos!

What are you talking about?
You're 52.

(GASPS) You said you was 39!

I was just trying to get you in bed.

I thought we'd both be dead by now.

Crap. But come on,
you got to change that law!

I mean, it's already ruined a friendship

with one of the best guys I know!

CAROL: Adam, who's at the door?

Oh, hi, Brian.

Hi, Peter.

Wait a minute.

Is that, is that wine?

Yeah, Adam just poured me
a little before dinner.

Wow, you guys eat late.

No, Peter, don't you see?
Carol's underage, too!

The mayor just broke his own law!

Mm, that's a good point.

I guess I'll just have
to resign in scandal

while leaving the law intact.

Or you could just change the law.

But it's a good law.

No, it ain't!

Look, don't you understand what drinking

means to us working stiffs?

It helps us forget about our day

and tell our children we
love 'em with a straight face.

It allows gross uggos to boof
each other's gross uggo parts.

And it gives people the courage
to sneak onto their mayor's

property and blackmail him
and eat all his ripe tomatoes.

That was a croquet ball.

Ah, then could you point me to
the closest nighttime dentist?

So listen, Mr. Mayor,
what do you say about that law?

(SIGHS) All right, I'll repeal it.

But only if you send me and
Carol a copy of that picture.

We don't have a lot
of the two of us together.

Brian, we did it!
We got him to change the law!

Just goes to show, if anybody
wants a law changed,

they should just go
to their mayor's house.

Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate

what you said there, about our friendship.

Well, to be honest, Brian,

at first I did just want you
to buy us beer.

But then the-the more we were hanging out,

I-I remembered how much fun
we used to have together.

I guess after all these years,

I started taking you for granted.

But you're still my best friend.

Even if I don't always act like it.

I enjoyed hanging out with you, too.

Thanks, Peter.

Hey, on your way out,

could you put this in my
mailbox for the mailman?

Uh, sure.
Put the flag up?

Of course put the flag up!

Geez, mail much?

Well, Peter, I'm just happy
that you and Brian

managed to get that law repealed,

and that you're finally friends again.

Me, too, Lois.

Good to have my drinking buddy back.

Yay, everybody's happy!

I love this family!

I draped that over him.

He was just doing it out in the open.

(GROANING SOFTLY)

Okay, who'd like to start us off
with show-and-tell?

Stewie?

Yes, today I brought in
my mother's driver's license.

Now, if you look closely,
she's clearly drunk.

You could put a Breathalyzer up
to that photo, and she'd get a DUI.

Ha-ha, Stewie's naked!

What?

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, my God! Don't look! Don't look!
Cell phones down! Cell phones down!

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

-(SHOUTS) What the deuce?
-LOIS: Stewie!

Run from the monster.

You might have to drive.

(GROANING)

Thank you all so much
for coming this evening

to my very fancy dinner party.

Oh, my God! I'm at Glenn Close's house!

You look very handsome tonight, Stewie.

Well, thank you. And you're the prettiest

of all the women I know
whose name is Glenn.

Everyone, please finish your salads,
because our main course tonight is...

Boiled rabbit. (LAUGHING)

(LAUGHTER)

I-I don't... I don't get that.

It seems weird that I'd have a joke
in my own dream that I don't get.

Oh, thank you so... (SHOUTS)

(GROANING)

Quick, you're almost on!

What? I'm on?
But I don't know any of my lines!

(GASPS)

(SINGING) <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

What the hell? Put him on the bench.

Wait, please, no! I just wasn't ready!

Don't worry. We'll put you in soon.

Ho-ho-ho!

Is funny because you won't be back!

ALL: (SINGING) <i>He's a family guy!</i>

(SHOUTS)

Wait, how did Joe
get halfway up those stairs?

Lois, get in here!
It's dark and I'm frightened!

I think they've got this thing backwards.

Hey, wake up! I had a bad dream,
so now your night has to be terrible.

Peter, Stewie's upset.
Scooch over so he can sleep with us.

Oh, come on. Are you serious?
Last time, he kicked me all night.

And I got a big day tomorrow.
I got two shows.

All right, folks, big treat for you today.

He's a little shy.

Put your hands together for Sham-Peter!

I'm not shy! I'm angry!

I'm in constant pain!

This act has been condemned
by over 30 nations!

I'm gonna kill you all!

PETER: <i>Ah, crap. I can't sleep like this.</i>

<i>And now my mind is racin'.</i>

<i>Like, how does that candle</i>
<i>in</i> Beauty and the Beast <i>sing so good?</i>

<i>I mean, the teapot I get,</i>
<i>'cause she's a girl.</i>

<i>But</i><i>the candle, I don't under...</i>

(COUGHS)

(GROANS)

Couch it is, I guess.

Oh, my God. The couch is gone.

Where the hell is... Oh, that's right.
Couchella is this weekend.

(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, man, where you been?

I just had sex with a girl on her period!

Dude, that's not a brag!

So, how fat are you?

Two-forty? Nice.

-Oh, Peter! What are you doing down here?
-Oh, hey, Brian.

Stewie kind of took over our bed,
so I'm looking for a place to sleep.

Well, why don't you go up to the attic?
I think there's even a futon up there.

Huh. That's a great idea.

Geez, I'm glad you came along.

I'm gonna sleep better
than a cartoon sheriff.

(SNORING)

(CLICK)

(TWINKLY TOES SOUND EFFECT)

(QUIETLY) I was in jail
'cause I killed a bunch of old ladies.

And now that I'm out,
I'm gonna do it again.

(LIGHT-HEARTED MUSIC CUE)

Wow, Stewie, you look exhausted.

Yeah, 'cause I was up super late
last night, beefing your mom.

-My mom's dead.
-Yeah, 'cause I beefed her to death.

Whoa, what's your problem?
Why are you being such a jerk?

I'm sorry, Brian.
I had the absolute worst night.

I had a weird dream. A frightening dream.

Yeah, Stewie, that's called a nightmare.

Sounds like you must've had
your first one.

That's what a nightmare is?

I thought "nightmare" meant,
like, being invited

to an apartment party.

Get a house if you want to have a party.
I'm not going to a party in an apartment.

Relax, it's no big deal.
People have nightmares all the time.

Oh, no, Brian. I am not living
through that horror again.

In fact, I've decided
that from this day forward,

I shall never allow myself
to fall asleep again.

Come on, that's ridiculous.
How do you think you're gonna do that?

I don't know. Maybe I'll get a job
working the night shift at a supermarket.

Hey, where's the vegetable aisle?

Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m.
You're not here for vegetables.

(DEJECTEDLY) Well, I got the 12 cucumbers.

-What's wrong?
-Just this guy at the...

(SIGHS) Never mind.

Peter, we have a hamper.

Stop throwing your dirty clothes
in the toilet.

Peter?

Peter, where are you?

(VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS)

What's all this?

Oh, hey, Lois. Welcome to the Pete Pad,

where the dancing's hot,
the drinks are hot...

Everything's just freakin' hot.

What have you done to the attic?

Well, when I slept up here
the other night,

I realized what a great space it is.

So I dragged up some stuff
and turned it into a sweet hangout.

Even made it extra awesome
by stealing a real street sign.

(CHILDREN GIGGLING IN DISTANCE)

-(TIRES SCREECH, THUDDING)
-(CHILDREN SCREAM)

I don't understand.
What are you gonna do up here?

Eh, mostly just burn the roof of my mouth
on unevenly-heated microwave burritos.

Now I'm busy,
so close the floor and get out of here.

All right, all right, come on, Stewie.

You've got to stay awake.
I know what'll help.

I'll watch that preview channel
that always has inconsistent volumes.

ANNOUNCER 1: <i>They're mother and daughter</i>
<i>but also best friends.</i>

<i>Catch</i> Gilmore Girls <i>on Channel 367.</i>

ANNOUNCER 2: (LOUDLY, BLOWN-OUT) <i>You can</i>
<i>name your own price</i><i>for hotel rooms!</i>

(WATER GURGLING)

(EXHALES) Help! Please!

(GRUNTS) Damn it! Why can't I move?

(RATTLING)

(GROWLING)

Aah!

Stewie, you okay? What happened?

I was just sitting here on the couch

and I had another nightmare
about that horrible monster.

Okay, that's it. I'm gonna help you
get these nightmares under control.

Really? Oh, thank you, Brian.

And maybe I can help you
control your strange obsession

with eating pencil erasers.

It's not an obsession.

Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah.

Oh, so rubbery. Mmm.

It's like a little steak. Mmm, mmm.

Brian, you really should...

The world is small and safe
when I do this!

Okay, Stewie, I read the review
of a dream book on Amazon,

so I think I can help you.

Literally every other tab
is open to Lusty Matures.

Yup, that's what it takes now.

Anyway, it says here that most nightmares
are born of subconscious fears.

So maybe if we make a list of the things
you're most afraid of,

we can face and conquer
these fears together,

and then your nightmares'll end.

Huh, that's actually a good idea.
Like the U.S. Army Reserves.

(EXPLOSION)

We're completely surrounded.
We need reinforcements.

You know who could really bail us out?

Somebody who works five days a week
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

These new digs of yours
are pretty great, Peter.

Hey, I brought
construction paper and markers

in case you guys want to draw breasts.

Cool. But before that,
who's up for another insulation fight?

-I'm in.
-Heck yeah.

(GIGGLING)

-Ha!
-(GIGGLING)

Gotcha!

Missed me.

Sneak attack!

(ALL GIGGLING)

(COUGHING)

What are you doing up here?

I need you to take the trash out.

You know what? I'm gonna use this

Peter Doesn't Have to Take Out
the Trash coupon

that I got for my anniversary.

You gave that to yourself.

I don't know, it says "official."

Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.
This whole attic business is ridiculous.

Hey, guys, check it out.

I'm a lady.

Joe...

You hit a home run with that,
I want to try it.

All right, Stewie,
time to tackle your fears.

Now, it sounds like
you're scared of monsters.

So to help you get over it,
here's Frankenstein.

(GROWLS) I'm Frankenstein.

I'm actually really nice.

There's no need
to be scared of me. (GROWLS)

Seriously? This is obviously Chris
in a costume.

Huh. Well, that can't be possible.

Because here comes Chris
walking in the door right now.

Hey, hey, hey. Here comes Chris Griffin,
a-roodly-toot-toot.

Yeah, okay, whatever, Meg.

Meg? You must be talking about me,
a-roodly-toot-toot.

-Do they all say "a-roodly-toot-toot"?
-A lot of them, yeah.

Chris, I'm putting
together a load of laundry.

You got anything?

(MUFFLED CHEERING)

Damn it, Peter. Are you guys
playing lawn darts in the attic again?

PETER: No.

Yay, lawn darts!

Peter wins lawn darts.

She's dumb. She got no idea.

(SIGHS)

(LAUGHING)

All right, Peter, that's enough.
It is time to get out of...

What the hell?

Oh, yeah, we put Joe
in Stewie's old Jolly Jumper.

You told me this was
a paratrooper's harness.

Shut up, baby man.

That's it. This is our home,

not some frat house
for you and your friends.

Now, I want you out of this attic now.

No way, we ain't leaving.
We're having too much fun up here.

Quagmire just showed us
his Eric McCormack impression.

There could be no such thing.

Well, that's what I said,
but then he did it,

and I was like,
"Oh, all right, okay, yeah, kind of."

Fine. You like the damn attic so much?
Then enjoy the attic!

(ELECTRIC WHIRRING)

Did... Did she just lock us in here?

It looks like it.

Guys, spin me back.
I didn't see what happened.

So, how'd it go last night?
Did we cure your nightmares?

No, not at all. They were worse than ever.

Which is why I built this.

What the hell is that?

It's a Digital Dream Interface.

You see, once connected to this device,

you will be able to enter
my sleeping mind,

where you will end these horrible dreams
once and for all.

I'm gonna do what?

(BABBLES)

What... What-what does he want?
What is he saying?

I think he's saying "a-roodly-toot-toot."

We just can't understand him
because of the way he talks.

(BABBLES)

Oh, no, no,
I think he just needs a ride home.

Stewie, you can't be serious.

Oh, I'm very serious.

You and I will place these cranial
impulse receptor caps on our heads,

I shall begin my slumber, and...

And then this thing will actually allow me
to enter your dream?

That's right, Brian. I want you
to come inside me while I'm asleep.

Do-Don't... Don't say it like that.

And once you're in my dream,
your job is to stop

these nightmares by finding
that monster and killing him.

This isn't a job for the meek, Brian.

When you get in there,
you've got to be hard.

-Okay, but that felt intentional.
-All right, let's get to it.

This is your receptor cap.
Over here is your REM monitor.

What's this thing do?

Oh, that's just a little
bike bell for fun.

(RINGS)

I found it at the crosswalk where
those kids got creamed the other day.

Anyway, let's get started.

Hello? Stewie?

Ah, you must be Brian. I'm Glenn.

Yes, I know.
You were very mean in <i>101 Dalmatians.</i>

Thank you. Would you like
to do the Bristol Stomp?

(SINGING) <i>The kids in Bristol</i>
<i>Are sharp as a pistol</i>

<i>When they do the Bristol Stomp</i>

How does he even know this?

He heard it once in the car.

Geez, Lois is really serious.

I can't believe
she left us up here all night.

Damn it, we got to do something.

Maybe if we just scream for help
someone'll hear us.

Help! Help!

Help!

...and just because of the roles I play,

people always assume
I'm very serious in real life.

-Yeah, I could see that.
-But I'm not.

I'm very capable of being silly, too.

See, watch, I'll show you.

Fart.

I, uh... Did-did...
Did you just say "fart"?

Yes, that's me being rather silly.

Well, hello, Brian.
I say, what brings you here?

Stewie, hey!

I'm here to find and kill the monster
that's been causing all your nightmares.

Oh, that sounds wonderful! Let's do it!

Oh, but real quick, I'm just gonna
turn into Elmo for a second.

Hi, Brian!

Elmo speak bad English
on educational show!

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

(HISSING)

(GASPS) What the hell? It's me!

Oh, my God, you're right!

But I... I don't understand.

Why am I the source of your fears?

Huh. I'm not sure.

Maybe this means that deep down,

the thing I'm most afraid of
is disappointing you.

Me? Wh-Why do you care so much
about what I think?

Well, think about it.

You've been more of a father figure to me

than the fat man ever
has been or ever will be.

Look, I know
I'm always busting your balls,

but it's just because
you're the only person in this house

whose judgment actually matters to me.

Wow. Thanks, Stewie.

But listen, you-you never have
to worry about letting me down.

I'll always be proud of you.

In fact, I already am.

-You are?
-'Course I am.

I mean, you're only a baby, and yet,

you're one of the most
amazing people I know.

Well, thank you, Brian.

Well, Stewie,
seems like my work here is done.

What's the best way out of here?

Oh, yeah, no, that one stays locked
until the overnight to Vegas

with my college a cappella group.

Peter, I'm going crazy up here.

We all are!

You got to talk to Lois!

Damn it, you're right.

Lois, let us out of here!

No way! You like it so much?

Then you can rot up there
with your buddies!

PETER: Lois, so help me God,
if you don't let us out right this second,

I'm gonna take a dump
on your wedding dress!

You wouldn't dare!

Don't test me. I'll do it!
We'll all do it!

Quagmire, pull down your pants!

-QUAGMIRE: What? I'm not doing that!
-You leave my dress alone, Peter!

CLEVELAND: If it'll get us out of here,
I'll make a doodie on it.

QUAGMIRE: What, are you nuts?

CLEVELAND: I've been crowning
for six hours!

PETER: Cleveland's pants are off, Lois!
Here come mine! This is happening!

QUAGMIRE: Lois, they're not bluffing!
Open the door!

JOE: I miss Bonnie!

Damn it, Peter, you hold that in!
I know you can!

You did it on the ferry to Block Island!

QUAGMIRE: Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke!

PETER: That's good!
Puke on the dress! Puke on the dress!

Aah, damn it!

There! You happy?

You were too late. We pooed on the gown.

Ripped a big hole in your ceiling, too.

I barfed on Peter's ass.

I-I don't know if it got
on the dress or not, Lois,

but I-I am... I am so sorry.

Yeah, this was all a huge disaster.

(INHALES DEEPLY) Let's just agree
that we both went a bit too far, hmm?

I, uh... I might...

I might need two weeks off
from this friendship.

Stewie, you awake?
Did you have any nightmares?

I don't think so.

(GASPS) Did you get rid of the monster?

Sure did. Turned out
that monster was nothing more

than a manifestation of your subconscious
desire not to disappoint me.

Apparently, I'm like
a father figure to you.

Okay. Wow. Somebody's got a big head.

Stewie, I want you to know...
I'm very proud of you.

All right, that's... That's awkward.
How-how am I supposed to respond to that?

-You are a good person.
-Stop complimenting me.

"Oh, I sure hope the dog
approves of who I am."

I'm out of here, weirdo.

There's a wedding dress out here
covered in (BLEEP).

(KNOCKING)

Hey, welcome to Bonnie's
29th birthday party.

(LAUGHING) I ca... I can't keep this up.

She's 46.

Here, we brought you guys
an orchid from Trader Joe's,

because we don't know
or care about any of your interests.

Well, I put together some videos
for Bonnie's party.

Here we are on our honeymoon.

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

Yeah, Cabo was great.

We even went back
for our 10th anniversary.

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

Better wrap it up, honey,
tide's coming in.

Well, let's break for presents,

but after that,
I'll show you Susie's birth video,

and I'll tell you, she fell out of there
like an orange out of an old dress sock.

Ugh, I have to text Rupert
what a train wreck this is.

(QUACKING SOUND)

Hey, I want real things.

(TOILET FLUSHING)

Kind of weird they're keeping
all our jackets in the tub.

(CRYING)

(CRYING CONTINUES)

Bonnie?

I told you, Joe, when we're alone,
you can call me "Bonald."

No, i-it's me, Brian.

Is that your real name?

I mean, are you... Are you okay?

-Sorry, am I allowed on the bed?
-I guess so.

-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

I have something in my eye.

Yes, you do. It looks like sadness.

Come on, you can tell me.
I'm your neighbor's dog.

I don't know.

It's just that when I was young,

I had so many things
I wanted to do with my life,

but now, I'm 46,

and all I've ever done
is take care of Joe.

And now you feel like you never
had a chance to be your true self.

Yeah.

I know just how you feel.

I mean, I'm happy that Peter found me
and gave me a home,

but sometimes I wonder
if I'd be happier on my own.

Exactly.

It's like sometimes, I feel...

Trapped?

No, I was going to say,
"like the von Trapps."

You know, unable to leave
their home in Austria.

Oh. Well, that still is remarkably close.

Thanks for being so nice to me, Brian.

Why are you scratching behind my ear?

I... I don't... I don't know.
I thought it might make you feel better.

It does feel kind of nice.

You're a good girl.
You're going to be okay.

(SOFT MOANING)

I'm... I'm sorry. I did...
I didn't... I didn't mean...

No, it's okay. Um...

I better go downstairs
before Joe realizes I'm gone.

And before Peter gets into the stuff
that's not for the party.

PETER: Aw, Halloween candy!

JOE: Peter, get out of the pantry.

Ah, I can't believe
I just kissed my friend's wife.

I'm a bigger scumbag than Spock.

I heard that there was a Romulan ship
spotted in our sector, which means...

Hey, hey.

(JABBERING)

Kids, this morning, Principal Shepherd
wanted to say a few words.

Thank you, Mrs. Abbott.

Uh, before I start,

are these the normal kids
or kind of the "dur, dur" ones?

It's a healthy mix.

Good morning, children.

It's that time of the year again

to fulfill your
community service requirement

by signing up for volunteer work.

Do we get to choose our own jobs?

No, no, no, no.
The jobs will be assigned randomly,

but the cooler and prettier students
have the better jobs.

For instance,
blonde chick in the third row

will wash my car this afternoon

while Little Miss Frumpkin
with all the questions

will work in an old folks' home.

Is "frumpkin" good?

(LAUGHING) No, no.

Brian, what are you doing up so late?

Ah, I'm having trouble sleeping.

I got to tell you something.

I kissed Bonnie last night.

-What?
-I know! I know! It was a huge mistake.

So let's just do two or three high-fives
and then forget it ever happened.

Brian, if Joe finds out, he'll kill you.

Yeah, no kidding.
That's why you can't tell anybody.

-Promise me.
-Oh, don't worry. Don't worry.

I'm great at keeping secrets.

Well, except for that one time
you discovered my hidden shame.

-Peter?
-Brian.

I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

I'm one of these guys now.

I'm sorry, Brian, I'm sorry.

Mrs. Parkhurst?
I'm Meg, your new student volunteer.

Oh, you must be my new student volunteer.

Yeah, I just said that.

What's your name, dear?

It's Meg.

Can... Can I get a new person?

Nonsense, come in,

and between you and me,
I hate my new student volunteer.

That ugly little Meg.

She says she's a girl,
but she certainly has a boy's body odor.

(SIGHS)

(DOORBELL RINGING)

Oh, come on in.

Peter, Joe and Bonnie
are here for game night.

Game night?

Yeah, I figured it was
the least we could do,

since you pulled up
a beheading video on your phone

at their party and showed it to everyone.

It was really more about
how loud my phone can get.

-Peter, we're doing this.
-(SIGHS) All right.

But the <i>Operation</i> game
is out of batteries,

so I'll have to make the noise.

(IMITATES BUZZER)

You hear that?
That's the sound of bad surgery.

All right, I'm awesome at charades.
Guys are going first.

Okay, go.

Uh, <i>About a Boy.</i>

Uh, <i>Four... Four Weddings and a Funeral.</i>

Uh, <i>Nine Months.</i>

<i>Notting Hill.</i>

Yes, it was <i>Notting Hill.</i>

I'm going to go get more wine.

Oh, hey.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hi, Brian.

Um, listen, about the other night.
You haven't told anyone, have you?

No, no, of course not.

I was going to ask if you had.

<i>Hey, Brian, can you bring me up a snack?</i>
<i>I'm supposed to be in bed.</i>

Look, the other night was great,
but it was a mistake.

You're right.

STEWIE: <i>Oh, man, wha...</i>

Yeah, I me... I mean, there's...

There's definitely some kind
of connection between us, but...

I felt it, too,

but maybe in another life, huh?

(SIGHS) Yeah, I guess you're right.

This could never work.

Like porn movies before sound.

(LIVELY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

(MOANING AND GRUNTING)

Ooh.

Oh, there you are.
Come on, Bonnie, it's Joe's turn.

Okay, here we go, uh, uh, crippled guy...

Uh, cheating wife...

Uh, uh, cheating wife of a crippled guy...

Uh, dog... Some...
Something with a dog... Uh, dog kiss.

I-I-I, uh, I think that's, uh, time.
Your, your turn is over.

Oh, sounds like, uh, sounds like dog
kisses crippled guy's wife at your party.

Wait, wait! I know it.

The other night at your party,
Brian kissed Bonnie.

-(ALL GASP)
-LOIS: What?

Bonnie, is this true?

Oh, my God.

I know, making out with a dog?

Can you even imagine a woman
who possibly does that for real?

Uh, hi, Joe.

Hi, Brian.

Look, I-I want to apologize
for what happened.

I-I-I didn't mean to kiss Bonnie.

Everybody had a little too much to drink.

It-it just happened.

Uh, I hope we're still cool.

Hey, don't worry about it.
It was a crazy party.

We ran out of salsa.

(LAUGHING)

How do you run out of salsa?

Anyway, we're good.

(RELIEVED SIGH) Really? Oh, thank God.

I-I-I was worried you'd be mad.

Mad? At my buddy, Brian?

Not a chance.

Hey, is that your car?

What? No! Wh-what's he doing?

My car was parked legally.

Huh. Well, maybe your car
violated some sort of unspoken boundary.

One that nobody bothers to codify
because it's just common decency.

Hey, Joe, is that the guy?

Read your text, Jerry.
Not supposed to say you know me.

Well, I hope your day gets better, Brian,
but, uh, I wouldn't count on it.

(EVIL LAUGHTER)

Boy, it wasn't easy, Mrs. Parkhurst,

but I think we got the nail
that was poking through your slipper.

Well, you strike me as someone
who's never going to get married,

that's for sure.

Now get me my itch cream.

Is it in the drawer?

Shut up! I'm trying to hum atonally.

(HUMS ATONALLY)

Ugh.

(HUMMING CONTINUES)

Here's your cream. See you Thursday.

Oh, my God, I can't believe I stole this.

You know what? I don't feel bad.
That woman's a nightmare.

(GASPS) Ooh, I should text this
to my best friend.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Sick brooch!

Adam, are you done
with that mayor homework, yet?

It's called a bill, Mom.

Hey, Brian,

I, uh, feel that things
have been awkward between us,

but just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

-can I buy you a drink?
-You know what? Sure, thanks.

What the hell happened?

Ah! How do I walk? Are these forever?

I also rubbed my butt on you
while you were unconscious.

I like to put stuff online.

Meg, Mom said that...

Hey, what's all this stuff?

Stuff I stole from the old folks' home.

But you should see how they treat me.

Meg, that's no excuse.
Stealing is just plain...

Oh, my God,
is that someone else's glasses?

I love wearing other people's glasses.

(LAUGHS)

Do I look like I stole atomic secrets?

You do.

Wow, this is awesome. I want in.

And there's the splitting headache
from wearing someone else's glasses.

Okay, Chris,
here's a room I haven't hit, yet.

Here, follow my lead.

Who's there? Why are you in my room?

Oh, hi.

You died,
and I'm here to take you to heaven.

Um, upsy-daisy, here we go.

Well, now that I'm in heaven...

(SQUEAKY FART)

Hurry, take everything, and be quick

or we'll be in bigger trouble
than a fat guy at a water park.

Come on, Dad, let's go on the water slide.

(SIGHS) I can't fit.

I'm afraid I'll get stuck.

I'll just go in the lazy river.

-But, Dad...
-No, son, this is the life I've chosen.

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC)

(MUSIC STOPS)

(MUSIC RESUMES)

<i>You've had enough</i>

<i>Of this life...</i>

Guys, thanks again for doing this.

-Joe has been making my life hell.
-Of course.

All right, now when Joe gets here

we're just going to tell him
he needs to lighten up on Brian,

and then we'll all talk this thing out
so we can move past it.

And then I get to show my card trick?

If there's time.

Let's make this quick.

What's going on? What's all this?

Joe, we all know what happened
and we're here for you.

But we think that you're taking
this revenge on Brian

just a little too far.

-Yeah.
-Yeah, I mean, come on.

It's... It's like enough is enough.

The Triscuits are the rosemary kind,
not the regular kind.

Me? I'm not the guy who violated
the sanctity of someone else's marriage.

Well, you make a good point, Joe,
and you're right, this is Brian.

We all know he don't care
where he gets his wick wet.

Just ask Quagmire's father.

Okay, we might be getting
a little off track, here.

Yeah, yeah, Brian's right.
Joe, you're out of control.

Even though Brian's been trying
to do my wife for years,

and on some level, I hate him for it.

Oh, Brian's a complete dick,
we all know that,

but I think we're
losing sight of the point

that Bonnie's a weird slut
who's always letting you know

she's open for business.

What? When am I doing that?

Oh, come on, when are you not doing that?

With that boo-boo-baby voice,
and that still-breastfeeding rack.

(GRUNTS) Give me some of that!

I'm Bonnie's friend,

but she could sometimes get the mail
in something other than a robe.

Okay, so we're all in agreement,
Bonnie and Brian are terrible people.

Quagmire, I want you to think of a card,
but do not tell me what it is.

Okay, enough.

How dare any of you criticize Bonnie?

For years, she gave up her own dreams
to take care of Joe.

And yeah, maybe she kissed me.

Maybe she needed to because she feels
so trapped in her marriage.

It's true.

No one ever takes the time
to ask how I feel.

Brian's the only one.

They don't get us, Bonnie,
and you deserve better than this.

We both do.

You know what? Let's get out of here.

Wow, we are zero for two
on interventions today.

I'm not changing for nobody.

You're no...
You're the ones with the problems.

Ah, we did it.

We don't need those narrow-minded losers.

This is so exciting.

We can finally live
the lives we've always wanted.

Like, I can finally start
my jewelry design business

making earrings for tweens.

Listen, hear that?

That is the sound of not making
an enormous mistake.

I think I hear it.

(ALARM DINGING)

Oh, hang on, looks like we need gas.

So do you have, like, a credit card?

Nope, and no cash, either,
but I don't care.

I couldn't stand another moment with Joe.

It was torture just watching him
do a crossword puzzle.

Hey, Bonnie,
what's a five-letter word for marriage?

Fraud.

Uh, it's got to start with a "U".

Union! Boy, you stink at this.

(BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS)

Boy, it's just so comforting to be here
surrounded by other people's memories.

(BLOWING NOSE LOUDLY)

Back into the sleeve with you.

Can you hand me another nylon

that I use as a sock
with my huge beige shoe?

Sure, and can you hand me that ashtray?

I might fire up this pipe again.

Chris, that's not an ashtray.

That's an urn for someone's ashes.

Really?

Yeah, you've been putting your pipe out
in some guy.

Oh, my God, what are we doing?

I feel awful.

We need to give everything back.

Oh, you're right.

We need to do the right thing.

Like the dad from <i>Small Wonder.</i>

All right, Vicki,
time to shut you down for the night.

(ROBOTIC VOICE) Good night.
See you tomorrow.

(HISSES THROUGH TEETH)

Nah.

(SIGHS) She's really gone,
and she took little Susie with her.

I miss that baby more than anything.

(SUSIE CRYING)

Oh, I guess she left it here.

Joe, I want you to know,
I will not support that relationship.

If Brian and Bonnie get married,
I will not go.

Although, Brian might want
me to be his best man.

Then I'd have to go,
and I'd have to dance.

It would be weird to be best man
and not dance.

And I'd have to give a toast,

and say that Bonnie's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

You know, she is the best thing
that ever happened to him,

but don't worry, Joe.
I'll only refer to you as Bonnie's ex.

You know, like, "Bonnie has an ex,
but Brian marks the spot."

-Oh, Peter, that's good.
-Thanks, babe.

I hope Brian and Bonnie
are as happy as us.

To Brian and Bonnie.

Bad news, the teenage runaways
at table four were not big tippers.

We just need enough money to get to Taos.

That's like the capital
of making and selling your own jewelry.

Okay, enough about the jewelry.
Do you even know how to make it?

I know how to make jewelry.

I just don't know
how to make the metal go into shapes.

Hey, you know what'd be great?

If you could talk with even
a little bit of inflection to your voice,

so it doesn't sound so much
like a (BLEEP) power sander.

Screw you.

You tweet things
that aren't worth tweeting.

Well, I'm sorry,

but Kim Kardashian did get famous
for making a sex tape.

We all know that. That's not yours.

And stop breathing through your mouth.
It's really annoying.

I'm panting.
That's how I sweat, you dumb bitch.

No, it isn't.
Dogs sweat through their paws.

You're such a know-it-all, Brian,
you don't even know about your own body.

At least I've had an orgasm.

Wow, I am sorry.

Look, th-this isn't us.

This is just the no food
and sleeping in a car talking.

We can make this work,
like couples who meet on Craigslist.

BOTH: You're not
what you look like in your picture.

Let's get this over with.

I wonder which one of us is the murderer?

Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room,

and then I'm done with my volunteer hours
and we never come back here again.

Mrs. Parkhurst?

Look at you two,
stealing from the elderly.

You're worse than that Juliette Lewis
who makes out with dogs.

Wait, is that a real thing?
Where did you hear that?

What are your sources?

Listen, we're very sorry
we stole from you,

but you have it all back now,
so we cool, right?

You know I should call the police on you.

The police?

Or maybe, instead, we do things my way.

What's that?

You will spend time with us
every afternoon after school,

doing jigsaw puzzles,
reading us the newspaper,

listening to poorly remembered stories
that have no point.

You monster.

Sit down.

Now I feel some dementia coming.

Feed me pudding
while I grip your wrist in terror.

Ah, this isn't my house.

See, if I make under 20 grand
for 20 years,

my film school debt just goes away.

That's a government rule.

-(BELL JINGLES)
-Bonnie?

Joe?

How did you find me?

Love is a powerful compass.

Any time I quiet my mind
and clear my heart,

it always leads me to you.

Plus, dirtbag here has a chip in his ear.

I do? Damn it.

No wonder Peter's so good
at hide-and-seek.

You're under the canoe in Quagmire's yard.

BRIAN: Son of a bitch!

Bonnie, I understand now why you left.

Over the years, I probably
have become too dependent on you,

and I'm sorry
if you've had to put your dreams

on hold because of me.

Oh, Joe.

But I'm here to fight for you, Bonnie.

And if you're willing to come back home,

I promise I'll spend the rest of my days
taking care of you,

just the way
you've always taken care of me.

Of course, I want to come home, Joe.

I love you.

(MOANING)

Wow, I guess just call me
Cupid, huh? (CHUCKLES)

You're welcome.

Ow! Damn it!

(GROANING)

Hey, Bri, came to try that apple pie
you were texting about.

Oh, you're shot.

Well, Chris and I
sure learned a lot this week.

Ha, you think you learned a lot.
I had quite an adventure.

You know what guys?
We only got like 15 seconds left.

We're gonna have to do these
at the same time.

Let's race. And... Go.

So Chris and I learned
that just 'cause people are old,

that doesn't mean
you should steal from them.

Bonnie didn't let you
stir the paint, did she?

No. But I am done messing
around with neighbors' wives.

Here's an invitation
to Donna's birthday party.

-'Cause maybe then I'd like it.
-Hey, let me see that.

-You rascal.
-Same old Meg.

And the winner is... Nobody.

Especially not you.

Good night!

There's a sign in the bathroom that says,
"If it's brown, let it mellow."

Sometimes it crests the toilet lid.

Peter, I think we should
send Stewie to Corridors.

I know it's a little pricey,
but it's the best preschool in the area.

Really? Is that the one
where they make 'em dress

in the little shorts and hats
like the guy in AC/DC?

Yeah, why does he wear that outfit?

'Cause he rocks.

-(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
-(CROWD CHEERING)

When I picked this,

I didn't know I'd have
to wear it when I'm 60!

I'm very cold.

You know what seems like a lie to me?

A Forever stamp that says "love" on it.

Oh, you want to go ahead of me?

Hey, how are you?

You know what seems like a lie to me?

I can help the fourth person in line.

One, two, three... yes!

Cleveland, you work here?

Yup, finally landed myself a job.

Hey, what can Brown do for you?

(LAUGHS)

That's our competitor, though.
I'm not supposed to say that.

It's grounds for dismissal
if anyone ever got fired here,

-but they don't.
-Well, good for you.

Oh, could I get a return receipt for this?

It's Stewie's registration form
for his new school.

Lil' Papa Stew-Stew's off to college?

No, just preschool.
He's very young.

Can you just charge me
my weirdly uneven price so I can be done?

All right, that's $2.16.

$4.37 if you want to send it the priority.

Oh, no, we got to start saving our pennies

now that we're sending
Stewie to a new school.

I'm actually doing some
job hunting after this.

SEAMUS: Let's go up there!

You know, Lois, the post office is hiring.

Really?
Oh, wow, that'd be great.

Yeah, I'd be happy
to get you an interview,

and as a white woman,
you'd be a minority here,

unless you're an alcoholic.

Wow, this place is really fancy.

Their Flat Stanley is
actually award-winning actor

Stanley Tucci.

Sometimes I wear glasses
and sometimes I don't.

Hi, I'm Chadley.

I've been kidnapped three times
because I come from money.

Oh, yes, I've heard about your family.

You've had two older brothers
die of drugs?

That's right.

Stewie, what would you say
to a playdate at my house tomorrow?

That sounds delightful.

My word, it feels so good
to finally be where I belong.

Like Judd Hirsch
at the gigantic sweater store.

Hi, uh, all five of us are Judd Hirsch.

Do you have a sweater
big enough to fit all of us?

Okay, everybody climb in.

Ah, I can't wait to spill soup on this.

Okay, Judds, shamble away.

Good having you aboard, Lois.
Let me show you around.

That guy right there? Larry.

Okay, got it.

A-And what's this giant,

(ECHOING) empty,
football-stadium-sized room?

Oh, the post office anticipates
that within the next five years

at least 200 million men in this country
will be ordering and receiving RealDolls.

Every man will have
seven to nine RealDolls.

Asians, blonde Southern girls,

blonde Asians capable of performing
every possible sexual act,

or at least incapable of refusing.

You can put one in your car
and drive in the car pool lane with it

and then maybe you can push her head down,

thus defeating the purpose
of the car pool lane

while fulfilling the purpose
of the RealDoll.

Maybe a trucker goes by.

You say, "Hey, Janine, give him a show."

Maybe later you ask yourself
some tough questions, like,

"Why is it so important to you
to impress and excite truckers?"

Anyhoo, grab that letter opener.

I'm gonna show you
why you should never mail cash.

Another good postal tip is,
if you wait to deliver your mail at night,

you can smell a lot
of really nice dinners.

Oh, no, it's that Amazon drone.

Try to ignore it.

Hey, Cleveland, what are you doing?
Taking a walk?

-No, I'm delivering mail.
-By foot?

Yeah, that won't take too long.

Well, got to go.

Got to deliver these fat pants
to your fat son.

He was harsh, but not untruthful.

We got to special-order
Cleveland Jr.'s pants

from a company that
manufactures grill covers.

Thanks for coming over, Stewie.

Oh, thanks for having me.
Quite a place you've got here.

Your mother seemed nice.

Yeah, I've only met her
a couple of times, but yeah.

This is my bedroom.

Is that car bed a Bentley?

And is that guy the driver?

Ready for this evening's
trip to Snoozetown, sir?

Not yet.
Sad story.

He used to drive the bed
for Michael Jackson's monkey.

CHAUFFEUR: I've seen some terrible things.

This is extraordinary.

Oh, it's fine, I suppose,

but you probably have
even nicer things at your mansion.

I'd love to come see it sometime.

Oh, um, y-yes, yes, my mansion.

Y-Yes, you-you should
come see my mansion, b-by all means.

I mean, not-not right this minute.

I-I have the U.S.
men's wrestling team there...

I'm gonna kill a wrestler...

-But then after that, you should.
-I can't wait.

Come on, let's go see
if the maid brought her son,

so we can push him
and he can't do anything.

God, I like it here, but what am I doing?

I don't have a fancy house.

I'm living a lie, like FDR.

And so I say to you, America,
we are going to win this war,

we're going to end this depression,

and there's no reason
to suspect that I cannot walk.

God bless America!

<i>(HAIL TO THE CHIEF</i> PLAYS)

And cut.
The newsreel's over.

-Thank you, Mr. President.
-(THUDS)

You're welcome, gentlemen.

Now, if you'd kindly kick me
into the closet with the mops.

Ah, must be a Yale man.

Shut up.

Hello, loyal mailwoman.

This is a letter to Hollywood,
saying, "Keep it up! Movies are great!"

Cleveland, what should I do with this?

I-It just says "Hollywood, U.S.A.,"
and this isn't a stamp,

it's the little sticker from an apple.

Oh, I can't never get those off.
I just eat 'em.

Anyway, just put it in here.

-But what's that?
-It's the dead letter bin.

It's all the stale mail
what never got delivered

for one reason or the other:
incomplete addresses,

house at the top of a hill,

anyone who uses one of those
French sevens with a slash in it.

Well, this is horrible.
I'm going to organize these.

There might be some we could resend.

That's above and beyond, Lois.

You know, you do the uniform proud,
like I like to think I...

Oh, chili dog got me.

Look at all these.
This is a mess.

Here's two that are stuck together.

What the hell?
This is from Peter.

Who the hell is Gretchen Mercer?

And this is postmarked
a week before our wedding!

Aw, there was a time when the president

of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club
got a lot of mail.

I don't know what to do, Bonnie.

Why would Peter write a letter
to another woman just before our wedding?

Why don't you just open it and read it?

What? Th-That's a federal offense.
I can't do that.

Don't you realize, as a postal employee,
I'm 6,004th in line for the presidency?

Well, then why don't you
just deliver the letter

and see for yourself
who this Gretchen Mercer is?

Bonnie, that's a great idea.

Although it could be a little awkward.

You could always just ask Peter about it.

No, he won't talk about anything serious

unless there's a crackling fire

to punctuate
uncomfortable family revelations.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

I didn't fall off the roof.

I jumped.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

I never found you attractive,

and what's more, I never respected you.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

I know about Maurice.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

Which Maurice?

Oh, Brian, I need your help!

Chadley wants to have a playdate,
here at my house!

-Well, that's great.
-No, it's not!

I can't let him see this dump.

Come on, Stewie,
Chadley should like you for who are.

Besides, this place isn't so bad.

Brian, Chadley's parents
each have their own bathroom.

I've seen the fat man
pee through Lois' legs

while she's sitting on the toilet.

What I've got to do
is find a spectacular house

that I can pretend is mine
to impress Chadley.

Oh, why don't you
just use Babs and Carter's?

I can't, they're having
an <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> party all weekend.

I can't find my wiener with this mask.

All right, time-out.
Let's-let's all just find our wieners

and then put the masks back on.

Okay, 940, this is the house.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hi, are you Gretchen Mercer?

Yes, may I help you?

Oh, yeah, we found
an old letter addressed to you.

Peter Griffin?

Wow, this is from an old boyfriend.

What?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

Wow, well, um,
here-here's the nutty thing:

believe it or not, I'm actually married
to Peter Griffin right now.

Huh, that is quite a coincidence.

I wonder why he was writing me.

I see you move your finger along
as you read.

That's what little kids do.

Oh, it was nothing.

He was just writing to say
that he was excited about getting married

and that he finally had enough Camel Cash

to get a leather jacket
and a pool floatie.

Huh, well, thank you, Gretchen.
I am very relieved.

I was thinking the worst.

Oh, I understand,
but you have nothing to worry about.

You're right.
I guess jealousy's my weak spot.

(CHUCKLING) Everyone has one.

Even Achilles.

So, you can only be injured
on your Achilles' tendon?

That's right.

My mother dipped me into the River Styx
and she held me by my heel,

so that's the only part
that can be injured.

How about you, Testiclies?

It's the same...
It's-it's-it's similar.

(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

So, what do you think of the house, Brian?

As far as Chadley knows,
this is where I live.

Stewie, who owns this place?

Oh, just some rich idiot I saw bragging
about his vacation on Instagram.

He posted a picture of his feet in sand.

You're a guy, don't do that.

What a dick.

Hey, I'll swallow his dental floss.

You pull it out of me
and put it back on the roll.

-Good call.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

Ah, that must be Chadley.

Hi, Stewie.
I love your house.

Where are your servants?

Oh, probably cooking bananas
and doing the cha-cha-cha.

You know, this is
a great house for a party.

You could invite the whole class.

I-I say, that's a brilliant idea!

What the hell are you doing?

Relax, these people
are gone for a few more days.

I'll invite everyone over
and impress the whole class in one shot.

That'll cover my playdates for a year.

-You really think that'll work?
-Absolutely.

And when it does, I'll be as popular

as the first kid in school
to get his driver's license.

Hey, heard you got your license.

(SEDUCTIVELY) Maybe after school,
you could take me to get some groceries?

(SEDUCTIVELY) Yeah, or maybe you and me
hop in that car of yours

and do some grocery shopping?

(SEDUCTIVELY)
Looks like you have a roomy backseat.

I'd love to fill that
with groceries after school.

Hey, it's Stewie.

All I know about cars is what my mom does.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Gretchen?

Wow, you look great!

Yeah, I didn't have kids.

Oh, yeah, of course,
but what the hell are you doing here?

I haven't seen you in 20 years!

Peter, I finally got your letter.

You know, the one where you said

that you were having doubts
about marrying Lois

and you still had thoughts
about marrying me.

Gretchen, I wrote that a long time ago.

Well, my answer is yes, Peter.

Yes, I will marry you!

Gretchen, I am already happily...

Moderately hap... Relative... I am...

I am married.

Oh, then I suppose
your wife is entitled to know

that you were still in love with me
just days before your wedding.

(GASPS) Blackmail!

Thank you, Cleveland.

And I don't know what to call the thing
you're doing to me, lady.

Look, Gretchen, I-I know
I wrote you that letter,

and-and-and I meant it at the time, but...
that was 20 years ago!

I may have had some doubts
before my wedding,

but what guy doesn't?

And now I know
I made the right choice marrying Lois.

(SIGHS)
Well, she's a lucky woman,

and I'm sorry for what I said.

I certainly don't want
to cause any trouble for you.

It's just that when I got this letter,

it reminded me how sweet and funny
you always were.

That's nice, but I-I should go.

Thanks for not making fun of me
for ordering a hot chocolate,

and go ahead and look into Facebook
'cause this is kind of what it's for.

Wait, before we say our final good-bye,
what do you say we have one last hurrah?

I've got two tickets
to a Ray LaMontagne concert tonight.

Oh, I-I'm not sure that's a good idea.

It feels a little weird
going out with another lady.

Oh, come on, Peter, I drove all this way.

Let me go home with one last good memory,

and then I promise, you have heard
the last of Gretchen Mercer.

Well, I should probably say no,

but I've never been
known for my good judgment.

I mean, that's how I got into trouble
with the Peter Catcher.

-(BELLS RING)
-(IN SING-SONG VOICE) Oh, Peter!

Come and get your lollipops!

Lollipops!

Come along, Peter!

(WHISPERING) Peter, you mustn't.

I've got cream pies.

Trinkle tarts.

Trinkle tarts!

(LAUGHING)

(LAUGHS EVILLY)

I'm gonna get so molested.

Oh, Peter, you can
take off your hat and jacket.

It's not illegal for two old friends
to go to a concert.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

I mean it's not like anybody I know
would be at a Ray LaMontagne concert.

MAN: Peter!

Where'd he go?

I'm-I'm gonna keep the hat on.

I'm sorry, Gretchen.
This-this was a mistake.

I just feel too guilty
being out with another woman.

I can't do this to Lois.

Ah, I understand.
(CHUCKLES)

Well, I guess there's no shame
in coming in second, huh?

That's right.

Except in, like, wars.

Aw, you are still funny, sweet Peter.

Yeah, I guess so.

All right, I got to go.
The beard inspector's coming, anyway.

Uh, sir, where's your beard?

I'm leaving.
I'm on my way out.

That's my Peter.

That's <i>my</i> Peter.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)

Wow, looks like you're actually
gonna get away with this, Stewie.

(LAUGHING)
And you threw a good party.

Yeah, it's getting pretty wild.

Over in the guest bedroom
there's a girl pulling a train.

This'll show my dad.

Hey, by the way,
how'd you pay for all this?

I dated Donald Sterling for two weeks.

He's a good man!

You don't know him like I know him!

(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

People. People?

As your rich host,
I would like to say a word if I may.

I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to have finally found

a group of peers with whom
I share so many common interests...

-(DOOR OPENS)
-And here come the people who live here.

Please let me explain!

I was just worried
you wouldn't accept me because...

I'm not wealthy like you are.

Stewie, it's not that you're poor.

It's that you lied to us and you're poor.

I'm sorry you lost
your rich friends, Stewie.

Well, that's all right,
I don't need money.

I already have everything I need.

Excuse me, is one of you Chadley?

You left your wallet inside.

Chicka-chickaw!

Well, that "chicka-chickaw"
makes me think you're not Chadley.

Oh, no! I chicka-chickawed too early!

Hey, Lois, you mind if I cut out of here?

-Not at all.
-Thanks.

Not to be too intimate,
but I need to have a bowel movement

and I can't go here.

I can only go at home
or at the Koo Koo Roo.

(DOOR CREAKS)

Hello? I-Is someone there?

I thought I heard something
over the roar of my tinnitus.

Oh, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing.

-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Ooh, a text.

"I'm taking care of our problem.

"We'll be together soon.
Love, Gretchen."

Huh.

Meg, you're kind of a loner psychopath.
What does this mean?

Oh, this woman is clearly a spurned lover

who's planning to kill Mom.

Ah, thank you.

(WHINES NERVOUSLY)

You're a good dog, Meg.

(WHINES NERVOUSLY)

Well, well, well...
if it isn't the first Mrs. Griffin.

Gretchen? What are you doing here?

Making sure Peter can finally be with me,
which is what he's always wanted.

Gretchen, it's 3:15 on a workday.
The post office is closed.

Lois! Gretchen wants to kill you,

and I have a slip
that says we've got a package?

Peter, I'm glad you're here to see this.

You and I can finally be together.

Peter, what's going on?

She's nuts is what's going on!

I don't want to be with her!

Oh, yeah? That's not what you wrote.

That's right.
I lied about what was in that letter.

Lois, Lois, before you read that,
you need to know one thing:

I'm the one throwing out
all your beige bras.

Guys don't like beige bras.

You told an ex-girlfriend
a week before our wedding

you were having doubts?

Lois, Lois, listen to me.

Yes, it is true,
just before we got married,

I was having some doubts.

I mean, your family hated me.

I-I didn't think
I was good enough for you.

We were kids, I was scared.
Weren't you?

No, I was in love,
which is what I thought you were, too.

I was in love, Lois... and I still am.

Not a day goes by where I don't
thank my lucky stars for picking you.

It was the best choice I ever made.

Now, put that gun down, Gretchen.
You don't have to do this.

That's right, you don't...
because you can have him.

What?

I'll never forgive you for this, Peter.
We're through!

Oh, Peter! I can't wait for you to meet
the dogs and the squirrels.

LOIS: Hey, Gretchen?

(GRUNTING)

Get away from my husband.

(GRUNTS)

Wait, so you're not mad?

No, Peter, I was lying
so she'd let her guard down.

But what about the letter?

Peter, do you remember me
crying at our wedding?

Sure, it's in all our pictures.

That's doubt.

But there's no doubt anymore.

You're the only man for me, Peter Griffin.

(SIGHING) I love you, Lois.

Oh, Peter!

Now come on, let's get it on
through a P.O. box.

LOIS: Peter, this isn't working.

Well, I'm at full go.
Are you sure you're in the right box?

-Yes.
-Box 528?

Yes, 528.

All right, just reach in and grab it.

Wow, Mom, I can't believe
you got fired from the post office.

Well, they didn't like
me beating up Gretchen

on federal property,

and then after your father
plugged up that P.O. box,

there was a mutual parting of the ways.

Well, Stewie, I guess
since Lois lost her job,

you're not going to be able to go
to that fancy preschool anymore.

Eh, I don't need school.
I'll be fine.

I'll just become a YouTube star
like Jenna Marbles.

-Who's that?
-No one knows, but she's rich.

As rich as Ray William Johnson.

-Who's that?
-Nobody knows, but he's rich.

As rich as Bethany Mota
or Marcus Butler or Ingrid Nilsen.

This? This is over.

Me and the guys were using them

to shoot crab apples

We'll meet back here at 2:00.

Chris, do you remember your job?

To try and get my shoes
sucked into the escalator

so we can sue the mall.

That's right, sweetie.

I heard they're paying 50 grand a toe now.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

Ah, the train.

Now that was the way to travel.

-You remember that, Chris?
-Not at all.

When did we go and get ourselves
in such a big damn hurry?

Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets
for the Ladybug Express, please.

Sorry, the train is just for children.

Well, what about that guy in the front?
He's a grown-up.

-He's the conductor.
-I don't see no orchestra.

That's a different kind of conductor.

Okay, well, if he's the conductor,

why don't he have electrical tape
wrapped around him for safety?

Also, a different kind of conductor.

All right, thanks for
joking around with me.

We're gonna go check out
the rest of the mall.

So, I'm thinking
about getting my ears pierced,

Then, I can just work

Do we-do we do that a lot?

Yeah, I guess it happens sometimes.

Did you want to look at something?

Already am.

Hey, can I try that on?

Good taste. That's our nicest men's ring.

Uh, better see if it'll
come off when I ski Aspen.

Yeah, yeah, that works, that works.

I know I'm a nerd, but I have, like,

a thing for rich guys.

I'll take the ring,
and I'll take your number.

Here you go. Call me.

What the hell are you doing?
That ring is $10,000.

Relax, Stewie.

All I have to do is bring the ring back
when she's not working.

I'll get a refund and she'll never know.

It's a perfect scam, like Teddy Roosevelt

By myself. I have low self-esteem.

Oh, my Hot Pocket!

Ow, it's hot!

(HORN HONKING)

Oh, that must be Jerome.

What the hell is Jerome doing here?

We didn't order any drinks.

No, he and I got plans.

We're gonna go down to Carver High School

and look at that mural
of black achievement.

Mm, they got a manila folder
taped over Dr. Cosby's face.

What? Cleveland, you didn't tell us
you had plans with Jerome.

Some things are my business.

You don't tell me when
you play with yourself.

Well, if you checked my Twitter feed,

I wouldn't have to.

(APPLAUSE)

And if you elect me, I will be as good
a homecoming king as a touchdown.

(APPLAUSE, CHEERING, WHOOPING)

And our final nominee

for homecoming king is Chris Griffin.

(SCATTERED CLAPPING)

(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK SQUEALS)

Thank you.

I'm Chris Griffin.

Webster's dictionary defines "smegma" as

"a sebaceous, cheese-like substance

around the head of the penis."

But what is a "king"?

Oh, God, this is already hard to watch.

Like that <i>Bourne</i> movie where
they couldn't get Matt Damon.

We're facing a biochemical
attack of untold proportions.

Unfortunately,
Jason Bourne is not available.

Who have we got?

We have the sixth-billed
guy from <i>The Avengers.</i>

The arrow guy who frowns a lot.

Uh, okay.

Does he look like Bourne?

Yeah, yeah.

He sort of looks like a young Popeye.

Well, sounds like he's
the right guy for this.

Yeah... yeah.

All right, students.
The votes have been tabulated,

so if you could all look up
from your phones for a minute,

I'll tell you who won.

(RAPID CLICKING)

Children. A man is talking.

All right, I better head down there.

I brought a bag of marshmallows

and a belt for Chris to bite on
during his meltdown.

And this year's James Woods High
homecoming king is...

Chris Griffin.

-(APPLAUSE)
-Yay!

(LAUGHING) Yay!

Holy crap!

I don't believe it. Chris won!

All right, now it's time
for these four poor kids

to thank you for
subsidizing their lunches.

(ALL APATHETIC) Thank you.

Mean it.

(ALL BRIGHTLY) Thank you.

All right.

Time for my car nap.

Hey, hey, hey, there he is! The new king!

I already called and quit my job.

Peter, he doesn't get money
for being homecoming king.

-Does he get land?
-No, of course not.

Does he get this joke? "Shagadelic, baby!"

Austin Powers!

Oh, very good. Very good, my liege.

Well, Chris, since you're royalty now,
I made your favorites.

-Dinner for breakfast?
-That's right.

Pork chops and French onion soup.

Oh, boy!

Well, as king, I shall eat this breakfast

on a tray in front of <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

I'll get the TV tray, Your Majesty.

How does nobody see what's going
on with this Chris thing?

What are you talking about?

Well, it's obvious.

The only reason they elected him king

is because they're gonna
prank him at homecoming.

Shut up, Hat. That's my brother.

They're not gonna mess with him.
He's the man.

He's got real Griffin beef
in those trousers.

Meg, how can you be so sure?

Because this kind of stuff
happens all the time

to unpopular kids.

They're just trying to embarrass him

and make him look stupid.

You don't really think
they're going to pull

a prank on Chris, do you?

I don't know, but if they are,

we got to get down to that
school and talk 'em out of it.

Good idea.
And luckily, I'm great at connecting

with that generation.

Like when I went on that
campout with One Direction.

So they checked into their hotel suite,

but the minibar had no
sparkling water-- only still!

(ALL GASP)

Ah, stop. It's too scary.

Oh, but that's not all.

They looked in the wardrobe
and discovered that the stylist

had only brought non-skinny jeans!

(ALL GASP)

Do mean like a Levi's 513 skinny straight?

No. Just regular pants that fit normal!

(ALL GASP)

That's not real, right? Those aren't real?

Of course not, Louis.
It's-it's just a story.

Well, I guess that means
these aren't real!

(ALL SCREAMING)

Yeah, they're gonna die in the woods.

Simon, are they tagged?

They're tagged, right?

-Oh, they're tagged.
-Good.

Simon, did I ever tell you the one
about the loose-fitting T-shirt?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

All right, if we want Cleveland

to stop spending all his time with Jerome,

we got to remind him how much fun we are.

-So let's just have fun.
-How do we do that?

I don't know.

Little bit of this.

Okay. That seems like fun.

What about one of these?

Yeah, sure. There's no wrong moves.

What if I brush my shoulders off?

Original ideas are preferred, but sure.

Three fun guys, room for four.

I don't know if it's working, Peter.

I don't know if it's fun.

It's more than fun, it's "foon."

That's a fun way to say "fun."

Hey, how foon would it be
if we waved sticks around?

I-I really don't know what we're doing.

It's foon, from the word before.

I don't see what's... (YELLS)

All right, first,
let's take your blood pressure,

'cause that's-that's
like our favorite thing

to do around here.

Okay, we all know how much
Cleveland loves <i>Tecmo Bowl,</i>

so let's start playing.

I'm the Raiders. I'm Bo Jackson.

And hopefully, he'll show up.

That's no fair. Bo Jackson's too fast.

Guys, do we want
Cleveland back or don't...

Uhp, here we go.

(PETER LAUGHS) Bye-bye.

QUAGMIRE: See, Peter? He's too fast.

PETER: You got to tackle me. It's "B."

You got to press "B."

QUAGMIRE: I'm pressing "B." He's too fast.

PETER: Going over here.

Going over here now.

Never get tired.

JOE: Change your guy, Quagmire.

Change your guy.

QUAGMIRE: I'm trying. Peter's cheating.

You're cheating, Peter.

PETER: I'm not cheating.
I'm following the rules.

I'm just really good.

QUAGMIRE: You're not really good.
You just got Bo Jackson.

JOE: Bo Jackson also played
professional baseball.

QUAGMIRE: Shut up, Joe.
Everybody knows that.

JOE: Kansas City.

Royals.

PETER: Can't stop. Won't stop.

Bo... might... go... all... the...

Nope, going back the other way.

QUAGMIRE:
What? Are you going backwards? Just score.

PETER: Nah, I'm gonna run
out the quarter.

QUAGMIRE: I'm not playing now.
My controller's down.

(PETER QUIETLY) Seems like your
controller's been down the whole time.

JOE: Who's Veris?
You got to switch off Veris.

Get it to Ronnie Lott.

Pretty much anyone but Veris.

PETER: Oh, no, I'm all the
way back here now.

I'm in my own end zone. What am I doing?

Too bad I'm not Bo Jackson.
Oh, wait. I am!

QUAGMIRE: Ridiculous.

PETER: Oh, yeah.

There you go, Quagmire.

You're about to tackle me. But then...

QUAGMIRE: Damn it!

JOE: Less than a minute.

QUAGMIRE: Shut up, Joe!

JOE: He's gonna do it. He might do this.

PETER: I don't know, a lot of football
still to be played here.

QUAGMIRE: I'm hitting reset.

PETER: Don't you dare hit reset.

You hit reset, you're banned for life.

QUAGMIRE: I hate this.

Joe, do you want to play?

JOE: Nah, I like being this guy.

PETER: A zig. A zag. A touchdown!

Yeah!

<i>I won the game</i>

<i>And now I'm gonna jump</i>

<i>Bo Jackson!</i>

All right, if we want
to get Cleveland back,

we should just put out his favorite snack:

an open can of tuna.

Often he'll come running
when he hears a can opening.

Peter, stop.

Yeah, I think it's time we addressed
the elephant in the room.

There's a simple reason

Cleveland is hanging out
with Jerome and not us.

Jerome is black and we're not.

Yeah, I mean, you can't blame him.

It's just a thing they have in common.

Something they can bond over.

Well, I guess that makes sense.

I suppose people do want
to be with their own kind.

Like the audience at a
Decemberists concert.

Good evening, white guys who weigh less

than their girlfriends.

(CHEERING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

God, a lot of gym teacher
suicide memorials in this place.

All right, let's find
the coolest kids here,

and see if they know anything
about a prank on Chris.

Those chicks in the
skirts look pretty cool.

Hey there. Brian Rockwell.

This is my friend, Stewie Goldberg.

What?

I don't know my way around the school,

so I figured I'd get the deets
from a couple of seniors.

Download me.

Brian-- it's not Goldberg, by the way--
we should ask about the prank.

I'm earning their trust.

Hey, uh, I'm new here,
but you know what'd be crazy?

If me, a guy,
went in the girls' room with you two.

(LAUGHING) I mean, that would be,
that would be so wild.

We should, we should
totally just go in there.

-Brian, stop.
-That'd be hilarious.

I'm in.

Stewie, go wait in the car.

No, we are here to get
information about Chris.

I said, go wait in the (BLEEP) car.

They had security guards in the bathroom.

We-we live in such a culture of fear now.

(KNOCKING)

Hey, guys, what are you doing here?

And why are you dressed like that?

Well, we realized you like
hanging out with Jerome

because he's black,

so we wanted you to know
we can be black guys, too.

Yeah, in fact, we can even
be famous movie black guys.

I'm Bagger Vance.

I also am Bagger Vance.

I'm Kazaam from <i>Kazaam.</i>

You really think I'm only hanging out
with Jerome 'cause he's black?

I hang out with Jerome because,
unlike some people,

he actually takes an interest in my life.

And he would never stick me with the bill

by walking out on me at the Clam.

Well, we could have come over
and graciously apologized,

but we took a chance.

That's what I like about us.

Sucks we didn't find
out what kind of prank

they're gonna pull on Chris.

I know that book is <i>The Hunger Games</i>
with the cover taken off.

Oh, look, something on TV.

And finally, tonight, a moving
story from James Woods High,

where the student body has made
their homecoming a special event

for a very special boy.

And this year's James Woods High

homecoming king is... Chris Griffin.

Yay!

(LAUGHING) Yay!

TOM: That's right. Chris Griffin,

a tubby spaz with a heart full of dreams,

gets to feel normal for a night,

thanks to the kindness of his peers.

BOTH: Oh.

I just see him walking around
with his hands down his pants all day,

and he's just so fat and weird,
so we feel bad.

Yeah, last year we did the burnt
up kid, so this was a slam dunk.

Oh, my God, they just
elected him out of pity,

because they think he's
mentally challenged.

Kind of like we did with George W. Bush.

(CHUCKLING) Huh? Right?

(SIGHS) I-I guess. I guess, Brian.

I-I don't-- I don't know.

Let's-let's just watch some commercials.

Well, that explains it.

The only reason Chris is homecoming king

is that all the other
kids feel sorry for him.

Do you think he knows?

I can't imagine.

And we can't tell him.
It would destroy him.

(IMITATING TRUMPET FANFARE)

Look away!

No one may meet the king's gaze.

So, uh, hey,
congratulations again on that, uh,

homecoming thing.

Why congratulate me on a right
and natural turn of events?

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I shall select three things

from Stewie's room that I wish to be mine.

There's a book in there
on how to eat healthy.

Why don't you take that, you fat bitch?

Well, he obviously doesn't
know it's just a pity vote.

In fact, this whole homecoming king thing

seems to have just gone
straight to his head.

I know, he's acting like an arrogant jerk.

CHRIS: Quiet, Rupert!

It is an honor to serve
the king in this manner.

Brian, this can't go on.
Chris is out of control.

He's even more arrogant
than an actor/writer/director.

Well, my script is brilliant,
and I'm a great director.

The question is,
how bad do I want this part?

(CRYING) Okay, I'll do it.

Well, now we know.
Neither of us likes crepes.

See, that's another thing
we got in common.

In fact, you want to hear something crazy?

Peter and the fellas think that
you and I only hang out together

because we're both black.

Uh-huh.

But I told them that's insulting.

Why is that insulting?

People like to be with their own.

I mean, you don't think
I hang out with you because

of your endless stories about
working your remote control

or your fat son or how you once
made a dog shake its head "no"?

I manipulated the
cheeseburger what like this.

You boring, man.

But you're black, so we cool.

That's racist. I'm offended.

Whatever. I'll see you around, Cleveland.

Man, I guess this whole
friendship was a bad idea.

Just like Goodyear's advertising strategy.

All right, we have $14 million
to play with.

I say we spend it all on blimps,
'cause who do we want to reach?

Drivers.

And where are people looking
when they're driving a car?

Straight up.

Squire, my chamber pot needs emptying.

What's he talking about?

He's been pooping in the waffle iron.

Just plug it in and close it.
It'll burn off.

Look, Chris, you know,
being homecoming king

doesn't mean you can
just start acting crazy.

I can do whatever I want.

I've been acknowledged
by my peers as their superior.

You're just jealous 'cause
you've never done anything

that deserves being elected king.

Okay, you want to know the truth?

They only picked you
because they felt sorry for you.

Sorry?

Why would they feel sorry for me?

Well, because they all think
you're a, um, you know,

"groundskeeper at a public
institution" kind of guy.

A what?

A dope. An idiot. A water head.

You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

Tonight, when they put
that crown on my head,

it's gonna be the
greatest night of my life.

Even better than when I had my first kiss.

(PHONE BUZZES)

I say, we were a little hard on Chris,
but I'm glad we came.

He's still my brother.

Hey, look, there's the security guard

that threw me out of the bathroom earlier.

And he's here with his wife.

(CHUCKLES) This is like a date for them.

Good evening, fingerers and fingerees.

Sorry, I had a little rum in the car.

Anyway, please welcome your
homecoming king, Chris Griffin.

(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

Good evening, subjects.

The boys' showers shall run red
with the blood of my enemies.

We believe in you!

-Good for you, Chris!
-No one clap too loud.

We don't want to frighten him.

Wait a minute.

And now your queen,
prom night car crash victim

Kathleen Fitzpatrick.

ALL: Aw.

We miss you, Kathleen!

You're heaven's queen now!

BRIAN: Wow, she was hot.

The queen is a dead girl?

What does that make me?

(GASPS) Brian and Stewie were right.

This was a pity vote.

We love you, Chris!

You love me?

You don't even know anything about me.

You just voted for me
to make yourselves feel better.

She was on PCP that night, you idiots!

Chris, I-I'm so sorry.

That's okay. You guys tried to warn me.

I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

Ah, don't worry about it.

Are you okay?

You know what? I am.

I may not be king,
but I learned I don't need anyone's pity.

That's the spirit, Chris.

And, hey, you're not the homecoming king,

but you'll always be my brother.

Thanks, Stewie.

It means a lot to me to know

I've always got my family
looking out for me.

Oh, hey, Chris.

This is Tyler.

Don't make this weird now.

(LAUGHS) Oh, what a gentleman.

Well, Cleveland, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

It's good to be back.

Hanging with Jerome was fun,

but my best friends are
right here in this room.

Hey, to celebrate,
how about we play a little

old-school <i>Double Dribble?</i>

Okay, but no stupid-ass
shots from the corner,

because that's a glitch
in the software and...

Game on!

(LIVELY ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYS)

PETER: All right, bring it up
the court, and corner three!

CLEVELAND: No, no.
That's what I'm talking about!

PETER: Steal.

Uhp, corner three.

CLEVELAND: All right, here we go.
I got something cooking.

PETER: Uhp, you dropped something.

Think I'll head over in this direction.
Corner three!

JOE: It's a rout. It's a blowout.

CLEVELAND: It's some bullcrap.

JOE: Couple nice passes there... hey!

PETER: See? Competitive ball game.

What should I do? Pass and then go up?

And corner three!

CLEVELAND: All right,
enough of this mess.

QUAGMIRE: Shoot it! Shoot it from there.

JOE: The refs are lettin' 'em play.
I do appreciate that.

CLEVELAND: Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

Now I'm playing for reals.

PETER: Yeah, you're doing pretty good.
What play should I call now?

Maybe... corner three!

JOE: He's hot. He is hot.

Keep feeding that guy.

PETER: Hi, nice to meet you.
Can I have that?

Hang out over here for a second.

Corner three!

JOE: You got to get out there, Cleveland.

CLEVELAND: I'm trying.

He's taking advantage of poor technology.

PETER: Uhp, lot of dribbling. Swipe.

Here we... aw, I hit the wrong button.

I think you all know I was
going for a corner three.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

What are you doing over there?

I'm on hold with tech support.

My computer locked up right in the middle
of this story I'm working on.

God, even Microsoft Word
hates your writing.

WOMAN: (INDIAN ACCENT) <i>Thank you</i>
<i>for holding. How can I help you?</i>

Well, for starters, you can keep
talking with that lovely accent.

Amazing. One second
of a stranger's voice on a phone

and you've got full Bollywood.

I... I assume she's in India.

<i>Your friend is correct.</i>

<i>I am in India.</i>

<i>But you sound like</i>
<i>a perfect gentleman to me.</i>

<i>My name is Padma.</i>

Padma. That was my mother's name.

(SIGHS) I'm gonna get an English muffin.

<i>So what seems to be the problem?</i>

Well, one problem I have

is that I have too much money.
(CHUCKLES)

<i>Then why don't you just</i>
<i>buy a new computer?</i>

What? I-I...

(CHUCKLES) <i>Oh, I'm just</i>
<i>bursting your balls.</i>

(LAUGHING) Oh!

Well, you're a feisty one. (CHUCKLES)

Uh, actually, my computer froze

right in the middle of a story
I'm writing.

<i>Oh, you are a writer?</i>

<i>Are you famous?</i>

By choice, no. No.

Sometimes fame brings
a lot of unwanted attention.

I mean, look at William Shakespeare.

-William Shakespeare.
-Aye.

Nice collar, you fruit.

Thank ye.

Hey, Shakespeare.
What's the title of your next play?

You should call it <i>Homosexual Collar Guy.</i>

Ah, thy japes and jabs cut me
to the quick, squire.

What does that even mean?

I know. It means,
"I use this collar as a bib

"for when I service guys."

Thank ye, thank ye.

So, how'd you like the collar?

'Tis not for me.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Huh, there's no one there.

Must have been some kids knocking.

Down here, Lois.

Oh, for God's sake, Joe.

Can't you put a tall flag on the
back of your chair or something?

I apologize for the difficulty
my paralysis causes you.

Hey, Peter. Good news.

Bonnie's out of town,
so I have an extra ticket

for Tuesday night bingo
down at the Allendale Mill.

Why the hell would I
want to go to bingo?

Oh, it's a blast.

There's the thrill of the game,
people bring snacks,

plus you'll hear some
pretty unfiltered opinions

about those jokers in Washington.

Yeah, that sounds perfectly terrible.

You know what, Joe?

Peter would love to go with you.

-What?
-Terrific.

I'll pick you up at 6:00.

What'd you do that for?

Peter, he's your friend.

Who knows? It might be fun.

(SIGHS) All right, I'll go.

But I'm not happy.

You know how much I hate
being told what to do.

(TOILET FLUSHES)

You know, Padma, I love Indian food.

But I'd have to say my least
favorite curry is Ann.

(CHUCKLES)

She's... She's a newscaster here.

I... I wish I could have
slipped that in earlier.

PADMA:<i> Oh, no, I know her.</i>

<i>She's internationally despised.</i>

<i>So, are you done rebooting?</i>

Look, (SIGHS) uh,
I have to come clean.

Um, my computer wasn't
actually broken this time.

Uh, I just wanted
to talk to you again.

<i>I like talking to you, too, Brian.</i>

Oh, hey, is that Padma
from tech support again?

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

Oh, cool. Ask her a question for me.

How come over there
they just talk on the phone,

and over here they're all doctors?

Get out of here. Lois said you're supposed

to sit on the potty for one hour straight.

I'm taking a break. I got bored.

And you've been on the phone
for more than an hour.

I'm sorry. Can you give me a sec?

Look, I know it's crazy,

but I honestly feel
a connection to this woman.

More than I have to anyone in a long time.

That's nice, Brian,
but you're from different worlds.

She's in India. That's a lot to overcome.

People in love can overcome anything.

I guess you're right.

I mean, look at Jeb Bush and his wife.

Honey, do you think
I'll ever be president?

No, no, no.

Stewie!

What? It's just a joke.

Yeah, but come on.

Look it up, man. Google her.

I know what she looks like.

Oh, I see you came with the Big Cheese.

What? You?

You're the Big Cheese?

I usually bring a variety wheel

of Laughing Cow cheese.

(LAUGHING) Laughing Cow!

That's got to be a happy farm, right?

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, you just must be
cracking up all the time

hanging out with this one.

Look, ma'am, I don't know
what signals Joe is sending out,

but I'm married.

G-49.

Hey, and you're already on the board.

You're a natural at this.

Oh, and fair warning when they call O-69,

I say, "Oh, my! Ooh-la-la!"

(LAUGHS)

Yeah, really funny, Joe.

Or-or how about this one?

"Oh... My God, I want to
kill myself right now."

All right, I got to get through this.

I'm just gonna go to my happy place.

Go to your happy place, Peter.

PETER: <i>Oh, and you're wearing</i>
<i>the necklace I gave you.</i>

Well, if I were you, I'd sure be excited.

You're only one number away
from having a bingo.

I am? What, you mean if they call...

CALLER: O-74.

(GASPS)

-Bingo!
-(ALL APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

You were right, Joe, this is awesome.

I've never won anything.

Well, except for when I won
that "Tori Spelling Bee."

Peter, your word is "equine."

ANNOUNCER: Peter reached this
round by accurately spelling

"collagen," "repulsive" and "botched."

God, I can't believe
you're still at work, Padma.

It's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

PADMA: <i>No, it is noon here.</i>

<i>Do you not know about time zones?</i>

Oh, uh, yeah, oh, that's right.

You guys are on metric.

Oh, you're in here?

Yeah, I'm on the phone.

Is, uh, is Chris down in the laundry room?

Yeah, I think so.

(SIGHS) Okay, looks like this is gonna be

a stander-upper in the garage.

Uh-oh, six percent. Better hustle.

<i>PADMA: It's so nice to talk to you, Brian.</i>

<i>You make me feel wonderful.</i>

God, if only you weren't so far away.

I wish I could just somehow
magically appear there

and meet you in person.

<i>Oh, Brian, that would be like a dream.</i>

<i>Okay, I should go.</i>

<i>I have 11,000 people on hold.</i>

Good-bye, Padma.

What the hell's going on?

Somebody's screaming in the garage.

Why are you still up?

Because I'm in love.

Oh, with that Indian chick?

What was her name? Dot?

No, it's not Dot, it's Padma.

And I have to be with her.

Stewie, I'm going to India.

(GASPS) Oh, my God, I'm going with you.

My yoga class will be so jealous.

Hey, everyone, the guy
I told you about, Brian,

he's taking me to India!

-(ALL SQUEALING)
-Oh, my God!

(INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)

We finally made it, Brian.

We're in India.

Excuse me, man with no pupil,

where can we get
a taxicab around here?

All right, let's do it, Stewie.

Let's go find Padma.

Shouldn't be hard
in this dreamy land of wonder.

I can already smell
the enlightenment and tranquility.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

-(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
-(COW MOOING)

(ENGINE REVVING)

(COUGHING)

This is wonderful, isn't it, Brian?

It's so tranquil, I'm tearing up.

Come on, I think I see a cab
with less than nine people in it.

All right, it's winning time.

Let's get this show on the road.

After all, it's not called "bing-stop,"

it's called "bing-go!"

(ALL LAUGHING)

That's very clever.

Yeah, and, uh... Uh, maybe if I win,

I'll yell, "bing-Joe."

Don't force it, Joe.

Yeah, be quiet, Joe.

Me and the gang are trying
to hear our numbers.

"You" and the gang?

I'm the one who brought you here.

Yeah, well, you know something?

The <i>Mayflower</i> also brought fungus,

which then became the Potato Famine.

What the hell are you talking about?

I don't know, I've had, like,
four Ensures.

I'm out of my mind.

Peter, I brought you here
to have fun, not take over.

Look, Joe, I'm a little busy right now,

so I'm gonna have the Somali
pirate from <i>Captain Phillips</i>

tell you something.

Joe, look at me.

Look at me.

He is the bingo captain now.

I tell you, I love it here, Brian.

The sounds, the colors.

You know, this is where the Beatles came
to ruin their music.

Yeah, yeah, that's great.

Anyway, Padma works in Bangalore,

so we got to hurry and catch the train.

(SIGHS) Can't believe
we're really in India.

Oh, look over there.
There's cute little kids are playing

Cowboys and Indians and Indians.

I'm gonna shoot you with my six-gun.

I'm gonna shoot you
with my bow and arrow.

I'm just going to stand here wearing
a shirt that appears to be a jacket.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

Do you think all those chickens
had to buy tickets?

I don't know, but I'm starving.

What I wouldn't give right now
for a big juicy steak.

How dare you?

To us, cows are sacred!

That's right, you are disrespecting
our entire culture.

And why did Wes Anderson come
here to make his worst movie?

-Stewie, what do we do?
-Quick, hit the red buttons!

(POWERING DOWN)

-Wow, that came in handy.
-Yeah.

-Now let's get out of here.
-Let's see what their wieners look like.

Yeah. Yeah, no, let's get out of here.

Okay, I'm off to bingo.

Peter, what are you wearing?

Oh, you mean my bingo cape?

That's our holiday tablecloth.

I'm sorry, Lois, but my people
have come to expect

a certain degree of pageantry.

Don't wait up.

We may go to Denny's.

Is Joe going with you?

Oh, "Crybaby Joe"?

Nah, he doesn't come anymore.

I think he resents my skill.

Peter, bingo was Joe's favorite thing.

Now, you go over there
and take him with you,

or I don't want you going at all.

Hey, hey, hey, don't try
to take this away from me.

This is the only thing
I've ever been good at.

Well, this and timing my farts
to a thunderstorm.

Why don't we all go ahead
and turn to page six in the handout?

-(THUNDER CRASHES)
-PETER: Ah...

The first thing you're gonna notice
is a bar graph.

And what that is is to indicate
our international sales...

(THUNDER CRASHES)

-...which peaked, of course...
-Oh, yeah.

...during the last quarter. But now
we're expecting that to drop off

as we enter the colder weather.

(FARTS)

(THUNDER CRASHES)

The storm's moving away.

(FLIES BUZZING)

We made it! This is where Padma works!

I feel like I owe every bus
in America an apology.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

So, we haven't discussed
what you're going to do if she's a pig.

She's already beautiful to me.

And, you know, we'll see.

(SCANNER BEEPS)

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(TELEPHONES RINGING)

My God, how you gonna find her?

There are hundreds of people in here.

Don't worry, I thought of that.

PADMA: <i>Thank you for calling tech support.</i>

<i>How can I help you?</i>

I'll tell you how.

Stand on your desk.

<i>-Brian?</i>
-Padma, just do it.

Oh, boy.

Are you Padma?

No, I am Ranita.

There is a python in my cube.

Brian?

Padma!

I can't believe this!

Why are you here?

Because I was having a technical issue

with my heart.

Ugh, 16 hours on a plane,

and that's what you came up with?

I am touched you came
all this way to see me.

I'm so glad I did.

You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

Well, I have to admit
you two do make a cute couple.

But then again,
so did Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Do you take this woman to lecture you
about trans fats

for as long as you both shall live?

-I do.
-And do you take this man to be

a watered-down Bono
until death do you part?

I do.

I now pronounce you
pretentious and terrible.

You may name your daughter
after a fruit.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

So, this is my town.

I have lived here my whole life.

Well, if you were born here,
then it must be a magical place.

Yes, let's go get sandwiches

at that New Delhi I keep hearing about.

(PLAYS TWO RIMSHOTS)

Thanks, Ganesha.

I am so happy that you are here.

In fact, my family is
having a big party tonight.

You must both come as my guests.

Oh, an Indian party!

I hope they play that one song
with the shrieking, nasal,

atonal woman over the bongos
and tambourines.

(WOMAN SINGING ATONALLY)

You seem nervous.

Are you worried
about meeting Padma's family?

Yeah. Well, that, and this is always

what it looks like on <i>Homeland</i>

right before there's a drone strike.

Oh, my, you both look so elegant.

Thanks, I did a little shopping today.

Not me. Mine is actually
an Aladdin costume from last Halloween.

I never travel without it.

(DINGING)

Family, guests,

and monkeys who have
wandered in to steal fruit,

it is my honor to welcome you
to this engagement celebration.

Oh, "engagement"?

So, who's getting married?

-I am.
-What?

Padma, my beloved daughter.

Dhiraj, my future son-in-law.

Please, come and meet one another.

Welp, that's a Punjab to the figs.

Where's the bar?

Everyone, you are all
so kind to come tonight,

and it is so nice to meet you, Dhiraj.

But something happened today,
and I can no longer marry you.

Padma, what is it?

My true love is here tonight.

He has come to me
all the way from America.

His name is Brian Griffin.

And my heart belongs to him.

(ALL GASP)

Quick, everyone's looking at the dog!

Go, go, go!

Padma, you cannot call off the wedding!

I have already paid a large dowry
to Dhiraj's family!

But it would be wrong
to marry someone I do not love.

The one I love is Brian.

Sir, what if I were to repay you
for all you've spent?

Would Padma then be free
to marry whoever she wanted?

(GASPS) Brian! You would do that?

Yes. I love you, Padma,

and-and I'd do anything to be with you.

I suppose that might be possible.

Great, just give me
a chance to raise the money,

so I can marry your daughter
and make her happy.

Oh, so you don't have the money?

He's holding onto an Applebee's
gift card with $1.62 on it.

I do not know Applebee's.

Is it like our Colonel Chutney's?

Does Colonel Chutney's make you sick?

Not every time.

Then, no, it's very different.

I mean, my wife and I
have never said the words

"open marriage," but...

Oh, hey, Lois!

Peter, it's time to come home

and give Joe back
his stupid little activity.

I appreciate that, Lois.

First of all, this is my favorite thing
in the world now, so no.

And second of all,
we're about to play a new round,

so start taking your pants off,

'cause when I win, I want you ready.

Peter, if it wasn't for Joe,

you wouldn't know about bingo anyway.

This meant everything to him,
and you've taken it away.

As a friend, do the right thing

and give Joe back
the happiness he found here.

(SAD MUSIC PLAYING)

Joe, gag on my fat dauber.

(JOE GRUNTS)

Damn it, I didn't want to have to do this,

but you've left me no choice!

Kids, get in here!

Yay! Time with Dad!

That's a bingo for me!

All right, how do you play?

"Free space"?

Wow! What's that about?

I call I sit next to Dad!

(SIGHS) All right, forget this.

Let's all go home and each do
our own individual media things.

(INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)

Stewie, I don't think this is gonna work.

We're never gonna raise enough money
to pay back Padma's father.

Trust me, Brian,
there are a billion people here,

and almost every one of them
has a tapeworm.

Yes, excuse me, I have a tapeworm.

All right, very good.
Lie down on your stomach.

This won't hurt a bit.

(PLAYING FLUTE)

Hey, how are you guys?

Oh, you're a lady.

And you sound American.

How long have you been in there?

I originally just came for my junior year,

but I fell in love with the place.

Stewie, there's no way
I'm sitting here all day

watching tapeworms come out of butts.

(SIGHS) I'm doomed.

I'll never be able
to pay for Padma's dowry.

I don't understand.

In movies, everything in India
always turns out great.

Julia Roberts ate or loved
or prayed or something.

I don't, I don't know. I didn't see it.

Wait a minute!

I know how I can make the money!

HOST: Who wants to be

a millionaire?

all the way from America!

-Brian Griffin!
-(APPLAUSE)

What brings you to India, Brian?

I'll tell you what brought me.

True love.

STEWIE: He's breaking up a marriage!

-All right, let's get started.
-(MUSIC PLAYS)

First question,
"Which retired Indian cricketer

"has scored over 18,000 runs
in ODI competition?"

Um, O...? Wha...?

O-ODI? What?

Is it A, Anil Kumble,

B, Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

C, Sachin Tendulkar,

or D, Jiminy Cricket?

(CHUCKLING) Well, I know,
I know it's not Jiminy Cricket.

Unless Jiminy's
based on a real person.

I need an answer.

You know, the more I say it,
the more it does sound Indian.

(INDIAN ACCENT) Jiminy Cricket.

D, Jiminy Cricket, final answer.

I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

Thank you for playing!

We'll be right back

after this message
from the Indian Census Bureau.

Too many people!

Stop with the people!

Padma, I'm sorry.

I still haven't raised the money.

But I'm working on it.

There is no longer a need.

My father has solved the problem

by promising Dhiraj
the hand of my younger sister.

Oh, Padma, I meant
to ask you, are there, like,

Bengal tigers just running loose
in the cities?

I don't know.

In America, are there annoying
talking babies always interrupting?

Okay, it's been a long trip.

Let's not say anything we're gonna regret.

Wait a minute, so if,
if Dhiraj is marrying

your sister, that means
we can be together!

Actually, about that.

I think watching you try to answer
that question out there,

I realized something.

You know nothing
of my country or my culture.

Well, tha-that was a
really tough question.

No, it wasn't.

Everyone in India knows
who Sachin Tendulkar is.

Brian, I am deeply touched
that you came all this way

to find me,
but the truth is, you and I

have very little in common.

Well, I could learn!
I mean, I mean, there's got to be

an old <i>Carmen Sandiego</i> episode
on India or something.

STEWIE: Brian, Brian, punt, punt.

I know you would try, Brian.

But when I look inside myself,

I realize I do not want to marry you.

Mostly, I just did not want
to marry Dhiraj.

I am so sorry.

Have I answered all of your questions
to your satisfaction?

No! I came halfway
around the world for you!

You said I was your true love!

Well, by coming here,

you saved me
from a lifetime of unhappiness.

And I will always love you for that.

Good-bye, Brian.

A peck on the cheek?

Was that worth an $8,000 coach ticket?

You know what?

It's about the journey,
not the destination.

No, it's not.

This sucked and you failed.

Story over! Bollywood!
